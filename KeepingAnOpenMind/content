	"The first thing you should check for is if other users on this forum have made or tried a TAS of the game you want to TAS. Search the forum as well as this wiki, since someone could have made a submission on that game. If you know or suspect that the game you are TASing has an engine similar to another game that has already had a TAS submitted, check it out to see if particular tricks or glitches used in it are applicable to your game as well.

You can (and should, in a test run) use auto-fire rather than find the first frame of whatever, but you must stick to TASing in a way so that it looks convincing. Don't let up, or else everything will start to look bad and you won't learn anything. That being said, you don't have to TAS the whole game if you know that you can do it in the good run.
