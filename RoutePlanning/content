	"No speedrun should ever be attempted without first having thought out a sort of route. Although it may seem quite persuasive to simply grab a rerecording emulator and use your new-found power of slowdowns and save states to make a recording of a game, it is not going to get you very far. At some point, you will realize that even excellent play can get very boring when one takes wrong directions and, as a result, actually needs to unnecessarily run around from place to place and backtrack to earlier levels just to be able to progress.

	"The very best speedruns owe much of their low completion time to the fact that its author(s) planned out their attempt very carefully, and have tried out numerous possible paths to see which ones are beneficial. If you check out the history of some of the videos on this site (by clicking on the link that leads to the obsolete, old version), you'll find that many of the major improvements are caused by route improvements (sometimes as a result of a new glitch being discovered).

	"In the planning of a speedrun, there are both short-term goals as well as long-term goals to satisfy. Route planning pertains to both of these goals.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"An example of a short-term goal would be the obtaining of a new weapon that's hidden in a level somewhere. The player may have various ways to reach the weapon, such as by shooting all enemies that defend it, or perhaps by stealthily sneaking past them. When given this choice, it usually seems like a good idea to shoot the enemies, but one might have to carefully check both possibilities; aggression may set off a reaction of enemy behavior that will ultimately cost more time than the stealthy approach.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Long-term goals are more broadly defined, and are generally more difficult to predict. An example would be the obtaining of a certain weapon during a speedrun that makes it much easier to pass a certain level much later in the game. In this case, a long-term goal would be to make certain short-term routes possible, such as the one described above (if shooting the enemies is much faster than sneaking past them, one will first have to get a weapon).

	"Failing to recognize the optimal solutions to these things will cause a slowdown in your run. If you, for example, don't invest the right amount of time into leveling up your RPG characters, you'll notice the effect later on when it becomes difficult and time-consuming to beat bosses. Not knowing where or when to pick up which required item during a run of a platform game will require you to move around a bit more until you get all that's required.
