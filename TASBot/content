	"TASBot is best described as a special 
	[a class=extlink href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.O.B. rel=nofollow 
		"R.O.B.
	]a
	" robot outfitted with Legos to hold a custom circuit board that can exactly mimic the behavior of a video game controller.  TASBot can play games on real video game consoles with superhuman abilities, usually leading to game breaking glitches 
	[a class=extlink href=http://gamesdonequick.com rel=nofollow 
		"in front of live audiences
	]a
	".  TASBot has a long and storied history that starts with the initial efforts to replay 
	[a href=/WelcomeToTASVideos 
		"Tool-Assisted Speedruns
	]a
	" on physical hardware via a process now called 
	[a href=/ConsoleVerificationGuide

	"When true released his board he called it true's NES / SNES Replay Device. I subsequently hacked together a Lego case and put it on ROB and dubbed it 
	[a href=/forum/p/361685#361685 
		"ROBBerry Pi
	]a
	". Then, due to being frazzled because of last-minute issues and being in front of 60,000 people I proceeded to do an absolutely horrible job of introducing who TASVideos was, who I was, and what the name of the bot was. Later, 
	[a class=extlink href=https://twitter.com/GDQMonitor rel=nofollow 
		"GDQMonitor
	]a
	" and 
	[a href=/4156S 
		"Masterjun's SMW executes arbitrary code submission
	]a
	" both referred to the combination of true's replay board, the Pi, and ROB as "TASBot". (As an aside, there was previously an unrelated project named 
	[a class=extlink href=https://github.com/d-snp/tasbot rel=nofollow

	"). I know true has never particularly felt comfortable with calling his board "TASBot" and at this point I think the name transcends any particular replay device. I've come to think of TASBot as the combination of ROB holding a controller or board and participating in his favorite pastime, playing games perfectly in front of a TV and a loving audience. What could be better?
