Like any RAM searching dialog, it is designed to start with the entire RAM contents and then the user weeds out values that aren't what the user is looking for.  For more information regarding how to find RAM Values see 
	(__wikiLink|/MemorySearch|Memory Search)
	". For a video tutorial on RAM Search, see http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/8547343 .
