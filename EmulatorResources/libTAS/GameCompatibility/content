	[a class=extlink href=https://www.libsdl.org rel=nofollow 
		"Simple DirectMedia Layer
	]a
	" (SDL) for rendering (both software and OpenGL rendering). SDL is a cross-platform library for developing games. It is used in many commercial Linux games, either directly, or by using a high level framework that uses SDL as an intermediate layer. This includes

[p 
	"Also, Steam games are partially supported right now. We can't let the game connect to Steam because Steam is messing with our code injection by spawning multiple processes and injecting code itself (such as game overlay). To fix that, a dummy Steam library is implemented, but it is still under development and games have many ways to connect to Steam so this does not work for all games yet. On the game compatibility below, it is noted if the Steam version of the game is supported. If not, you must use a drm-free version, except if the Steam game is or can be made
