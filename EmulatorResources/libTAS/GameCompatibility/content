To fix that, a dummy Steam library is implemented, but it is still under development and games have many ways to connect to Steam so this does not work for all games yet. On the game compatibility below, it is noted if the Steam version of the game is supported. If not, you must use a drm-free version, except if the Steam game is or can be made
