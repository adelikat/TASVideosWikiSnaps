	"libTAS is a Linux software program that provides TAS tools such as frame advance, inputs recording, and savestates for games and applications. It is not a Linux emulator as games are running natively on the user system, but it creates an intermediate layer between the game and the operating system, feeding the game with altered data (such as inputs, system time). We can call such tool an API translation layer (
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/dwangoAC 
		"dwangoAC
	]a
	" prefers the term "rerecording framework" to describe these kinds of tools). libTAS tries to make the game run deterministically, although issues may still arise when dealing with multithreaded games. libTAS connects to an external program to provide a graphical interface to the user, with tools such as input editor or RAM watch/search.
