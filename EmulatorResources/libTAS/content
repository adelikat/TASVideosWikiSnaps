	"libTAS is a software for Linux that provides TAS tools to games, such as frame advance, inputs recording, savestates. It is not a Linux emulator as games are running natively on the user system, but it creates an intermediate layer between the game and the operating system, feeding the game with altered data (such as inputs, system time). We can call such tool a 
	[b 
		"trans-layer
	]b
	" - an API translation layer. It tries to make the game running deterministically, although it is still an issue when dealing with multithreaded games. This layer connects to an external program to provide a graphical interface to the user, with tools such as input editor or RAM watch/search.
