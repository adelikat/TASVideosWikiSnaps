Also, something not mentioned is a "Picture comparator", I mean that sometimes you do pixel precised moves and you must compare between 2 scenarios. Usually, I save them as PNG an compare and see what is best. It would be better if it is built-in. Also, one thing that isn't mentioned is the Gui interface. Seriously why should I use those command lines version when it's much simpler to use a GUI.
