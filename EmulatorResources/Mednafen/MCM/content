	"Re-recording is bulletproof since the movie data is loaded from the appropriate file when a state is loaded. This prevents ruining a movie by loading states out of order while recording.

	"Savestates made from movies are seperate and do not contain the movies within them. For example, the savestate "filename.nc0" made from the movie file "filename.10.mcm" is seperate from "filename.10.mcm" and don't contain the input data from "filename.10.mcm".

[p 
	"Movie files have their associated savestates separate from "non-movie" savestates, so those savestates cannot be accidentally overwritten while no movie is being replayed.
