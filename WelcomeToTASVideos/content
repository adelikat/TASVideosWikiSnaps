	(__wikiLink|displaytext=emulators|href=/EmulatorResources)
	". Emulators are 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=deterministic|href=/Glossary#Determinism)
	" software recreations of video game consoles, built to be as accurate to the console's hardware as possible. Emulators come with tools and functionality intended for the convenience of the user, and it's these tools that make TASing possible. Note that in cases where a system cannot be emulated for technical reasons (such as PC games), frameworks such as 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=libTAS|href=/EmulatorResources/LibTAS)
	" can still provide a deterministic environment and TAS tools without emulation. For organizational convenience, we list these frameworks under emulators, even though they do not emulate any hardware.

	[em 
		(__wikiLink|displaytext=frame advance|href=/Glossary#FrameAdvance)

	(__wikiLink|displaytext=re-recording|href=/Glossary#ReRecordReRecording)
	". Frame advance is the process of advancing a game one 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=frame|href=/Glossary#FrameFps)

	[em 
		"RAM Search
	]em
	" and 
	[em 
		"RAM Watch
	]em
	", which allow TASers to find and monitor the exact values stored in a game's random-access memory. This can be used for anything from tracking the player character's horizontal speed to
