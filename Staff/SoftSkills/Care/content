	"We've spent so much on trying to invent and build things that could help us escape reality. Doesn't that mean that we have no idea how to work with the reality we have right now? Sometimes we think we've found a solution, but it becomes a small comfort zone where we can finally stop thinking about the surrounding hell, which leads to degradation of that hell, because we don't work on it. It's important to be able to rehab, but escapism has never solved a strategic problem.

	"Which is paradoxical. When someone is facing a problem alone, they often think that problem is unique and there's no working solution, so it can't be helped naturally. But when somebody else simply joins the crew and wants to share the experience, the problem can't overwhelm anyone in particular anymore, as long as they make sure to face the issue together. And strategically, the new person can spot obvious mistakes the other person wasn't aware of, which eventually led to the crisis. The crisis just needs to be put into perspective.
