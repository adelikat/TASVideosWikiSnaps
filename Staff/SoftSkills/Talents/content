If you've been unable to figure something out, but managed to dig really deep and apply new measure of diligence, finally discovering a solution that works will drastically change your life! Which will in turn give you a new method for dealing with reality, and if this new method is also applied diligently, another leap in quality will become more realistic!

But we always forget to flip the chessboard and play our own game instead, while also solving the problem for real, because there are little to no examples of how to do it. Once you refuse to consider the problem absolute, you naturally start looking for practical solutions, and if you keep searching with enough diligence, you will find them.

But first, you have to honestly ask people before destroying something they've built (and be ready to retreat), and second, you need to actually understand how to build working systems in place of destroyed ones.
