	"Therefore it's paradoxical how a high level union can be established if there is some fundamental agreement about conflict resolution. And if such a union is based on ignoring the conflicts, one part of the union absorbs the other, or they just fall apart. There's a ton of examples in politics: in how regimes are organized and how stable and productive they are.
