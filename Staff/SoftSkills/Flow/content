	"If one follows this intuitive impression, 
	[em

	" goes unnoticed: seeing the world in black and white won't let you stick to just one part you desire. Dualistic vision of the world assigns absolute values to the opposing extremes, and we can't escape an absolute. But we won't survive in the middle of their battle either.

[div class=p 
	"How do we survive then? Should we come up with a different worldview that makes our lives better, easier, and more successful? No, because that still implies that there's evil we need to escape from. And if this evil nature is assigned to something integral to the real world, we risk rejecting objective reality.

	"But we can't stop acting intuitively either! Unconscious behavior happens by itself, we can't just redefine our internal function. It's also intuitive to get immersed into big dreams, high hopes, to aim for revolutionary changes, quality leaps, etc. And while trying to reach those, we often underestimate complexity of the goal, and overestimate our abilities, leading to what we then consider a failure.

The more patient and mindful you are while building your dream by hand yourself, the more it will meet your expectations, and the more robust it will be in the end. Pay attention to all the details that show up, and diligently account for them. If you don't have motivation for that, then you won't succeed.

[div class=p 
	"So it's quite the opposite: acting on pure impulse is unnatural, because then we ignore our mind and morality, separating our own psyche into parts that are "important" and "not-so-important". It works in both directions: we should not tell our feelings to just stop and never return, we shouldn't ignore them either. Which is why multidimensional confession of a psychological fact is how we restore personal integrity and synergy.

[div class=p 
	"We are incredibly complicated beings, so there's no reason to aim for maximal simplicity. But we won't be able to understand ourselves if we don't categorize and abstract. Restoring self-consciousness is how our psyche regroups. Losing self-consciousness, on the other hand, can be called the state of 
	[b

[div class=p 
	"Ironically, when we fully realize that we need all parts of our psyche to work together in synergy, to mutually immerse, the work this requires will finally lead us to the state of flow. And we will stop minding failures, because being an integral person is more more important, and pleasant, than constant winning. If winning naturally comes by itself as a result, well, that proves that we're doing it right. But it's not an inherent value or a self-justifying goal.
