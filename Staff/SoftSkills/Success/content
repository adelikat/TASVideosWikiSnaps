	"Success is often the desire and the goal. If you are successful, that's usually viewed as having achieved that goal and deserving of praise. A successful person is the ultimate role model.

	"Of course luck is inherent to success, for example you have to meet the right people to learn from or to get critical help from. But you can't be lucky all the time, failure is in turn inherent to luck. And failure absolutely does not guarantee success. If you are persistently doing things wrong, no amount of failure and hard work will help you. The only experience you gain that way is negative, and the only thing you start dreaming about is to stop pushing this metaphorical train with your bare hands. But personal believes may still demand that you continue.

	"That is really one anticlimactic advice, isn't it? It's so bafflingly underwhelming that no motivational speaker will ever teach you that. In fact, lots of successful people teach you the exact opposite - "never give up"! Yet if we look at people on Earth in their entirety, it doesn't really look like the "never give up" lesson is working for the majority of them. Sure they happen to reach some of their goals just by pushing through, and in other cases they become so desperate that they may indeed stop giving up, and they manage to achieve something valuable. But how sustainable is all that?

	"The "never give up" mantra is so associated with success that everyone is now terrified of giving up. People are so obsessed with constantly winning that they've unlearned how to lose. Clinging to our current goals forever is so all-encompassing that we've become unable to ever let go. We think that high performance is so meaningful that we stop giving ourselves time to recharge. And if we underperform as a result of long-term overworking, we think it's a bad thing to ever fail at it.

Giving up is considered the absolute fundamental failure that can't be healed or helped.

At first the way you give up will look to you and others as something poor and bad, but with some experience you'll learn to consciously retract. And with enough controlled retraction experience you'll be able to see it quicker when the goal is worth giving up on before it's too late.

But not only do they never go away, they're as legitimate part of you as your own ego is. Your id didn't enjoy the things you had to do to succeed, so your forced yourself to do them regardless. Which did pay off short or long term, but it also has its cost. You can't be truly happy doing it. Maybe only for a little bit after it.
