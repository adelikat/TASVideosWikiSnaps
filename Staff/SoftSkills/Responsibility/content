	"People often feel that blame and fault means something bad, and it's incredibly hard to unlearn this. Mostly because this involves a really bad surprise, a narrative you disagree with, one that upsets you, and often people actually trying to punish you. But it's somewhat easy to deconstruct this.

	"If a penitentiary system in some country is magically designed to be maximally fair and only punishes the guilty people, paying them back according to what they have done, on the surface it would feel like a perfect system, because it restores justice. But first, what good is it if it doesn't succeed in fixing people's behavior so they don't commit new crimes? Second, how often do you find yourself in a situation when you've done bad things, but someone helped you fix them? And third, majority of the people in prison are criminals, and socializing further with them only repeats the cycle that led one to break the law initially.

	"So it may be very helpful to unlearn the short-circuiting that happens in us when someone wrongly (or rightly) blames us for something.

	" that makes me the only person capable of fixing it, by inventing some novel approach? After all, most inventions were designed to solve problems their inventors didn't create! If they just kept sitting there waiting for the problematic person (or situation) to go away, it may have never been solved for everyone else either. So yes I'd rather blame myself for still not inventing a solution, and I'd rather keep taking ownership of the problem, trying to crack the puzzle for the sake of it, just because it's so damn challenging, and practically important.

	"But if that only leads to getting overwhelmed and anxious, there's something else that needs helping. It's the impression that there's some momentum not letting us let go of the negativity, like a slippery slope moving things to hell by inertia. The impression that if something bad has happened, we have no choice but to relive the consequences indefinitely, until the impact completely fades away.

	"There's no slippery slope in thinking, or in life. Any time you start caring about getting out, you can find something that will help you.

But just like with talents, if you learn to apply due diligence, that becomes your new talent, and it can then be mastered while solving a real-life problem. Even if you don't solve it fully, your experience may be critically important for someone who comes after you, even if it still takes a lot of future people. But taking responsibility for your own, and other people's, future, is a solution to a lot of problems in itself, and makes us happier as we learn new things and eventually succeed.

	"One's personal level of responsibility is something other people can't forcibly change. We are absolutely free to decide how responsible we want to be at a given moment. If we have some answers to "what for?", that would be our motivation, be it a positive or a negative trend. But motivation does not appear from "I have no choice, I must follow the lead". Even if one is able to force oneself to be more responsible for a short period of time, it's not sustainable if it's not free. And the other way around:

	"Of course being responsible doesn't mean that other people can't be responsible for problems. But the only productive way to discuss a problem and attempt to solve it is by taking maximum initial responsibility for the current state of things and checking what can be fixed or improved right away. Only when that repeatedly hits a wall built by others, it's useful to bring that up. But again, not as a way to blame others, but as a way to inspire them to help fixing the main issue. Only then people would be interested in doing the legwork.
