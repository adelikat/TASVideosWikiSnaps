	"Lack of care and responsibility in the surrounding role models is what makes people think that feeling good is all that matters, because their background is pointless suffering, and egoism looks very tempting by contrast. They don't realize they just trade one pointless thing for another, and other people agreeing to act pointless is what caused the pain in the first place. If you don't want to become a clone of those you hate, you have to deconstruct the problem and attempt to fix it in the area you have access to. So you fight other people being careless and narrow-minded by you being careful and thorough. You deflect their approach and establish a more humane and more productive approach.

That way you redefine the scary exterior as a red herring, distraction meant to protect the fragile internals from the careless.
