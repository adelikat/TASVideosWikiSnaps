Common misconception people have about themselves is that absence of quality features is the default state, and one has to work unnaturally hard to gain them. So we consider ourselves clueless, mediocre, hypocritical, egotistic, resentful, just because we tend to be like that. And if someone doesn't have those problems, that must be an exception.
