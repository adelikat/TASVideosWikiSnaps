	"Welcome to TASVideos! First of all, there is some technical stuff to do: Before posting in the forum, please read the 
	(__wikiLink|/SiteRules|Site Rules)
	". We also suggest you read the 
	(__wikiLink|/WelcomeToTASVideos|Welcome To TASVideos)
	" page to get a better understanding of what this site is about. It will tell you what all you need to know about how and why we make these movies. Basically, When posting in the forum, the thumb rules are to be polite and articulate!

	"If you intend to submit a TAS, make sure you've read the

	[a class=intlink href=/GameResources/CommonTricks 
		"Common Tricks
	]a
	" page too, before recording anything. Remember, you can always post in the forum if you need help with anything; we'll be glad to help out!

[p 
	"It mainly depends on your prior experience with games, but generally, any simple platformer for any of the older consoles, such as NES or Gameboy, would be a good choice. We also suggest that first of all, you learn all the basic tools of the emulator before recording anything. When you decide to start recording, it might be a very good idea to pick a game that already has a TAS published, and to constantly compare your run to that one, making sure that yours isn't slower.

	]b

[p 
	"It does, but the result is worth it! It's really a fun activity, and it's not that hard to learn. Not only is it fun and challenging to make a TAS, you get to see the result of your time invested when you replay the movie you've recorded.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Many emulators let you 'save the state' of a game, no matter where you are or what you're doing. Have you ever tried this? When you 'load' the state, it's like going back in time! Save before a difficult part of the game, so you can always go back and try it again right away. Cheat all you want with this, and the game will never care!
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"But the movie may still not be as perfect as possible, because some moves would be too fast to pull off right away every time. But emulators fix that too! Make the game as slow as you want! Pause it, even! If a game only accepts 60 button presses a second, you can pause the game and press a key for 'frame advance' which makes the game play for just 1/60th of a second and then pause itself again. Hold a button you want pressed in the game while you tap the 'frame advance' key, and you'll have held that button for a mere 1/60th of a second from the game's point of view! You can be one fast player now!
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Because of these tools, you're constantly progressing in the making of the TAS, and you can just continue to record from where you stopped the last time. So if you record 2 minutes of the TAS on day 1, you can continue to record from that point in the TAS on day 2.

		"4. I've started doing a TAS, but it's not going very well… I'm having a hard time getting the same time as the TAS I'm comparing to. Can you guys help me out?
	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Of course! That's what the community is all about. If you have a question about the emulator, such as how a certain feature works or so, ask your question in the appropriate emulator thread. If your question is about the game you're TASing, post your question in the appropriate game thread. Please do not be discouraged if you find it hard to get a good result the first time you TAS a game. It's certain that you'll get better and better the more you try, and eventually you'll find that you can get at least as good, if not better, results than the TAS you're comparing to! And really, don't be afraid to ask questions, especially in the 
	[a class=intlink href=/Forum/Viewforum.php?f=46 
		"Newcomer's forum section
	]a
	". As long as you ask nicely, we will answer nicely. If you are unsure where in the forum to post your question, ask it in the Newcomer's section, it's better that you ask your question in the wrong sub forum than not asking it at all.

	"If this is your first TAS, we strongly suggest you post your run in the forum before submitting it. If everyone in the forum give their thumbs up, you can go ahead and submit it. The reason we prefer that you post your first TAS in the appropriate forum thread is simply because for your first TAS, even if you've studied the tools and the previous runs thoroughly, it's not certain that it's site material, simply because it often takes a long time to learn TASing. But again, if your run is well made and good material for the site, we will most likely give you thumbs up!

	"Sure! At the top of the forum page, you'll see the word "search" with a magnifying glass next to it. 
	[a class=intlink href=/Forum/Search.php 
		"Click on that link
	]a
	". In order to search for your game, simply type in your search in the first textbox. If your game contains multiple words, such as Super Mario Bros, put "quotes" around the name when you search, so that you only get results for "Super Mario Bros" instead of separate "Super", "Mario", and "Bros". You can also select which subforum to get results from, under the Forum: list under Search Options. If your game is a NES game, for example, set this option to "NES games" to sort out all the hits you're not interested in.
