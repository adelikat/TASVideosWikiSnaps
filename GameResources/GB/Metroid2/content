	"The select glitch in Metroid 2 is a fairly interesting one.  By mashing the select button, the player can cause blocks to appear and disappear, giving access to the game's "secret worlds".  In real time, it is very unpredictable and nearly impossible to control.  However, it is possible to get it to work reliably on a tool assisted level.  This page is to help you understand how to get it to work, and utilize some quirks in the map that result from it.

Now, if you were to start where Samus would be standing in the buffer, and draw a line to the right, eventually you will hit the other side of her ship.  In fact, if the game failed to update the buffer as she walks to the right, that is exactly what she would do!  Utilizing the select glitch involves forcing the game to do just that.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The way the game updates this buffer is one side at a time relative to Samus.  One frame it will update the bottom row of the map surrounding Samus; the next frame, the leftmost column; the next, the rightmost; and finally, the top row.  The pattern will start again the next frame.

	"Now here is where it comes together:  That frame of lag caused by pressing select forces the game to forget to update whatever side of the map it is trying to update before moving on to the next.  If you can force the game to forget to update that side enough times before it moves onto the next row/column, it will stay there for Samus to interact with.  What was once behind her is now in front of her!
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Remember, the buffer has four sides to it.  As such, pressing select every fourth frame a few times while moving in the desired direction will cause the select glitch to occur.  Keep in mind that you need to make sure that the side of the buffer you are forcing the game to forget to update is in the same direction that you are moving in; otherwise it will not work until you change directions or try again.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"A really easy way to get this to work in real time (using a turbo controller of some sort) is to simply use turbo select and hope it goes in the direction you want it too.  The frame of lag caused by changing causes the game to ignore every other press of the button, therefore causing the game to interpret it as being pressed every fourth frame.  Handy, no?

This can be used to either manipulate them before entering, or use blocks from them without having to enter them.

Warp rooms take effect when Samus triggers a border transition (that is, she leaves the room through one of the boundaries where the screen stopped scrolling).  They can be a powerful way of moving about the map, but what they do can be extremely confusing if you are just getting into the select glitch and are not fully aware of their existence.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Simply put, a warp room works by pretending to be in another location whenever Samus leaves it.  We will call this an "exit point".  Let's use an example to demonstrate this.  Imagine Samus is in the room 10x4 on some arbitrary grid.  It has an exit point of 5x5.  There is an opening on the right side; therefore, when she leaves that room through the normal opening, she will be in the room at 6x5, not 11x4!

In this situation, if you try to backtrack, you will find the room you left from is not there anymore.  She will actually end up at 5x5, not 10x4 pretending to be at 5x5.  This could be part of a secret world; it may be another part of the map altogether.  5x5 could itself be a warp room to somewhere else entirely!
