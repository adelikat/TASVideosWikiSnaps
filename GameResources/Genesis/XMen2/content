	"Keeping jumpkick speed with Nightcrawler
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Nightcrawler has a maximum of one down/diagonal/forward kick per jump. After the forward kick ends, the speed gradually (0:64 per frame) decreases back to 0, quicker if you hold forward. If you press the kick button again after the jumpkick ends, the speed is locked at its current value.

[h3 id=KeepinglungespeedwithWolverine 
	"Keeping lunge speed with Wolverine
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Wolverine does not have any limit to the number of attacks he can perform per jump. When a lunge ends, the speed gradually (0:64 per frame) decreases back to 0, quicker if you hold forward. Upwards, downwards or forwards attack can be used to lock the speed, depending on the situation. Downwards attack also increases downspeed. Somersault can also be used, which delays landing.

	"With Nightcrawler: If the kick button is pressed on the same frame as the kick ends, the gravity is increased about four times.

	"If you end up inside a wall, the game checks for collision with the end level area before ejecting the character. Known possible uses are the first level and the second sentinel factory level.

[h3 id=Fallthroughthinfloors 
	"Fall through thin floors
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Related to the trick above, if you fall at a high speed and an upkick ends at the same frame as you hit the floor, you can go through it. This is because of the different shapes of the hitboxes of the upkick and the falling animation. You need a high downward speed to perform this, around 16-18 pixels/frame. Possible in the jungle levels.

[h3 id=Fallthroughthinfloorsneartrees 
	"Fall through thin floors near trees
