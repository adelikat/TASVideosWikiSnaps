	$LF
	[a id=heading-2663 
	]a
]h3
[p 
	"Nightcrawler has a maximum of one down/diagonal/forward kick per jump. After the forward kick ends, the speed gradually (0:64 per frame) decreases back to 0, quicker if you hold forward. If you press the kick button again after the jumpkick ends, the speed is locked at its current value.

	"Keeping lunge speed with Wolverine
	$LF
	[a id=heading-2664 
	]a
]h3
[p 
	"Wolverine does not have any limit to the number of attacks he can perform per jump. When a lunge ends, the speed gradually (0:64 per frame) decreases back to 0, quicker if you hold forward. Upwards, downwards or forwards attack can be used to lock the speed, depending on the situation. Downwards attack also increases downspeed. Somersault can also be used, which delays landing.

[p 
	"With Nightcrawler: If the kick button is pressed on the same frame as the kick ends, the gravity is increased about four times.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"With Wolverine: If the A-attack button is pressed on the frame after you stop holding the jump button, the gravity is increased about six times. This only works on the first 15 frames of the jump.
	$LF

[p 
	"This can be used to drop quickly, or to adjust the length of a jump.

[p 
	"If you end up inside a wall, the game checks for collision with the end level area before ejecting the character. Known possible uses are the first level and the second sentinel factory level. (The application of this trick in the second sentinel factory level was found by the speedrunner rggibson.)

	"Fall through thin floors
	$LF
	[a id=heading-2667 
	]a
]h3
[p 
	"Related to the trick above, if you fall at a high speed and an upkick ends at the same frame as you hit the floor, you can go through it. This is because of the different shapes of the hitboxes of the upkick and the falling animation. You need a high downward speed to perform this, around 16-18 pixels/frame. Possible in the jungle levels.

[h3 
	"Fall through thin floors near trees
	$LF
	[a id=heading-2668 
	]a
]h3
[p 
	"Similar to above, but you do not need a high downwards speed. Coming out of a regular jumpkick is enough to make this happen. Possible in the jungle levels.

[p 
	"Normally there is a small recoil when taking damage. By being airborne, close to the ground and in an upkick on the same frame as taking damage, you regain control of Nightcrawler directly.

[p 
	"After scoring a hit on an enemy, you are invulnerable for a few frames. Besides being generally useful when kicking/slashing through enemies, this can be used to pass through the spiked pillars in the pyramid level, by kicking the barriers that drop down (which counts as enemies).

	"By pressing left every other frame, the character moves at walking speed to the left, locked in one frame of animation. It can be used for example to duck-slide along the ground, or for entertainment.

[p 
	"By doing an aerial attack, then teleporting before you land, and holding B when you appear, you can infinitely float in the air. Enemies constantly receive 2 damage if they touch you while you are floating. Nightcrawler is invincible until B is released.
