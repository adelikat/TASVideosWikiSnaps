	"If you stop running a certain time during the latter part of Aladdin's running animation, he will skid to a stop. If you stop for only one frame (long enough to trigger the running animation) and begin running again, the X velocity of Aladdin's skid will be added to his running velocity, noticably increasing his speed for a short period of time.
