Normally, when you break out of a barrel, without doing Barrel Storage, the game simply sets the third byte in $2440 to FF. But how it does that is pretty interesting; it copies the third byte to the first byte, and then it sets the third byte to FF. The first byte is the action command of Luigi when he is in front. When you're inside of the barrel, the third byte is usually 00, and when you're not inside the barrel the byte is FF instead. With barrel storage however, you are inside the barrel, but the third byte is set to FF. Now, if you break out of the barrel, like I said, the third byte gets copied to the first byte, meaning the first byte is now also FF, which means Luigi will have the blank action command on his A button.

A very important note to make is that the first byte is copied to the fourth byte 1 frame before the first byte is set to 00, which means even though the first byte is 00, the fourth byte is still FF. Because the fourth byte is FF, it will keep the action command of talking to the sign even if you get away from it. Now let's go back to the variable at $2430: the first byte there is set to 02, which means Mario should be talking to a sign, but he is in the back so you still have the normal Jump. However, after you switch, this byte is responsible for being able to change Luigi's action commands past the intended limit.

Then if there are any walls between Mario and this adjusted position, he will sometimes get blocked by them (end up touching the wall instead of going through it). Also Luigi will teleport to a certain position: consider the 0x2000 by 0x2000 square centered at Mario's new position. Luigi teleports to the nearest position to him that is inside this square (including the borders).
