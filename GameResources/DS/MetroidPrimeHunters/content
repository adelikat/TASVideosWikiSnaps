	"Aiming is complicated. Starting from no touch screen input, it takes 6 frames of touch screen input before the game changes your camera and/or targeting reticule. The second frame of touch screen input and the 6th frames are the only frames among the first 6 frames that actually affect where you aim: the rest can be pretty much anything else (though the first must not switch weapons or cause you to enter Morph Ball). The distance and direction between the two touch screen inputs determines how you turn and/or move the targetting reticle. If there are no additional touch screen inputs, you will stop turning/moving the targetting reticule immediately. If there are additional touch screen inputs, there is sort of a momentum effect where your previous touch screen inputs affect how you turn/aim on later frames.
	$LF

	$LF
]p

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The second involves using the touch screen to make rapid large strokes. With TAS this can effectively be done in two frames. Maintaining touch screen input and using the dpad in coordination allows you to keep more speed from the touch boost. However, in order to touch boost again, you must have no touch screen input for at least one frame and the game must detect that you slow down in some fashion.

Inactive segments are only visible from certain angles and you cannot scan everything in them. Notably you cannot activate portals when the segment is inactive. In the RTA community active segments were referred to as "visibly/graphically loaded". In really old metroid threads, inactive segments were referred to as "secretized" referring to the "secret world" terminology used to described out of bounds back then. To make a segment active, you must pass through an invisible trigger between the active segment and the inactive segment you want to make active. You can't skip between segments: if the segment you want to make active is on the other side of the room, you need to make each segment before that segment active in turn.

When in a room, shooting the door (with the appropriate weapon if it has a colored shield) and being within proximity of the door will cause the hallway to immediately load. This also unloads the previous hallway you were in. 
	$LF

[p 
	"When in the loading hallway, shooting the door to the next room and getting close to it will start loading the next room if the loading hallway is the active segment. If it is not the active segment, the game crashes instead. When it is finished, the new room will actually be in the position of the old room and your position and the position of any projectiles/bombs are shifted by an offset and placed in a new hallway that looks identical to the previous hallway, creating the illusion that your position is unchanged.

]p
[p 
	"In the case where there is no floor extending out of bounds, in order to move out of bounds, you must stay on the floors within the walls. If you move too far towards the inside of the room, you get pushed back inbounds. If you move too far away from the wall you will fall. Additionally, on the edge you will not regain your jump. Regaining your jump requires landing on the floor and can be rather tricky to do without getting pushed back inbounds. Carefully planned movements are key.
