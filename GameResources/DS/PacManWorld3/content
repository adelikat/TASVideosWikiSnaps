	"While similar, the EU version has slight differences. Charging a rev-roll plays a sound effect. The camera is slightly different, staying farther back at high speeds, so the game has more potential for lag. EU has a `Saving...` indicator on the bottom screen between each level. Some levels have earned more polish, like one area in Banni Wastelands being a slope instead of stable ground. You can have a maximum of 9 lives on EU, while on US it's 2.

	"Holding any direction from idle, Pac-Man accelerates 33 pixels per frame, until his speed caps at 532 px. He can jump, and combo up to 3 butt bounces by repeatedly pressing B in the air. He can combo up to 3 punches by repeatedly pressing A. He can wall jump by pressing A, but only if his Y speed is between -299 and 299.

	"He can charge a rev-roll by holding down the Y button, and tapping the touch screen will initiate it. While rev-rolling, Pac-Man's speed caps at 1434 px, which is ~2.7x faster than running. The longer you charge a rev roll, the longer it will last. The rev-roll timer starts count at 10 frames, and increases by 1 each frame, until it caps at 120 frames. This means for a fully charged rev-roll, hold the Y button for 111 frames before tapping. You can stop a rev-roll early by pressing Y again. You can't change your angle in a rev-roll.
