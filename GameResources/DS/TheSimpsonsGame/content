Then, run into a wall and press A to turn into a ball right before running into it completely. If done correctly, Homer will be slightly clipped inside the wall. From here, you can repeatedly press B to rapidly jump up the wall. This glitch is used to skip certain sections of levels.

If you tap the screen at this point, the object will be dropped and will no longer be moved.

However, the game thinks you are still using the Buddha ability. From here, you can move Lisa wherever you want by moving the D-pad. For example, pressing Up will cause Lisa to fly upwards, pressing Left will cause Lisa to fly left, etc. Lisa's speed will be locked at this point, so she will continue moving forward even if you are not holding any buttons. This is extremely useful in some stages and skips the majority of some sections. This glitch can be cancelled by touching the screen and pressing X.
