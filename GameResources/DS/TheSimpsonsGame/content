	"As previously mentioned, these addresses change every time you enter a new area, die, or use certain abilites. However, there is one simple technique you can do to find these addresses if you do enter a new area, die, or use certain abilites. In DeSmuME, go to Tools > RAM Search... and set the data size accordingly to how big your address is. Pause the emulator, hold the B Button and advance the game four frames, and then go back into RAM Search. Using the comparison operator, find a value that is equal to -34816. -34816 is the first shown value for Y Speed, so finding a value that is equal to -34816 will find the address for Y Speed, and then, you can find X Speed by subtracting 0x04 from the address you just found for Y Speed.

When press X to pull a switch, Bart / Lisa will stop in place to pull it, which wastes some time. But if you press B and then X immediately afterwards, you can jump and pull the switch at the same time. This means you can move forward a little bit to pull the switch instead of stopping in place.

This only seems to work with walls that are on the left side of the screen. First, make sure you have eaten some food so you can turn into a ball. Then, run into a wall and press A to turn into a ball right before running into it completely. If done correctly, Homer will be slightly clipped inside the wall. From here, you can repeatedly press B to rapidly jump up the wall. This glitch is used to skip certain sections of levels.

Combining this with his gliding ability allows him to glide at insane speeds. This only works with grapple hooks that launch Bart horizontally.

If you tap the screen at this point, the object will be dropped and will no longer be moved. This is very useful if you perform this glitch while dragging Lisa with the stylus, because it quickly moves Lisa forward and saves time in some areas.

If you perform the previous glitch while holding Lisa and then press X in front of the Buddha Hand Port before she launches off the screen, she will stop moving because you cancelled the Buddha ability. However, the game thinks you are still using the Buddha ability. From here, you can move Lisa wherever you want by moving the D-pad. For example, pressing Up will cause Lisa to fly upwards, pressing Left will cause Lisa to fly left, etc. Lisa's speed will be locked at this point, so she will continue moving forward even if you are not holding any buttons. This is extremely useful in some stages and skips the majority of some sections. This glitch can be cancelled by touching the screen and pressing X.
