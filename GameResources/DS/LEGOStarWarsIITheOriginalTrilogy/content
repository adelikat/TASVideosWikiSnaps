	" How to Easily Find Addresses after Switching Partners, Dying, or Entering Loading Zones
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"As previously mentioned, these addresses change every time you go through a loading zone or swap partners. However, there is one simple technique you can do to find these addresses if you do swap partners or enter a loading zone. In DeSmuME, go to Tools > RAM Search... and set the data size accordingly to how big your address is. Make sure your character is standing still, and pause the emulator. Hold the B Button and advance the game one frame, and then go back into RAM Search. Using the comparison operator, find a value that is equal to 5877. 5877 is the maximum value for Y Speed, so finding a value that is equal to 5877 will find the address for Y Speed, and if you know the address for Y Speed, you can find the other addresses I listed by adding or subtracting 0x04 from Y Speed. For example, if I know the address for Y Speed, I can subtract it by 0x04 to find the address for X Speed, and I can add 0x04 to the Y Speed address to find the address for Z Speed, and I can add other offsets to find other specific addresses.

[h3 
	" Host Wireless Glitches
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"In this game, you have access to the Host Wireless function whenever you pause the game. The Host Wireless function allows you to host multiplayer games and play with other players. However, it can also make it possible to clip through closed doors, lower bosses' health, and even double jump infinitely. Here's a step-by-step process on how to do them:
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Infinite Jump
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"1. Perform a double jump or use the jet pack by pressing B twice. (Only certain characters, such as Jedis, are able to double jump, and only Boba Fett, Jango Fett, or certain custom-made characters can use the jet pack)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"2. Pause the game by pressing START.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"3. Select the Host Wireless option on the bottom screen.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"4. When the game asks you to save, press B and abort the save.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"5. Press B again and hold it until the level fades back in again.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Why it works: When you enable Host Wireless and abort the Save, the game puts your character into a falling state if you are in mid-air. This means you can perform any mid-air action infinitely, including jumping, if you repeat these 5 steps as many times as you want.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Door and Object Clipping
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"1. Move forward into a door or LEGO object by holding a direction that is facing the door or object.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"2. Pause the game by pressing START.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"3. Select the Host Wireless option on the bottom screen.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"4. When the game asks you to save, press B to abort the save.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"5. Keep holding the same forward direction after aborting the save again and hold it until the level fades back in again. Though, it usually takes more than one clip to fully pass through the door. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Why it works: When you enable Host Wireless and abort the Save, the game unloads all doors and objects for a frame or two before the game fully fades back in again. Believe it or not, these two frames are enough to wedge your character a little bit inside the door or object. Repeating the 5 aforementioned steps enough times makes it possible to clip past the door or object entirely.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Lowering Bosses' Health
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"(This only works on certain bosses.)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"1. Pause the game by pressing START.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"2. Select the Host Wireless option on the bottom screen.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"3. When the game asks you to save, press B and abort the save.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"4. Wait for the level to fade back in again, and the boss's health will go down to 4 hearts. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Why it works: There is currently no known explanation behind why this trick works, but my guess is when you enable Host Wireless and abort the Save, the game resets certain events in such a way that it ends up decreasing the boss's health.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Diagonal Inputs
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"If you hold a forward direction on the D-pad (e.g. Up) and then alternate between pressing forward and a diagonal direction (e.g. Up-right) every other frame, you'll do much more precise movements than just pressing forward. This is very useful in TASes if you want to walk at the perfect angle.

	" Camera Abuse
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"In this game, you are able to rotate the camera by tapping the camera icon on the bottom screen and dragging the arrows with the stylus. However, moving the camera to the right or to the left slightly allows you to move forward at precise angles, just like with diagonal inputs.

	" Partner Switching
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"In almost every level of the game, you have one or more partners by your side, and you can gain control of them by facing them and pressing X or double-tapping their character icon on the bottom screen. But, sometimes switching to another partner lets you perform certain actions quicker, like in Rescue The Princess, there is a switch you pull that puts a Stormtrooper's helmet on your head. However, pulling it makes your character stand still for a few seconds. Switching characters after pulling the switch allows you to regain control of your character much earlier. 
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Glitchy Box-pushing
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"If you push boxes, or crates, at the right angle, you can end up pushing the box in the wrong direction. For example, if you hold Up into a box at the right angle, you'll do a glitchy box push and push the box at a skewed angle instead of forward.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Wrong Warping via the Shop
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The game has an interesting property involving Save prompts, which are the gray text boxes that ask you if you want to save the game. These pop up every time you turn on Host Wireless, complete a level, or purchase an item in the Shop in the Cantina. These messages will continue to pop up until you Save the game for the first time. However, if a Save prompt pops up in certain locations and you abort the Save, something interesting will happen involving the Shop. If you purchase any item from the Shop after aborting the Save, yet another Save prompt will pop up. If you accept or abort this Save, the game will fade to black and wrong warp you to the last location that you aborted a Save in. For example, if you complete a level in Episode IV and have not saved the game yet, a Save prompt will pop up. If you abort this Save, purchase something from the Shop, abort or accept that Save in the Shop, the game will wrong warp you to the Episode IV room. The results of this glitch have not been fully tested or experimented with, and the results are still unpredictable. For example, when I aborted the Save in the Shop, I managed to wrong warp in a seemingly random location that was out of bounds in The Blockade Runner. However, wrong warping straight to Episode rooms via the Shop is useful in some cases.
