These pop up every time you turn on Host Wireless, complete a level, or purchase an item in the Shop in the Cantina. These messages will continue to pop up until you Save the game for the first time. However, if a Save prompt pops up in certain locations and you abort the Save, something interesting will happen involving the Shop. If you purchase any item from the Shop after aborting the Save, yet another Save prompt will pop up. If you accept or abort this Save, the game will fade to black and wrong warp you to the last location that you aborted a Save in. For example, if you complete a level in Episode IV and have not saved the game yet, a Save prompt will pop up. If you abort this Save, purchase something from the Shop, abort or accept that Save in the Shop, the game will wrong warp you to the Episode IV room. The results of this glitch have not been fully tested or experimented with, and the results are still unpredictable. For example, when I aborted the Save in the Shop, I managed to wrong warp in a seemingly random location that was out of bounds in The Blockade Runner. However, wrong warping straight to Episode rooms via the Shop is useful in some cases.
