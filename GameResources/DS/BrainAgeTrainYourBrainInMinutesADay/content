Once this is done, Brain Age will remember the relevant keypoints then discard irrelevant input. This phenomenon can be most observed with making a

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Edge breaking is the all-around glitch: it can be used while drawing to draw in a single segment without having more than 2 edges (or 4 edges if you have a dual-digit answer); placing your second edge in such a way that you manipulate the resulting answer of your first segment (this segment will be your entire drawing, thanks to edge breaking); and creating a second segment for further manipulation (if you want to create targeted displayed answers on the topscreen before the right one, for example.)
	$LF

[p 
	"The recommended use of edge breaking is as follows:
	$LF

This has two very clear and distinct advantages over edge breaking: first off, you can use godspots for more than one frame, and second, you can start a segment within a godspot with no problem, since it will not be displayed; something that is not doable with edge breaking alone. With edge breaking alone, you have to hide the first input of another segment in the drawing. The obivious drawback of godspots are that.. they are limited to two spots.
