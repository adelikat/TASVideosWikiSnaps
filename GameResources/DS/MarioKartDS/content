		"Prolonged Rocket Boost (PRB): A well-known glitch: If you keep using MTs fast enough that your boost timer never reaches 0, you can drive offroad without losing any speed. This can also be done with a boost pad instead of the starting boost.

		"Fast fall: When making a large jump, it is usually beneficial to hold up. Not doing so could cause you to slow down when your boost wears out. This happens because pressing up increases your Maximum Speed, keeping it above current speed even after your boost wears out. (This can sometimes be combined with hopping uphill to get better speed boosts upon landing.)

		"Starting Turn: Turning while not drifting slows you down. However, there is one frame before you start moving when pressing left/right will change Turning Loss without actually turning your kart. By pressing left/right on this frame, and then the other direction the next frame, you can turn a bit without losing any speed.

		"Lap Timer Bug: Mario Kart DS allows you to have a lap time that is not an interval of 1/60th of a second (1 frame). However, this partial-frame time is NOT used as the starting time of your next lap's timer. Thus, any "time" between the finish line and your position the frame after crossing it is not counted.

		"Driving into the air: Normally, drifting into the air (e.g., going off a ramp) slows you down. To prevent this slow-down, drive off while your Drift Angle is 0, or as close to it as possible. This can't always be done, but is very easy to do in places like GCN Luigi Circuit when driving off the boost pads.

		"Tight/Wide Drifting: When using a kart that does not have good drifting abilities, pressing outside (left on a right drift or vice versa) near the start of a drift will cause you to turn more inside than pressing neutral (neither left or right). In the case of ROB's BLS kart, this effect lasts 10 frames. Each frame reduces the strength of the effect.

		"Exiting a drift: Turning Loss does not take effect when drifting, but is changed by pressing left/right. Press left/right just before exiting a drift to get it as low as possible. (When drifting tight, pressing 2 frames neutral, 2 frames outside, 1 frame inside to charge, 1 frame outside+release gets it very low. When drifting wide, 2 neutral, 1 inside to charge, 1 inside+release gets it very low.)

		"Slowing down: The best way to slow down from top speed is not to simply press B. Pressing A+B will decrease your speed by a percentage each frame. At high speeds, this percentage is a greater decrease than the fixed decrease from simply pressing B.

		"Wall clip: When you hit a wall (or other wall-like obstacle), your Drift Angle is set to zero. If you hit the wall at the very end of the wall, your speed will not go down to zero and you can continue driving past the wall. This can be very useful for making sharp turns.
