		"Heaven's portal: When you do a slidekick, dive or long jump into a glitchy corner (meaning the character slightly enters the wall), if you do it with a certain angle and while moving downwards, the character is sent upwards to the ceiling above them. Most of the places where you can do a heaven's portal have no in-course ceiling, therefore the ceiling above the character is the hard-coded limit, which is very high. The trick can also be done by going into a wall with high speed. Heaven's portals can be used to do major skips (e.g. Moat Skip) or reach stars faster.

		"Star cancel glitch: When you eat a star as Yoshi, it is possible to skip the celebration for getting the star, that forces you to exit the level. After eating the star if you bounce on a fly guy or spindrift, land on a shell, or grab an owl, then you will be able to move around with the star in your mouth. If you walk/run, stand still long enough for the landing animation to finish, or start swimming, then you will do the celebration for the star as usual. However, if you jump out of the landing animation then you will not start the celebration, and can thus delay it indefinitely.
		$LF

]ul
[ul

		"No-direction trick: This trick works by not pressing any direction while doing any sort of jump. When doing so, the character's speed will aim to go to 0 by decreasing/increasing (depending on the situation) by 2048, until it reaches 0. It's useful to do it while the character's speed is above maximum speed, since the speed goes down slower than if you pressed any direction. It works with all movement except punches, kicks, dives and slidekicks since their speed doesn't decrease in the same way and/or is locked.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		"Direction reset: When pressing the opposite direction from the direction the character is facing while in the air, their speed starts decreasing until it becomes negative (which means the character is actually moving in the opposite direction from the direction they are facing). However, if the speed becomes exactly 0 while decreasing the speed, it will increase (positive numbers) even if you're moving in the opposite direction of the way you're facing. If the direction is backwards (being more than a 16384 angle difference from the facing angle) and you keep pressing the direction while landing, then the character will instantly turn when landing.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		"Frame sliding: While walking up a slope you'll notice that your speed decreases every frame. To avoid this, simply press backwards and no-direction every other frame to keep the speed you had. if you don't have enough space to do a slidekick recover (or a kick in a case of a quite flat slope) then this can be useful. It can also be used to preserve a little Y run for each time you do it, and as entertainment for a run (e.g. using it during Moat Skip in any% since there is a lot of straight running).

		"Glitchy long jump: Usually, when you do a long jump, it is necessary that the character is facing the same direction he is moving in order to get a long jump with the highest speed. However, while walking, if you turn very fast so that the model angle lags behind the motion angle, by using a specific direction with the touchscreen you can do long jumps with top speed where model angle and motion angle are completely different.

If you're in the air, the speed becomes locked. When doing a kick, you're not affected by the floor (if it's a moving floor, you are not affected by its movement), and the kick will keep the speed you had until you reach the ground. Also, after a kick you can instantly run after landing. Same with a punch, but your speed will be sent to 0 after the animation finishes.

If you're playing as Mario, you can wallkick after that. For a dive, you need to have a really low speed dive, and that's only possible with triple jumps, slope jumps, and sideflips, because they are the only moves that allow you to dive at any speed.

		"Y run: This is a feature of the game. If you stand still and hold Y, after almost one second you will be able to run extremely fast (even faster than the max run speed) and with insane acceleration for a short period of time. There is a timer that starts at 30 and decreases by 1 every 2 frames, though only while you are on the ground. This means just running normally it will last for one second exactly, but with lots of air time it can last for an entire star. Y run can be useful when you have to go through doors, since you can run fast immediately instead of slowly building up speed from 0. Also, with the touchscreen, you can instantly decrease your speed to a value you want instead of slowly decreasing. This can be used to turn faster by reaching 0 speed quickly.

				"Dive reset: When doing a dive onto the ground, if you let your speed reach 0 (by letting it slowly decrease or grabbing something) you will automatically recover in a standing up animation. While in the air, you can't decrease speed during a dive, so the game assumes you're on ground after doing this animation. However, while doing a sideflip, wall jump, or triple jump (very hard with a triple jump), if you get the right amount of negative speed, you can do a dive that sets your speed to exactly 0. Thus, the standing up animation will play in mid-air as soon as you do the dive. After the animation finishes, you will be able to move for 1 frame, allowing you to jump, backflip, or kick. This trick allows us to reach new heights, as it allows infinite height gain as Mario using a wall. Here is a video explanation:

		"SSL pillar glitch: If you start walking onto a pillar in Shifting Sand Land with quite high speed (running speed is sufficient), depending of your position and motion angle, you can upwarp a little, or sometimes you can lose all your speed while on the shell.

		"Fast pole grabbing: When jumping or sideflipping, if your speed is less than 40961 when grabbing a pole you will be able to jump or climb the pole instantly. Normally, you would have a second where you can't do anything, as there is a short animation. With Yoshi and Luigi (only useful to do alternate pole jumps with them) you can manipulate the speed to be negative since any negative speed makes the trick work, e.g -108108. If you are jumping off the pole, hold backwards, and just before reaching a speed of 0, press no direction so that then if you press backwards again, your speed will become negative instead of going to 0 and becoming positive.

		"Grate upwarp glitch: In Goomboss Battle, if you jump under the grate with a precise position and an angle to the left, there is a glitchy spot where you can hang at the very edge and cannot move at all if you stay hanging. If you manage to have the perfect position and perfect angle you will not hang on the grate, and instead enter the wall. This means a failsafe occurs and you are sent up to the edge of the grate, in a landing state.

		"Dialogue in air: The check for dialogue in this game only cares about X and Z position, not Y position. This means that by using a dive reset or spit reset you can start the dialogue in mid-air. While the text is on screen the character will float, and after that you have 2 frames to do an action. However, the character will always look directly at anyone who is talking to them, so being too high above whoever's talking will lose frames because they have to tilt their head downwards. They also have to get their head back to a normal position after the text, once again wasting a few frames.

		"NPC clipping: This works by talking to a bunny or a Toad that is close to a wall while you are between it and the wall. The game pushes you out of the NPC, making you go through walls with the right position.
