The character's facing angle controls what angle the character is drawn on the screen (relevant for long jumps, kicks, crouching, yoshi's tongue, etc.); the character's motion angle controls what direction the character is moving. When you're going in a straight line, the two angles are the same; when you're turning quickly on the ground or holding a different direction than forwards during a jump for example, the motion angle becomes different than the facing angle.

There doesn't need to be another room in the map for this to work though, you can cheat a room fictionally. This address works with objects too (deriving from the object's base), so you can keep objects alive even when they're from a different room.

This happens because the speed is capped when going backwards (the facing angle is reversed in a sideflip). In fact, if you try to jump or long jump backwards (with POSITIVE speed), the cap happens too. The cap only happens when you're moving backwards compared to your facing angle but with forwards speed. If you start by jumping forwards and hold backwards while skipping the exact speed of 0, you will start moving backwards but with negative speed, and the speed is never capped when it's negative.

		"Heaven's portal: When you do a slidekick, dive or long jump into a glitchy corner (meaning the character slightly enters the wall), if you do it with a certain angle and while moving downwards, the character is sent upwards to the ceiling above them. Most of the places where you can do a heaven's portal have no in-course ceiling, therefore the ceiling above the character is the hard-coded limit, which is very high. The trick can also be done by going into a wall with high speed while in a slidekick. Heaven's portals can be used to do major skips (e.g. Moat Skip) or reach stars faster.

		"Hell's portal : This is the same as Heaven's portal, but it can get the character stuck into the animation he is in and go forward forever. Until you recover or jump (press A or B) and you will be sent to the death barrier, or if you're lucky and get over a floor at some point, recover or jump to prevent getting stuck again.

		"Corner clipping: Some glitchy corners let the character gain a lot height during a long jump, a slidekick or a dive with a precise angle, thus getting to the ceiling very quickly. If the ceiling at the top is slanted, in some instances you will be able to clip through the wall by the top and get out of bounds with sometimes precise speed manipulation needed. Examples of those are the corner used for 8 star door skip in the character's room, and the pillars at the side of the mirror on the castle 2nd floor.

		"Free movement transition glitch: The normal behavior during a transition is that you have absolutely no control over the character (moves, angles, state), the speed address holds 0, and the position is being forced to certain coordinates on a certain axis (doesn't have to be the regular X, Y or Z axes). However, by eating a coin early before the transition but late enough that the character doesn't start running before it, you will actually be able to run even if the transition has started, and you can control the character freely during the transition. However, you are still being forced to the same coordinates on the same axis, so you will only be able to truly move on a plane (the plane of which the axis is perpendicular to) no matter what your angle is. This also works with a 100-coin star (or any star that doesn't make you exit the course in secret stages), and you will actually get the star dance during the transition even if you've already started to be moved, and you won't be forced to any coordinate during the star dance animation, but it will resume once that animation ends, and you can move freely during it.

				"Backwards star licking: Some stars (such as HMC Metal-Head Wario Can Move) are positioned close to a void that kills the player. If Yoshi eats the star with high enough backwards speed (often with a sideflip), he can collect the star while falling into the void, and die instead of collecting the star normally. This saves time in most places since the void is often close enough to the star vertically and the death animation is faster than the normal celebration. In addition, you can do the same thing with stars that are positioned close to a loading zone that doesn't act like a painting (such as THI Pluck the Piranha Flower with the pipe), and enter a new area within the level instead of actually dying. Precise timing is needed for that though, because if the star falling animation starts too early, the loading zone will be bypassed and the celebration won't be cancelled, and if it stars too late, the transition will interrupt Yoshi from getting onto the ground.

				"Mid-air walk: By having a fly guy, a spindrift, an owl or a shell next to a star, you can eat the star, cancel the star dance with the object (bouncing on the fly guy or the spindrift, grab the owl or get onto the shell) and keep the star in your mouth. The only way to get the star dance after that is to start walking, stand still, or enter the water. By continuously jumping (if needed), getting near a death barrier makes the star cancel possible by doing the following: jump towards the edge of the floor, wait for the character to start falling vertically (not the actual falling state's model) and press a direction. This will make you walk mid-air for 2 frames, thus the star falling animation happens. This is also possible with loading zones that don't act like a painting, but as before, it's needed to press a direction mid-air with specific timing to get the transition and the star at the same time.

				"Travelling star: By doing the same method mentioned just above to get the star in your mouth without getting the star dance, you can afterwards actually spit out the star towards the loading zone. If that loading zone doesn't act like a painting, then you can simply run towards it and lick the star before getting into the loading zone. However, with loading zones that act like a painting (works for other loading zones too), you will require to perform the free movement transition glitch and collect the star during the transition. It will still be counted as long as you get it before the sceren becomes completely white. This method is useful for TTM and SL, as the transitions act like paintings.

		"No-direction trick: This trick works by not pressing any direction while doing any sort of jump. When doing so, the character's speed will aim to go to 0 by decreasing/increasing (depending if your speed in positive or negative) by 2048, until it reaches 0. It's useful to do it while the character's speed is above maximum speed, since the speed goes down slower than if you pressed any direction. It works with all moves except punches, kicks, dives and slidekicks since their speed doesn't decrease in the same way.

		"Direction reset: By pressing a backwards direction compared to the character's facing angle while in the air, the speed starts decreasing until it gets close to 0. If your speed gets past 0, it becomes negative and you simply start moving in the opposite direction of your motion angle. However, if the speed reaches 0 (can be achieved by pressing neutral right before the speed is supposed to become negative if needed), any direction that you will press resets your motion angle to that direction instantly, and the speed becomes positive.

		"Landing model reset: Normally when landing, the character's motion angle is set to their facing angle. However, if they differ by more than 16384 units, then the facing angle is set to the motion angle instead. This can be done by turning a lot in the air, or by doing a direction reset.

		"Frame sliding: By pressing backwards and then neutral when running, the character's facing and motion angles are locked, as well as the speed (unless it's higher than the maximum running speed beforehand, in which case it's set to that instantly). This can be useful to go in a straight line strictly (which is not always possible while running normally, even with L and forwards held) and keep the facing angle lagged behind the motion angle to redirect faster afterwards if needed. This can also be used to get up slopes since your speed is locked, however it's only faster to do it in specific situations, like when you can start doing it with maximum speed and if it's on a very steep slope.

		"Glitchy long jump: Usually, when you do a long jump, it is necessary that the character is facing roughly the same direction he is moving in order to get a long jump with the highest speed. However, while walking, if you turn very fast so that the facing angle lags behind the motion angle and long jump by pressing B and R at the same time (to not crouch), by using a specific direction with the touch screen during the long jump you can keep high speed even if the facing and motion angles are completely different. You can even reach top speed with the straight backwards direction if the difference is higher than 8192. Here is a more detailed explanation of this trick:

		"Sideways long jump: Glitchy long jumps can be useful for going up slopes. In particular, some slopes are too steep to long jump up, but you can long jump down them. The player's facing angle is used to determine whether you can long jump, so by creating a significant difference between your motion angle and facing angle, you can face slightly downhill to be able to long jump while moving uphill. This is especially fast in some cases because you can land immediately and long jump repeatedly, staying above 240k speed.

		"Delayed long jump: By running and pressing R you can slide for up to 16 frames (or longer on some floor types) while maintaining the speed you were running at. This can be useful for preserving Y run when you need to travel a bit farther than 1 long jump since the timer doesn't decrease when you are crouching. However, when you start crouching your motion angle is set to your facing angle, so it's impossible to do a glitchy long jump like this.

				"Before reading these tricks, it is important to note that when doing a punch, your speed will decrease by 2048 every frame if you're on the ground. If you're in the air, the speed becomes locked. When doing a kick, you're not affected by the floor (if it's a moving floor, you are not affected by its movement), and the kick will keep the speed you had until you reach the ground. Also, after a kick you can instantly run after landing. Same with a punch, but your speed will be set to 0 after the animation finishes. Therefore, punches and kicks are useful for being faster than running in some instances.

		"No bonk trick : When doing a dive or a long jump, you would usually have a damaging bonk when reaching a wall. Though, if your speed is less than 65536, you will get the regular jump behavior instead. If you're playing as Mario, you can wall jump after that, and with any other character you will get the regular jump bonk. For a dive, you need to have a really low speed dive, and that's only possible with triple jumps, slope jumps, and sideflips, because they are the only moves that allow you to dive at any speed.

				"Dive reset: When doing a dive onto the ground as Mario, Luigi or Wario, if you let your speed reach 0 (by letting it slowly decrease or grabbing something) you will automatically recover in a standing up animation. While in the air, you can't decrease speed during a dive, so the game assumes you're on ground after doing this animation. However, while doing a sideflip, wall jump, or triple jump (very hard with a triple jump), if you get the right amount of negative speed, you can do a dive that sets your speed to exactly 0. Thus, the standing up animation will play in mid-air as soon as you do the dive. After the animation finishes, you will be able to move for 2 frames, allowing you to jump, backflip, or kick. This trick allows us to reach new heights, as it allows infinite height gain as Mario using a wall.
