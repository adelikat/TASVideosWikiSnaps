	$LF

[p 
	"If a rollercoaster train touches the station but is pulled out down by gravity or up by chainlifts, it may leave the station and travel the other way while still in "arriving at station" status. This causes the train to travel through the track at constant slow speed, even uphill. If a train in such status reaches the end of a track, instead of falling off it will switch to "moving to end of station" status and move forward again until it reaches the end of a station.

	"When a (launch-mode) rollercoaster leaves a station, it cannot derail. If you build descending track pieces at the beginning, the train will be stuck and gain endless speed (although it will be reset to 0 after a certain threshold). The sound may behave weird, too.
