	"Forming an alliance between the various factions of Jadame is a major part of the game's plot. Normally you would form the alliance, then sink the Regna pirate fleet and then be tasked by Xanthor to find the 4 elemental hearts.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"However, if you manage to obtain the 4 hearts and access the house where Xanthor hasn't arrived yet, he will magically be there and construct the conflux key so you can go through Escaton's Crystal and finish the game without forming the alliance.

[p 
	"This bug allows a character to cast spells regardless of whether they have them in their spellbooks or whether they can even learn it. The spells that can be cast are the last Master-level spells in their respective schools of magic - the 10th for each school.

[p 
	"You can skip through doors inside dungeons such as the ones in Escaton's Palace. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"A long time ago, it was said you have to stand in front of a door, save & reload while holding forward. This would allow you to simply walk through the door. It works because the game loads doors last and when people still played on older computers, it took longer to load. But nowadays on more modern computers, the doors are loaded almost immediately. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"It has never really been confirmed if the above story (just using one save & reload) is true. But you can still do the skip by using multiple save & reloads. You have to open the spellbook (other screens may work, too) after each reload.

[p 
	"If you try to pick up an item that has been picked up before, it will say that you picked up a "

	[small

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"At this time, you can - while out of bounds - use Telekinesis on items that lie around in the palace. But you cannot use it on Escaton's door. This would save a significant amount of time in a speedrun, otherwise.
