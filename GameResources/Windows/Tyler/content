	"You can travel out of bounds of the map by moving diagonally. This works because you only die if you are directly adjacent to a platform tile. When moving too far out of bounds, your ball can disappear forever, softlocking the current level.

	"The green spinning things launch you into a predetermined direction by 1 tile when touched, possibly pushing you from the map and killing you. If you touch them and press the same direction simultaneously, you can move out of bounds.
