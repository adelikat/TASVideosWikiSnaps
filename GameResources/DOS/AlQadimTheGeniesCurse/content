	$LF

	"One rune is hidden underneath a bridge that can be moved back and forth to reveal and hide the rune. It is possible to repeatedly activate this rune by hiding and revealing it. You will receive 350 exp for each time you clear it this way.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"You are normally supposed to go over the bridge since it is scripted to be set on fire by an enemy and there is no other way out. When activating the glitched rune again, the enemy will go to set the bridge on fire again. During this time, you cannot move the bridge. It follows this script until all the six needed runes are cleared, at that point it will ignore the bridge forever and the glitch can then be repeated very fast to net as much experience points as you want.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"On lower difficulty settings, it is sufficient to clear the glitched rune until you can proceed through the barrier. On higher difficulty settings, since battles take longer, it is viable to keep doing the glitch to gain more exp (thus leveling up for more power).

In the palace, you are to have an audience with the Caliph to visit your family. A guard inside the New dungeon where your family is located would take you to where your father is captured. You can walk around in the New Dungeon freely and copper machines or guards would not mind you. This part of the game is not required to advance the plot and therefore you can skip it, but doing so will cause a little problem later.

	"You have to make a 2nd visit to your father later on, and you can leave through the New Dungeon's normal exit by bribing the guard. If you skipped the 1st visit, then he will not only give you the option to be bribed but since the scripted event where he takes you to your father was never triggered, it will be triggered during the 2nd visit instead. During that cutscene a copper machine would inevitably spot you and cause a game-over.

[p 
	"In RTA, fighting may take a while. It is considered to be the best strategy to get the key from the top left fire (which is only a small detour) and meditate on the left in peace, but kill the right side's troops - not getting the key from the top right fire (detour is too long) but from the leader's death instead.

[p 
	"When sailing to another town and encountering water elementals, after killing all of them, it is possible to walk under deck since an invisible wall would be removed after the fight - (the wall would remain in the pirate and zombie ship fights). Coming back on deck would then make it so the trigger for the boat would be loaded, so you can row to shore despite the ship trip not being finished yet. When you were sailing to a particular city, then you will row to shore of that city. When returning to the ship and talking to the captain, he will resume the ship trip and sail to the same particular city again - at which point everything would be back to normal.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If you do this glitch while sailing to Bandar, the capital city, and walk up the city at least until the first fountain, another glitch will occur: Talking to the captain will now dematerialize and rematerialize your character for seemingly no reason. After this, using the boat or going under deck will resume the ship trip. But you cannot ever talk to the captain again since it would now always dematerialize and rematerialize you, rendering the game unwinnable.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In v1.0, it is possible to use the boat without having to go below deck. This means you can escape the ship during sea fights (the pirate and zombie ones, too). When returning, the enemies will still be there and you cannot kill them since the game doesn't let you draw your sword or use projectile weapons. The captain still insists you kill all the enemies, so the game is effectively unwinnable if you do this. Otherwise the glitch behaves the same between v1.0 and v1.1.
