Then 3 frames before he clings to the ladder, briefly release jump for two frames and then press it again (so if he clings on frame 1234, release jump when frame counter is 1231 and press it again when frame counter is 1233).

The goal is to be aligned with this exact warp position. To successfully wrong warp, run to the left and hold up on the frame that Snake is at the warp position. This will NOT work without running. Snake will stop 48 subpixels away from the warp position and the game will not correct this. The end result is warping to the upper left corner of the map on top of some "edge of map" tiles, resulting in an instant exit.
