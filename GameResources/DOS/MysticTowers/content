	"When done with a bomb trap tile that you step on, and then again stepping on the tile after picking up the fallen bomb, the game will try to spawn another bomb. It will try to convert another item or object in the room (spring, fire place, switch, lever, trap tile, pushable object) into a bomb. It will usually pick the item or object that's in the furthest part of the room: In the picture on the right, object a would get converted next, then b, then c.

When done in v1.1, it depends on where the glitch is done, as some rooms have a higher likelihood of crashing the game. Bringing up the load or save screen will not crash the game in this version. If the glitch was going to crash the game, then saving, restarting the game and loading will fix it.
