	"When stepping over a tile or pressing a switch that causes a bomb to drop from the ceiling, bring up the load or save screen just before it touches the ground, and the bomb will not explode on impact but instead lie on the ground. It can then be picked up, but will usually not increase the amount of bombs you have in your inventory.

	"When done with a bomb trap tile that you step on, and then again stepping on the tile after picking up the fallen bomb, the game will try to spawn another bomb. It will try to convert another item or object in the room (spring, fire place, switch, lever, trap tile, pushable object) into a bomb. It will usually pick the item or object that's in the furthest part of the room: In the picture on the right, object a would get converted next, then b, then c.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When a converted object is picked up, your bomb amount will increase by a seemingly random amount - but when you use a bomb on the generator, your count will drop to 0. Converted treasure gives 254 bombs, apple and meat gives 1, other items may give you 5, 7, 8, 9, 33 or 44 depending what object it is that was converted.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When stepping on the bomb trap tile after the initial fallen bomb was picked up, the game has a tendency to crash. When done in v1.0, the game will crash as soon as you bring up the load or save screen or exit. When done in v1.1, it depends on where the glitch is done, as some rooms have a higher likelihood of crashing the game. Bringing up the load or save screen will not crash the game in this version. If the glitch was going to crash the game, then saving, restarting the game and loading will fix it.
