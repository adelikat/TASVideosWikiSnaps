		"Single player only game, so no chain chucking Gunstars across the screen.

		"The tackle dash input has been changed. Rather than Half-Circle-Forward + Jump the input is now Double-Tap Forward + Shoot.
		$LF

		"Green's stage has the most drastic changes.
		$LF

				"Green's stage is on a silly heli backpack rather than some sort of magnetic cart.

			[li 
				"Seven Force was too big and had to be crunched down to 5 phases despite the name, with Tails Force and Eagle Force having been dropped.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				"All 5 phases of Seven Force have to be defeated regardless of difficulty.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				"Some of the remaining forces have had their pattern revamped, most notably Crab Force shoots slower moving but spinning walls rather than fast but vertical walls.

		"Dice Palace is completely omitted from the port, along with Black's appearance in the refights stage.

	[li 
		"The space shmup section is replaced with a much easier walker section, though the space Seven Force boss fight is referenced in the background.
		$LF

		"Weapon lengths were adjusted for the smaller screen while the sprites generally are about to scale with the Genesis graphics. This leads to a few weapons feeling much stubbier while others feeling wider with screen coverage.
