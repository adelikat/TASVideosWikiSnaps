	"Because all dice rolls for a game are determined before it begins, nothing useful will likely occur, given that GBC Backgammon dice rolls can be manipulated just before rolling the dice. At least 17 rolls (some of them high doubles) must be done by both sides to complete the game. If a home board shutout is performed with an opposing piece on the bar, this prevents the opponent from making a roll, but the added flexibility is very small.
