[p 
	"During the tutorial at the start of the game, several text boxes appear on the screen instructing the player how to play the game. These stop your movement for 2-3 seconds and can be somewhat annoying. By reverse engineering the game, it was found that these textboxes check for a flag in memory, and if it is true/enabled, the text box will not block the player's movement. This flag is the same flag that is set when the player presses triangle while talking with a NPC, to cancel out the chat. It was accidentaly discovered that if the player presses triangle as the text box of a npc chat is shrinking away at the end, it will set this flag and it will linger until the next NPC chat. For example, if one presses triangle at the end of the chat with old wrinkle before the tutorial, the text boxes during the parkour course will not block Kingsley's movement.

[p 
	"In this game, any corner formed by two meeting planes where the resulting angle is smaller than 90 degree can be exploited quite heavily. There seems to be a bug in the collision system that makes it so the game can't eject kingsley out of these sharp corners when there is a force applied in a direction opposite to the apex of the corner.

[p 
	"This means that you can just run straight head first into an acute angle corner, wiggle around a bit, and Kingsley will just jam himself deeply inside the corner/wall.

	"The little zero is Kingsley, the hat character above him signifies the direction he is pointed at, M is an enemy. The idea is to run straight into A, while sidestepping into B. Jump just before taking a hit by the monster and you should be upwarped on top of B. Beware, sometimes you might simply jump right through the corner and fall to your death into the endless void. You can jump right after the attack instead but is slightly more difficult because most time, you will simply pop out the corner right after. Jumping and getting attacked in the air makes it so that you get upwarped as soon as Kingsley starts bleeding deep enough into the wall and is the preferred way, both for speed, simplicity and consistency.

		"Using short enemies: in the many hours of grinding this, it has only occured twice to me twice using spiders in the second dungeon, to skip the pineapple key door. (Where an easier skip has been found by now) Behind the acute angle corner in the room with the grape key and spiders, there is a wide angle. I simply ran straight into it for a long time, meanwhile getting attacked by spiders from behind. This does not cause an upwarp but instead, a simple clip through the wall to get in the room behind. The wall is fairly thin, which may have had something to do with making this one easier.
