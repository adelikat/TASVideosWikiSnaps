	"This is the trick that makes Zero superior to X in most stages. It destroys most bosses incredibly quickly, and also works well on regular enemies if necessary.
	$LF

[p 
	"This trick is performed by pressing the attack button to slash on the ground, then dash to cancel the slash animation. The dash can be cancelled by another slash, so slash again as soon as possible. The first two hits of Zero's triple slash do not trigger invincibility on bosses, so every slash will cause damage.

	"Zero's sword physics have changed in X6, making this trick possible. First, be as close to the opponent as possible, and have your back faced towards him. Then slash, and when the slash hits, turn around towards the boss. This will instantly make you start the second slash of the three hit combo. Then press dash and the other direction, so you face away from him again. Slash again, and repeat.
