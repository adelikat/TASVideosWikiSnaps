If going uphill while underwater, the penalties stack. Uphill, the penalty can be avoided by simply jumping up the hill, if you have a form of movement that works midair.

[p 
	"Doing a dashing jump from in front of a slope into said slope while in wolf form and untransforming as soon as you hit the slope will cause Alucard to clip inside it. This has X subpixel accuracy. Note that without Power of Wolf, Alucard gets instant top speed dashing to the left but not to the right, while he gets it neither direction if Power of Wolf is on, meaning you have to get a running start in such cases before starting the jump. Also, having more speed from Power of Wolf allows you to clip into smaller slopes that the normal dash jump would clear before you could untransform.

Moving towards the transition during a screen pause such as a level up, Heart Refresh, or shield rod spell allows you to move without the camera following Alucard, and moving into the zone where the camera stops in this manner causes dissonance in where the game believes is the right distance Alucard should go into the edge of the screen to load a new room, meaning you can just fall straight off maps if you open up a wide enough gap.

	"The general name for traveling out of bounds. Some things to note, you are moving at half walking speed while under the floor or behind a wall, but jumping into the OoB avoids this speed penalty. Untransforming from bat or mist under the floor causes Alucard to be completely stuck as the game believes you are in a tight corner, but changing to wolf and back regains horizontal control. You do not have enough speed to change rooms on your own, but wing smash and mist both allow you to trigger room transitions.

This pulls the point where the next room is loaded back by the disparity you created instead of forward, meaning you enter it sooner and wind up further back in the next room. However, since there is no position further back than where you are supposed to start, your X position is simply underflowed and you enter the next room at X pos 255, a full room length ahead.
