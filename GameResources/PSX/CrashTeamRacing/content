[div class=p 
	"1. The checkpoint/respawn area you are in. Every time you get to another one the item box value will change.
	$LF
	"2. The rank/progression value. If you are rank 2 or below (EXCEPT FOR THE FIRST BOX), you can technically get any item by pressing Circle at the right moment and changing directions from the CPU. Needs more research.
	$LF
	"2.1. There is a set distance between you and the cpu; if you're enough close in this interval the item box value will keep spinning (not valid for first box). Needs more research.
	$LF
	"3. The FIRST box is already decided when you entered the level warp. The item box value keeps spinning while driving in the HUBs, so every frame or so, it changes. It stops spinning once the track starts loading. This is easy to manipulate.
	$LF
	"4. If you are First Position in the course, even if you have another box predestined by what the value says, the game will force another object (potions, tnt's, etc)
	$LF
	"5. Sometimes being out of bounds or on a FakeNMZ (out of bounds but still on the track: an area without checkpoints), fucks up the game and if you're close enough but still ahead of the cpu, the game will put your rank behind.
	$LF
	"6. If a CPU is pushed by you or another cpu on a FakeNMZ, the cpu will become first, as long as it stays on that zone. (It doesnt matter if you are ages ahead of the CPU's). Needs more research.
