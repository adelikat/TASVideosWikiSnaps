	"For the glitch to warp to the credits, the overworld screen needs to be in a certain position. Specifically, it needs to be within a one-tile (8-pixel) range both horizontally and vertically. Not moving the screen down far enough usually causes a soft or hard reset, and not moving it left far enough warps Adol to a small blue room (possibly the room after fighting Vagullion).
