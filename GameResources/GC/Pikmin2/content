Instead, it will oscillate slightly within 1u/s above or below the maximum, or more if the terrain is not perfectly flat.

	"One less intuitive exception to this is when Pikmin can end up stuck on collision, such as when navigating a corner or when whistling Pikmin that can't find a way to the leader.

	"The direct control over Pikmin allows for some useful tricks:
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		" Pikmin do not care if others reached their goal. This means that by having a Pikmin at the end of the line (usually by throwing and whistling them), they can be controlled remotely. This is useful for when Pikmin need to reach a location while a leader is not necessary, like grabbing a treasure up a ledge or going around a wall to deal with a hazard on the other side.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" C sticking towards oneself while throwing basically universally increases maximum throw speed by ensuring more Pikmin are close enough to be grabbed. However, if Pikmin need to be held for a length of time, the C stick will effectively be leading Pikmin away from the captain more often than not, so in those cases C sticking is a little more situational. Examples of such scenarios include swapping the held Pikmin to a slower type with the D pad or setting up something called a momentum throw, as is explained later.

]h3
[div class=p 
	"Performed with the A button, throwing Pikmin is one of the standard ways of making them interact with objects. There are three main parts to the process of throwing a Pikmin, each corresponding to a part of an A press. Grabbing the Pikmin requires pushing the A button, although it can take more than a frame if a Pikmin needs to move closer to the leader to be teleported into the leader's hand. Once the Pikmin is being held, it will stay that way until the A button is released. Finally, the Pikmin is thrown when the Pikmin has been held and the A button is no longer held.
