	"By Goombella Buffering in the room before Pirate’s Grotto, you can fall out of bounds. There are a few NPCs there because unused NPCs are stored at the coordinates 0, -1000, 0. By falling while riding Yoshi, you can maneuver Mario in the air to land right on top of the ember, triggering the ember fight that normally occurs while rescuing Bobbery. This sets the game to a mid-Chapter 5 state. Since you can warp ahead using this trigger, you no longer need to complete the pre-Chapter 5 sequence which included visiting The Thousand-Year Door, talking to Flavio, Podley the bartender, and Bobbery.

	"Performing the Bobbery Glitch on the door right before Magnus von Grapple 2.0 will cause Bowser to be in paper mode during the intermission. This causes some very odd effects. Since you are in paper mode, you can also go into tube mode. If you try to jump while in tube mode, the game will lock your Y Speed, your Base Speed, your current angle, and your direction; although you can still move around freely. Since these value are locked, this also allows you to float in the air. Trying to jump in tube mode results in a softlock, because you are unable to go back to normal. If you enter and leave tube mode, another glitch will occur with Bowser's collision with the ground of the area. If you try to walk up the stairs to the Sanctum, you will simply clip into the first two before hitting a wall by the third stair. If you try to walk onto the grass, you will clip through it and fall underneath the level. This will also occur repeatedly each time you respawn, although it is possible to land back on solid ground in some way. If you try to jump while in paper mode as Bowser, you will lose the paper mode properties, and will have similar properties to Bobbery Glitch. Bowser will appear to be in paper mode, but will function as if he isn't in paper mode. Also, you can gain the paper mode properties back by going on the third or fourth stair of the Sanctum. However, if you go down a stair, you will lose the paper mode properties again. It should also be noted that even with being able to jump, Bowser still cannot enter the blue pipe. This is because the game is programmed so that neither Bowser nor Peach can enter a pipe.

This happens because the glitch most likely duplicates the flag that checks whether the item is bought and sets the original flag to "bought", while the copy is still set to "not bought". The Invalid Item appears to require 0 coins and 0 BP, and through repeatedly entering and leaving the shop and buying and selling regular items, you can make the Invalid Item disappear off the shelf entirely. However, as the item isn't real and can't be bought, this glitch has no practical use. Performing two superslides and then entering and leaving a building results in the badge shop badges appearing in the middle of Rogueport at coordinates (0,0,0). Loading the shop 8 times will cause all of the text in the game to appear corrupted upon walking up to the badges.

If that value is lower, Mario would walk straight up, causing him to fall out of bounds instead of walking onto the seam (unless it was changed further into the entering animation). There currently is no known way to change Mario’s angle during these cutscenes.

[div class=p 
	"The third and most recent theory is entering a battle while using Vivian. If Mario were to enter a battle while using Vivian, walls would become disabled.

A variation of this is a 2 frame speed swap, wherein Mario, Peach, or Bowser can move up or down for 2 frames and then move in any direction for 14 frames without losing the greater speed value.

This causes Mario to walk as fast as normal but while in paper mode. In doing so, you can also open doors while in paper mode. This causes Mario to remain outside of the building when entering. Now the camera is rotated 90 degrees. From here, since you’re still outside of the building, you can perform a Flurrie Superslide, just like during Ultra Hammer Early. Because the camera is rotated, Mario moves down on Z-axis, relative to the screen's rotation. This means that Mario slides down into the Teleporter Room. Currently, the game doesn't think you’re in Chapter 7, so you have to read a note that makes the game think Mario is indeed in that chapter. This skips grabbing the sixth Crystal Star, the Peach and Bowser intermissions, Fahr Outpost, and the General White Hunt. Just like Ultra Hammer Early, this is a Japanese-only glitch because of the superslide mechanics.

This can also be done by obtaining hitbox glitch and walking underneath the sides of the fountain statue the same way you would with the pillar.

	"By flipping into Paper mode, walking into a tight space between two solid objects and then unflipping in that area that's supposed to keep him flipped, Mario will sometimes clip into both objects. This can be used to enter buildings without having to unlock or open the door. This doesn't have any use in a speedrun yet.

	"While on Yoshi, Mario retains his hitbox value of 20. Because Yoshi has greater speed, sometimes Yoshi's greater speed allows Mario to clip through certain things that he otherwise would not be able to. An example of this is on top of Bobbery's house. Yoshi can clip through the roof, skipping the need to go down the chimney in tube mode. Because the house was never loaded, the walls are not solid. After talking to Bobbery, you can walk through the wall instead of opening the door.
