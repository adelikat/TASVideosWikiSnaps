You should still see the back exhaust lit up just before you resume gas; if your exhaust flames are gone you've had gas off too long. If you let go of gas too early, you will lose boost speed and you will probably try to resume gas and boost and not get a boost 'cause you mistimed it, this will slow you down a bit.

	"This is a technique that may occur as you cancel an extended Shaking line, or you may have seen in a Shaking video that long lines of Shaking suddenly burst a few hundred km/h as the tech is cancelled or interrupted by boosting. This is because speed is stored during an active Shaking line while your speed is lower than your machine's true speed.

	"The basic idea of LMBD is to get the manual boost upon the instant you land so you can go straight back into 2000+ snaking speeds, rather than dropping to 1400. To do this, manual boost during the dive, close to the point of landing, then simply do the standard MT landing. Immediately once you've hit the ground, press A once to start the engine again and continue snaking.
