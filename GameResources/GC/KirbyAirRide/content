	"When an item spawns, it appears in the air. If it is grabbed before it reaches the ground, it will "blink" briefly before disappearing. If 2+ players grab the item  at the same frame before it hits the ground , both players will recieve the item. This not only counts as grabbing 2+ items by the game, but can also lead to unlikely events occuring at the same time, like having multiple Krackos on the screen at once.
