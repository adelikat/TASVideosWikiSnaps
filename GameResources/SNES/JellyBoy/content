Notably, the levels need not be completed once their puzzle piece has been collected, so death may be used to save time when they do not need to be completed to progress on the world map. This usually saves much more time than gaining the necessary lives, either through 1-ups or collecting 100 cherries or 100 music notes in a level.

	"Floor clip preservation

]h4
[div class=p 
	"When landing, Jelly Boy will often clip a few pixels into the floor, before being snapped to the correct height a frame later. Triggering a transformation (e.g. by picking up an item or pressing X to return to the normal form) on the right frame stops the snapping from happening, keeping Jelly Boy clipped into the floor. This has a couple of issues:

[div class=p 
	"It is not known how to do anything about the first of these. For the second, it can be interrupted by performing an action (e.g. attacking with Y, ducking with A, or in rare cases the B action), keeping you permanently inside the floor until you jump. Getting hit by an enemy in this state will push you downwards through the floor you are in.

[div class=p 
	"When in Jelly Boy's normal form, landing while not holding a direction makes Jelly Boy act as if he is on the landing floor until his speed has decreased to 0 or a direction is pressed. During this time, you will move horizontally, and may jump as if you are stood on the floor. This can be used to jump over larger gaps than you would be able to otherwise.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Other forms have neutral landings with other effects; details can be found on the transformation page. In particular, the skateboard may go up to 30 frames without slowing down, which can be used in Marble Alley to skip a textbox while still collecting enough cherries for an extra life.

]div
[div class=p 
	"This is particularly effective with the flamethrower transformation, as its attack may last arbitrarily long, as was used in a (now obsolete) strategy for Brass Monkeys. With Jelly Boy's normal form, the attack does not last long enough for this to save time, with the exception of the attack hitting an object. In this case, the attack is extended by a frame, and (if the acceleration cycle is on the correct frame) save 7 pixels.
