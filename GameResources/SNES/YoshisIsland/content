If Yoshi's speed is above average when you let go if left/right, it will reduce down to the average (thus no Super Mario World Hop Glitch) but letting go can allow slight sub pixel advantage by freezing your speed on a good oscillation. It also allows for turning left, and hopping backwards without losing significant speed; however, you need to accelerate so you end up with the same speed again, and prepare an egg shot which faces you in the opposite direction.
