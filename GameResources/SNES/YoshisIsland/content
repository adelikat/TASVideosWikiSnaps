[p 
	"Additionally, you can press a combo of left and right, then release to freeze your speed on a good oscillation. You then press A, which locks you in the egg aiming animation, while facing backwards. You then time the jump so that you cancel the egg and jump on the next frame without losing your good oscillation. This results in a backwards facing jump with a speed of 767. From there, you can use Yoshi's tongue to grab at sprites behind you, but only do so when you absolutely need to.

]p
[p 
	"After ricocheting a shell off of a wall, swallow it immediately before jumping on it and you will gain a boost with the shell in your mouth! Repeat for as much needed! Shell must be jumped on at the very edge; otherwise simultaneous swallowing and jumping won't be possible. Infinite jump boosts will only work with shells, not monkeys.

[h4 id=Jumping 
	" Jumping
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Press B button 4 frames before Yoshi lands (i.e. landing sprite) for a perfectly timed jump. When jumping off of slopes, this is important to prevent speed decrements. If a jump off of a slope cannot be done 4 frames before landing (and sometimes must be done 3 frames before) Yoshi will lose speed; try to modify the previous jump to easily fix it.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Note: There is an interesting mini boost when jumping up an uphill slope at max speed, if you do a little variation of the acceleration trick (on the frame when you're about to touch the ground, press left one frame). It's unknown yet if this saves any time, but for 2 frames you'll be above max speed and then 1 frame below it, then go back to normal oscillating max speed.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Sometimes, if you jump on certain frames, your speed is reduced to an average of 752, so it should always be tested with every jump. Generally, if you want to jump again straight away after landing on a flat surface, it is optimal to jump on the third frame possible. Each jump should be tested.
	$LF
]p
[h4 id=Longjumping 
	" Long jumping
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Sometimes Yoshi can jump through narrow passages/entrances and 'squeeze' through enemies and other obstacles by holding down the B button no longer than necessary (so Yoshi will not get hit or run into the side of the ledge), releasing it for as long as needed until the B button can be held again without any collisions to stay off ground for a little longer (without any floating); this can only be done if Yoshi is not falling, and is still increasing height. Can't really jump any further, just at a shorter 'arch'.
	$LF
]p
[h4 id=PipeanimationCancelling 
	" Pipe animation Cancelling
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"If you jump and press down to do a downward pound when attempting to go down pipes, Yoshi will jump up, and the pressing down will make Yoshi activate the pipe, but will have jumped first. The result is that Yoshi jumps, doesn't do the pound animation, and the screen fades black, loading to the next room that Yoshi would enter from the pipe. This saves time from going into the pipe normally.
	$LF
]p
[h4 id=Acceleration 
	" Acceleration
	$LF

[p 
	"Get a faster acceleration when Yoshi is at a complete stop (also with jumping arrows) by pressing Left once, then Right 4 times, then Left, then Right 3 times, then Left, then Right 3 times, then Left, then Right 3 times, then Left, then Right 2 times, then Left, then Right for the remainder.

[h4 id=Slope-Oscillation 
	" Slope-Oscillation
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"When you jump on a slope, jump off it on the 2nd frame possible. This will change your average speed (and the low and high respectively). Normal average speed from initial acceleration is 760, but with the slope trick, the max becomes 767. Different positions on the slope must be tested, and sometimes it's not possible to reach 767. But, speeds above 760 can still be reached, such as 765.

[p 
	"Once you perform the slope trick, you must constantly watch memory to make sure the average speed does not decrease down to 752.

[h4 id=SpeedOscillationFreeze 
	" Speed Oscillation Freeze
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Yoshi's speed oscillates; this speed however is frozen when you jump and let go of right/left (which is essential for keeping speed while making eggs.) If Yoshi's speed is above average when you let go if left/right, it will reduce down to the average (thus no Super Mario World Hop Glitch) but letting go can allow slight sub pixel advantage by freezing your speed on a good oscillation. It also allows for turning left, and hopping backwards without losing significant speed; however, you need to accelerate so you end up with the same speed again, and prepare an egg shot which faces you in the opposite direction.
