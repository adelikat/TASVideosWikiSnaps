	"Umihara Kawase is a little-known Japanese game superficially similar 
	$LF
	"to Top Secret or Ninja Five-O.  The player takes the role of Umihara, 
	$LF
	"a schoolgirl armed with a pink backpack and a rubber fishing line, and 
	$LF
	"tries to navigate a series of interconnected non-linear levels called 
	$LF
	"Fields, amassing score by capturing Darwinist nightmare fish along the 
	$LF
	"way.

	"The game isn't that long if you're only trying to see the ending.
	$LF
	"Demonstratedly the game is possible to finish in about 2 minutes.

	"The true fun of the game is in tricks and competition. This is an 
	$LF
	"incredibly difficult game to 
	[em 
		"play
	]em
	" even if it's not a difficult 
	$LF
	"game to 
	[em 
		"win
	]em
	" (similar to Ikaruga in that respect).
