	"Umihara Kawase is a little-known Japanese game superficially similar 
	$LF
	"to Top Secret or Ninja Five-O.  The player takes the role of Umihara, 
	$LF
	"a schoolgirl armed with a pink backpack and a rubber fishing line, and 
	$LF
	"tries to navigate a series of interconnected non-linear levels called 
	$LF
	"Fields, amassing score by capturing Darwinist nightmare fish along the 
	$LF
	"way.
