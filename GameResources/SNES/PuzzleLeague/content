	(__wikiLink|user:Baxter)
	" mentioned in his 
	(__wikiLink|936M|Panel de Pon run)
	", the only gameplay difference between Panel de Pon and Tetris Attack is the scoring. In Tetris Attack, you can get a high score the fastest by making massive chains, whereas in Panel de Pon, you large combos will work faster.
