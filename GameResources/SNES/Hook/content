[p 
	"Normally, when you want to start dashing (by holding Y, which is also the attack button), Peter Pan will go through his attack animation before starting to move. But if you quickly pause/unpause after starting to hold Y and the direction you want to go in, the attack animation will be skipped.

	$LF
	[a id=heading-493 
	]a
]h4
[p 
	"Jumping and falling off slopes each delay forward movement for two frames.  Attacking while running delays forward movement by one frame. Attacking while jumping is OK as long as it isn't done too far into the jump.

	]a
]h4
[p 
	"This game doesn't have much lag, or at least not much lag you can do anything about, but there can be some lag towards the end of stage 2 at least.  The current TAS does not use the route through this section with the least jumps/attacks but rather one that has less lag because that ends up being faster.  SNES9x has a lag counter to help you keep track of this.

	$LF

	"Doing so will make dust gathering slower. If you can't simply stand or jump while gathering dust, try starting to float then quickly canceling it.  After canceling the float Peter Pan will initially fall very slowly.
