	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Normally, when you want to start dashing (by holding Y, which is also the attack button), Peter Pan will go through his attack animation before starting to move. But if you quickly pause/unpause after starting to hold Y and the direction you want to go in, the attack animation will be skipped.

	" Minimize jumps, falling off slopes, and attacking while running
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Jumping and falling off slopes each delay forward movement for two frames.  Attacking while running delays forward movement by one frame. Attacking while jumping is OK as long as it isn't done too far into the jump.

	" Keep track of lag
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This game doesn't have much lag, or at least not much lag you can do anything about, but there can be some lag towards the end of stage 2 at least.  The current TAS does not use the route through this section with the least jumps/attacks but rather one that has less lag because that ends up being faster.  SNES9x has a lag counter to help you keep track of this.

[h4 id=Don'tskimponpixiedust 
	" Don't skimp on pixie dust
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Peter Pan moves faster while flying, which generally makes up for the extra time spent gathering dust. Pixie dust decreases by 1 every frame Peter Pan is flying or floating.

]p
[h4 id=Don'tfloatwhilegatheringpixiedust 
	" Don't float while gathering pixie dust
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Doing so will make dust gathering slower. If you can't simply stand or jump while gathering dust, try starting to float then quickly canceling it.  After canceling the float Peter Pan will initially fall very slowly.

[h4 id=Positionyourselfappropriatelywhendonegatheringpixiedust

	$LF
