	"The game uses a flow of 14592 sequent RNG values which it will run through during playing the game. Those values determine the appearance of enemies, item drops, SMAAAASH!! attacks, NPC behavior and other things. Having text being written onscreen will cause the flow of RNG to move with each character written. When the game loads new enemies onto the map, it will shift the flow of RNG too.

	"In order to skip enemies or to have specific enemies appear, one can pause the game by pressing "B" or "select". The RNG will be called each frame during pausing. Unpause the game and move on once the result is desireable. This trick shouldn't be used if enemies can be avoided by walking past them in a clever fashion.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Tip for advanced players:
	$LF
	"If you need to push the RNG for a better set-up for a battle or for an item drop, you can try walking past a barrier that causes enemies to load continously in an area where there are many enemies (You can use the lua-script found at the bottom of this page for this. When the flow of RNG shifts when walking around, you know that you may have crossed a barrier. After the frame it shifts, move back and forth to go across this barrier repeatedly). This has an even greater effect when done on an intersection of barriers.

[div class=p 
	"In a battle, one wants to use the SMAAAASH!! attack as much as possible without wasting too much time for manipulating it. You can change the RNG by moving the selection in the battle menu. Since you can move the selection only every other frame, it is faster to manipulate the first SMAAAASH!! by pausing before entering the battle.

	"When Ness and co. step onto a staircase, they will be moved forward and be locked to the staircase. If the game interrupts this locking procedure by telling you that someone's health is getting critical or through a phone call, Ness and co. will be able to walk through walls. You can walk around on the map freely, but most areas will be unloaded and you can't use any doors. You can use the sound stone or the town map in order to load an area. You can also walk out of bounds though the game might freeze if you walk too far.

	"This glitch is, obviously, very useful for speedrunning. However, you can't use this trick to go directly to Giygas since the game freezes during the battle. The game unsets flags to check later if you followed the plot.
	$LF
	"So in order to prevent the game freeze, you need to 1) fall through the hole in Lumine Hall and 2) visit Magicant and beat Ness' Nightmare.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"An alternative method to do this glitch is to position oneself on a staircase and die by poisoning, cold, sunstroke or sickness. At the game-over sequence, make sure to go back to the title screen. Don't let the gameplay demos at the title screen play or the glitch will fail. Now the next time you load any savefile you can walk through walls.

	"As mentioned earlier, everything in Earthbound is on one big map. If you "check" an area that is located outside this map, the game will lag for a short while before bringing up a message. At some places it is possible that the game can bring up glitched messages! Such places are inside the

		"top-right corner of Onett

	". The game may rarely crash, warp you somewhere, start an event such as a photo shot or a battle, or bring up menus. The game tries to read text from random places in memory. However, it can't be abused very well nor is it well investigated.

	"This glitch is useful for tool-assisted speedrunning due to its potential to bring up the otherwise unreachable debug menu which can be used to complete the game very quickly. See 
	[a class=intlink href=/1627M
