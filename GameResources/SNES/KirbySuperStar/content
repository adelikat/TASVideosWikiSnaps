It does not work without a corner since the ceiling ejects Kirby downwards to a height where he can't glitch through the ceiling anymore. If it weren't for that very pixel, he could glitch through ceilings directly.

	"Basically, for this trick to work, Kirby or his partner need to press "down" to crouch for a certain number of frames, while running on a solid ground. If done correctly, Kirby or his partner can fall through a passable platform by pressing the "down" arrow key a certain frame before he would hit the platform. The state of being able to pass a platform like that will not be reset by Kirby's death, room transitions or other transitions. Using this trick, going down a platform normally and a soft-reset will cancel this state, however.

	"Lag is very tedious to control in this game. The lag frames during screen transitions can be minimized by different audio output of the game (by jumping, running or using your shield before entering a door). Generally, the more action on-screen, the greater the amount of lagframes that may occur. Avoid killing enemies if possible. When using Jet, try to direct your backward fire into a wall. Do luck-manipulate enemies into not performing moves that would induce lag frames easily (such as a fire enemy spitting a fireball).
