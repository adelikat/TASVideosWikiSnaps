	"While performing a dashing attack in mid-air with the Fire ability, press Up and Down. This will cause Kirby to zip downwards at an enormous speed. This can be used to glitch through the floor to skip through some rooms or at the computer virus battle in order to kill yourself to skip the long sequence.

	"In order to glitch through a ceiling, fly towards the corner of a ceiling so that you just barely miss its wall. Then press "up" and "down". It does not work without a corner since the ceiling ejects Kirby downwards to a height where he can't glitch through the ceiling anymore. If it weren't for that very pixel, he could glitch through ceilings directly.

	"When pressing Up+Down on a ladder, it will glitch out the game, usually leading to a crash. In snes9x-rr 1.43, it sometimes would lead to the miniboss battle in Dynablade but the emulation in snes9x-rr is not console accurate. The glitch has been tested on console by 
	[a class=extlink href=https://www.twitch.tv/0xwas rel=nofollow

	"Basically, for this trick to work, Kirby or his partner need to press "down" to crouch for a certain number of frames, while running on a solid ground. If done correctly, Kirby or his partner can fall through a passable platform by pressing the "down" arrow key a certain frame before he would hit the platform. The state of being able to pass a platform like that will not be reset by Kirby's death, room transitions or other transitions. Using this trick, going down a platform normally and a soft-reset will cancel this state, however.

	[a id=heading-2930

]h3
[p 
	"Lag is very tedious to control in this game. The lag frames during screen transitions can be minimized by different audio output of the game (by jumping, running or using your shield before entering a door). Generally, the more action on-screen, the greater the amount of lagframes that may occur. Avoid killing enemies if possible. When using Jet, try to direct your backward fire into a wall. Do luck-manipulate enemies into not performing moves that would induce lag frames easily (such as a fire enemy spitting a fireball).
