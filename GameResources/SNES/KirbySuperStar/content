It does not work without a corner since the ceiling ejects Kirby downwards to a height where he can't glitch through the ceiling anymore. If it weren't for that very pixel, he could glitch through ceilings directly.

	"This trick works by first performing a setup which leaves either Kirby's or the helper's fall-through counter at a non-zero value. Normally the counter resets when leaving a crouch, but it can be tricked by, for example as Kirby, crouching for a single frame during a run animation. In this state, if down is held starting a few frames before hitting the platform, they will immediately fall through without landing on the platform.

	"Lag is very tedious to control in this game. The lag frames during screen transitions can be minimized by different audio output of the game (by jumping, running or using your shield before entering a door). Generally, the more action on-screen, the greater the amount of lag frames that may occur. Avoid killing enemies if possible. When using Jet, try to direct your backward fire into a wall. Do luck-manipulate enemies into not performing moves that would induce lag frames easily (such as a fire enemy spitting a fireball).
