	"Sky accelerates for a while before reaching full walking speed. By jumping at the first frame possible this can be avoided, since jumping speed is always maximum and doesn't need acceleration. But when Sky touches the ground again, he still has to accelerate if he didn't yet. The acceleration can be completely skipped by grabbing a wall.
