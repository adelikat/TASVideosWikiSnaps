	"The game checks the subpixel portion of your speed before checking the integer pixel portion. If your subspeed is below the subspeed of the limit, the game is satisfied that you are below the speed limit, and will skip the integer check. A very simple example is when running straight for 2.50 speed, you can then move diagonally to get close to 2.77 speed, as before you hit that limit, the subspeed portion of diagonal running is satisfied. After your speed tries to exceed 2.77, it will snap to 1.77, as normal for diagonal running speed.

Additionally, if you need to get rid of your hyper speed, accelerate normally at a moment your subspeed triggers the limit, and your speed will snap down to where the limit is.
