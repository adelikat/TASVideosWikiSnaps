	$LF
	"in the making of tool-assisted speedruns. For most of the tricks,

	" Zipping
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This occurs when Gomez has a speed of 3 pixels per frame or more, if you jump into a wall going right with the right timing, you will get stuck in the wall and zip upwards very quickly. This can be used a lot to save time because you can go through walls and sometimes, spawn doors to the next room.

	" Keeping Speed Through A Door
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"When you enter a door, if you hold up and left, or up and right (depending on the direction you are going), you can keep a speed on 1 pixel per frame into the next room.

	" Speed Explanation
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Optimizing this game to its fullest potential is impossible unless you understand how speed works. From a stop, it takes 8 frames to accelerate to 2 pixels a frame, then it takes 16 frames to accelerate to 3 pixels a frame, then it takes 24 frames to accelerate to 4 pixels a frame (assuming you have 2 speed upgrades that are at the beginning). If you accelerate for 7 frames from a stop, you won't make it to 2 pixels a frame. This would seem useless, but if you stop after you accelerate for 7 frames, and then start moving again, it only takes 1 frame to get to 2 pixels a frame. You can do this with the 16 frames and 24 frames too. So if you optimized the counters enough, you could get 4 pixels a frame in 3 frames. This is very useful for places where you fall down. You can also make the timer infinitely loop if you hold the direction for 9 frames, then let go of the direction for 4 frames, and then hold it for 9 frames, and repeat. You could also do this to keep 2 pixels a frame, or 3 pixels a frame.

	" Jump Through Hills
	$LF

[p 
	"You can only do this is a few rooms where you go horizontally only, and there is fairly steep hills, but not too steep. If you jump for 1 frames you can somethimes go through hills.
