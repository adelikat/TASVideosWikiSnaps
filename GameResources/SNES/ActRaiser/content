The trick can also be activated in Northwall Act 2 but it doesn't save time due to the amount of time spent getting an eye to hit you while next to the tree.

	" The most important thing to take away from Admiral's maximum population guide is that killing as many enemies as possible before reaching the first lair in a town is important for maintaining maximum growth. You also have to plan carefully because how you should build in one town is affected by what will happen while you're in other towns. It can be difficult to predict, for example, the minimum number of extra roads to build to accommodate for future growth while you're away from a town. So it's best to make test runs where the focus is on optimizing the simulation segments and not worrying about how well-played the action segments are.

	"Boost's incrementing behavior seems somewhat inconsistent unless you see how it interacts with Crest, hence this explanation. Before Hero begins moving, Crest and Boost both equal 0. When the hero begins moving, Crest increments by 1 per frame.  When Crest reaches 5, Boost is set to 4.  Boost then counts down by 1 per frame, while Crest stays at the same value.  On the frame after Boost reaches 0, Boost resets to 4 and Crest increments by 1. Once Boost has counted all the way down while Crest=7, everything resets to 0, and the cycle starts again. The main point is that there is a part of the sequence where Boost does not go 4,3,2,1,0,4,3,2,1,0..., but instead stays at 0 for several frames.
