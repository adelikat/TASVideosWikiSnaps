Once you have received the power-up (Mario stops blinking), reset the game and if done correctly your level completion count has gone up by 1. If done repeatedly, you can reach up to 99, although, by glitching address A042 it may be possible to write values higher than 99 to it (see the section Glitch World below).

This can be used to use the bubble from the Hippo level in other levels, or to touch the checkpoint bell of a level "early". It saves time to take Space Zone 1's checkpoint bell into Space Zone 2, and die and re-enter to start near the end of the level.

[p 
	"If you take the checkpoint bell into a level that does not normally have a checkpoint bell, the next time you enter the level you will start out in the top left corner of the level in versions 1.0 and 1.1. You start at the normal starting point in version 1.2, instead (this fact can be used to distinguish your game version between 1.1 and 1.2).

Now it will create more and more enemies until all the enemy slots are used up and those "enemies" only become active when Mario lets them onscreen. This comes in handy for the lag zip glitch described below. (

[p 
	"The following glitch only works in version 1.0 of the game. To do it, you must go down a pipe in a previously beaten level, and pause & leave it in the process - alternatively, you can die at the same time you go down a pipe. The next time you enter a level, you will go through the floor. In some levels this allows you to enter a glitch world that allows a quick level end.

[p 
	"The following glitch works in both version 1.0 and 1.1. Instead of pausing while going down a pipe as mentioned above, you can also die at the very same frame Mario starts descending which will give you the same effect as mentioned above: After entering the next level, Mario will be sent through the floor.

Once the input slots are used up, the game freezes. If you manage to beat a level, it will save over your first savegame.

	"By abusing the fact that Mario oscillates between a speed of 1 and 2 every frame, and that different speed patterns are used depending on memory address A200 (which goes up when running and down when stopping), you can gain more speed by switching between different speed patterns. Instead of 1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2... you would go 1,2,2,1,2,1,2,2,1,2,...
