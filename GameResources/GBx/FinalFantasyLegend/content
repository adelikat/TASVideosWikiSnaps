	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"As with other RPGs, Final Fantasy Legend also has an RNG. It is difficult to manipulate, as it will only increment through actions, or get shuffled by a soft reset. The soft reset RNG manipulation is mostly frame-based, but something like entering a menu can slightly affect it.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Unfortunately, soft resets seem to revert to a default for the 
	[em 
		"battle
	]em
	" RNG, meaning if it's impossible to win after a reset, there's no way to manipulate that short of getting into another battle before the impossible one, and don't reset along the way.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" RNG Addresses
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Final Fantasy Legend uses a different address for almost every different effect possible.  There are 128 such addresses, stored in the RAM from 
	[tt 
		"C300
	]tt
	" through 
	[tt 
		"C37F
	]tt
	".  Manipulating one will not affect whether a different action is successful, as almost every action that needs an RNG has its own address it can use.  With no known exception, each RNG address rolls once per use, incrementing by one after each use.  For example, the Mutant growth RNG address, 
	[tt 
		"C30B
	]tt
	" is rolled once per mutant at the end of every battle; if it is 123 in a party of three mutants, it will increase to 126 after the next battle.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"After resetting, each RNG reverts to a value offset from 
	[tt 
		"C300
	]tt
	"'s by some amount that varies slightly.  The formula for the offset of each value is believed to be
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	[em 
		"y
	]em
	"=floor(9/64*
	[em 
		"x
	]em
	"+
	[em 
		"b

	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"where
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	[em 
		"y
	]em
	" is the offset amount
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	[em 
		"x
	]em
	" is the difference between the RAM address in question and 
	[tt 
		"C300
	]tt
	" (e.g., for RAM address 
	[tt 
		"C30B
	]tt
	", x is 11)
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	[em 
		"b
	]em
	" is the value of 
	[tt 
		"C300
	]tt
	" plus some unknown fractional amount
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The "unknown fractional amount" in b makes many of the RAM addresses inconsistent, but it also frees up an additional degree of freedom to manipulate luck.  For example, 
	[tt 
		"C358
	]tt
	"'s offset is +12 3/8.  Roughly speaking, this means that when the game is (soft) reset, three out of eight times 
	[tt 
		"C358
	]tt
	"'s value will be 13 higher than 
	[tt 
		"C300
	]tt
	"'s; the five other times, it will be 12 higher.  To check the feasibility of manipulating two addresses simultaneously, simply subtract their offsets.  In the case of 
	[tt 
		"C30B
	]tt
	" and 
	[tt 
		"C34B
	]tt
	", the net offset is +9, meaning 
	[tt 
		"C34B
	]tt
	"'s value will 
	[em 
		"always
	]em
	" be 9 greater than 
	[tt 
		"C30B
	]tt
	"'s value and those two addresses are "locked" to each other.  It is therefore impossible to manipulate mutant bonus type and mutant abilities independently.

	"If you hold down a button for a single frame, the game won't even process it. You must hold each button you want to press for two frames rather than one.

[p 
	"An optimal run away takes around 20 frames longer than an optimal reset. In addition, it is possible to manipulate

[p 
	"Have a Mutant learn TELEPOR before you fight GEN-BU. After you put the three KING items on the statue, use TELEPOR to get to the tower. Because you didn't walk on a certain trigger tile, poor GEN-BU never gets a chance to fight you.

	$LF

	"Bosses are immune to the PARA element, which includes many status effects and instant death. However, most have no immunity to the STONE element, in which petrification acts like instant death anyway.

	[em

	" than the enemy's defense for it to even work.

[p 
	"For status spells, your Mana needs to be at least Enemy Mana-4 to guarantee a hit from the first shot. Most endgame bosses have a Mana of 100, so in order to petrify them in the first action, you need 96 Mana by the endgame.
