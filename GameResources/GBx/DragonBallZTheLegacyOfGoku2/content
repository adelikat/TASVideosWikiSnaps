Another way to do it is to use the game's sleep mode. In the video, the glitch is demonstrated with Vegeta's big bang attack.

	"Switching your character at a save point doesn't remove any ki blasts from the screen and it clears your character's stun. Because of this, it is possible to shoot multiple ki blasts simultaneously without having to wait for the stun to wear off. When done with certain attacks such as Vegeta's big bang attack, it will cause a memory corruption glitch that mainly messes up graphics and audio. It may be possible for this glitch to be useful in a TAS someday.
