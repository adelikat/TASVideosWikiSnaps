	"In each level of the game there is a total of 5 star items. Upon collecting them all and finishing the level, a bonus game will start. This is undesirable in a speedrun and should be avoided. In fact, collecting stars in general should be avoided since the "level end" screen counts every collected star item, wasting time.
