]h3
[p 
	"When driving through enemies, you will usually hit them either 2 or 4 times (each hit takes 3 frames). This is due to how the game handles invincibility spans for enemies. You can abuse this by always aiming to get only 2 hits on enemies. This can be done by changing your position before you start to drive (done at the beginning of a room usually). You will always get 4 hits for certain enemies or when driving uphill.
	$LF

]h3
[p 
	"This is a glitch that will allow Kirby to skip the animation when he blows out so you will be normal immediately. The rate at which this bug occurs is set. At this time the bug hasn't been researched, so one would need to use trial-and-error for this trick to work. As Wheel Kirby, you can use this to puff out and immediately blow up and starting to drive near the ledge, using the "Keep momentum, skip backward movement as Wheel Kirby" trick mentioned above.

It depends on whether they are performing a special move at the time Kirby inhales them. Golems can only perform either a stomping attack, a rolling attack or an uppercut punch.

Basicly, everytime you create a cloud of dust, RNG changes. It is assumed RNG changes slowly over time or depending on enemies (when their sprites change etc.)

For example, after beating a boss and receiving a mirror shard, you can save about 4 seconds but you will lose whatever ability you had. Usually, it's ok to lose your ability unless it's Wheel, since acquiring Wheel usually takes longer than the 4 seconds saved from resetting.
	$LF

Doing this against a side of the screen (not a wall), you can keep preserving the speed indefinitely. Since the speed address is signed 16-bit, preserving speed any higher than 32,767 or any lower than -32,767 will cause an overflow or underflow respectively which will cause Kirby to suddenly move into the other direction at super speed.
