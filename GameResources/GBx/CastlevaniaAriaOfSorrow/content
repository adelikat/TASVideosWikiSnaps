The maximum damage-per-second of a weapon depends on damage per hit and cooldown.

	" Movement tricks
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Most of the movement tricks in the game are centered around effective use of backdashing. Backdash has a faster initial speed than walking; however, you may not normally do backdashes more than once per 26 frames (see also: broken backdash). 
	$LF
	"Thankfully there are several ways to circumvent it until faster movement methods are made available.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Also known as the backstab dance. This movement pattern uses a jump to cancel the backdash animation, and an attack to prevent soma from turning around. This allows one backdash per 15 frames instead.

[h4 id=Backdashcancel 
	" Backdash cancel
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Souls like Catoblepas, Bone Pillar, and Medusa Head, can cancel most animations. One of their most useful applications is canceling a backdash without having to leave the ground and wait for Soma to land again. This allows one backdash per 10 frames. Catoblepas costs less MP but Bone Pillar does more damage if you later wish to attack with it.

	$LF
]p
[h4 id=Brokenbackdash 
	" Broken backdash
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"If you backdash on one of the first two possible frames after a previous backdash (i.e 26 or 27 frames after the first), you enter a broken state where you move backwards, but you don't enter the backdash animation. During this broken backdash, you can backdash again.

		"example
	]a
	" This is a good way of moving down slopes before catoblepas, because jump-canceling as in the backstab dance above doesn't work so well when it takes a much longer time to reach the ground again. You can see this in Kriole's second all-soul submission, in the Skeleton Knight room and in the Giant Ghost room in the chapel.

[h4 id=KickerSkeleton

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Black Panther has a horizontal speed of 4 pixels/frame, but it is always active, unlike Kicker Skeleton. However, you can save some MP in a TAS by using jumpkick during Black Panther movement and avoiding the landing cooldown by using Black Panther again.

	" Rush souls
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Although rush souls take a while to charge up and use a lot of MP, they have a maximum speed of 6 pixels/frame, the fastest speed Soma can go. Unfortunately, due to the castle layout, Soma will have to keep re-charging his rush soul in each new room and many times within some rooms, limiting the use of said method of movement to newgame+, where rush souls are available from the beginning but Black Panther is not. The

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"It is possible to corner boost on all corners, but it requires either a very good position or a fairly high speed. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The first method requires you to be inside the wall, a feat which is rarely achievable. The most common way to be inside the wall is to approach it from above. When inside the wall, simply cutting the corner on the right frame may or may not give Soma a slight vertical boost. This generally saves 1 frame/application.

		"Demonstration
	]a
	" -- notice how from frame 140 to 141, Soma moves downward 11:40 pixels but his Y speed is only 6:40. Thus, the corner boost netted 5 pixels of downward movement.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Another way of boosting is called platform boosting. All platforms have rounded edges which allows you to land earlier on the edges of a platform opposed to the center of it (this was added by the programmers to make tricky jumps more forgiving). This can be abused to get slight boosts, by landing on the edge of a platform, waiting for a frame for Soma to get to the top of the platform, then continue jumping. This generally saves 3 frames/application.

	"Maximizing damage output against monsters is a tricky business in Aria of Sorrow. The main issue is managing cooldowns. There are four separate cooldown values: weapon, bullet soul, guardian soul, Kicker Skeleton/Skeleton Blaze. Given the appropriate cancels, you can swing a weapon far faster than a monster can be hit by it, so in order to maximize damage output, you have to interleave different damage types. A great example is the fight against Death in 
	[a class=intlink href=/1628M 
		"Kriole's all-souls v2
	]a
	". Using Mystletain, Bone Pillar, and Kicker Skeleton, there is a sustained slash/blast/slash/kick sequence. A detailed discussion of cooldowns, plus a lua script to display cooldown values for enemies, is in

Some other monsters, including Final Guard, are neither one-shot killed nor healed by Killer Mantle; instead, it hits them bypassing their armor.

This can send you off the edge of a screen which doesn't have a normal exit, and so you will trigger a room transition which the designers hadn't planned for.

This movement doesn't properly check for collisions, so it can embed Soma (or Julius, in fact) in walls. Once you are embedded in a wall, the game will try to eject you, and hilarity ensues.
