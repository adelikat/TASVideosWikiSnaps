]h4
[p 
	"Unlike that of the sequels, the combo system of MMZ1 is not implemented with attack levels. The first two slashes of Zero's triple ground slashes and air rolling slashes cause on bosses a short invincibility period that is only 12 frames long, while the finishing slashes result in a much longer invincibility period. Therefore, it is possible to perform a very long slashing "combo" with such slashes that only cause a short invincibility period on a boss.

	$LF

]h4
[p 
	"If the collision box of your attack stays overlapping that of an enemy, the attack will no more hit the enemy after it has hit the enemy once upon contact, unless it is multi-hitting by design. However, if you move the collision box of the attack out of the enemy, it will be able to be hit again. Typically, you can do a jumping slash next to an enemy and keep turning to the left and right while still in the air, to make your slash hit the enemy for multiple times. This does not work if the enemy has boss-typed invulnerability.

	"For some reason, the hot metal ladles seen in levels use some "attack" to inflict damage to Zero upon contact, which is very blockable with Zero's shield from the left and right sides. Thus as long as the shield is being held, Zero can touch, slip or jump on the sides of the ladles without taking damage.

[p 
	"A thrown charged shields keeps returning to Zero as long as Zero keeps away from it. Since Zero can move faster than the shield, it can be abused to hit enemies around as long as possible. However, with careful positioning, you can let the shield just encircle Zero standing still. This is useful if you want to keep the charged shield on alert throughout a dialogue or a scripted event during which Zero cannot move.
