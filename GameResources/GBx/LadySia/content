You don't take damage from enemies and can't die,this allows you to go under water and the under of the stage on levels with air. If you gain life the side effects still remain. Then if you exit the area, without gaining life, and move onto the next part of the stage, then take damage your health rolls from zero to the maximum value on GBA, 2147483647, or i assume because i have to way to test it. But large enough that its pretty impossible for you to die without falling of the stage.

]h4
[p 
	"When Sia is slightly out of range to jump to a platform, jump towards the platform and swing your sword when you get close to it. This will give Sia a small boost which makes it possible to reach the platform. This only seems to work on platforms that move, or are animated it some way, but there are some useful exceptions. Keep in mind that the Sword Jump glitch will be deactivated after the Sword Climb Glitch has been used. Since the Sword Climb glitch messes up moving and animated platforms, this doesn't matter too much since the Sword Jump mainly only works on similar platforms.  There is one exception where you will have to correct Sword Climb’s effects to use Sword Jump.

	"While it hasn't been thoroughly tested which is the better method, it seems that it all depends on the surface in question. While testing on various surfaces, one method could be slower but reach farther (and visa versa), slower and not reach as far (and visa versa) or be exactly the same. Keep in mind that the frame work is different for every surface, meaning that the frame you start crawling, the amount of frames you crawl, and the amount of frames you walk before jumping is always different.
