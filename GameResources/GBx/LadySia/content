Keep in mind that the Sword Jump glitch will be deactivated after the Sword Climb Glitch has been used. Since the Sword Climb glitch messes up moving and animated platforms, this doesn't matter too much since the Sword Jump mainly only works on similar platforms.  There is one exception where you will have to correct Sword Climb’s effects to use Sword Jump.
