	"The timing of a button press has a high influence on random factor. The duration of a button press (how long it is held down) has a mild influence on random factor. For example, holding a button down for different durations usually (but not always) preserves a critical hit while randomizing damage. Mashing the A button during dialog slows down the text a little, so it can be used to luck-manipulate.

[p 
	"When catching Pokémon, timing of entering squares has a high influence on random factor. Walking around in the grass without stopping has a mild influence; the desired type of Pokémonis not likely to change, but its DVs are likely to change. Duration of a button press also has a mild influence.
