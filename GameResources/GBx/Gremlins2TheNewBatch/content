	"When you take damage, there is an invincibility span of 64 frames. If you use the musical note item, the invincibility counter will stop at whatever number it was at. Next time you take damage, it will finish counting rather than give you the full 64 frames, which can cause you to take damage twice within a short time. Not useful.
