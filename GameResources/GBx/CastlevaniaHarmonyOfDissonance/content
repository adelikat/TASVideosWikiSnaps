	"For example, in the most popular case, 1st attack is Maxim's Dive Kicking(0x06) and 2nd attack is Midair Slashing(0x30). The AND value of both accepted attack ID is 0. So, if the thrown Shuriken hit to the enemy, multiple hit glitch is occurred because of the attack of Shuriken is accepted but it isn't stored in sprite's memory. The longest time for continuing multiple hit is 14Frame(invulnerability of Midair Slashing).
