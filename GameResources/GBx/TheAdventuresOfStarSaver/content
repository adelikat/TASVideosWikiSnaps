	"Under certain circumstances, the game assumes you have ground beneath you even though you don't. Therefore you can jump in midair and stay airborne indefinitely. The exact conditions for this bug to happen are unknown, but you can influence it by pressing A repeatedly in the air and by changing your jump height.

	"There is a severe bug in the final stage of the game. To do it, you must be in human form and must not shoot throughout the level. You must approach the pressure plates that smash into each other fast enough. If done correctly, the game will glitch out in about 10 seconds.

	"If you shoot before the game glitches out, it will almost certainly crash. But if you don't, the glitch effects are more variable and visible. It seems the glitch has potential for
