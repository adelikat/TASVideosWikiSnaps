You can transform to flying form and to fish form by pressing "up B" or "down B" respectively. There are powerups that let Yacopu transform into special forms such as flower Yacopu, mini Yacopu, big Yacopu, goku Yacopu, ball Yacopu and mouse Yacopu. Each form has different perks and abilities.

It won't open again until you move far enough away. The Level 2 boss' attack (which makes him invincible) starts when the timer ($FF99) has value 40 (in hex). Both of these situations can be avoided by jumping against the boss to make him bounce up. By having Yacopu carry the boss on top of him, you can prevent him from touching the ground and therefore their invincibility periods won't trigger.

	"In flying form, if you touch the ground to gain 3 extra speed units on a Drop Frame, there won't be a drop. So in that situation you don't need to pause the game. Therefore it should be tried to make flying Yacopu touch the ground on Drop Frames.
