Because Mario take a few frames to react to slow down of any sort, this will not effect your forward speed at all.

	"If you throw away a hammer and then grab it on the first frame its animation changes (and therefore it's hitbox), and you grab it in such a way that you miss the new hitbox but hit the old one, then the hammer will split into two different one.  It is unknown at this time whether this trick works with the block breaking hammer in the Pyramid Stages.  Also unknown is its effect on the lifetime of the hammer (would two hammers drain the countdown twice as fast?  If so would it be possible to extend the life of the hammer indefinately by making the countdown miss 0 by going from 1 to -1?)

It's unknown whether or not it's possible to seed the RNG at the beginning of the game by waiting frames before starting, but it seems to be impossible to manipulate from within the game.  This would explain the weird occurances surrounding luck in my WIPs.

[p 
	"Grincevent: It is indeed possible to seed it at the beginning of the game, when the brick wall is being destroyed; at that point the RNG changes each frame until it stops by itself (the end of the breaking animation) or the player presses start (or A...) to go to the title screen. But if you want to manipulate the RNG at the start like that, you'll have to wait at least 61 frames from the first point when you're given the opportunity to skip that screen. In other words, from the earliest frame you can skip that screen, the RNG starts moving 61 frames later. It has to be worth these 61 frames (or more) if we want to change the starting RNG.
