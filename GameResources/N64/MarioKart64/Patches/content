	"Mario Kart 64 runs at 30 input frames per second (fps) of in-game time. Under ideal conditions there is one lag frame between each input frame. Internally the game makes calculations at 60 fps. On the actual Nintendo 64 hardware, this is typically true in one player modes but not true in multiplayer modes. The game engine is not capable of dynamically adjusting the game pacing based on the number of actual runtime input fps. Because of this, additional lag frames in multiplayer mode would make the game run in slow motion from the players' perspectives (although the simulated speed internal to the game would be the same as in comparable one-player modes). To counteract this and make the play speed feel similar to one player modes, the developers introduced a scaling factor to change the amount of in-game time elapsed per input frame. In one-player modes this factor is 2, meaning that from one input frame to the next, 2 units of in-game time (2/60 of a second) are simulated to have elapsed. In multiplayer this scaling factor is adjusted based on the number of players and the course that is being played. It is adjusted to either 3 or 4 units of in-game time (3/60 or 4/60 of a second respectively). These adjustments were presumably made by game testers late in development with the hope of mimicking the intended game pacing showcased in one-player modes. They represent a 50% and 100% increase in in-game time elapsed per input frame and a corresponding decrease in temporal resolution by 1/3 and 1/2 respectively. Given only these large adjustments, the resulting game pacing on actual hardware is inconsistent and the loss in temporal resolution makes the controls less responsive.

	"When played on more capable hardware, including the official Virtual Console and iQue releases as well as unofficial emulators, fewer lag frames are experienced. With fewer lag frames these scaling factors actually change the effective speed of the game. They directly increase the pacing by 50% or 100%. Combined with the loss in temporal resolution, three and four player modes become almost unplayable. In these cases, it would be preferable to remove these hardware dependent scaling factors and accept a consistent real-time 30 fps.

	"It is also possible to set the game time units per input frame to 1. This produces 60 frames per in-game second but the lag frames every other frame still exist. Thus, these codes result in the game playing at an effective runtime pacing of 50% of normal. To overcome this, it is necessary to use an emulator capable of fast forwarding at 200%. The end result is a normal pacing and very smooth 60 fps in all modes. However the music will be double speed and some frame-rate dependent animations (like power slide smoke) occur twice as often as normal.
