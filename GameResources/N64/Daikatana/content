	" Movement and Jumping
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Hiro's speed when walking forward will be referred to in this guide as "movement speed" or "forward speed". This is the main intended way of advancing through the game's levels. It starts at 1.40 units per frame and will increase with Speed stat upgrades. There is no acceleration; press C-Up for one frame and you will start moving 1.40 units at a time. There is deceleration after the button is released though.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"You can also move backwards at half of your forward speed or strafe at roughly 1 unit/frame. Both of these increase slightly as well with Speed upgrades. If you move forward and strafe against a wall, you will not lose any speed, but only move in the direction that's perpendicular to the wall.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Jumping is very simple, as you only have to press the button for one frame and Hiro will do his standard jump as high as he can. You can't jump higher by holding the button longer and you also can't steer yourself once you're in the air. This may seem to limit its usefulness, however this behavior can be abused to preserve high speed in the 
	[a class=intlink href=/GameResources/N64/Daikatana#WeaponBoost 
		"Weapon Boost glitch
	]a
	".
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When you land from a jump, you can jump again if you're within 5 units of the floor's collision box. This will preserve your jumping speed as the game doesn't process that you've hit the floor, therefore it is known as a "frame-perfect jump". If you're landing from high enough, this second jump can be a very small jump with decreased Y-Speed. It's not known why this occurs, but if necessary, you can fix it by landing fully on the floor and starting a new jump.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"You cannot activate buttons or doors while jumping. You will have to land for a frame or two, even if this makes you lose speed. Remember not to press A and R at the same time though, as that will make Hiro crouch.
	$LF
]p
[h3 id=Turning
 
	" Turning
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Turning is slow in this game, especially compared to Hiro's movement speed. A full 360-degree rotation takes 139 frames with the default Control Stick sensitivity and 111 frames on the highest sensitivity, a difference of 28 frames.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Due to the number of times you turn in the game, including during cutscenes where Hiro may often make 180-degree turns, changing the sensitivity saves a lot of time overall. It's four frames faster to change it after the game has started, even accounting for the pause button presses.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Most buttons and doors require you to be within certain facing angles to be able to activate them with A, though some buttons can be activated no matter which direction you're facing, like the last button in E1M1.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Use the Hor Facing Angle and Ver Facing Angle memory addresses to judge where Hiro is looking. Along with the position and speed values, they are very helpful for comparing paths between two TASes.

	"Nearly all of the lag in this game is "invisible"; in other words, BizHawk does not detect it. Even so, everything on the screen will freeze or move slower as the game tries to process more things at once.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"You can avoid or reduce lag by moving differently or turning the camera so as to load different objects onto the screen. You can also shoot some objects, like enemies, before they appear on the screen. For example, with the Ion Blaster, ricochet the shots off walls to hit them while they're still out of sight.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The RNG for this game controls enemy position and sometimes even the type of enemy that appears. For example, in the second-to-last room in E1M4, the two enemies guarding the Daikatana chamber can spawn as either common guards or floating turrets. It is not yet known how to affect this, though a guess is starting the level on a different frame (as it was discovered while fixing a desync in E1M3).

[p

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"You should also not use the Control Stick on BizHawk's Virtual Pad, as this may cause desyncs as well. Use the UDLR keyboard shortcuts instead.

[p 
	"There is an invisible box blocking a door until its "opening" animation has finished. In other words, the visible door has no collision; instead the collidable box despawns after the door fully opens. While you're waiting to proceed, you can shoot enemies in the previous room or align yourself better to enter the door.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"For other paths that are blocked by an invisible box, like the Daikatana chamber bridge in E1M4, you must press the necessary buttons to get rid of the invisible box. If it would save time, you can also attempt a

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"There are two types of cutscenes: the ones outside of levels that can be skipped with A, and ingame ones that cannot be skipped. The often long length of the latter kind necessitates any method possible to avoid activating the cutscene.

[p 
	"Once the 
	[a class=intlink href=/GameResources/N64/Daikatana#WeaponBoost 
		"Side Winder

	" is obtained or the Speed stat is high enough (values shown below), many cutscene triggers can be simply jumped over, being about 20 pixels wide. Some cutscenes, though, must be played in order to unlock the next path (E2M1 Charon's boat) or start a boss battle (E3M4 boss).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In many cases, a cutscene will start with Hiro slowly turning to look at an object. You can save time by turning to face that direction before entering the cutscene. In addition, you can optimize Hiro's position to shorten the time it takes him to face the second object (and third, and so on).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Sometimes you can skip the first of two cutscene triggers and activate the second with no consequences. This works for the E3M4 boss (though you still need all pieces of the Purifier sword to activate the second).
