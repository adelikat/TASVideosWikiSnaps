If done properly, Link will block the attack just as he is about to finish the roll (and while he's still invincible) and that will retain the "picking up" action, and so the speed at which he is knocked back by the attack will remain constant as long as he has his shield raised.

	$LF
	"This technique is an extension of using superslides. The application of the trick is to make Link turn in a new direction and continue to slide backwards at a slightly slower speed, because normal superslides are locked in their direction. In previous cases, in order to start going in a different direction, a superslide would need to be manually stopped, and a new one started. This trick prevents the need for stopping.
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		"When supersliding, you need to hold Z and R to start; once sliding, you need only hold R (to keep the shield out.) If you let go of R, Link will stop sliding. However, by holding the analog stick at a slight tilt downwards, and either to the left or right, Link will start sliding around in circles. After a while, Link will stop.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"At any point when Link is sliding in circles, you can start to hold Z; this will cause Link to stop spinning and start sliding backwards in a straight line, just like a superslide. As with a superslide, holding Z will keep Link going backwards. This speed is slower than a normal superslide, but still faster than backwalking or sidehopping.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"If you still have the analog at a down tilt, if you let go of Z, you will start spinning in circles again. You can change the tilt to spin either left or right. When you start spinning in circles again, you can press and hold Z again to start sliding backwards in another new direction.

	") while stabbing with 
	[b 
		"B

[h3 id=AirWarp 
	" Air Warp
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"While supersliding its possible to warp above or below ground. To do this Link needs to superslide off something thats already preloaded e.g. A bush or a bombflower. Link then needs something else that can damage him, such as an enemy or explosion, but its important that the object Link superslides off does not break or get destroyed. Once the superslide is activated if Link stops superslidng on the same level then he'll warp back to the object he just superslided off of. If his Z-axis is above the object then he'll warp to the object but his Z-axis will not change, if he does this below the object then he'll fall through the ground, either falling into the void or into invisible water.

[p 
	"This technique allows Link to "jump" from a standing position.  It can be used to reach ledges that are normally unreachable.  For this trick, Link must have a shield and have access to Bombs or "Goron Special Crop" (Bomb Flowers).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"To initiate the ground jump, Link must find something which he can grab, the grab icon will confirm this. To prepare a ground jump you can either equip Links sword Hold 
	[b 
		"Z+R
	]b
	" and press

	[b 
		"Z+R
	]b
	" Link needs to be pushed away from the item that he was trying to grab, its ususally done by an enemy or explosion pushing Link away from the object. The easiest way to perform the trick is on a bomb because the object disappears meaning Link can't pick it up. Once the glitch is pulled off all the C buttons are locked as well as the 
	[b 
		"B
	]b
	" button, anything that would force the grab icon to change will cancel out the glitch such as jumping or going into a water environment. To cancel it you can backflip or sidehop, although both cause Link to jump up vertically slightly and reach ledges that were just out of reach beforehand. It should also be noted that it allows certain cutscenes and texts to be skipped, this is becuase all ground triggers can be avoided, but many places have cutscene borders that stretch infinitely upwards and downwards mainly because it was easier to program. 
	$LF
]p

]p
[p 
	"To perform this trick, Link must equip and pull out a Bomb or Bombchu.  If using a Bomb, it is required that Link should let the fuse run until the Bomb is about to explode.  Once this has been done, Link need only initiate his jump, followed by releasing the explosive in mid-air by holding 
	[b

This generally happens too quickly to notice during standard play, since the games ejection routine corrects this in order for Link to climb normally. However, this can be abused if Link can take damage from an enemy or an explosion the moment he latches onto a wall he will subsequently be pushed through a wall.

	"This technique makes Link's sword (or the Deku Stick) active without the need to swing it. It requires a shield, and something Link can interact with (this includes anything that brings up a text box, such as Navi's advice and sign posts, as well as bombs, bushes, rocks, jars and treasure chests).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"To do this trick, Link must be within interacting range of the aforementioned objects.  While crouching (hold 
	[b 
		"R
	]b
	"), Link must stab and then interrupt the attack with an interaction by pressing 
	[b 
		"A
	]b
	".  If done correctly, Link's sword will let off a subtle glow, as if Link were constantly swinging it.  This keeps Link's sword drawn out in a constant attack state, so anything that collides with the sword will take damage.  This state can be canceled by swinging the sword again with 
	[b 
		"B
	]b
	"(which resets the attack state of the sword), raising the shield without holding

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"To do this technique, you must first activate the Endless Sword Glitch.  Once in this mode, Link can not fall.  Link can regain the ability to suffer from gravity if he performs a back flip to completion, but this can be checked by blocking a Bomb explosion in mid-flip.  If Link blocks an explosion in mid-air, he will enter a blocking stance, which negates the effects of back flipping.  Therefore, Link can abuse this to constantly gain height from back flips without falling to the ground.  Note that completing a full back flip will cause Link to lose his Endless Sword state, thus making him impervious to Bomb Hovering.

	"This technique grants access to the Gerudo Fortress as Young Link.  There are two distinct methods for achieving this goal.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The first method for this sequence break involves the Cucco found in the Gerudo Valley.  While holding the Cucco, Link must work his way on the one of the wooden bridge supports closest to the Gerudo gate.  While standing on the support, position Link so that he is facing the gate at an angle.  Once prepared, Link must run off of the side of the support.  The supports are just high enough off of the ground that Link will jump off of the edge as if it were a ledge.  This, mixed with the fact that holding a Cucco greatly reduces Link's rate of descent, Link needs to be very close to the top of the gate.  Just before reaching the gate, press 
	[b 
		"B
	]b
	" to make Link drop the Cucco and perform a midair jump slash.  If done properly, Link should land on top of the gate without being seen.  Link is now able to access the Gerudo Fortress (and the Spirit Temple) so long as he is not seen by the guards on the opposite side of the fence.
	$LF
]p

On the very left part of the quicksand pit, the ground is set at a less harsh angle for Link.  If done correctly, Link will cross over the pit unscathed.

If using Bombchus, leap off of the crate towards the wall, press Z to drop/detonate the Bombchu, and jump slash as soon as you can.  If done properly, the blast will launch Link on to the grassy ledge of the walls.  Link can now back flip up to the very border of the wall, which will allow him to walk along the void until he reaches the Shadow Temple's entrance.  Be careful not to fall off of the wall, or you will have to start over.

	"Normally, when you reach the Shadow Temple, you need Din's Fire to open the entry way.  However, if the entrance door is never loaded, you will not be barred from entering the Shadow Temple.  To skip loading the door, work Link along the wall, but do not drop off at the entrance's staircase.  Instead, side hop from the wall into the void above the staircase.  Link will eventually jump over the whole set of stairs, landing in the entry way whilst taking some damage.  By not traveling down the staircase, the door to the Shadow Temple will not be loaded, and you can now enter the Shadow Temple without the need of Din's Fire.

	"This technique allows Link to enter Lord Jabu Jabu without the necessity of a fish.  There are two ways to do this trick.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The first method requires Link to jump slash off of the fences adjacent to Jabu Jabu.  Link must gain maximum height and distance from his jump, as he must land somewhat on top of Jabu Jabu.  Doing this will cause Link to trigger the entrance script for the dungeon, even though he has not technically entered Jabu Jabu's mouth.  The second technique requires Link to roll in to Jabu Jabu at an angle.  Note that the second technique is very difficult to achieve, as the hitbox for the rolling is very slim compared to the hitbox for jump slashing.

While playing the fishing game Link cannot leave the pond without the man who lended the rod stoping him. He can however be bypassed if Adult Link equips the hover boots, runs into the center of the pond and then casts the rod in mid-air, this tricks the man because Link can run around normally with the rod still being cast.

Simply, on entrance purchase the rod and run to the far right side of the pond, where a small stream appears to run into the pond. There is a collection of rocks that Link can run onto and jump off of. Once Link has performed a jump cast the rod before he lands. If done correctly Link can run around the pond with the rod cast.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"To perform this exploit, Link must first enter the room in which the switch is located.  Link must then make the Bottle his active item, which means that he must release and recapture his fish.  Once the Bottle is in Link's hands, have Link backflip on to the target switch.  Before Link completes his flip, activate the Bottle again.  As soon as Link lands, he will place the fish on the switch.  The game will read the occurrence as one object landing on the switch, even though two separate objects have landed.  If Link moves away from the switch, it will still assume that it is being weighed down by Link, as it still reads an object on the switch.  This allows Link to employ the switch without needing to use actual objects to weight it down.  Keep in mind that the fish will not keep the switch held for long, and so this trick will only work with switches that are very close to their effect.

In order to add 18 Link needs to have 18 of something on C-right, this is normally done with deku nuts. Go back in time and turn into Young Link and imeadiatley go forward in time again.

Which section depends on what item you have on c-right. So, if you have a broken sword on c-right (broken sword is linked to medallions, Minuet&Bolero), it will actually write the value of 29 onto your medallions/songs binary slot. 29 in binary is 0001 1101. If you look at the charts below, you'll see that this will end up giving you the Forest, Water, Spirit and Shadow medallion.
