]h3
[p 
	"Discovered by tmont. The key to this glitch is that the game has a separate state that tracks what level you can charge to and this state only updates on unpausing. In order to execute this glitch, you need to have at least one sword you can charge to level 2. Equip that sword and ball (or some other configuration that lets you charge to level 2 or 3). Hit select to bring up the menu again and switch to a sword for which you don't have the ball, but keep the menu up. Now save your game. Hit reset and load the game you just saved.

Another problem is that bringing up the menu again will cancel out the glitch. But this is still useful enough to skipping the big bug fight for the ball of fire. The ball of water can't be skipped because getting it is a necessary plot trigger. Skipping the ball of thunder is possible but requires a completely impractical route.

Since you get pushed backwards relative to the direction you are facing and you can move on top of them, it is possible to go through them gradually. Approach the NPC from the east and move diagonally southwest. The hero faces south, so after talking with them, he gets pushed north. Continue moving southwest and the overall effect will be to move west and eventually pushed north past the guard.

However, the mountain side block can be skipped. There are actually two hitboxes with a gap between them big enough for the hero to walk through. So it is not necessary to trigger the Leaf kidnapping by walking over a trigger block in Zebu's cave (Blowing up the wall or talk to Zebu is not necessary).

In particular, when moving diagonally over normal terrain, step size alternates between 1 pixel and two pixels in each direction every frame. A manhattan step on normal terrain is always 2 pixels. So very often it is possible to get through an area faster by alternating between manhattan and diagonal steps every other frame.

	$LF
	[a id=heading-8255

]h3
[p 
	"When duelling with Stom, your hits push you both up and his hits push you down. The number of hits needed to move depends on the value of counter. This counter increments when Stom beats you, making subsequent fights easier. The pattern of Stom's attacks is based on the $000E RNG seed. However, regardless of the setup you cannot win by button-mashing until the third fight.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The duel can be won on the first try if a bit of finesse is used. The trick is easy to see when hitboxes are displayed. Your sword is much fatter than Stom's, so you just need to sidestep Stom's attack and counter with your own. This is difficult unassisted because there is some randomness in his attack pattern and only a 2-pixel margin for the position to stand and counter. But it is possible.

[p 
	"The barrier spell produces a barrier around your hero. Projectiles that hit this barrier are vaporized. If a projectile hits the hero and the barrier on the same frame, the hero takes damage. If you activate the barrier by pressing A for one frame, it appears for 8 frames. It can't be reactivated until it has been down for a frame. Even if you hold the A button, the barrier flickers off every 8th frame. This can be a problem for fast-moving projectiles, particularly coming from north or south of the hero where the barrier isn't as thick. In particular, this needs to be considered during the big dragon fight because the laser beams move fast enough to break through this one-frame gap. It is possible to get around this by changing position or making sure not to be in the direct path of the laser during the flicker.

[p 
	"Each enemy has a different movement method. Most enemies meander towards you, adjusting every so often. But some enemies move completely randomly based on this mechanism. On spawning or picking a new direction, they grab two random numbers. One is used to determine direction and the other how long they move in that direction. Examples include the waterfall cave medusas and the floating eyes on Mt Hydra. Enemies that move like this are always moving offscreen, but slower than when onscreen (most enemies don't move offscreen). So these enemies are continuing to grab more random numbers while offscreen, affecting luck on everything else.

[p 
	"Emperor Draygon's human form is different from other enemies. There is no invincibility period after he takes damage. In the second battle this is the same as is his behavior. But on each frame the game tops his HP back up to 255. So although the hits register, he will never die. In fact, since damage is a single byte and enemies with 0 hp are still alive (the game looks for an underflow when it subtracts damage from current hp) he can't be killed with one hit. So he is effectively invincible. But if he could be killed then the big dragon fight would be skipped and the bow of truth would not be needed.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The big dragon form moves back and forth and grabs a random number every 16 frames. On certain values it will do an action. The action is determined by the high nibble of the $0008 global counter value. Normally the laser attack that makes him vulnerable will not be chosen. But if the hero takes damage he behaves differently. When the high nibble is 8-F he will use his bouncy ball attack and when the high nibble is 0-7 he will use lasers. This laser attack does not last as long as the non-damage version; it is not possible to finish him with stabs. Luckily, his behavior does not revert after one laser attack and it is possible that he will use another after moving a bit.

When this is done DYNA does not fire the crescent shot as a counterattack. DYNA's attack sequence is based on the counter. When the counter underflows DYNA stops using its spread shots and fires its laser. The laser is much less laggy though waiting for it may not be practical. Also, it can be less laggy to avoid using barrier and simply stand in a blind spot where shots go right by.

	"Bringing up the menu can cut lag. For example, hitting select during an explosion clears out the explosion sprites and so it can cut the explosion lag quite a bit. Useful when destroying walls or after bosses because this is often a time when something is needed in the menu.

	"It is often possible to cut lag by slowing down. That is, wait a frame instead of taking a lag. In the short term this takes the same time but it may benefit overall time if there is some event ahead where you would need to wait anyway. In some cases when there are many enemies around it can be best to just move on quickly; getting them offscreen sooner will cut more lag than waiting.
