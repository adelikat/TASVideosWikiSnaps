Hitting a ceiling adds 32 Subpixels to Grant's position, even if he's already right next to a wall. Doing this often enough will add a full pixel, allowing Grant to enter the wall at the corner between the ceiling and the wall. Depending on the position of him and the blocks around him, jumping immediately zips Grant upwards a block. Alternatively, Grant will be able to crawl around in the walls. Subpixels have to be aligned carefully when approaching the wall, as to minimize the amount of jumps this trick will need.
