	"Typically if the two brothers do a flying knee at the same time they will either fly in opposite directions, or one will always hit the other first.  Under certain circumstances they can hit each other and fly in the same direction.  This possibility opens up a lot of possible shortcuts.

	"To get this to work the brothers must be moving in the same direction.  They also must be at the same height (on 3D floors).  In addition RAM addresses 0x0489 and 0x048C must be low values.  If they are high, the trick does not work.  These values increase each time the brothers do damage to each other.  The flying knee does the most to increase it.  Therefore, the double flying knee glitch can not be done twice in a row.
