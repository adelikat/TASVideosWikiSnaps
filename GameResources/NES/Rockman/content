	$LF
	"However, the check that prevents doing so, is done very simply: It only checks
	$LF

[ul

	".
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Here's the technical explanation of the trick as it was
	$LF
	"used in the tool-assisted movie.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When a boss battle begins, there are only three ways to end it:
	$LF

		" Kill the boss

	"When the Cutman battle is entered, and subsequently escaped,
	$LF
	"the battle does not end. It goes on. Cutman is still alive.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Momentarily after escaping the room, Cutman throws a scissor.
	$LF
	"However, because Cutman is no longer visible, the scissor does not appear. Cutman thinks he has a scissor, but there is no scissor.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This is when things go awry. You see, as long as Cutman thinks he has a scissor, he will use some kind of telekinesis to manipulate the scissor back to his hand (for catching). In other words, the game adjusts the scissor's position every frame to make it meet Cutman's hand.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The method it does that, is that it first looks up the object table, searching for a scissor type object. Then it alter the properties of the found object (the sprite number, and the Y coordinate).
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"It does the lookup using a common function in the game code.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"However, Cutman is so certain that a scissor exists, so the return value of the function is not checked. So when a scissor doesn't really exist, it writes into a random memory address instead. (The actual value returned in an error case is the number of alive objects.) This memory address happens to coincide mostly with Rockman's data. The rest is pretty obvious.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"The glitching stops when the Clone robot fight begins, because at that point, the previous boss fight is over and Cutman with his magic scissor powers exists no more.
	$LF
	"However, Megaman maintains a weird pose for a few frames, because his object properties (mainly, an action delay counter) were messed up.
