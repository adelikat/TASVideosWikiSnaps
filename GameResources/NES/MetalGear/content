	"When continuing the game from a password or from dying, there are 6 fixed positions where Solid Snake will start.  4 of them are based on rank, 2 are event driven and override the rank positions:
	$LF
	"Rank 1 is at the jungle at the beginning of the game.
	$LF
	"Rank 2 is at the south entrance in building 1.
	$LF
	"Rank 3 is inside the eastern elevator room of building 1 at floor 1.
	$LF
	"Rank 4 is outside of building 1's northern entrance.
	$LF
	"Being Captured is in the cell next to Grey Fox.  This is in place until card 3 is obtained.
	$LF
	"Destroying the Supercomputer is at the electric floor room before the Supercomputer with the countdown timer running.

	"There are 3 places where deathwarping is useful to save time:
	$LF
	"Deathwarp 1 is done right after getting rank 3 in floor 2 of building 1.  In order to do this, Grey Fox needs to be rescued.
	$LF
	"Deathwarp 2 is done on the rooftop of building 1.
	$LF
	"Deathwarp 3 is done after Coward Duck.  Rank is reduced intentionally to 2 because that position is faster.

	"In order to obtain the rocket launcher, Solid Snake must be rank 4.  A rank-up occurs every 5 prisoners rescued, so a total of 15 must be rescued.  There are 16 prisoners available before the rocket launcher, so 1 prisoner can be skipped.  There are only 3 prisoners that have a detour of more than 25 seconds:
	$LF
	"MISSING OUR "GREY FOX" has a detour of 2574 frames
	$LF
	"Twin Shot's prisoner (B1 rooftop) has a detour of 2463* frames.  *It is 2495 but this route does not have a 32 frame delay to take damage.
	$LF
	"The prisoner in floor 1 of building 2 (near the deep water) has a detour of 2458 frames.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"As mentioned in the deathwarp section, rescuing Grey Fox is done for the extra death warp.  The other 2 prisoners are extremely close in timing.  The TAS should skip Twin Shot's prisoner, but a speedrun should get that prisoner because it is difficult to take damage like the TAS.
