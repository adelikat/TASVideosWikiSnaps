		"Jumping when shooting
	]dt
	[dd 
		" Just like Death hopping, you can jump while shooting or while charging a shot, allowing you to mantain a lot of your momemtum and saving significant amounts of time.

		"Jumping while tired
	]dt
	[dd 
		" Q Boy gets tired after his power meter runs out. If you want to keep moving while this happens you have to do the same thing as death hopping, only your movement is a little bit more stricted.

		"Float Jump Management
	]dt
	[dd 
		" This is a rather unique mechanic in Q Boy. Use this to jump from higher distances and more wide areas. Calculating when to use this move is key.

[dl 
	[dt 
		"Damage Management
	]dt
	[dd 
		" Taking damage is an useful way for an inmediate refill in Q Boy's power bar, it also saves time when getting tired. But you can only get hit 3 times, unless you get a heart.
		$LF

]dl
[dl 
	[dt 
		"Jumping Straight
	]dt
	[dd 
		" Ways of jumping straight are either to not hold a direction, or press direction keys simultaneously on frame perfect inputs. This doesn't apply with falling, though.
