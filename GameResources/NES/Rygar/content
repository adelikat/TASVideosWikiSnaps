[div class=p 
	"Whenever you walk off a cliff or ledge you can duck, right before

	"you start to fall.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"It's possible to float through the first non-jumpable cliff you encounter, the one at the very first rope in the game.
	$LF
	"If you aim it exactly right, it's possible to jump and slide through the top

	" Jump through walls

]h3
[div class=p 
	"This is not the same trick as the "Float through a cliff" because this has no usefulness in it. It will just help you to examine the glitched up world of Rygar.
	$LF
	"Any wall with nothing above them can be jumped through. This means that for example, walls in Sagilas cave cannot be jumped through because they have ceiling directly attached to them.
	$LF
	"To perform this odd trick you must simply be near the top of the screen somehow (this is the hard part of it, either by flying up there or to jump on an enemy) and not directly to the wall. A few pixels out of it works fine. When jumping/flying towards the upper edge of the wall you simply should steer Rygar towards it and if you can move through the wall. You'll suddenly be inside the wall or scrolling to another screen (depending on where  you perform it)

[div class=p 
	"Use: To examine the glitched up world of Rygar. For example you can scroll to the left of where the game begins by combining flying + air walk. Or to examine what's inside the big grey granit-block right before the first door to Garloz.

[div class=p 
	"This is a neat little trick that allows you to jump over the river at some places where the shores are close to each other. It only works in the PAL-version though. To do this jump you must have precise timing, the hard part is to know where to  jump from, but every shore has some ground that is walkable even though it doesn't looks like it. When you have found the extreme edge of the shore you wish to jump from it's just to aim for the other side. Sometimes this won't work though but if you hit with your weapon you will gain the extra movement needed and make it over.
