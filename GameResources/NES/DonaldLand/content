	"The stage 3 cutscene also has a small timesave that may go unnoticed for the most part. The cutscene starts Ronald out in a bunch of solid tiles for whatever unknown reason; probably it just didn't matter since the game takes control of ronald anyway. But, we are given 1 frame of freedom at the start, and that allows us to turn left which is just enough to give us that pixel boost zip that is readily apparent when you're inside of terrain. This causes the cutscene to play out just a few frames quicker than normal.

[p 
	"So stage 4 is probably the best place to talk about enemy/apple behaviors. Normally when an apple is stuck to an enemy it will explode killing said enemy and turning it into a dead sprite that somehow exits the stage (usually by falling down). However, ramming Ronald directly into enemies also kills them, and doing this while an apple is already stuck to an enemy will cause the apple to reset it's timer and start flying as if the enemy didn't exist. This seemed useful at first, but the fact that Ronald is still stunlocked while taking damage makes it less useful, even despite the invincibility item we may pick up somewhere around halfway through the stage.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This same affect mentioned above will also happen when certain enemies turn into a completely different enemy. The enemies that converge forming a larger enemy are one example of this, and when they merge and your apple has reached the point where it explodes but not quite before the apple timer is up, it will actually reset that apple while still killing said enemy. Reset apple will then fall down and we can be in position to take advantage of it. Another instance of this happening, though completely non-useful for any valid purposes, is when enemies are bypassed really fast while an apple is stuck to them. If an enemy is despawned by going too far off screen, this will also reset the apple timer, and in general is best avoided because now you can't cast your second apple for a really long time. This generally won't happen in this stage though because of the slow movement speed, but can happen in any of the normal stages. (may want to break this off to another section later since it doesn't apply to stage 4)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Another attribute to the enemy/apple relationship is that if an enemy is killed with apple 1, while apple 2 is later stuck to it and hasn't exploded, then the dead sprite carries the second unexploded apple with it and doesn't reset that apple's timer. This actually has a few uses throughout this stage, because some of the enemies dead sprite patterns actually bring it up into the air quite a bit before descending. Since most enemies are located in a giant mass of burger icons that we want to avoid, killing enemies in this manner drags them up out of said burgers and we can use second apple to get our boost from.

	"Stage 9 is definitely one of those interesting stages that is handled quite differently from the others. Swimming as fast as possible is the fastest base movement for these stages, but that does pose a problem of height, which is generally a case for Donald Land. Fortunately we can ride apples downward to lose that height and also gain a hefty speed boost from them in the meantime (Apple boost 1.625 usually). This requires us to slow down enough for a basic downwards apple toss to be slow enough for immediate swimming to catch up and stick ronald's feet to it. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"But if you toss the second apple immediately after the A press that gets ronald to the first apple, we now have an apple with a much higher boost value (around 2.937), and in fact the first apple will speed us up just enough to get us to the second one. Now that this apple has a really high boost value, generally we just want to stay on it as long as possible before exiting to get the most out of that apple. And if that apple hits the ground before we're able to ride it for a long distance, we can now use another technique to dramatically increase the speed; pressing Down between our swim frames. This preserves the speed between swims for whatever reason.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The screen can wrap around from either side of the screen where the camera is stopped enough for ronald to approach that side. This can be seen by moving to the left side of the screen at the start of stages and tossing an apple to the left, which then wraps around and comes out the right side of the screen. Be careful not to walk too far to the left or the apple will just get lost instead.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"At first this just seemed like a funny little quirk to the game's mechanics, but further inspection showed it could actually be used for the stage 6 boss. Killing the boss from the left side of the screen allows us to get an easy apple boost ending since we're already to the left side of the "gravitational point" that the boss cutscene pulls us to.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There was even a further idea to use this for the stage 5 boss since ronald starts close to the left and the boss starts close to the right. In fact, we can get a first apple attached to the boss much faster this way, and since the boss takes 5 hits, that's the most important hit right? Well, the problem is getting back to the boss after said hit. We do still have to land the second apple before the third, so using the second apple to quickly approach the boss doesn't work. If there were some way of getting back to the boss quickly it could possibly be faster. If I recall, this method was tested and found to be just a few frames slower than the current method used, so it's a close call.
