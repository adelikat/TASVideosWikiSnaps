	"Regular horizontal moving speed is 1.x pixel per frame. x is subpixel value, each subpixel used in the game is 4 256ths of a pixel, and it alters within 1/2 of a pixel each frame you move (it is either less than 0x80, or more). X subpixel rolls each frame you move, even if you are running into a wall. So by adding such wall bumps when possible you can manipulate X subpos to always result in a higher total position.
	$LF

[p 
	"Y subpixel only advances while you are on a rope, or are falling through a screen transition gap. So you can manipulate Y subpixel by grabbing the ropes or jumping into gaps at different time. Sometimes Y subpixel is critical for some collision.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Subpixels get carried between levels, so you want to adjust them after boss fights to be higher. X position resets to a default value on each level start, so you will be farther right even if you moved left enough to have 0x80+ subpos.
