[p 
	"Toad is the only character in SMB2 who runs faster than normal while carrying an enemy or "heavy" items.  Heavy items include mushroom blocks and keys.  Heavy items do not include ripe veggies.  As mentioned above Toad will run at 43 speed instead of 36 (~0.44 pixels per frame faster).  This is quite a significant speed boost and often makes it worth it for Toad to go out of his way to grab an item.

[p 
	"How it's done: While moving towards an enemy, jump and go through the top left or right corner of the enemy.
	$LF
	"You can either jump just before you hit an enemy on the ground that you were running towards, or it can be an enemy in the air or on a platform above you.
	$LF
	"If you timed the jump correctly, the character's feet will pass through the top of the enemy without taking damage, and this will trick the game into thinking that you're standing on the enemy, and it will still think that even after you move farther up.
	$LF
	"Any time before you begin to fall, you can jump again in midair.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If the enemies are positioned correctly, you can even pass through the corner of another enemy during your second jump and jump a third time.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"You can use double jumps to reach high places more quickly.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Even though it'll take longer to get up the steps after taking the shortcut, Birdo always throws his eggs at the same time so it doesn't matter exactly how fast you get there unless you can get there a lot faster and on time to get his previous egg.
	$LF
	"All that matters is how fast you can pick up the last egg, so Toad is slightly faster than Luigi in 1-1.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In 1-2, after getting the key from the jar, move an enemy so that it's just at the edge of the cliff, and use it to double jump over the big pit.  As you make the jump in midair, duck so that you don't hit Phanto.

The trick is to throw a mushroom block that hits the enemy in its head.  This starts the invulnerability timer.  The block then will fall to the ground, bounce, and then snap to floor under the boss.
