	"Whenever the Faxanadude starts moving, his speed is set to 192 subpixels per frame (spx/f) and incremented by 2spx/f to a maximum of 384spx/f.  As long as the Faxanadude continues moving in a horizontal direction without missing a frame, acceleration continues.  Turning around, as long as there is no intermediate non-walking frame, does not kill your acceleration.  Jumping without Wing Boots being active also affords acceleration.  For jumping with Wing Boots to provide acceleration, L or R must be pressed at each frame of the jump.

A few frames later, the weapon is maximally extended and can deal damage.  On the final frame of attacking (where advancing the game causes the uppermost bit of the Player Behaviours to be set to 0), movement is again able to be registered, but it is also possible to activate items (DB) or throw Magic (UB) without starting a new attack.  On the frame immediately following, it is impossible to start a new attack.  On the frame following that, a new attack can be started.

At Aspirant (the title earned at 1000 experience), the Wing Boots, Ointment, and Gloves (and probably Hourglass too) are set to last for 30 seconds.  Each of these timers decrement when the frame counter, modulo 64, is equal to 63.  The pause frame does register other input, the unpause frame does not, so a typical pause pattern might look like: URSA, --, S, URA to continue flying to the right.

	"Lord Tom discovered a way to partially jump down a ladder.  To make this work, you need at least a one-pixel ceiling above the Faxanadude.  Then jump (toward the ladder you wish to fall through).  Done correctly, you will notice that falling acceleration is applied to the Faxanadude even though rising acceleration was not, and on the last frame of acceleration, the Faxanadude will fall eight pixels further into the floor.

	"Enemies will push the Faxanadude in the direction they are facing when they hit the Faxanadude (or, when the Faxanadude hits them).  The Faxanadude is shoved away at a rate of eight pixels per frame for three frames, and is given sixty frames of invincibility.  These sixty frames cannot be extended through pausing.  By hitting an enemy with a Weapon or a Magic on the same frame as the enemy collides with the Faxanadude, the enemy will be turned in the direction it was hit and Faxanadude will be sent in that direction as well.  As with all other methods of stopping, the Faxanadude's movement speed will be reduced to its lowest value, 192 spx/f.
