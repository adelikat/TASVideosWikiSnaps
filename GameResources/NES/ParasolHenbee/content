		" You can clip into solid ledges by starting your dash on an awkward frame cycle. Since your dash alternates between 1 pixel and 2 pixels per frame, you can sometimes trick the game to starting your dash with a 2 pixel advancement. This causes you to be on a different x position cycle. Gaining 2 pixels the exact frame you contact a solid ledge will put you inside it briefly and if you are close to the top it will throw you up there instead. Useful for making otherwise impossible jumps.
