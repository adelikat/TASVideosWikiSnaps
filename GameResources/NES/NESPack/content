[p 
	"NES-Pack is a game for the Nintendo Entertainment System created in 2016 by Wout van Poppel (
	(__wikiLink|user:Mothrayas)
	"), a staff member at TASVideos. The game is quite similar to the otherwise unique 1993 classic DOS-game 
	(__wikiLink|GameResources/DOS/Jetpack|Jetpack)
	".

[p 
	"The objective in NES-Pack is to navigate several maze-like levels collecting all the gems that appear in each, and then heading to the completion point. The player can collect power-ups in the form of fuel which grants our hero the ability to fly and also move faster. Hindering the player are gaps and obstacles that need to be jumped or flown over, barriers that can appear or disappear, and enemies that are also capable of flight themselves.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"NES-Pack is quite easy to learn, but requires practice to play well. The levels combine aspects of mazes and classic platformers, requiring users to plan routes, conserve fuel, and navigate each level around enemies and other obstacles. Beginners can usually figure out how to complete the harder levels in a couple of minutes, but true masters are generally able to beat each level in under 20 seconds. The game keeps track of best times in each level as well as cumulative time, so players can keep track of how well they honed their abilities and compete with their friends.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"At this stage, a demo version of the game has been released with 8 levels to choose from, ranging from the simplistic introduction game-play concepts, to the tricky to master. This version is released as a preview of what the game will offer in the future, covering all the game's mechanics, if not all the levels. Players can review it for fun and get a feel for what play will be like in the final version. Even at this stage, some competition has been ongoing by the TASVideos members trying to achieve the best scores in each level in different play categories. A more complete version of the game with many new levels to choose from is planned with a release date coinciding with a future speed TAS competition.
