	"These are various stategies discovered for the opponent Don Flamenco 1.  While some of these strats maybe doable in real time, these demo movies are Tool-assisted and demonstrate the strat in a frame perfect manner.  These times present the fastest possible time that can be obtained with these particular strats.

Phase 1 is left body blow to force an uppercut, dodge, jab, left gut which he blocks, then jab which he will block but will stop the clock.  Then get a late punch for a star and use the star.  Phase 2 is identical to the No CS strat.

	") came up with only a few years after the game was released.  It gets a sub 30 time without having to time a late punch (which only has a 1 frame window of opportunity).  You continuously use the easy CS trick to keep the clock stopped as much as possible.  Each series of rapid punches should be 6 punches long.
