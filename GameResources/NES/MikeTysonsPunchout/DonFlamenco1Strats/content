	"These are various stategies discovered for the opponent Don Flamenco 1.  While some of these strats maybe doable in real time, these demo movies are Tool-assisted and demonstrate the strat in a frame perfect manner.  These times present the fastest possible time that can be obtained with these particular strats.

	"This is strat used in the published TAS.  It does not use the clock stopping glitch.  Phase 1 is simple, left body blow to force him to hook, dodge, late punch for a star, use star.  In phase 2, get a well timed counter punch that allows for immediate rapid punches.

	"This strat takes advantage of the "easy CS" glitch that is possible on Don & Joe.  Phase 1 is left body blow to force an uppercut, dodge, jab, left gut which he blocks, then jab which he will block but will stop the clock.  Then get a late punch for a star and use the star.  Phase 2 is identical to the No CS strat.
