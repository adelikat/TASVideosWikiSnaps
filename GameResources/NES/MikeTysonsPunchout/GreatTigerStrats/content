	"These are various stategies discovered for the opponent Great Tiger.  While some of these strats maybe doable in real time, these demo movies are Tool-assisted and demonstrate the strat in a frame perfect manner.  These times present the fastest possible time that can be obtained with these particular strats.

	"This strat was first developed by Matt Turk in 2004.  Start by jabbing to force him to counter jab then late punch for a star.  Do this 3 times, then unload 2 uppercuts immediately.  Then force another jab and late punch for a star.  Pause briefly and then throw a jab that will intercept Tiger while his ruby is flashing.  Now wait about 3 seconds and deliver an uppercut to intercept his next ruby flash which will knock him down.  On Phase 2 & 3 he will get up on 1 so just uppercut him immediately.

	"This was the first fast Tiger strat that I (
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/adelikat 
		"adelikat

	") came up with to get sub 1:00 on Tiger only a few years after the game was released.  The strategy is simple, do a jab when his ruby blinks then throw an uppercut.  Repeat until he is TKO'ed.  This movie represents the fastest possible use of this strat; acheving a 56.25 time.

	"Start off by waiting until right before his jewel flashes then punch his face, he will block then punch back at you. Dodge his jab and do a very late punch to the face for a star, then right (Very quickly) after that punch his face again for star #2 while his jewel is flashing. Use the two stars and pause for just a split second then punch his face again and hopefully you will hit him while his jewel is flashing for another star, USE IT! Now wait until right before his jewel flashes again and punch, dodge and late punch his face for star #4, then right (very quickly again) after that punch his face for your last star. Now punch, he will block and do a late punch to knock him down! I knocked him down at about 0:42 or so.
