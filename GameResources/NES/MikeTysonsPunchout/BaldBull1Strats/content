	"These are various stategies discovered for the opponent Bald Bull 1.  While some of these strats maybe doable in real time, these demo movies are Tool-assisted and demonstrate the strat in a frame perfect manner.  These times present the fastest possible time that can be obtained with these particular strats.

	"Bald Bull has two possible health amounts when he gets up after the 2nd knockdown.  His energy will either refill to 80 or 72.  The odds of a 72 refill is exactly 25% (4/16).  72 is possible only if the lower nibble of the RNG (0x0018) is 4, 5, C, or D.

	"Between 0:20 and 2:00 of round 1, Bald Bull will be in his "basic" pattern.  He will throw 2 hooks and then either throw a 3rd hook followed by uppercuts OR delay and then go into a 3 jab pattern.  Every strategy depends on him doing one or the other, usually the 3 rolling jab pattern since they can be countered for stars, and uppercuts during the rolling animation will score the maximum 27 damage.  Unfortunately the rolling jabs are the most unlikely.  There is only a 25% (4/16) chance.  He will do rolling jabs if the lower nibble of the RNG (0x0018) is 0-3.
