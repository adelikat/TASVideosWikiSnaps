	"These are various stategies discovered for the opponent Don Flamenco 1.  While some of these strats maybe doable in real time, these demo movies are Tool-assisted and demonstrate the strat in a frame perfect manner.  These times present the fastest possible time that can be obtained with these particular strats.

		"Countering his hooks & jabs always has a random chance of success except on every 5th punch where it is 100%.  On the random ones, success happens when the RNG (0x0018) ends in a 0 but is not 0 (10, 20, 30, 40, etc).  Thus the odds of getting a random star is 1/16 (assuming an equally likely outcome of all 256 possible RNG values)

	"Don gets back up with any of 3 possible energy refills for any phase except phase 3 of round 1 if Mac has not been damaged.  In a speedrun strat, Don can get back up with 80, 72, or 64 health for phase 2, and 80, 72, or 40 in phase 3 if he's been damaged.  This is why the select trick is used in TAS strategies.

		"After a hook, the opponent timer (0x0039) will restart on a certain frame.  It seems, that if on that frame the RNG (0x0018) is less than 8 or ends in a 0, the timer will stay frozen.  So there is a 24/256 chance on that frame and any subsequent frame that the timer will not restart.  While impossible remote, there is a chance that Don 1 could just stand there after his first hook all the way until the 1:30 mark of round 1!
