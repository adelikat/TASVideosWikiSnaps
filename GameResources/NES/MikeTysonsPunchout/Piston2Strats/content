While some of these strats maybe doable in real time, these demo movies are Tool-assisted and demonstrate the strat in a frame perfect manner.  These times present the fastest possible time that can be obtained with these particular strats.

	[a class=intlink href=/GameResources/NES/MikeTysonsPunchout 
		"main MTPO page
	]a
	" for details).  Then comes one of the hardest to time punches in the game.  You must delay slightly and tab+b to deliver a punch to the face.  The punch has a 1 frame window of opportunity in which this punch will land and only if you tab up+b (holding it too long will fail).  This immaculate punch seems to somehow catch Piston precisely as his guard pattern is changing even though there is no visible signs of the change.  It is also hard to time because there is no visual cues as Piston is merely standing there with his guard down.  Once it is delivered, tab up+b again for another face punch that will land a star.  Hold up for just a few frames beyond his recovery point (which is face returns to normal).  Then hold up + start to deliver a star.  His guard must raise during your uppercut for this to work.  If it doesn't, you didn't hold up long enough.  Once it is delivered tab up + b twice to deliver two more punches for stars.  The 2nd punch has a random 50% chance of success, if it fails the strategy will not work.  After these punches, immediately deliver a star uppercut.  Next pause slightly and deliver another uppercut that will intercept is eye brow shake.  The punch must be timed perfectly in order to do the maximum damage (22).  There are many timings that intercept the eye brow pattern but only do 15 damage.  After the uppercut throw 3 jabs to intercept his jabs to knock him down for the first time at 27 seconds.

After the uppercut tab up + b twice to land two face jabs for two stars (again the 2nd star is random).  Now delay for awhile (Piston will shift his feet 5 times) and press start to deliver an uppercut that will intercept his eye brow shake.  Again, it must be timed perfectly to do the full 22 damage.  Throw two more jabs, the first of which will get a star and the 2nd will send him to the canvas at 46 seconds.  You must have 3 stars remaining.
