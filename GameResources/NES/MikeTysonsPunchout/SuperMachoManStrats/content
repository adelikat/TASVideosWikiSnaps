	"These are various strategies discovered for the opponent Super Macho Man.  While some of these strats maybe doable in real time, these demo movies are Tool-assisted and demonstrate the strat in a frame perfect manner.  These times present the fastest possible time that can be obtained with these particular strats.

	"To start the clock stopping glitch requires rapid punches.  Mac can only get rapid punches by countering his Spin or Super Spin punches.  So the clock stopping logic is to get him to do one of these spins as soon as possible!

	"The goal here is to get Macho to start his super spin as soon as possible.  Mach will throw a minimum of 5 punches before he will start this punch.  The idea is to simply throw a punch as he throws a punch so that he stops and blocks the punch (which is faster than letting him throw the punch).  In the TAS strat, one punch is countered with a jab that lands.  With perfect timing this is slightly slower than making him block (for this one punch).  Once he goes into the super spin punch, it much be a small delay as possible.  He will actually have 4 possible timings (due to having to timer countdowns before he throws, each could be a long or short timing).  Manipulate the shortest possible timing then dodge his Spin and counter with a rapid punch followed by a delayed punch to stop the clock.  Then knock him down without restarting the clock to get him down at a time of 0:19 on the clock.
