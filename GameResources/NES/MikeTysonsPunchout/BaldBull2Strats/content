While some of these strats maybe doable in real time, these demo movies are Tool-assisted and demonstrate the strat in a frame perfect manner.  These times present the fastest possible time that can be obtained with these particular strats.

	"This is a technique developed by Matt Turk to get "random" punches to land on Bald Bull and yield stars.  When he goes into his ear rub pattern, do a left punch to his but, then tab up+b to throw a punch to his face.  If you get lucky, the punch will land and Bull will give up a star.  The chance of this trick working is 1/16.
