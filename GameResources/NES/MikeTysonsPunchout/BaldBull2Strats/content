	"These are various strategies discovered for the opponent Bald Bull 2.  While some of these strats maybe doable in real time, these demo movies are Tool-assisted and demonstrate the strat in a frame perfect manner.  These times present the fastest possible time that can be obtained with these particular strats.

	"This is a strategy I came up with in 2005 that could achieve a sub 1:27 time (which was then a world record). The only randomness is having him go into the "ear rub" pattern in phase 2 after the 2nd hook. There is precisely a 25% (1/4) chance of him going into this pattern.

	"The real advantage to this strat is that it twice relies on a failed "bull dozer" technique which could yield random stars.  If one or both of these succeed it transposes into the single or double dozer techniques with drastically lower times.

	"This is a variation of the strategy I came up with in 2005 that could achieve a sub 1:27 time (which was then a world record). The strategy twice attempts the "bull dozer" technique (a trick developed by Matt Turk). Should these fail it still achieves a fast time but should they succeed it can result in even lower times. This video demonstrates a 1:21.97 time resulting from one successful bull dozer technique.

	"This is a technique developed by Matt Turk to get "random" punches to land on Bald Bull and yield stars.  When he goes into his ear rub pattern, do a left punch to his but, then tab up+b to throw a punch to his face.  If you get lucky, the punch will land and Bull will give up a star.  The chance of this trick working is 1/16.
