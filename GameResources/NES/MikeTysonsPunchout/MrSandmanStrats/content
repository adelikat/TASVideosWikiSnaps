	"These are various strategies discovered for the opponent Mr. Sandman.  While some of these strats maybe doable in real time, these demo movies are Tool-assisted and demonstrate the strat in a frame perfect manner.  These times present the fastest possible time that can be obtained with these particular strats.

	" video, zallard1 gets hit on the 6th and the 11th. You can, however, get hit on the 1st, 4th, 6th, 9th or 11th. Remember, however, that you must take 2 hits. In between punches where you take hits, tap Up, dodge his Jab and counter with a right body blow. You want to hit him 9 times for a total of 45 damage. After that, throw a left jab to provoke him into attacking, dodge and counter with a short Nightmare pattern (left jab, delayed right body blow). If you feel it necessary, do a right quick-dodge to buffer into the body blow. Wait for him to punch, duck and do short Nightmares until he has received 85 damage. When that happens, duck his punch, throw a left jab, a left body blow immediately afterward and a left jab for knockdown at 1:15.
