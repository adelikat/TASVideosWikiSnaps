	"These are various stategies discovered for the opponent Piston Honda 1.  While some of these strats maybe doable in real time, these demo movies are Tool-assisted and demonstrate the strat in a frame perfect manner.  These times present the fastest possible time that can be obtained with these particular strats.

It was the first strat to achieve a sub 45 without the use of the random star punches that are demonstrated in the published TAS.
