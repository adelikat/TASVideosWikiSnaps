	"These are various strategies discovered for the opponent Soda Popinski.  While some of these strats maybe doable in real time, these demo movies are Tool-assisted and demonstrate the strat in a frame perfect manner.  These times present the fastest possible time that can be obtained with these particular strats.

	"The idea behind this strat is to exploit Soda's weakness.  If you intercept one of his uppercuts with a body blow, the next star uppercut will instantly knock him down.  The logic of each phase then is the same: get him to attempt an uppercut as soon as possible.

	"All phases start by stopping Soda from throwing his hooks by throwing two left body blows.  He then has one of six random events.  He could either throw more hooks or uppercuts.  And his delay could be fast, medium, or slow.  It must be manipulated so that he throws uppercuts with as small a delay as possible.

	"This TAS strat differs from the Phil & Genisto strat in how it intercepts his uppercut.  They way the game works is that on a certain frame it reads if the user is pressing down, if so, Soda will pause in a crouching position in which he can be punched.  In non-TAS strats, Mac will have to duck, then come out of ducking position, then punch.  In the Phil & Genisto strat, down is press for just 1 frame, which isn't enough to start the ducking animation, so Mac can hit Soda much sooner.  This strat discovered by
