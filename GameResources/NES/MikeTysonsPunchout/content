Using this to his advantage, Mac can start rapidly punching and then do a delayed punch for a star (or, in some cases, the opponent can even block it).  This will cause the clock to stay stopped!  The clock will remain stopped until certain actions are taken.  The exact logic of how/when the clock will continue is described in the "Rules of Engagement" section.

This can be exploited in order to better manipulate the opponent's guard.

For fast strategies, it is important to do things that will cause an opponent to get up on 1.  For instance, knocking down Piston 1 in the first minute without taking damage will cause him to get up on 1.  Knocking down Piston 2 twice in the first minute without taking damage will result in a 1 count.  Knowing what factors can cause a 1 count is critical to fast strategy development.

	"This glitch works due to the manipulation of address $0080.  This address is responsible for determining the height of an opponent.  Normally this value is 10 for Sandman.  When he is punched in the gut, it shrinks to 8.  In the case of a simultaneous hit that knocks Mac down, the value is reduced to 8 because Sandman takes damage, at that point Mac goes down and writing to that address is halted.  Thus it never returns to 8, causing Sandman to shrink when he is restored to his standing pose.  Address $0080 is written to whenever a fight resumes, so the glitch is corrected when Mac gets up and the fight continues.
