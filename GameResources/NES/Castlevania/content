For example, if Simon suffers a blow from his left side, he will be knocked to the right of his former position, first rising up in the air and later falling back down towards the ground. The jump peaks at 14 Y coordinates higher than his original position.

				"The above holds true when Simon is already in the air.  Experienced players can use this to perform a double jump.  Here is an example: Simon jumps right.  While in the  air, Simon is hit by a monster on his left side.  Simon now launches to the right, first rising in the air followed by falling towards the ground.  This can be abused to reach platforms that are out of Simon's normal horizontal jumping range.  The first step is jumping towards a desired platform, hitting an enemy during the jump that causes Simon to get bumped further up and to the left or right.  In many of the Castlevania movies on this site, this trick is used with the bats in stage 2 in order to avoid the scene where Simon must fight or dodge the fishmen.

				"This trick can also be used to ascend to platforms that are exactly 3 "blocks" above a lower platform (example: Stage 4 after climbing stairs, Stage 7 before climbing stairs, stage 12 before Frankenstein's monster, etc).  First, wait or manipulate an enemy to approach a desired platform 3 blocks above the current platform.  Second, time a jump so that Simon is partially inside the platform above him when damage is taken.  Simon's reaction to damage causes him to be launched high enough to pass through the horizontal threshold of the higher platform.  Once a certain height is gained, the game is programmed to push Simon up and through the higher platform instead of falling back down to the first platform.   With practice, this shortcut can be performed quite easily in real time.
