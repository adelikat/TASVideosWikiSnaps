	"The game stores a maximum of three moves per side in memory for take-back purposes. When take back is selected, the game goes back two moves (one from each side) so it doesn't have to switch the current player. However, if there is only one move remaining in memory, the game takes back that one move, and gives the turn to the other player!

It can only move and capture towards the left (towards the a-file for both players) and cannot move from the leftmost file. If a checkmate is delivered with this pawn, the pawn does not take the king and the game is completely frozen.
