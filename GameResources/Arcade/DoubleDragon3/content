	"The arcade game works on a weird lane system where the vertical positions are very fixed compared to the horizontal positions. Alternating something like Up -> Left+Up -> Up will cause the player to move up 3 lanes in 3 frames. This also works with alternating diagonals which helps with some enemy positioning. Double tapping left or right allows for running. Stopping a run by holding another direction causes the player to slow down gradually but kicking will immediately stop them in place.
