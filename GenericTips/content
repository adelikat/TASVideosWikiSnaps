	" Savestate levels and slots
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"You should have one savestate which you use extremely often (termed "quicksave" although any savestate is arguably a quicksave). There should be a 2nd savestate trailing the quicksave that can be used for backup. Other savestates are for replaying your movie and/or resuming recording at some point. You should have at least one savestate around the beginning of the level that you are on.

	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" How do I replay the movie?
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Use the Movie Replay option with Read-Only checked (so the emulator replays the movie rather than record on it). It will replay from the beginning. If you just want to see the level you are working on, load one of the savestates (make sure read-only is on).
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" How do I resume recording at a specific point?
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Replay the movie up to that point, make a savestate, turn off read-only (Shift+8 is default in most emulators), then load the savestate.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This is especially helpful if you decide to change something that occurred before your quicksave, or the run

	" Frame advance
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Frame advance allows you to input controls frame by frame at your pace. Simply hold down all buttons you want inputted, then press frame advance. Frame advance can be held to advance quickly with the same input.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"It is a more precise version of slow motion than fixed-rate slow motion, where the emulator runs at a fixed speed (between 1% and 3%).

	" Controls
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Assign keys so that one hand takes care of directional input (up, down, ...), the other hand common button input (A, B, ...). Assign keys that are rarely used out of the way.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The frame advance button should be close to the hand that is least involved (usually the hand using directional input). The quickload button should be close to the other hand. The quicksave button can be anything as long as it is not easy to press by accident. All other savestate buttons should be out of the way.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Avoid assigning keys to the control keys on your keyboard.

	" How to speedrun tool-assisted
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"You are expected to know the game which you are TASing. You can't make a good TAS without knowing the game. It is highly recommended to play (actually play, not TAS) the game at least once. If there are existing speedruns or TASes, check them out.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The first thing you should do is plan your route. The route can make or break a run. Do many tests for route, as it is important. Check out FAQs (
	[a class=extlink href=http://gamefaqs.com/ rel=nofollow 
		"http://gamefaqs.com

	"When making the TAS, look for shortcuts, even small ones. Optimize your movements, as that may save a lot of time. Find ways to beat bosses faster.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" How much should I optimize?
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"When starting out, you should not look for things like unnoticeable pixel-perfection or other tedious frame optimizations. You should only look for important things. Become accustomed to the character's movement and try to find the quickest way for the character to move and act. Try to find the best way to defeat bosses. As you make the TAS, you gain experience. Don't overdo anything, though.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"You should make a test run first. Try not to spend more than 3 hours of TAS-making per 5 minutes of gameplay on a test run. Don't be sloppy, however. After you make the test run, you may try a second attempt, which is more optimized than the first. You should spend a while on the second attempt, but not forever.

]p
[p 
	"Do not overdo an attempt to pull off a shortcut or improvement. If it seems impossible or unreasonably improbable after testing, move on.

]p
[ul

	[li

]ul
[h4 
	" How about RPGs and luck-based games?
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"RPGs deserve a huge amount of testing and route-planning and often are or become repetitive, so it's usually not recommended for beginners. However, if the game mechanics (specifically the random number generator, often called RNG) work to your favor, and you know how to plan quick routes that have a reasonable chance to succeed, you would do well to try.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Test runs should be based entirely on route and strategy. All long dialogs in a test run should be cleared using the emulator's autofire buttons. Try to work out the game mechanics so you know whether delaying button presses changes whether attacks are critical hits, or misses, or such. Try changing previous button presses if attacks don't change because sometimes the results of attacks are determined further back.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If the RNG hates you (e.g. nothing changes no matter what you do), give up. Not all games are created equal.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Once you have worked out the game mechanics, carefully construct the route through the run. The strategy is often going to change, depending on the circumstances. Try not to be too committal, although that might work sometimes. You may have to create backups and branch the movie to test two different strategies. The important thing is that you know why such strategy can work.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Try to shoot for uncommon or better, but not rare, probabilities. Assuming delaying button presses changes attack results, 1/10 is huge for a TAS. 1/20 is not far off. Generally, the lower the probability, the greater the justification. If you obsess over 1/100, it should be very worthwhile. Probabilities worse than 1/300 shouldn't even be considered, unless you know what you are doing.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Do not overdo an attempt to pull off a strategy. If it seems impossible or unreasonably improbable after testing, alter your strategy and move on if possible.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" What about entertainment?
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Most of the entertainment in most games is derived from speed. However, there may be places where it does not waste time to move around or do something other than standing still. Don't be excessive, however.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Be exact in all actions. Make short jumps, kill enemies quickly, do not miss shots, and do not use more shots on a enemy than necessary.
