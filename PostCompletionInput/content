	"For some games, the length of inputs necessary to guarantee game completion will be achieved is significantly shorter than the length of inputs necessary to actually reach the completion point.  Some examples include: requiring inputs to progress through an epilogue, high score name/initials input, or to simply clear a credits screen to reach some final screen.

[p 
	"For the purposes of speed records, TASVideos allows TASers to stop the movie when the initial ending sequence is guaranteed to begin, without including extra input to process the entire ending. This is only allowed under strict conditions, and movies that have all the necessary input are still preferred for submissions.
