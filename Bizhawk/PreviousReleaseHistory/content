	"* 1.9.1 - r8272

	"* 1.8.4 - r7991 (80% sure, missing traffic in history)
	$LF
	"* 1.8.2/3 - r7871 (hazy; originally I wrote r7885, but I think I went one too far)
	$LF
	"* 1.8.1 - r7740 (positive)
	$LF
	"* 1.8.0 - r7728 (release notes say r7725, but i think it's probably r7727.. anyway, these are missing as usual.,.. r7728 merged back to trunk--i think thats good for the release)

	$LF
	"* 1.5.1 - r4902 (hazy. release notes say r4903 but r4903 merged a hotfix to trunk. i think r4902 merges something from trunk to 1.51 branch, that probably defines 1.5.1. but that tag is missing in svn, so im gonna say r4901
