		" Focus TASing on a specific segment. TAStudio will try to make every frame in the forced zone a greenzone and distributes them if the greenzone capacity is meet. When the forced zone is smaller than the capacity, the rest of the greenzone frames will follow the normal greenzone logic after the forced zone. The forced greenzone will not get deleted, unless the user unsets it. Changing input in the forced zone deletes the greenzones, but the selected forced zone will be still there. This should give the user a better influence on the greenzone. Setting it could be reached by selecting some frames, then rightclick->"Force greenzone", unsetting it rightclick->"Unset all forced greenzones". Currently doable with markers.
