	"The CodeData (CD) Logger primarily tracks information for each byte in the ROM about how it's used by the game program: the most useful distinction is between code and data, but in some cases more fine-grained information is useful. This data is helpful for reverse engineering games, so that automated disassembly tools can produce .db tables for stuff known to be data, and disassemble stuff known to be code. Typically you will want to turn on the CD logger and play through as much of the game as possible, to trigger reading of every level, script, sound, and art, to get the coverage as near to 100% as you can.
