	"Each platform should ideally have 5% of its movies starred. For a platform with only a few published runs, it might be unlikely to have any starred movies, but if it has a couple of published runs, at least one should be considered. If most runs on the platform are mediocre, do not just add stars to a bunch of runs just to reach a 5% quota.

	"Games from major franchises are generally better made than other games, and are also more popular. Because of this, runs which lend themselves best for getting a star are usually from a popular franchise. While it is expected that starred movies will generally consist of many Mario, Mega Man, Sonic, Castlevania, Metroid, and Zelda runs, other games deserve a chance too.
	$LF

[p 
	"Avoid giving more than one or two games of the same franchise a star on a single platform. If a certain franchise is already well represented, and there's another game which has many of the same qualities of a franchise run, strongly consider the other game instead.

	"The starred movies should consist of many different genres, not just platform games. Ensure that there's some puzzles and RPGs on the list as well.

	"No single game deserves to have two different runs starred. Likewise, if two runs for two different games are very similar, star only one of them, and find something else to star. To determine which of two similar runs better deserves a star, choose the one which appears more impossible than the other, and best captivates the audience.

	"There is nothing wrong with a starman having many of their own movies upon the starred list. If a starman really understands what the community wants, and is a skilled player who TASes many popular games, it is expected that he or she will have a few starred runs. However a starman shouldn't rush to star their own movies. A starman should only star thier own movie after some strong third party nominations, or after discussing their movie with other starmen or site administrators.
