					"TAS (tool-assisted superplay)

				" - is the craft of creating superhuman gameplay movies. We aim to play games in the most incredible way they will allow, which means we investigate games as hard as we can, and try to showcase every tiny feature they have inside. Deep investigation and endless experimenting discover things many people could not imagine about the games we TAS. We then use these features to present how the games afford to be played, in all the ways we can invent. The most popular ways are to use the game resources to push the games to their 
				[b 
					"speed
				]b
				" limits (beating them as fast as their engines allow) and to 
				[b 
					"play around
				]b
				" in the funniest manner.

				"Now, we are not going to lie to you, the casual visitor, we have to use specific tools for what we do. We keep 10 savestate slots for all kinds of route testings, we roll back 
				[b 
					"just every
				]b
				" outcome we are not satisfied with. We play frame by frame, exploring all types of behaviour the game provides. We hold a game on an endless pause, observing its internal memory addresses, mulling over the options to act, calculating the potential profit of different variants, applying them to the gameplay, inventing the new and unexpected decisions by insight... It's quite a new form of amusement. Especially if you TAS the game you played in your childhood, you supposed you knew every aspect of it, have snooped every corner of its levels, and now you have an ability to dive into it completely, and not just 
				[b 
					"play it
				]b
				", but 
				[b 
					"play with it
				]b
				". That anxious feeling, which is pretty undescribable.

				"You still think TASing is easy? You think we bot those games? You think we have the tools that beat games instead of us, so that we just control the result? Huh! No tool can create art by itself, it only helps us to "draw" our ideas within the playgrounds, that we consider those games to be. And we also love to work hard! Only the hard work produces the supreme bliss! Enjoy the list of the most delicious mockery we handle every day:
