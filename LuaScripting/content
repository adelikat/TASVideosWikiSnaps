	"In order to integrate Lua, a number of emulator-specific functions were created, which form the emulator-specific Lua API, enabling control of the emulator. However, one is not limited only to emulator-specific Lua functions. Anyone can use any function in the main Lua API, including file I/O. Thus the emulator can be scripted to communicate with, say, text files!
