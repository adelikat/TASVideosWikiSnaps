This might push some to create a TAS for some Japanese games they would not otherwise attempt.

	"Understanding the vocabulary will make understanding the sentence much faster. When first starting out a large portion of time will probably be devoted to simply looking up words.   The more Kanji you learn the more words you will be able to understand or make an educated guess on its meaning.  戦車 has the Kanji for war and car and the word means tank. While the meaning is not exactly the same you can at least see the resemblance.  However there are a few words that seem that the Kanji parts were simply chosen for their reading like 風呂	【ふろ】		(n) bath, (P).  風 is wind, and 呂 for spine so the word definition of bath cannot be understood from its parts.

[div class=p 
	"Katakana is easy to identify mostly since the strokes tend to be more jagged, and abrupt, while Hiragana are more curved.  Katagana is used for loan words from other languages.  In video games it is used commonly for fantastical objects such are monsters, weapons, items, etc. If you are not sure what word the Katakana means, try saying it aloud in a couple different ways.  The Japanese do not have a lot of sounds that English/French/German/Russians have and sometimes the Katakana for the word is a REALLY bad bastardization of the foreign word.  The worst cases I have seen are some French words.  In some hard cases continue with the story until you can see it used more and get more context for it.

Linguists use Revised Hepburn and while it seems superior, I have no idea how I would write out some of these characters on an English keyboard like a "o" with a line on top of it.  Probably why the standard Hepburn is used more widely.  Use the Hepburn version for romanization.

	"Searching via radicals is typically the best way of finding unknown Kanji.  Radicals are pieces that make up Kanji.  Radicals should not be considered to have meaning.  Kanji that have meaning that are included in other Kanji are a far better measure for determining meaning. There are some bizarre Kanji that are simply extremely difficult to find using this method.  Common sense rules do not seem to apply.  But those are the exception.  Linking lots of potential sites to search for these since, some may or may not display right, and this will be  the most important tool to identify Kanji.

You see it usually with white blonde USA women or with black USA citizens in Japan or even "half Japanese", because, well, you know.  Both of these types are almost always denoted speaking with broken Japanese with lots of broken English in it.  In any case these tropes have no language they are actually fluent in.  In the case of the black guy (99% a black dude), they sometimes have some sort of rap angle or something like it.   Some words may be in actual English characters.
