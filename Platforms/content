	"The Virtual Boy (バーチャルボーイ Bācharu Bōi) is a video game console developed and manufactured by Nintendo. It was the first video game console that was supposed to be capable of displaying "true 3D graphics" out of the box. Whereas most video games use monocular cues to achieve the illusion of three dimensions on a two-dimensional screen, the Virtual Boy creates an illusion of depth through the effect known as parallax. In a manner similar to using a head-mounted display, the user looks into an eyepiece made of neoprene on the front of the machine, and then an eyeglass-style projector allows viewing of the monochromatic (in this case, red) image.

The Nintendo DS also features a built-in microphone and supports wireless standards, allowing players to interact with each other within a short range, or online with the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service.

	"The PlayStation (プレイステーション), officially abbreviated as PS and unofficially as the PSX or PS1, is a 32-bit fifth-generation video game console, first released by Sony Computer Entertainment in Japan on December 3, 1994. The PlayStation was the first of the PlayStation series of home and handheld consoles. In 2000, a re-designed, "slim" version was released, called the PSone, which replaced the original grey console. The new name was intended to avoid confusion with its successor, the newly-released PlayStation 2.
