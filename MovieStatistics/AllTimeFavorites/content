	"This list attempts to sort movies by download rate, compensating for publication time. As time passes, download rates get smaller, and this formula compensates for this, in practice taking time out of the equation. The formula is: 
	[tt 
		"Ratio=downloads/days^0.4
	]tt
	". (This formula was developed by studying the behaviour of download ratios over time.) Only currently published movies which are over a week old are included in this list.
