]h3
[div class=p 
	"TASVideos (formerly Nesvideos) was born from the need to provide good-quality multimedia files of tool-assisted speedruns. We take quality very seriously, and strive to produce files that are pleasant to watch and that are as small as possible.
	$LF
	"We also stress the informative value of the movies, and thus we have a few guidelines, that are mandatory reading for anyone who wants to make MP4 files to be published on this site.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"As set out in our 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=introduction page|href=/WelcomeToTASVideos)
	" and 
	[a class=intlink href=/MovieRules#GamesMustBeReal 
		"parts of the Movie Rules
	]a
	", our runs are intended to appear as though they could be played on the original hardware (if not 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=actually capable of being played back on the original hardware|href=/ConsoleVerification/Movies)
	"). Thus, one core guideline for our encodes is to 
	[b 
		"appear, as closely as possible, as though the run was played on the original hardware
	]b
	".
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The other and possibly more fundamental core guideline here is 
	[b 
		"annoy the viewer the least
	]b
	".  This implies the following constraints, between which we aim for the best possible compromise:
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		" Quality: The video should look and sound as close to the pre-encoding input (i.e. raw emulator output) as possible.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Size: The video file should be as small as possible; this is enforced with per-platform ratio limits, as described below.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[div class=p 
	"There are two additional key points that our videos must adhere to:
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		" The video content must label the movie as tool-assisted so as to prevent the misconception that it is an unassisted speedrun (a significant amount of controversy has arisen over such misconceptions in the past). Normally, this also includes a pointer to the TASVideos website because it is currently the most reliable source of TAS-related information in the Internet.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" The video content must label the player by name and the TASVideos website as the source. This information should be presented in such a fashion that it cannot be removed from the movie without extraordinary effort; this mostly means that labeling in the form of metadata or "soft subs" is not sufficient, and "hard subs" must be used.

	" Emulation settings
	$LF
]h3
[div class=p 
	"In keeping with the "as close as possible to hardware output" principle, settings that cause video or audio to deviate significantly from an actual console's output (as compared to not using the settings) should not be used. Examples of these settings include FCEUX's "allow more than 8 sprites per scanline" or Gens's "PSG High Quality".
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"These requirements are relaxed significantly when dealing with 3D games, especially on emulators that cannot accurately replicate the original console's output (example: Dolphin). In these cases, it is permitted to use anti-aliasing, anisotropic filtering, and other texture filtering settings, even if they are not available on the original console.

	$LF
	"our emulators normally provide this functionality natively.  Most screen recorders

	"and other external program (such as Camtasia or Fraps) are not acceptable because
	$LF
	"they do not know when the contents of the emulator window change and hence cannot
