	"History: The first official award ceremony. Previously, 
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/Nach 
		"Nach
	]a
	" had set up his own informal poll for awarding TASes. This ceremony borrows a few ideas from Nach's poll and formalizes the process. Instead of making a few separate categories, then dividing them up by system, which is what Nach did and it lead to a very large list of categories, the community decided to have one award for each system, then have a few special categories focusing on specific aspects of a good TAS. The selection started with a nomination process, and then went on to voting. Though there were still a few problems to iron out, the award ceremony was overall considered a success. Thus was started an annual tradition here at TASVideos.

It had been over two years since the last Super Mario Bros. movie, and the game had been frame warred to death at that point as well. Many people didn't think improving the run would be possible.

	"History: The SNES category had a lot of high profile and highly rated movies, pulling heavily from Mega Man, Metroid, and Mario franchises. Many of these movies were also seriously considered for the star run category when the system was revamped. Two movies in particular got a lot of support, both through votes and on the forums: 
	[a class=intlink href=/817M 
		""All items" Super Metroid

		"Sonic 3 and Knuckles

		"Gunstar Heroes

	" and

		"Link's Awakening

River City Ransom was a run dedicated to playing with the game, completely ignoring speed as an objective. Journey to Silius also got a lot of support from the people explaining their votes, though it didn't do that well in the final standings. River City Ransom won this category for the sheer insanity of its antics.
