	"There were a large amount of viewers who thought what was done for these runs was simply unlocking existing features heretofore unknown in games, or else playing some kind of hacked version, probably more explanation was needed at the end of each run to clarify what viewers just saw. Many viewers also expressed sentiments that R.O.B. (TASBot) was some kind of artificial intelligence, and did not understand that it is simply a replay bot, or a bot which receives instructions online. Perhaps an overall explanation at the beginning and end of the block as to what TASBot is (and isn't) would help.

Many were also worn out from the block and went to bed immediately thereafter (or towards the end of it). Despite this, the site had a huge increase in activity during and surrounding the block.

During the surrounding hours, the site received 219,863 hits, which is roughly four times the amount of similar time frames. A typical day, has ~150,000 hits, whereas the day surrounding the event generated 646,529 hits. It was also a stroke of genius to display an unexplained QR code for viewers to figure out on their own at the end of the Brain Age run, as it led more people to the site in the hunt of a 
	[em 
		"surprise
	]em
	" of some kind. Contrasting to just displaying the site's URL on the screen, which would probably be ignored by nearly everyone, this worked out well.

Despite the large increase in hits, from the server's perspective, the increase was minimal, and did not lead to any noticeable performance penalties in the slightest. This contrasts with previous years were the site was either down for a while or somewhat unresponsive and sluggish. With these changes now in place, we appear to be ready for handling significantly increased loads.
