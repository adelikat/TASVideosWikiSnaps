The gang goes out on a simple mission at first to rescue a kitten, but is then revealed to be a trick by "Fat Cat" to capture Gadget and make her work for him.  Now the rescue rangers have to rescue their companion in an unexpected twist in fate. This run illustrates very well the advantage of using two-player mode, which

				". It was only released in Japan and Scandinavian countries, but eventually achieved something of a cult status thanks to its refined gameplay, as well as exceptional music and graphic design. The plot follows a green toy on a quest to rescue a little girl from the clutch of other toys, who were rightfully upset at her forsaking them in favor of our protagonist. What these other toys can't do, however, is conjure stars to use them both as projectiles and very effective transportation devices!
