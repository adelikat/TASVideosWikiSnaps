		"Reverse engineering
	]a
	" is the process of discovering the technological principles of a device, object, or system through analysis of its structure, function, and operation. It often involves taking something (a mechanical device, electronic component, computer program, or biological, chemical, or organic matter) apart and analyzing its workings in detail to be used in maintenance, or to try to make a new device or program that does the same thing without using or simply duplicating (without understanding) the original.

	"In good old days, TASing was messing around with a game and trying to play it as has not been seen yet. It worked, because it was generally new. But as new people were getting involved, new games were being TASed, old runs were getting obsoleted constantly, the community ended up with a standard of TASing that was greatly superior over the former one. It was a natural process due to two main aspects:
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		" Level of optimization was constantly upgrading, new tricks were being found and used, old ones were being optimized.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" It was getting harder to keep the viewer entertained, because he has already seen much stuff during years, so TASers had to come up with innovative ideas to improve entertainment.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[div class=p 
	"Now, to make a run that is consistent with the modern TAS standards, one would need to apply the most advanced methods to the game he TASes. Which is, figuring out exactly how the game internally works, and using that knowledge directly during TAS creation.
	$LF

	"Zero Page is addresses from $0000 to $00FF. Games use it for temporary variables that change very often or for ones that need the fastest access to; it is usual that addresses from Zero Page proceed different unrelated variables from the main memory. So these addresses, even though they can contain some important variables you can already use stably, in most cases are still unreliable. You would need to find the original addresses that represent real states of the game RAM and don't get filled with unrelated values.

	"This term is pretty self-descriptive. All units in the game that interact with each other and with the environment are conventionally called objects.

And if you fill in the addresses that account for each object's attribute respectively, you will see the system.
	$LF

	"You will need to figure out, what is columns and what is rows. Some games have object slots as columns and attributes as rows. Others host all attributes right after declaring an ID, making slots rows and attributes columns.

In most cases the breakpoint will be hit only once in a certain time segment (say, once in a few seconds). And the value that is being written matches the one that you see in RAM afterwards.

But make sure you log all the hits if there are plenty of them per frame. Advancing several "steps into" after the last one, to get all involved code logged, may be a good habit. Observing it during execution is not that handy. But reading its dump will show you how the value that was written to your address was born. It can be:

	$LF

[div class=p 
	"In the rest 2 cases you need to find where the end value comes from. If it is written directly from another address, set a breakpoint on writing to it and trace how it gets there (several breakpoints before setting the end value can occur, rely on the last one that writes the value affecting your main address). If it was messed around with, using other addresses values, you must debug the routine that is done each time, which provides different result getting different source values.

	"Basically, you will be stepping back in time to find the reason. And when you have enough stuff debugged and traced, you can get the exact idea of how your semi-random value works. You can even replicate the code in lua and predict the future values depending on gameplay. And, most importantly, you will be able to affect the semi-random source that is used by that value, controlling the latter  effectively. Or you will find out that it is not random at all and can not be affected without harm towards speed. It is a puzzle after all, you solve it!
