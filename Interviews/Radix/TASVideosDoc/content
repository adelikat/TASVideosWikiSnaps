	"That depends on how you define it. Way back in the late 90s, Quake runners often

	"used a simple rocket jump script to do a few actions with a single button press. I

[blockquote 
	" Has that atmosphere changed (amongst non-TASers)? Also, why do you think it happened?
	$LF
]blockquote
[div class=p 
	"Sure. Now it's a separate thing that people can respect, and nobody is trying to pass it off as a real playthrough anymore. It probably gets a whole different set of people interested in it, because real time running isn't for everybody, it needs fast reflexes that a TAS doesn't.

	"Is this a statement that you would rephrase any today? You kinda already answered this already, I know... Would it be more like 'like them, haven't made them, don't watch them' now?

	"It's been years since I did runs, and I mostly did GameCube runs which didn't have any way to tas back when I did. I know that at the time though, GBA runs were already getting benefit from tas only tricks influencing regular plays.

	" If there's anything else at all that you remember, a little story or anything, that we could include in the interview, feel free to write everything you can! I can see that you might really not have anything seeing as how distanced TASes seem to be for you.

	"I remember years ago seeing a link to a TAS of someone who 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=used the same input for Mega Man X and X2 at the same time|href=/380M)
	", and then made the video of the play back side by side. At the time I just thought "how strange, why do that", but years later, the idea intrigues me and I wonder if it was ever done again? I guess because "2 person 1 controller" became a thing at AGDQ and it reminded me of it, though it's the sort of the opposite situation.
