	" Where did you first run into TASing?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"That depends on how you define it. Way back in the late 90s, Quake runners often
	$LF
	"used a simple rocket jump script to do a few actions with a single button press. I
	$LF
	"theorized at the time that you could just write a script to do the whole map for you, if it weren't for all that pesky random stuff. I didn't give it much thought after that until 
	(__wikiLink|668M|the Morimoto video)
	" in 2003.
	$LF

[blockquote 
	" What were your initial reactions to it?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"I didn't like that it was portrayed as a legitimate play through. I had no problem with the concept though.
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" What was the general atmosphere like? How were others reacting to the TASes they had seen, also why?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"At the time there was just the one. I think about half the people I knew at the time shared my opinion, but I'm just making that number up.
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" Has that atmosphere changed (amongst non-TASers)? Also, why do you think it happened?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"Sure. Now it's a separate thing that people can respect, and nobody is trying to pass it off as a real playthrough anymore. It probably gets a whole different set of people interested in it, because real time running isn't for everybody, it needs fast reflexes that a TAS doesn't.
	$LF

[blockquote 
	" How have your own reflections changed? Why?

	"Personally I thought the

	" was freaking amazing. To do some kind of buffer overflow and 
	(__wikiLink|2513M|reprogram Super Mario World)
	" on the real hardware just blew me away. I'm not going to start downloading TASes to watch, but that's mostly because I've got a huge back log of games to play and watch.

		""My basic thought is 'don't like them, haven't made them, don't watch them,' " said Nolan Pflug, who oversees Speed Demos Archive, a Web site that houses traditional runs.
	]em
	$LF
	$LF
	"Is this a statement that you would rephrase any today? You kinda already answered this already, I know... Would it be more like 'like them, haven't made them, don't watch them' now?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"I don't know as I'd go so far as to say I'd like them, but I accept them as part of the community of speed runs now.
	$LF

[blockquote 
	" Do you have any other favourites (you mentioned the SMW one) from amongst the TASes that you have seen.
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"I've seen so few. The ones at AGDQ are probably the majority of all I've seen. Of
	$LF
	"those, SMW was my favorite for the technical aspects of reprogramming a game, but
	$LF
	(__wikiLink|1533S|MK64)
	" was my favorite for showing off all the crazy skips in the game.
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" Did you ever use strategies or tricks in real-time running that you know originated from TASes? Can you name some games or runs that did that or TASes that did the opposite?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"It's been years since I did runs, and I mostly did GameCube runs which didn't have any way to tas back when I did. I know that at the time though, GBA runs were already getting benefit from tas only tricks influencing regular plays.
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" If there's anything else at all that you remember, a little story or anything, that we could include in the interview, feel free to write everything you can! I can see that you might really not have anything seeing as how distanced TASes seem to be for you.
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"I remember years ago seeing a link to a TAS of someone who 
	(__wikiLink|380M|used the same input for Mega Man X and X2 at the same time)
	", and then made the video of the play back side by side. At the time I just thought "how strange, why do that", but years later, the idea intrigues me and I wonder if it was ever done again? I guess because "2 person 1 controller" became a thing at AGDQ and it reminded me of it, though it's the sort of the opposite situation.
