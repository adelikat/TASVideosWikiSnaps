	" Can you tell me a little bit about yourself: age (27?), what you do
	$LF
	" for a living, etc.
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"Yeah, 27. (I guess I’ve wrote that in too many places by now
	$LF
	"because you found it easily.)
	$LF

[p 
	"I’m a software engineer, and a free (computer) software enthusiasist.

[blockquote 
	" You mentioned in an interview last year that you don’t play a lot of
	$LF
	" video games these days. What is your gaming background and how have
	$LF
	" your playing habits changed over the years?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"Yeah, I don’t really play a lot. Maybe once a year, I stumble upon
	$LF
	"some RPG that will suddenly take a week or two of my time, but
	$LF
	"otherwise I don’t really play that much.
	[br

	$LF
	"At the Nesvideos site, I sometimes assist players in their movies
	$LF
	"by reviewing them during the making, and even going as far as 
	$LF
	"demonstrating alternative ways by playing it. And, I have some
	$LF
	"own tool-assisted movie projects work-in-progress.
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" You’ve talked in the past about how you discovered tool-assisted runs 
	$LF
	" by downloading Morimito’s Super Mario Bros 3 run.  Can you tell me how
	$LF
	" you first discovered speedruns overall?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"Internet speedruns, huh...
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"A friend introduced a Doom speedrun to me. Guess that was it. :)
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" Do you remember how you found out that Morimito’s run was tool-assisted
	$LF
	" and how you reacted to that? Were you disappointed? Intrigued? Confused?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"No, I was already familiar with the concept, from the tool-assisted Doom
	$LF
	"speedruns. I don’t really remember the details. I saw the movie, went     
	$LF
	"to 
	(__wikiLink|Morimoto)
	"’s homepage, downloaded the FMV of various movies, searched
	$LF
	"for the program that plays FMV files, found Famtasia, and after that,   
	$LF
	"I’m not sure how I figured out about the things. It’s been more than      
	$LF
	"two years after all :)
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" How has your thinking about tool-assisted runs taken shape over the
	$LF
	" years? Did you always appreciate them the way you do now, or did it
	$LF
	" take time for you to come to your current views about them?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"In the following explanation, I’ll explain things only from the Nesvideos
	$LF
	"perspective. I’ll ignore outside TAS feats, since my only contact to
	$LF
	"that part is from a Doom TAS I’ve watched, and I don’t thus consider
	$LF
	"myself being part of that culture.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Since the forming of my site, I welcomed people to start submitting
	$LF
	"TAS movies and the amount of them (both the players and movies) has
	$LF
	"been growing.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Tool-assisted runs have evolved. Our precision and methods have improved,
	$LF
	"and as such, so have the results and the appetite. What could have been  
	$LF
	"“cool” 1.5 years ago, would now often be judged “sloppy”. Those of us  
	$LF
	"who have seen hundreds of TAS videos, don’t become impressed as easily
	$LF
	"as those who see them first time. Most popular games have been played    
	$LF
	"now, so it’s also harder to create something novel and impressive.     
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"We've become more speed-oriented and less art-oriented. Sometimes we even
	$LF
	"compete on frames (an unit of time almost as small as a 100th of a second).
	$LF
	"However, just because we 
	[em 
		"can
	]em
	", we try to accomplish as many things at once
	$LF
	"as possible. For example, if we can kill an enemy without taking damage,   
	$LF
	"we’ll do it because it’s often more impressive than otherwise.
	$LF
	"If we can kill the player character without slowing down the movie, we’ll
	$LF
	"do it just for the show. We play on enemy fire, avoiding them closely or 
	$LF
	"even passing through enemy objects just because it’s possible when you’re
	$LF
	"perfectly aware what the game is doing. Doing routinely feats that nobody  
	$LF
	"could do in real time barring some freaky luck.
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" When did you first try making some tool-assisted runs of your own,
	$LF
	" and what were your early experiments like?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"My first TAS run was an attempt to try beating SMB with as little
	$LF
	"score in the end as possible. It wasn’t very interesting.
	$LF
	"Later, I was encouraged enough to start making a SMB2 speedrun.
	$LF
	"I also made a Castlevania speedrun. When I gained more experience
	$LF
	"on that, I was able to make them faster, beating my own records  
	$LF
	"many times. By now though, they’ve been beaten by other players  
	$LF
	"who are more careful than I.
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" What is the most amount of time you've ever put into making a run?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"Officially, the making of the 
	[a href=/418M 
		"Mega Man 1 speedrun
	]a
	$LF
	"took 8 months.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"But not so much of it was spent playing but planning how to play   
	$LF
	"a particular scene.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Now someone would think that if it took 8 months, it must have
	$LF
	"been created by animating fabricated screenshots in succession.
	$LF
	"Not only is that claim proven false easily, but I’m way too lazy
	$LF
	"to do such laboursome work. I’m a programmer, not a labour-craftsman.
	$LF
	"Programmers are lazy. :)
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" Can you tell me about any moments you can recall from making your
	$LF
	" runs, when you were particularly surprised by or pleased with a  
	$LF
	" shortcut that you found?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"It’s always fascinating to discover new techniques.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"That pretty much covers it all.
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" What were some of the particularly difficult challenges you faced while
	$LF
	" making any of your runs (for example, was there something you tried to 
	$LF
	" accomplish in one of your runs that you just couldn’t do no matter how
	$LF
	" many times you tried?)
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"Yes, there have been some occassions. In Castlevania, there’s one scene
	$LF
	"where I would very much like to pass through the roof with the help
	$LF
	"of an enemy hit, and in Mega Man, there was a scene where I wanted to
	$LF
	"“zip” through the ceiling to skip two screenfuls of boring progress.   
	$LF
	"A fellow player named 
	(__wikiLink|user:finalfighter)
	" found a way to accomplish the
	$LF
	"second shortcut, but the first one is still deemed as impossible.
	$LF
	"In Castlevania 2 (Simon’s Quest) there’s a certain rumour on a famous
	$LF
	"glitch collection site that we spent great effort recently trying to 
	$LF
	"prove true, but it didn’t work out even when we programmed a robot to
	$LF
	"try it tens of thousands of times.
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" Please tell me about the size of the tool-assisted run community?
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	" How popular are these runs? How popular is your site?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"This question is difficult to answer. The aspects you asked are
	$LF
	"difficult to measure in a meaningful way. I’ll ignore the question.
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" Can you talk to me a bit about the Mario 64 run? I’m interested in
	$LF
	" learning when you first saw it, how you reacted to it, and how the
	$LF
	" community on your site reacted to it. How significant is that run?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"This question contains an assumption of an outsider perspective.
	$LF
	"The movie was developed 
	[em 
		"within
	]em
	" our site. I find it difficult  
	$LF
	"to answer that question.
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" You talk on your site about how one of the main goals for these runs is
	$LF
	" to “create art.” Do you think these runs are making art out of something
	$LF
	" (games) that wasn't already art?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"This question contains a faulty premise. Games are art. Games don’t need
	$LF
	"to be not art in order to be able to make movies of them that are also art.
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" You clearly value the beauty of the runs on your site. That makes me
	$LF
	" curious about your thoughts about the beauty of games. Have you always
	$LF
	" found games to be aesthetically pleasing? Do you find that tool-assisted
	$LF
	" runs games have changed your views on when or why a game is beautiful?  
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"Some games are more, some games are less. There’s visual aesthetics and
	$LF
	"aural aesthetics. In the movies we make, there is performance aesthetics.
	$LF
	"It is an extension, not something that changes the game.
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" After reading through your 
	(__wikiLink|FAQ)
	" I get the impression that many people
	$LF
	" criticize the idea of tool-assisted runs. How much of that kind of  
	$LF
	" feedback do you receive, and why do you think people have a problem 
	$LF
	" with what you do?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"I think the general atmosphere is quite educated about tool-assisted
	$LF
	"runs today. Back two years ago, I fought against claims of cheating 
	$LF
	"and other bad-mouthing. Today, although I still see some people who 
	$LF
	"hate the movies and consider them cheating, I see much more people  
	$LF
	"who recognize the values of both types of speedruns.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"I believe things wouldn’t be this way now if it weren’t for the
	$LF
	"information we have made available regarding tool-assisted movies.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"So the feedback we receive also reflects the today’s situation.
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" I’m interested in what runs you’re working on now.
	$LF
	" 
	[a href=/Bisqwit/Projects 
		"Your site states
	]a
	$LF
	" that you have a Chip n Dale NES run coming and you say that it will be
	$LF
	" “interesting.” What stands out about it? Is it because it's two-player?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"Thank you for reminding me! I should update this page. I dropped
	$LF
	"the Chip’n Dale project because someone eventually did it ahead me.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I wrote ‘interesting’, because the movie applied some unusual playing
	$LF
	"strategies such as letting one of the characters die in suitable places
	$LF
	"and other tricks that give speed.
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" What do you think the future holds for tool-assisted runs?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"More consoles, more games. Also, new techniques.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"More computer-aided search for timings and techniques.
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" Is there anything else you would like the MTV News
	$LF
	" readership/audience to know about these runs?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"The time it takes to create a movie. It is one of the biggest
	$LF
	"mysteries to people who don’t know the details of the moviemaking.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Planning takes a lot of time of course, but so does playing too.
	$LF
	"Because we usually play the games at very slow speed, even frame
	$LF
	"by frame, making a 10 minute movie can take as much as two hours
	$LF
	"because of the slowing alone. But because the core idea is to make
	$LF
	"movies that don’t have mistakes, we re-record, which is, undo, each
	$LF
	"sequence that didn’t work out as wanted. The sequences that are undone
	$LF
	"might vary from a few frames (fractions of seconds) to entire stages
	$LF
	"(a couple of minutes). Because of this re-recording process, making a 
	$LF
	"10 minute movie can take anything from two hours to two weeks, depending
	$LF
	"how difficult tasks are involved in it. Typically, abusing the game   
	$LF
	"programming errors require much precision and patience, and thus, many  
	$LF
	"retries too.
