	"This interview was answered by 
	(__wikiLink|user:Bisqwit)
	" for GameCritics
	$LF
	"in August 2004. The interviewer is Kyle Orland. It was
	$LF

	" How did you first become interested in the idea of
	$LF
	" recording and archiving "artful" plays of videogames?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"Personally, my interest sprouted when I saw the famous
	$LF
	"Super Mario Bros 3 "timeattack" movie played by some
	$LF
	"Japanese fellow called 
	(__wikiLink|Morimoto)
	".
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When I found that the author had created many other movies
	$LF
	"as well, such as 
	(__wikiLink|5M|Rockman)
	$LF
	"and 
	(__wikiLink|6M|Rockman 2)
	" movies, I began trying
	$LF
	"my hand at it (starting with Super Mario Bros), while developing
	$LF
	"my website to provide these movies and information about them.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"It's quite obvious that many people started the same way ― they
	$LF
	"first saw a timeattack movie somewhere and they started looking
	$LF
	"for more.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I don't know how Morimoto started, but it's clear that his SMB3
	$LF
	"movie that quickly spread over the world in the end of 2003
	$LF
	"was an igniter for this worldwide phenomen.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	(__wikiLink|EmulatorResources/Famtasia|Famtasia)
	", the Japanese NES emulator we began with, has had
	$LF
	"rerecording functionality (the necessary feature for making
	$LF
	"these movies) since April 2000.
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" Take us through the basic process involved in the creation of a
	$LF
	" "flawless" gameplay video. How long does this process take?
	$LF
	" (a range is fine).
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"For a gameplay movie to be flawless, it must be as fast as possible,
	$LF
	"it must not miss a shot, have no wasted efforts, and so on.
	$LF
	"Creating a such movie involves planning and carefulness.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The game is played at slow speed (the emulator slows the game down),
	$LF
	"doing small segments at time and optimizing then as well as possible,
	$LF
	"redoing until it goes well. The finished (and unfinished) product
	$LF
	"is reviewed many times, at full speed and at slow motion, to find
	$LF
	"things to improve and to invent new strategies and then played again.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Creating a such movie is very timeconsuming. You can easily elapse
	$LF
	"4 hours for a 10 minute sequence ― and that's only for the first
	$LF
	"revision. For some games, planning can need lots of time.
	$LF
	"Creating a releasable movie can take anything from 4 hours to 6 months,
	$LF
	"depending on how much free time you have, how complex the game is, how
	$LF
	"careful you are and how skillful you are.
	$LF
	"Many improved movies are also based on observations from previous
	$LF
	"movies, so it's actually difficult to estimate how much time goes
	$LF
	"into producing a good gameplay movie.
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" On your site, you say your goals for these videos are "creating art
	$LF
	" and providing entertainment." Can you expand on what you consider the
	$LF
	" artistic side of these videos? What makes a playthrough beautiful?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"The character of a game is basically an actor.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"The player is a director.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The task for the player is to create a movie that is entertaining to
	$LF
	"watch, given the story (the game).
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Just like when directing movies, one can not mechanically define how
	$LF
	"to direct. Although we have collected some 
	(__wikiLink|guidelines)
	", creating a good
	$LF
	"show is still a matter of creativity.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"We're only limited to the script (the plot of the game)
	$LF
	"and what the actors (the game dynamics) can do.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Taking the most advantage of these is an interesting quest.
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" While your site says you strive to make entertaining videos, is also
	$LF
	" says you also strive "to eliminate all slowness" from the videos.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	" Which part is more important? Is this a competition, an art form,
	$LF
	" or both?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"There are basically two camps within us ― two major goals.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Some people want to see how far the game can theoretically
	$LF
	"extend - to find all the superlatives of the game, such
	$LF
	"as the fastest possible time to complete the game.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Some people just love the show, and they want to see creativity.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Aiming for speed usually pleases both, because perfection in speed
	$LF
	"forces to think of ways of playing that are too risky to attempt
	$LF
	"in normal playing.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Competition exists ― old movies are often being replaced with new
	$LF
	"ones that are "better". Almost always the "better" movie is faster
	$LF
	"than the older movie.
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" The videos on your site use emulation and constant saves to perform
	$LF
	" seemingly impossible videogame feats. Do you feel this goes against
	$LF
	" the spirit of these games as consistent, self-contained worlds?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"If a child receives a box containing an expensive toy as a birthday
	$LF
	"present, it's possible that he'll enjoy the box more than the toy.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"This is creativity.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"We're doing the same for these games.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Instead of walking on the paths created for us,
	$LF
	"we create our own paths, our own legs and so on.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"And we're not listening to people who say "you can't do that!".
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Just like children.
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" You address many misconceptions and stereotypes about your videos on
	$LF
	" your site. Do you find many people that still believe your videos are
	$LF
	" hacked or editted?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"During the first months of this year (2004) when Morimoto's SMB3 movie
	$LF
	"was finding new audiences on daily basis, I saw lots of people getting
	$LF
	"the first impression that the movie is edited.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Some people read Morimoto's comments of the movie
	$LF
	"with a machine translator.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Rumours were flying and people were adapting them and believing
	$LF
	"everything that would make the movie somehow despisable ― no matter
	$LF
	"whether the claim is actually true or not.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Lately I haven't seen these claims anymore, but it's likely that
	$LF
	"some people still think that way.
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" A huge community has sprung up on the internet around the creation
	$LF
	" and perfection of videos like the ones on your site. Why do you think
	$LF
	" so many gamers have come together in pursuit of this goal?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"Because it is interesting.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"It also gives people some sense of pride and self-satisfaction when
	$LF
	"they manage to do something nobody has done before and when they know
	$LF
	"their movies will be watched with admiration.
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" Many of the games in these videos are considered some of the
	$LF
	" toughest ever made. Do you feel that showing the games being played
	$LF
	" so flawlessly demystifies them, in a way? Does nostalgia make some
	$LF
	" of these games seem tougher than they actually are?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"I think these old games are not easier today than they were 15 years ago.
	$LF
	"It's likely that watching a movie of 
	[a href=/movies.cgi?name=ghosts 
		"Ghosts'n Goblins
	]a
	$LF
	"played with ease affects the person's opinion towards the game,
	$LF
	"but it doesn't make it any easier to play.
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" Personally, I'm often mesmerized watching the amazing feats in these
	$LF
	" videos. Have you heard from any other viewers who are appreciative
	$LF
	" of your work? What have they said?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"I have received two kinds of feedback.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Almost everyone who has emailed me of something related to the movies
	$LF
	"or my site, has expressed that they enjoy the movies and wish to see more.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Then there are some who complain because they feel we're cheating
	$LF
	"and doing harm to honest competitive gaming. These ones tend to be
	$LF
	"quite loud sometimes.
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" What does the future hold for the art and craft of creating gameplay
	$LF
	" movies? Is the community running out of relevant games to conquer?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"The old consoles are still holding some interest.
	$LF
	"However, we're also stepping slowly towards the newer systems.
	$LF
	"What started with NES movies, has now extended to SNES (Super Famicom)
	$LF
	"and Sega Genesis (aka. Sega Megadrive) as well.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Speedrunning is not a new phenomen ― it has probably been going on
	$LF
	"ever since the first games were made. Humans are competitive.
	$LF
	"Toolassisted movies for games such as Doom II and Quake have been
	$LF
	"made for many years already, and they're still being improved.
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" Finally, what is your favorite gameplay video?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"I like the Tetris movie ("tetris_japan_finals.mpeg") that
	$LF
	[a class=extlink href=http://www.arika.co.jp/arika_eng/_release/release_soft.html rel=nofollow 
		"can be found
	]a
	$LF
	"in the Internet. I don't know the details of it, but it's played on
	$LF
	"an arcade machine and it's really awesome. It's not tool-assisted.
