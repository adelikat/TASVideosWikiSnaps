	" What does it take to become a tool-assisted speedrun champion? Can anybody do it?
	$LF
]blockquote
[div class=p 
	"It takes dedication and a bit of luck. Anyone can do it, provided they
	$LF
	"take their try at a game that hasn't been beaten to perfection yet.
	$LF
	"As with regular speedrunning, a TAS player must be keenly focused at
	$LF
	"anything that may cost time in the game, such as bumping into obstacles,
	$LF
	"non-obvious shortcuts. Even collecting some bonuses in the game may end
	$LF
	"up costing time, when the game may spend time tallying your score later
	$LF
	"in the game.

[blockquote 
	" How many TAS records do you own?  What is your most impressive run?  Why?
	$LF
]blockquote
[div class=p 
	"Currently I possess only two TAS records, though I have had a few more.
	$LF
	"My most impressive run was that of the original Mega Man for NES.
	$LF
	"It abused many glitches of that game that required extremely high
	$LF
	"precision and understanding precisely how the game works, to pull it off.
	$LF
	"Lately someone else improved the record with a few clever discoveries,
	$LF
	"though most of the movie looks exactly the same.

[blockquote 
	" How long did it take to achieve your most impressive run?
	$LF
	" How many hours a day did you play?
	$LF
]blockquote
[div class=p 
	"About a year, but naturally I did not play every day.
	$LF
	"I'd say it took perhaps around 300 hours to produce it. Possibly more.
	$LF
	"A lot of the time was spent in making graphs, discussing plans with other
	$LF
	"experts of that game, disassembling the game code to figure out how it
	$LF
	"works, etc. Such work is carried out very rarely for TASes. Maybe only
	$LF
	"for the top five or ten, of all the thousand or so TASes that exist.
	$LF
]div
[blockquote 
	" Are TAS's more difficult than 'regular' speedruns?  Why or why  not?
	$LF
]blockquote
[div class=p 
	"They are not easier and not more difficult. With unassisted, i.e. "regular"
	$LF
	"speedruns, a significant portion of time is spent trying to develop one's
	$LF
	"reflexes to be able to carry out some stunt in the game. With TASes, an
	$LF
	"equivalent portion of time is spent running the game at extremely slow  
	$LF
	"motion, perfecting the tiniest movements in the game. Both types of
	$LF
	"speedrunners still usually spend the majority of time just 
	[em 
		"planning
	]em
	$LF
	"the speedrun and probing the game for its weaknesses. To figure out
	$LF
	[em 
		"how
	]em
	" they could pass through a wall, for example.

]div
[blockquote 
	" What is it about tool-assisted speedruns that you enjoy so much?
	$LF
]blockquote
[div class=p 
	"I enjoy the insight to game programming that it gives; the subverting
	$LF
	"of the games' rules by finding out glitches and abusing them; and the
	$LF
	"visual performance that comes from movement without a single flaw.
	$LF

[blockquote 
	" What would you say to those who disregard tool-assisted speedruns
	$LF
	" altogether, saying it's cheating?
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"I would say: you are missing a lot, beginning with the point,
	$LF
	"but I cannot blame you.
	$LF
]div
[blockquote 
	" Do you think it's possible for humans to perfect a speed run for any
	$LF
	" game using tools? Why or why not?
	$LF
]blockquote
[div class=p 
	"This question is not as interesting, as is the question of whether it is
	$LF
	"possible for humans to perfect a speedrun for a game _without_ using tools.
	$LF
	"The answer to that question is, in my opinion: rarely, except for the
	$LF
	"simplest games. For games that require reflex or luck, you must have
	$LF
	"incredible dedication to come close to the TAS records. In my opinion,
	$LF
	"that dedication is much better spent by using TAS tools. Much less life
	$LF
	"wasted :) But when the unassisted speedrun movies are 
	[em 
		"not
	]em
	" perfect
	$LF
	"(though still trying hard to be), they are most interesting to watch.

	" How do you go about figuring out new techniques for faster times?
	$LF

	$LF
]blockquote
[div class=p 
	"A lot of it comes from experience and insight, some from luck.
	$LF
	"There are typical pitfalls in game programming that cause
	$LF
	"similar bugs/traits in many games, and learning about them
	$LF
	"helps developing techniques. Some people just try random things.
	$LF
	"Having a keen eye for anything out of ordinary helps a lot.
	$LF
	"As in, "wait, how did that happen? Can I do it again? Is it useful?".
