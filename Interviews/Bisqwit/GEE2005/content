	" How was the genre of "Tool-Assisted-Speedruns" born?
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	" Do you know who did the first "Tool-Assisted-Speedrun" ever?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"According to my knowledge, the term "Tool-Assisted Speedrun" has been
	$LF
	"born in the Doom speedrunning communities.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When applied to Doom, a regular Speedrun is simply an as-fast-as-possible
	$LF
	"completion of Doom with real human skills and a lot of training.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"A tool-assisted speedrun of Doom is made with an altered version of Doom
	$LF
	"that allows arbitrary segmentation of the movie (so that short segments
	$LF
	"of the movie can be done over and over until it's as wanted, not just
	$LF
	"complete levels), and to slow do the game engine so that it's easier to play.
	$LF
	"When the movie is played back, it looks as if it was played in a single
	$LF
	"session in real time.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Applying the term "tool-assisted speedrun" to emulator-made movies is
	$LF
	"a very recent movement. Previously, most people called them timeattacks.
	$LF
	"Some people still do.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The term timeattack means a time trial ― an attempt to complete the game
	$LF
	"as fast as possible. Using the term to denote tool-assisted emulator movies
	$LF
	"was introduced to western world upon Morimoto's famous Super Mario Bros 3
	$LF
	"movie in November 2003.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"While Morimoto's movie was the igniter for the western world to start making
	$LF
	"tool-assisted emulator movies using the feature called "re-recording",
	$LF
	"Morimoto's movie wasn't the first of its kind. According to my knowledge,
	$LF
	"another Japanese person called Tokushin made
	$LF
	"also a 
	[a class=intlink href=/15M 
		"Super Mario Bros 3 movie
	]a
	" in 2001,
	$LF
	"and yet another Japanese person
	$LF
	"called Yy made a tool-assisted 
	[a class=intlink href=/13M 
		"Super Mario Bros movie
	]a
	$LF
	"in 2000. Both movies are available on my website.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Although thus the exact origin of tool-assisted speedruns (emulator or not)
	$LF
	"is not known, it's clear that it was Morimoto's movie in November 2003 that
	$LF
	"made the phenomenon world-wide famous.

	[br

	$LF
	" - What talent is needed?
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	" - How long does it take?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"It all depends on the amount of effort one wants to put into it.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There are various levels of detail that may or may not apply to
	$LF
	"the individual process.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Simpliest, the making of the speedrun is just playing through the game,
	$LF
	"until the game is completed.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Next detail level lies in the undoing of mistakes.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Mistakes such as taking damage accidentally, or backtracking, or jumping
	$LF
	"a little too late. The player must re-record (load a savestate to return
	$LF
	"to an earlier point of the playing process) whenever he makes a mistake,
	$LF
	"and try again. Regular speedrunners do it by starting the whole thing over.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The more experienced the movie maker, the more mistakes he can spot in his
	$LF
	"own movie (and in movies made by others). Note that an experienced 
	[em 
		"player
	]em
	$LF
	"might not be able to spot things that are relevant in speedrunning.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The next detail level is to consider techniques and strategies.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"It is the process of analyzing different ways of playing and devising
	$LF
	"methods that result in fastest progress in the game.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Analyzing things like which items to collect, which enemies to kill, how
	$LF
	"many experience points are needed, whether jumping is faster than running,
	$LF
	"and so on. Ofter, compromises have to be made, because something that is
	$LF
	"fast in one situation might be slower in another situation.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Part of this process involves analyzing the game. Because tool-assisted
	$LF
	"speedruns are often made at very slow speeds, utilizing a "
	[a class=intlink href=/Glossary 
		"frame advance
	]a
	""
	$LF
	"feature (which is analogous to the "single step slow-motion" in VCRs),
	$LF
	"the player can make very precise analysis of the game and devise techniques
	$LF
	"that are simply impossible to notice/use in realtime playing.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Often, the analysis reveals game flaws, "glitches", that can be used to
	$LF
	"skip large parts of the game.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Note that these glitches have nothing to do with cheating codes used
	$LF
	"with devices like Pro Action Replay. Cheating codes modify the game.
	$LF
	"Glitches are something that is already inherent in the game, only to
	$LF
	"be discovered and then abused.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The most extreme way of acquiring information is disassembling the game
	$LF
	"to analyze its program code. It requires expertise in programming, and
	$LF
	"may not yield anything useful after all.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Creating a 10 minute long tool-assisted speedrun for a platform game
	$LF
	"might take anything from 2 hours to 6 months, depending on the devotion
	$LF
	"of the movie maker(s) and of course, of the complexity of the game.
	$LF
	"As for complexity, often, the looks can be deceiving...
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Making of tool-assisted speedruns requires entirely different skills
	$LF
	"than just playing those games. In normal playing, one needs to have
	$LF
	"good memory, quick reactions and good coordination skills in general.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In making of tool-assisted speedruns, one doesn't need to have quick
	$LF
	"reactions or good coordination skills, but instead, one needs to have
	$LF
	"an analytical eye on the game: how different actions compare
	$LF
	"in speed, what are common pitfalls, what kind of
	$LF
	[a class=intlink href=/GameResources/CommonTricks 
		"programming errors to expect
	]a
	" in the game,
	$LF
	"what actions are not necessary for the game completion, etc,
	$LF
	"and an envisioning mind to look for non-obvious paths.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Much of this skill is only learned by actually doing it.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In realtime playing, players often do excess movements to make the
	$LF
	"playing easier (such as destroying enemies that might hit them), but
	$LF
	"in tool-assisted playing, the player can take risks that are too risky
	$LF
	"for realtime playing. Literally, the player may bet his life on that he
	$LF
	"wins a lottery. Because if the game doesn't co-operate, he can always
	$LF
	"re-record. He can even influence the luck.
	$LF
	"Influencing the luck is impossible without knowing the future,
	$LF
	"but in tool-assisted speedruns, luck is frequently influenced.
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" Which games are best suited for "Tool-Assisted-Speedruns"?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"The more ways the game has to accomplish the same result (and the less
	$LF
	"obvious it is to find the best ways), the better it is for speedrunning.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Most often, this means platform games which have many degrees of freedom.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The more different ways of movement and more weapons the player has at
	$LF
	"his disposal, the bigger is the contrast between an inexperienced and
	$LF
	"experienced speedrunner at the game. And thus, the better the movie.
	$LF
	"Sometimes, games that are also very hard for regular players are also
	$LF
	"well-suited for speedruns.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Of course, there is also the aspect of entertainment. A game that
	$LF
	"is very difficult to play might not always be interesting to watch.
