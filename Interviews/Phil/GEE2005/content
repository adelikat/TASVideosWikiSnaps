	$LF
	"called GEE in July 2005. The interviewer is Moses Grohé. It was

	" How was the genre of "Tool-Assisted-Speedruns" born?
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	" Do you know who did the first "Tool-Assisted-Speedrun" ever?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"All I know, it started with the game Doom.

[p 
	"On NES, Morimoto's SMB3 makes TAS more popular but it seems it wasn't the first since Yy had made SMB1 as "NES Super Mario Bros (PRG 0) by Yy in 19:27 (2000-06-09)" which is a full run of the game but beaten by me and Genisto ;).

[blockquote 
	"Can you remember what was the crucial factor to start 
	$LF
	""Tool-Assisted-Speedrunning" for you?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"When I first saw that SMB3 movie made by Morimoto, I thought it was legitimate so I started making movie with Zsnes without savestates then I discovered Bisqwit's site and started doing TAS.

[blockquote 
	" Can you please describe the process of making
	$LF
	" a "Tool-Assisted-Speedrun" in every detail.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	" - What is the trickiest part?
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	" - What talent is needed?
	[br

	$LF
	" - How long does it take?

[p 
	"First, you choose a game that you know, though I have already made a movie of Dragon's Lair  which I have never played before, and want to to do.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Then if you want, you can check some FAQs, though rarely useful but still, and/or ask people if they know some tricks which may help you doing a good movie or watch a movie that you want to beat and analyze the errors in the video.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The trickiest part, is try, retry and retry until you find the good way to do perfect things. Try finding useful bugs. It requires a lot of patience. In fact more tries = better results. So a video may take more than 50 hours to do for a 10 minutes movie depending of the game.
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" Which games are best suited for "Tool-Assisted-Speedruns"?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"Apparently, platform and especially popular games are best.
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	"Which ones do you prefer? Why?
	$LF
	"Wich one is the best run you’ve ever seen? (Why? What makes a run 
	$LF
	"stand out?)
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"Hard to tell but Hitler no Fukkatsu by Genisto is pretty interesting to watch because of so precised movements. I think movies that can't be done or hard to achieve at full speed, makes the game more interesting.
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	"Can you describe the kind of satisfaction which you get when you did 
	$LF
	"a movie of a perfect run?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"After taking a lot of hours to make a video and see the final results, evidently I am proud. I am even more satisfied when people are pleased to watch my video.
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" Can you imagine those movies in a different context than the internet? (I'd like to see
	$LF
	" them as visuals in dance-clubs, that would be cool. Have you ever heard of someone using
	$LF
	" them for that or any other purpose?)
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"No, never heard of that things before. I know someone wanting to make a DVD but that's all.
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" Which one should be done?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"Jyzero's should finish its FF3 US run but when Zsnes's team will fix the sound core, I will do FF2 US.
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	"Are you interested in "normal" speedruns? Do you like them?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"Yes, for games that I want to do. Well, they are not as interesting as TAS but some of them are still good. For normal speedrun, I prefer watching modern games like Doom 3.
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" Do you still enjoy videogames like the average casual gamer?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"I play often Medal of Honor Breakthrough in Multiplayer mode but other than that, I don't play very much games lately.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I prefer strategic games, especially those made by KOEI, and RPG.
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" What makes a videogame a good or even great videogame for you?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"Original history, good music. I hate remake of games. I said that I would love to see a speedrun of Doom 3 but I don't like this game. :P
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" What is the best compliment you ever got for one your your runs?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"Personally, when someone say: How did you find that" is better than "Excellent run" because I know he was impressed.
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" What was the worst affront?
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"Those anti-tas guys with childhoosh attitude. I will not name them and other details.
	$LF
]p
[blockquote 
	" Please tell me the one thing you ever wanted to read about "Tool-Assisted-Speedruns" in a
	$LF
	" magazine.
	$LF
]blockquote
[p 
	"The article must be informative so people must know what TAS means and doesn't involve any cheating.
