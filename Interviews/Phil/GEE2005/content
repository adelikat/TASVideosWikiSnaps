	"On NES, Morimoto's SMB3 makes TAS more popular but it seems it wasn't the first since Yy had made SMB1 as "NES Super Mario Bros (PRG 0) by Yy in 19:27 (2000-06-09)" which is a full run of the game but beaten by me and Genisto ;).

	"First, you choose a game that you know, though I have already made a movie of Dragon's Lair  which I have never played before, and want to to do.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Then if you want, you can check some FAQs, though rarely useful but still, and/or ask people if they know some tricks which may help you doing a good movie or watch a movie that you want to beat and analyze the errors in the video.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The trickiest part, is try, retry and retry until you find the good way to do perfect things. Try finding useful bugs. It requires a lot of patience. In fact more tries = better results. So a video may take more than 50 hours to do for a 10 minutes movie depending of the game.

	" Which games are best suited for "Tool-Assisted-Speedruns"?
	$LF

	$LF
]blockquote
[div class=p 
	"Hard to tell but Hitler no Fukkatsu by Genisto is pretty interesting to watch because of so precised movements. I think movies that can't be done or hard to achieve at full speed, makes the game more interesting.
	$LF

[blockquote 
	"Can you describe the kind of satisfaction which you get when you did 
	$LF
	"a movie of a perfect run?

[blockquote 
	" Can you imagine those movies in a different context than the internet? (I'd like to see
	$LF
	" them as visuals in dance-clubs, that would be cool. Have you ever heard of someone using
	$LF
	" them for that or any other purpose?)

]blockquote
[div class=p 
	"No, never heard of that things before. I know someone wanting to make a DVD but that's all.

	" Which one should be done?
	$LF
]blockquote
[div class=p 
	"Jyzero's should finish its FF3 US run but when Zsnes's team will fix the sound core, I will do FF2 US.

[blockquote 
	"Are you interested in "normal" speedruns? Do you like them?
	$LF
]blockquote
[div class=p 
	"Yes, for games that I want to do. Well, they are not as interesting as TAS but some of them are still good. For normal speedrun, I prefer watching modern games like Doom 3.

	" Do you still enjoy videogames like the average casual gamer?

[blockquote 
	" What is the best compliment you ever got for one your your runs?
	$LF
]blockquote
[div class=p 
	"Personally, when someone say: How did you find that" is better than "Excellent run" because I know he was impressed.
