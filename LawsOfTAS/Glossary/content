[p 
	"This is a term coined in the early development of rerecording techniques.  The term applies mainly to the concept of embedding movie data into savestate files.  This allows the user to load a savestate and restore the movie data (events) associated with that savestate.  This allows out of order savestating, multiple timelines, and eliminates problems of broken movies from the result of accidental savestate misuse.
