TASVideos submission forms depend on automatic determination of console.  In cases where a file could be for different consoles,  the header should include information necessary to determine this.  For instance, FCEUX has a FDS flag.  PCEjin has a CD addon flag.  Mednafen has flags for the various consoles it emulates.  Dega has a flag for Master system vs Game gear.

Details as to specific formatting schemes as for when and where the subtitles would be placed would be up to the specific implementation of the feature in the emulator. Ability to export subtitles to a popular subtitle format is highly desirable, because that allows to put them in encodes with high flexibility.

All buttons for that frame should be accounted for too as opposed to only buttons that were pressed.  Shortcuts should not be allowed.  TAS movies are often edited by hand or have sections of input copy/pasted into other movie files.  Therefore it is necessary not just for stable recording/playback but also for movie editing.
