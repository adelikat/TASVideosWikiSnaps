For example, if the goal of a movie is fastest time, the submission must be faster; a slower or tied movie will be rejected. For movies of a game which never really ends, a movie which chooses a later ending point can obsolete one which chose an earlier ending point, if it overlaps in content.

For example, gaining time by switching to another version which loads faster, has shorter cut-scenes, or by more optimized usage of the title screen menus is not counted as an actual time improvement. A movie which doesn't have any actual in-game game-play improvements over its published predecessor will not be accepted.
	$LF

[p 
	"If time is gained from using a more accurate emulator, but game-play hasn't been improved, such a movie will be rejected.
