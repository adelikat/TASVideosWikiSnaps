[p 
	"First, go to some relevant point in the game, one where you are about to change the value of what you want to find.  Open the search box. Don't search anything yet, but click "Start" or "Reset".

Click "Update values" if the emulator doesn't do this automatically.

[p 
	"Generally moving right introduces a value 'greater than' the previous value, and moving left introduces a value 'less than' the previous value.  This is dependent on the programming convention of the game, and may not always be true. For example, some games don't have the constant addresses of objects' coordinates, but calculate them from screen and sprite positions.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"You can easily save work by checking around the address you found. For example, if you found the player's X position, it is often reasonable to assume the player's Y position is two or four bytes ahead.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When looking for a speed value, moving right is generally positive and moving left is generally negative.  In this case you usually need to use 'signed' comparisons. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Negative numbers are interpreted differently depending on whether the value is being read as signed or unsigned.  When reading a byte ranging from 0 to 255 without interpreting the sign (unsigned), a positive number counts up from 0 and a negative number counts down from 255.  When the emulator is searching for a 'signed' value, it performs this interpretation for you to make the values range from -128 to +127.  Comparisons must account for this.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In newer emulators one may have to choose between a data size of 1,2, or 4 bytes.  One must predict whether the byte holds less than or equal to 255, 65535, or 4294967295 intervals of precision.  One step by a character could be anywhere from 1 unit to 10,000 units, so trial and error of data size may be necessary.  Checking misaligned values is usually not necessary.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"A good starting approach may be to select "2-bytes" for search. This avoids confusion near byte boundaries (such as when 127 goes to -128, or 255 goes to 0). If it doesn't work, try "1-byte" or "4-bytes."
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"For relatively simple platforms, like NES, you can use the inbuilt Hex Editor to observe RAM, watching what addresses are changing while you're acting. For example, you never know, how the subpixel value exactly changes, so it may be easier to look for values, that change every frame when the acceleration works, and stay still when it doesn't. Also, it's more useful to turn the whole pages ("Page Up", "Page Down" keys) while observing RAM, not to scroll them.

[p 
	"Games sometimes allocate data during execution, this means that the exact address of things may change between levels, starts of the game or even every frame. This can greatly complicate your work. But you can always find a pointer to the currently used address.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The simplest case would be that a fixed address always holds the exact address of the value you do care about.
	$LF

[p 
	"Games sometimes store collections of similar items, like the list of active enemies. These collections are often stored as either arrays or linked lists.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Arrays are just regions of memory where several instances of the same type of data is stored in sequence. They are very popular with simple games, since they can be statically allocated in a fixed spot all the time.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Linked lists are more common on more modern systems, but can still be found on older platforms. They are built as a chain of similarly formated regions of memory that are linked together using pointers. Linked lists are often double linked, each item having a pointer both to the next and the previous item in the list.

]p
[p 
	"You may also find hashmaps. Hashmaps act like an array, but allow for fast retrieval for data with a specific key. In order to work with these you will need to reverse engineer the exact hashing function the game uses.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In all cases for these data structures you will need not only knowledge of where in memory the data structure can be found, but also knowledge of how to find the specific item in the collection that you want to know about. You can often find pointers or indexes to the specific value elsewhere in memory.

[p 
	"Practically every computer system actually used in practice uses a callstack approach.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The callstack is a dedicated region of memory used to implement function calls. The callstack commonly grows downwards, the address of new data decreasing.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"As functions in the program are called values are added to the callstack. Some of these values can be very interesting, since they can be the value you are searching for.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The problem with the callstack is that values are often overwritten.
