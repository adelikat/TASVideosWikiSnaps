	"This goes back to 1991-1992, when I rented Shining in the Darkness, a (then new) RPG on the Genesis, and started a new game. I had gotten bored of entering my real name in games by then, so I decided to mash buttons randomly and got some crap like "ABVRT". Unsatisfied, I tried again and got "ACMLM" (
	[a href=http://acmlm.org/other/acmlm3.gif? rel=noopener external nofollow 
		"reproduced on emulator
	]a
	"), which for some reason looked good to me. From then on, I've purposely entered this name in every new RPG I've played (when it fits), and decided to use the same name online.

	"I grew up with the NES since 1988, and started to fall behind in modern gaming during the first 32bit era (Nintendo 64, Playstation) once 3D gaming took over. I'm still into classic gaming (8bit and 16bit), which happens to be the best emulated consoles.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"I first heard about console emulation in 1998, when I saw someone playing Excitebike on a PC, but I thought it was only a perfect port. Later that year, I got a SNES emulator and FF6 (FF3 US), played through it, started looking for more ROMs, and got a NES emulator, and so I got into emulation.

[div class=p 
	"A year later, while looking for SMB2j and messing around with Game Genie codes for glitched levels in SMB1, I found a level editor and eventually did ROM hacking (mostly the Strange Mario Bros series, available on 
	[a href=http://acmlm.overclocked.org rel=noopener external nofollow 
		"my site
	]a
	"), actively until summer 2000. This started with only level editing, but being also a programmer, I progressively wanted to change more aspects of the game, such as graphics, colors, music and finally the code itself. This has actually been useful for me here, particularly in 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Dragon Warrior|href=/967S)
	" and 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Monopoly|href=/1011S)
	" where I had to figure out (and simulate) the game's randomization algorythm to manipulate luck better.

	"My first tool-assisted plays were also in 2000, when NESticle was still popular. It had no re-recording but could record movies with slowdown and frame advance, so I messed around with it in a few games, such as Tetris. Nothing great, but one of them can be found in

	"Then I had mostly forgotten about it, until Morimoto's famous SMB3 run in late 2003, which I first thought was insane skill, but already had doubts it was done with slowdowns and savestates. I still didn't know about any re-recording emulator at the time, but made a short run of Nintendo Tetris type B entirely with a hex editor.

	"Finally, in November 2004, one of the previous (but then new) SMB2 runs brought me here, and I made my first true tool-assisted runs, starting once again with
