	"Hello, I'm ViGadeomes !
	$LF
	"I was introduced to speedrunning back in 2017 (don't remember exactly how xD) and so I started making some ILs and stuff. Then, by watching YouTube videos I saw the name "TAS" on some of them and didn't understand why these wasn't referenced on speedrun dat com. Then thanks to CdV and RealMyop (old french commentators of TASes and speedruns), I understood what was a TAS and as I was starting to route, glitch hunt etc Asterix Search for Dogmatix for GBC I thought it was a good idea to try to make a TAS of it to first find more stuff before I would go on the speedrun of the game.

[div class=p 
	"The more I did, the more I enjoyed TASing and got more involved in the TASing community and it ended up with my first serious TAS submitted and published 
	(__wikiLink|href=/3649M|implicitdisplaytext=3649M)
	".
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Since then, I enjoy mostly doing TAS stuff with too much projects started but never finished...
	$LF
	"On the speedrunning side, I'm involved in some RTA communities where I also glitch hunt, find strats, make some ILs. Some of them are Need for Speed, Assassin's Creed and Asterix XXL/2/OG.
