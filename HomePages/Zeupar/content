	"Hi there! I am a lazy speedrunner with a (very improvable) run published on SDA and am a vested editor here at TASVideos. I plan on submitting more speedruns to SDA in the near future. I enjoy watching TASes as much as speedruns, but since I still don't have enough motivation to make a TAS myself, I try to help the site by giving tips for games I know well (not many) and keeping the information found in publications and wiki pages as clear and accurate as possible. I avoid watching runs of games I plan to play, and there are many such games, so I haven't enjoyed the majority of the most praised speedruns and TASes yet.

	"I have always loved video game competition. My first contact with speedrunning was via The Sonic Center (I am currently one of the administrators of TSC). I think most Sonic games make for amazing speedruns and TASes (especially the still-not-completely-broken 2D ones), because it feels like they are developed with speedrunning in mind.
