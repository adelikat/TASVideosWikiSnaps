	"Hi there! I am a speedrunner and a vested editor here at TASVideos. I enjoy watching TASes as much as speedruns, but since I still haven't gathered enough motivation to make a TAS, I try to help the site by giving tips for games I know well (not many) and keeping the information found in publications and wiki pages as clear and accurate as possible. I avoid watching runs of games I plan to play, and there are many such games, so I haven't enjoyed the majority of the most praised speedruns and TASes yet.
