	"The Dinkie Dino (aka Raku Raku Dino-kun) is a generic virtual pet that was out on the market shortly after tamagotchis first appeared. The objective is to have it evolve into an adult dinosaur by taking good care of it. You can give it something to drink, feed it, turn off/on light (when it sleeps), pet it, check status, play rock-paper-scissors with it, have it study, have it take a shower, turn off/on air conditioner and inject medicine.

	"You can change the ingame clock by holding the Esc + Enter buttons. If you set the time to right before a full hour passes over and over, you can receive the changes described in the schedule above quicker.

	"Dinkie will move to the 2nd evolution level if he is 14kg and has full plates/glasses on the status screen, sleeps and 9am passes. At the time he wakes up, he is at 15kg. (Therefore, we conclude that the game follows this order: 1) convert full plates/glasses to weight 2) check if weight is enough to evolve).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"But when I adjusted the timer like that a few times in a row, Dinkie died on me even though all the status meters were fine. So either the game straight-up prevents you from cheating, or there might be some nifty game mechanic. E.g. I'm speculating the game sets a status ailment that should occur within the next hour and it checks if you cured it. But if you skip over the hour by adjusting the timer, then you fail the flag.

	"Note, on the image below, the pasta evolution branch was taken, yet Dinkie turned into an angel. And I remember from playing as a kid, I treated my Dinkie very well and it turned into a vampire in the end. So it seems to be random and independent of the evolution branch which of the two he turns into. My speculation at this point would be that he becomes a vampire if you feed him ice cream.
