	"Hi, my username here is p4wn3r and this is my homepage. Wiki formatting screwed my name though. I can't really blame it. Though my nickname completely pwns, it's one of the most misspelled ones in the site.
	$LF
	"More seriously, I'm a brazilian guy and became a TASer in late 2008, I discovered the site by watching primorial#soup's SGB Pokémon Green run, which got me interested in TASing in general.

	"This was actually a test run I did with the objective of getting more familiar with the game. It however has a major route flaw, had too many arbitrary goals and luck manipulation is really sloppy. Though this run has been really awaited by the Pokémon community, my attempt surely isn't publishable by this site. I'm currently redoing this with only complete pokédex, which will be a lot more entertaining.

	"It reproduces an artistic position I've come across in my years playing chess. It's mildly funny for chess players, but the TASing joke itself isn't enough to abuse the submission queue or a judge's patience, so I didn't submit it.

	"Luck manipulation was really interesting, there are some really good stunts where the player draws the exact card he needs to win, but the menus are cancelled so fast that it's not possible to see it at 100% speed.

	"That project had been abandoned for a long time and I thought that game needed a run, so I took FractalFusion's WIP and his groundwork and finished it. It was incredibly fun to TAS, I looked more at VBA's memory viewer and Scite's Lua IDE than the game screen.

	"My improvement on the best rated Pokémon movie in TASVideos. I never expected to improve this after my second submission. However, after looking better at the game's RAM, I could glitch it even more and improve it. I tested everything I could to make it optimal, and I claim this to be the fastest "route". I can only think of improvements for this if something completely different from what's known now is found or someone does some black magic to eliminate enough scrolling lag to bust frame rules (which I couldn't do no matter how hard I tried).

	"The canonical any% completion of the 1st generation, which doesn't abuse save corruption. I managed to improve the previous movie by more than 37 minutes. The large time saver comes from exploiting a warp glitch similar to the Yellow run. However, by banning save file corruption, the execution is completely different and also showcases a good set of glitches to get the fastest time and notoriously uses the ZZAZZ glitch, which, because of several emulation inaccuracies and "randomness" in the behavior of the game when it's activated, was thought to be impossible to be used as a time saver. That may be one of the reasons that made primo's previous movie last since 2007, even when this bug was already known.
