I ended up saving 25 seconds, mostly through the discovery of a helpful glitch that allows you to attack enemies repeatedly without having to stop to fight them.

This allows you to influence which way the knockback is applied during the parts of the game where your character has a projectile attack. Using this in two places, I improved my original TAS by 2.63 seconds, and this was published in December 2015.

In fact, I had tried to make this precise jump work when working on the first movie, without success, but this time I managed to make it work, saving over a second. However, I was very busy with academic work at this time, so I put off redoing the TAS. Finally, for much of August 2022, I worked on finding several more improvements, some very large, and some only a handful of frames. With some significant analysis of how the game handles objects and frame rules, with some debugging help from 
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/negative_seven
