	"Around February, JXQ created a temporary website which solved the problem on TASvideos whereby many of our emulator links were outdated or broken. His solution was to host the emulators and tools himself until a more permanent solution was found. While JXQ no longer hosts the site, I have created a mirror and new design layout which I will update whenever required. It can currently be accessed
