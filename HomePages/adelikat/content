	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"1) The most important thing I look for is if the game is suitable for TASing.  By this, I mean that it requires some tricks/glitches/strategies in order to optimize it.  Basically, the optimal solution must not be blatantly obvious, such as simply running to the right and hitting the level exit.  The more complex the process of optimization the more likely I am to be interested in it.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"2) In addition to having surprised, it must not get repetitive.  Such as if all levels require the same "solution", if all levels and/or bosses look the same, or if the same technique is used relentlessly throughout the run.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"3) How optimized it is.  This is slightly different from saying how perfect it is.  I am looking that the author has some sort of mastery over the "craft" of TASing.  I.e., they are familiar with the basic techniques of TASing and employ them skillfully.  The route is planned out.  Known tricks & glitches were used, etc.  This criterion also applies to improvements to published movies.  If a movie beats a published movie but still has a lot of noticeable flaws or is known to be improvable, I may reject it.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"4)  Viewer feedback is important, especially when a movie is borderline.  However, this is not a democratic system and I have been known to go against the audience.  This is usually when the audience response differs from my assessment of 1, 2, and 3.

Player 1 will aim for pure speed while player 2 goes for a playaround, fights enemies, and does insane stunts/crashes.  Player 2 will always get busted or crash out before player 1 finishes.  This way the movie is still as fast as possible while still being an entertaining playaround - the best of both worlds.  There may be ways that player 2 can help player 1 get faster times as well, perhaps bumping into his bike from behind to boost his speed?  Needless to say, this will be difficult to TAS and will require a lot of planning.

This might make the playaround part much more entertaining despite the worse graphics; so I may decide to do this game instead.
