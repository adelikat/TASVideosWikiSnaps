	"When I became a judge for TASVideos in 2006 the queue was well over 100 submissions large.  I and others worked hard to get it down to size.  It was then that I made a goal of having an empty queue to show as a sign of our hard work.  While it got to small numbers over the years, a delayed publication, or a new submission always threw a wrench in the attempt to get to 0.  Years went by and there was always something that prevented us from achieving what was becoming this holy grail of queue work.
