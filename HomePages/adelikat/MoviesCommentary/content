[p 
	"Zanac was my first 
	[a class=intlink href=/415S 
		"submission
	]a
	" to TASvideos (known as nesvideos then).  I was new to the concept of TASing and wanted to do an easier game before I took on my main project which was Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!  Zanac didn't already have a TAS (I didn't feel qualified to try to improve anyone else's).  I had played the game a lot as a child and thought it might be a good TAS.  Even though it was an auto-scroller, there were many things to consider in terms of speed.  It had many boss fights to optimize, fairies to instantly kill bosses (and the ability to choose to some degree which bosses they killed), and level warps.  There was also a glitch to make some turrets of the boss remain closed to save some time.  So I did an "all levels" movie as my first submission.  I used Famtasia since it was the rerecording emulator I was familiar with.  It was a little bit outdated at the time of the submission though.  At the time, I thought Zanac made a good TAS, but looking back, it didn't.  
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/Bisqwit 
		"Bisqwit

[p 
	"Later, I found out that FCEU could record soft and hard resets.  This meant I could record the level select code (13 soft resets) and make just a 1 level run.  This was controversial since it is a cheat code, but I felt that it was a better representation of the game to skip to the last (most interesting) level.  This way the game does not get too repetitive.  So I made a new 
	[a class=intlink href=/764S 
		"submission
	]a
	".  This eventually obsoleted the previous movie.  As of date this is the largest margin of obsoletion in TASvideos history. ;P
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The current 
	[a class=intlink href=/734M 
		"published movie
	]a
	" is an improvement based on a discovery I made later.  I found that I could upgrade the rapid fire fully before the boss fight using a trick (discussed in detail in the submission text).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Overall, I like this movie and think it makes a good TAS but certainly not one of the best.  The game itself is very pleasing to watch, and the run shows off some perfect reflexes.  It also demonstrates many interesting features of the game in just 3 minutes of gameplay.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The thing about this game that non-experts would not know is the insane amount of luck manipulation involved.  Almost every hit and every action by the opponent was random and very unlikely.  The Mike Tyson fight for instance is manipulated so he does his fastest pattern for every punch.  The odds of this happening in any given fight are about 1 in a million.  The Bald Bull 2 fight is even more random: every punch landed on Bald bull 2 for a star is extremely random - about a 1 in 32 chance - and there are about 14 of these punches thrown, not to mention his pattern must be manipulated.  All fighters must be manipulated when they hit the canvas.  The count on which the get up is random, and it must be manipulated so they get up on 2 (or 3 in some cases).  In fact, there is only 1 fight which as no randomness at all - Great Tiger.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This game is what led me to tool assisted speedruns.  This has been my favorite game of all time, and one that I competed heavily attempting to get console record times for each fight.  With emulation (Nesticle at the time) came the ability to test strategies and find the theoretical perfect record times.  Nesticle could record movies, but you couldn't use savestates, so I and others had to resort to making a savestate at the beginning of a fight and play it many times in order to get a good demo of a particular strategy.  I wished that there was a way to use savestates while recording a movie so I went looking for such a thing.  So TASes were the "holy grail" for me when I stumbled on the site.  Later I found that it also used things like slowdown and other tools to achieve perfect times.  So I began using Famtasia to make demos of each fighter and try to come up with different strategies.  At the time I never had any desire to make my own TAS.

[p 
	"Sometime after, 
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/Phil

		"Genisto

	[a class=intlink href=/215S 
		"submitted

	" the first ever full run of MTPO.  There were several strategies I hadn't even considered before.  I was blown away by this movie and it inspired me to make my own TAS.  Theirs did not use the clock-stopping glitch, so I wanted to make a movie that used it.  So I 
	[a class=intlink href=/505S 
		"submitted
	]a
	" my 2nd ever movie.  My intent was to have it published along side Phil & Genisto's movie.  This movie achieved some excellent clock times, including improving the Piston Honda time by 2 seconds.  However, as a TAS newbie, I didn't consider trying to make sure it was as fast as possible in real time as a secondary goal.  I didn't take time to manipulate it so the opponents don't try to get up and fall or try to manipulate them to get up on the earliest count.  At the time I didn't care about this but after it was brought up, I saw that it would make the run look more polished, so I set out to improve it.  This movie was eventually rejected.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Since I had an improved fight that wasn't due to the cs glitch, I saw that I could improve Phil & Genisto's movie too.  So I made both a cs glitch and non cs glitch movie at the same time.  This required a lot of TASing and a lot of testing.  I wanted to make these movies absolutely perfect.  I spent about 9 months making these movies and submitted both at the same time:  
	[a class=intlink href=/762S

	"The 
	[a class=intlink href=/762S

This was ironically a sad feeling though.  I had been looking for new things in this game for 15 years at this point.  It was sad to see it "done".  (Fortunately I was wrong).

Unfortunately, this movie was not interesting to the TAS community.  That is sad, since I think it is a good movie and compliments the published movie well.  I cancelled it when I saw that there wasn't any interest in it.

	"Later I stumbled on an improvement to Soda Popinski while messing around playing the game for fun, so made a new 
	[a class=intlink href=/1046S 
		"submission

	".  I improved Soda Popinski from 0:47.00 to 0:45.25.  I also found a way to improved Don Flamenco II from 58.97 to 58.61.  I also corrected a real time (not clock time) error on Super Macho Man that no one noticed.  At one point he did 4 super spins when it is possible to manipulate it so that he did only 3.

	$LF

]h4
[p 
	"This is still a favorite of mine.  I think this game is well suited for TASing because it has so many different types of levels.  The racing levels are hard to optimize since they are 3D-ish.  There are also traditional boss fights.  
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There are more linear levels and some odd ones.  Like saving children from evil boats and UFO's (yeah this is a weird game).  These are my favorite levels because I can play around.  I let all but 1 child die (I am such a nice guy :P) in order to save some seconds on the points tally.  I then perform some crazy antics as I try to prevent the boats from taking the remaining child.  At one point I let a boat get the child and then ram it to the wall; keeping it from movies away.  Anyone who has played this game would know who impossible that is to do.  So that is a great TAS moment.

]p
[p 
	"When I began my TAS Mike Tyson's Punch-out!! I thought it would be my only TAS.  I had no interest in doing other games.  But in the process of making my submissions of this game, I found how addicting the process is :)  After my first MTPO movie was published I was hooked on making TASes.  I started to look for other games to TAS as well.  I was very familiar with Cobra Triangle  and remember being disappointed when I watched the published movie at the time.  There were many tricks I was familiar with not utilized in that movie.  So I began and eventually submitted my first Cobra Triangle 
	[a class=intlink href=/769S 
		"movie
	]a
	".  It was a solid 44 seconds faster than 
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/Walker Boh 
		"Walker Boh

	"'s movie.  
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"After this submission I found a new strategy for level 1 to get more speed upgrades.  This was a big improvement so I cancelled it and later submitted what is still the currently published 
	[a class=intlink href=/425M 
		"movie
	]a
	" which improved the previous by 10 seconds.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Interestingly, I used FCEU .12 and didn't know anything about RAM addresses.  Later I set out to improve it with the new tools of .16.  I tried the first 4 levels and couldn't improve it by a single frame :O  So I decided that this was indeed a high quality TAS.  So I know of no way to improve it and therefore have no plans to redo it.

]h4
[p 
	"This game has a 16 frame rule (the same type as the Super Mario Bros. 21-frame rule).  This was a frustrating thing to discover.  I really enjoy this movie.  It is a 3D environment even though it is a 2D platform.  This makes the TAS logic unique compared with other NES games.  The route planning is tricky as a result and very tedious to TAS.  The results are worth it, as it makes a great TAS.

[p 
	"After Cobra Triangle, I decided to give this game a try so this was my 4th game I  completed a TAS for.  Again, I was very familiar with the game and thought the published run could stand to be improved.  So I made a 
	[a class=intlink href=/772S 
		"submission

	".  I found some improvements immediately (one suggested by 
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/JXQ 
		"JXQ

	" who was a complete newbie at the time :)) and made a revised 
	[a class=intlink href=/774S 
		"version
	]a
	".  This one was published and stood for a long time.  Later, with the aid of new tools like memory watch and made the previous published 
	[a class=intlink href=/819M 
		"movie
	]a
	".  Due to the 16 frame rule, I was pretty sure this movie would not be improved.  Unfortunately I was wrong and was later pwned by 
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/Deign 
		"Deign
	]a
	".  He hexed in some of my levels, so I got to be co-author without lifting a finger; pretty sweet deal.  The result is

[p 
	"I began this TAS after having more published movies (Zanac, MTPO, Marble Madness, Cobra Triangle).  I was starting to feel confident in my TASing abilities so I wanted to push my limits and do a larger project.  This certainly fit the bill!  I spent almost a year doing this project and it was a journey to say the least.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"It was worth the effort.  This is one of the movies I am most proud of.  I think it is the most extreme example of luck manipulation on TASvideos.  So many unlikely events happen like there are everyday occurences.  Critical hits happen every time they are useful and each one has a 1/64 chances of success (some have a 1/256).  All random encounters are avoided unless I need an item and want an enemy to drop one (which is often extremely unlikely) or I want to kill my characters to avoid backtracking.  In this case I have my characters hit themselves and manipulate it for a critical hit, which I find hilarious. :)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Not only is luck manipulated, but I went through a tedious process of not only finding the desired outcome but minimizing the amount of frames it takes to manipulate it.  I did this by advancing previous menus with different buttons, holding them for different amounts of frames etc.  The result is that nothing takes more than 20 frames to be manipulated.  The result in phenomenal, because at full speed you never see a noticeable wait period between actions.  This makes the TAS look very polished.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Now that new tools are available (such as basicbot), luck manipulation could be taken much further than this.  But due to poor emulation, movies of this game are terrible about desyncing.  I attempted a v3, but couldn't handle losing my work constantly so I have no intentions of ever improving this.

I thought it would be an easy game to TAS, but it was actually one of the more difficult projects I have done.  There is a lot of planning to do in terms of item drops and weapon use.  There are numerous tricks and options so many things must be tested.  Also the game is a pain to control during vertical sections (which are abundant).  It was also a lot of fun to do (mostly), and I am really happy with the results.  I managed to improve Walker's previous run by over 37 seconds.  I consider this TAS a gem.  Not many people know the game but it is an awesome game for TASing.
