	"Zanac was my first 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=submission|href=/415S)
	" to TASvideos (known as nesvideos then).  I was new to the concept of TASing and wanted to do an easier game before I took on my main project which was Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!  Zanac didn't already have a TAS (I didn't feel qualified to try to improve anyone else's).  I had played the game a lot as a child and thought it might be a good TAS.  Even though it was an auto-scroller, there were many things to consider in terms of speed.  It had many boss fights to optimize, fairies to instantly kill bosses (and the ability to choose to some degree which bosses they killed), and level warps.  There was also a glitch to make some turrets of the boss remain closed to save some time.  So I did an "all levels" movie as my first submission.  I used Famtasia since it was the rerecording emulator I was familiar with.  It was a little bit outdated at the time of the submission though.  At the time, I thought Zanac made a good TAS, but looking back, it didn't.

This was controversial since it is a cheat code, but I felt that it was a better representation of the game to skip to the last (most interesting) level.  This way the game does not get too repetitive.  So I made a new

	"The thing about this game that non-experts would not know is the insane amount of luck manipulation involved.  Almost every hit and every action by the opponent was random and very unlikely.  The Mike Tyson fight for instance is manipulated so he does his fastest pattern for every punch.  The odds of this happening in any given fight are about 1 in a million.  The Bald Bull 2 fight is even more random: every punch landed on Bald bull 2 for a star is extremely random - about a 1 in 32 chance - and there are about 14 of these punches thrown, not to mention his pattern must be manipulated.  All fighters must be manipulated when they hit the canvas.  The count on which the get up is random, and it must be manipulated so they get up on 2 (or 3 in some cases).  In fact, there is only 1 fight which as no randomness at all - Great Tiger.

	"This game is what led me to tool assisted speedruns.  This has been my favorite game of all time, and one that I competed heavily attempting to get console record times for each fight.  With emulation (Nesticle at the time) came the ability to test strategies and find the theoretical perfect record times.  Nesticle could record movies, but you couldn't use savestates, so I and others had to resort to making a savestate at the beginning of a fight and play it many times in order to get a good demo of a particular strategy.  I wished that there was a way to use savestates while recording a movie so I went looking for such a thing.  So TASes were the "holy grail" for me when I stumbled on the site.  Later I found that it also used things like slowdown and other tools to achieve perfect times.  So I began using Famtasia to make demos of each fighter and try to come up with different strategies.  At the time I never had any desire to make my own TAS.

However, as a TAS newbie, I didn't consider trying to make sure it was as fast as possible in real time as a secondary goal.  I didn't take time to manipulate it so the opponents don't try to get up and fall or try to manipulate them to get up on the earliest count.  At the time I didn't care about this but after it was brought up, I saw that it would make the run look more polished, so I set out to improve it.  This movie was eventually rejected.

I then perform some crazy antics as I try to prevent the boats from taking the remaining child.  At one point I let a boat get the child and then ram it to the wall; keeping it from movies away.  Anyone who has played this game would know who impossible that is to do.  So that is a great TAS moment.

	"It was worth the effort.  This is one of the movies I am most proud of.  I think it is the most extreme example of luck manipulation on TASvideos.  So many unlikely events happen like there are everyday occurences.  Critical hits happen every time they are useful and each one has a 1/64 chances of success (some have a 1/256).  All random encounters are avoided unless I need an item and want an enemy to drop one (which is often extremely unlikely) or I want to kill my characters to avoid backtracking.  In this case I have my characters hit themselves and manipulate it for a critical hit, which I find hilarious. :)

I did this by advancing previous menus with different buttons, holding them for different amounts of frames etc.  The result is that nothing takes more than 20 frames to be manipulated.  The result in phenomenal, because at full speed you never see a noticeable wait period between actions.  This makes the TAS look very polished.
