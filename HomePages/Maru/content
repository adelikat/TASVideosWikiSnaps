	"Super Mario Bros. "warps, RTA Rules" in 4:57.54 by Maru - This run converts to 4:54.265 using the SMB1 community's RTA timing conventions and is a theoretically perfect run of the game. It is a benchmark used to compare RTA speedrun world records. It is unlikely this will ever be improved.

	"Super Mario Bros. 2 "game end glitch" in 35.74 by Maru and total - This TAS achieves arbitrary code execution (ACE) in SMB2USA through subframe inputs. This TAS was used as the base for a live demonstration involving displaying Discord messages on a NES at ESA. This was in response to a challenge set forth by Discord on Twitter/X:

	"Super Mario Bros. 3 "warps" in 10:24.34 by Lord Tom, Maru, and Tompa - This is a warps run of SMB3 without ACE that gets 99 lives magnificently in the autoscrollers and has a unique route for 8-F. This TAS was showcased at AGDQ using the TASBot replay device and has also been showcased at other charity events.

[div class=p 
	"Super Mario All Stars: Super Mario Bros. 3 "warps" in 10:23.51 by Maru - This is the All Stars counterpart of the NES SMB3 TAS that uses left+right for a speed boost. This was mostly made as a test to determine whether the All Stars version was faster than the NES version, and it turns out it was.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Mega Man "game end glitch" in 27.04 by pirohiko and Maru - This TAS uses a more efficient setup to reach arbitrary code execution. The previous TAS relied on generating the object needed for ACE to work through a 1 byte framecounter. However, this TAS is able to generate it through second controller input, saving several seconds.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Mega Man in 9:45.35 by Shinryuu, pirohiko, Maru, and FinalFighter - This TAS completes all stages without ACE, but uses object glitches to generate magnet beams and to call level ending routines when possible. The run is extremely technical, with bruteforcing and graphical fixing scripts being used.
