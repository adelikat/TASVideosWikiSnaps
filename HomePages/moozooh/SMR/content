	"The "slide" observable after crouching at high speed can be reduced if recharging on a slope. To do this, you need to press forward + dash + L or R at the moment of recharging to go into running state, then down + dash + L or R on the next frame to store the charge, and L or R without any other buttons on the next frame. This can be used to cut off 18 pixels off the sliding distance.

By placing one or two bombs, letting them propel Samus and pressing jump when her upward acceleration reaches zero, you can successfully extend her jump height by about two full tiles. Obviously, it also works with any amount of bombjumps prior to springball jumping. You can't do double springball jump in this fashion, though.

	"Quickly alternating spinning and unspinning when jumping with prior dash, it's possible to keep the speed while temporarily reducing aerial momentum. Changing from standing jump to spin resets it, so by doing it on each second frame, Samus's average momentum can be brought to a mere 0.24576 px/f, compared to 1.24576 (spinjump or falling state) and 1.16384 (standing jump). This can be successfully applied in circumstances requiring you to jump down at low speed to clear a low ceiling.
