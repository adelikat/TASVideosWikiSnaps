	"Do note that the staff are good at detecting insincerity. They will not entertain lengthy debates or attempts to turn the appeal into a contest of rhetorical ability. What they want to see is a clear indication that you understand what you did wrong and why it was wrong, and an earnest will not to let it happen again. How to demonstrate that is entirely up to you. Consequently, the greater the transgression that led to the ban, the greater the burden of proof you need to show that you have changed. Abusing the appeals without showing clear and proportionate signs of improvement will only extend the ban, and can potentially make it irrevocable. For example, immediately complaining about one administrator to another administrator is not a good idea; bans and unbans are both consensus decisions by the moderator team, and all senior staff members participate in these discussions and share the information with each other.
