DDP is followed by DoDonPachi Dai-Ou-Jou (whose PS2 port has been

	"Some time ago I moved to an absolute yet more versatile perception-based rating scale. I find that it works rather well without contradictions. My standards aren't exceptionally high (the basic range is 6—8 for both values), but I don't grant 9 and 10 lightly, either. The amounts listed in parentheses account only for separate movies (no two versions of the same movie, the one with higher marks is taken into account; tech marks are adjusted for obsolete movies).
