	"My gaming "career" started in mid-90s, when I didn't yet have a PC but still was playing on my SNES. I only had a few games (less than a dozen in total), so I did my best to hoyle the crap out of them. Worked really well on games like 
	[a class=extlink href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniracers rel=nofollow 
		"Uniracers
	]a
	". Heh, wasn't I naive back then, thinking that just beating the games on hardest difficulties was a feat! Still, I was one of the best players among my friends, which perhaps saved me from a severe ego deflation a couple years later.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"During the said couple of years, I wasn't engaged in any activities even remotely similar to that, until I discovered two things: 
	[a class=extlink href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasto_Mania rel=nofollow 
		"Elasto Mania
	]a
	" and the emulation scene.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Not that they were somehow related; more like my competitiveness returned to me while I was playing Elma, and it also helped me hone my mediocre gaming skills to the point that I ended up being a junior member in 
	[a class=extlink href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimsonland rel=nofollow 
		"Crimsonland
	]a
	" Elite Club. However, the official forum boards were hacked somewhere in 2004, so hardly anyone aside from Twinsen (then-president of the club and also one of the former champions) could confirm my achievements from that time. That being said, I already made 
	[a class=intlink href=/Moozooh/About.html#PersonalRecords 
		"new personal records
	]a
	" since then.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Rediscovering the emulation scene revived my interest in old games; and even though I couldn't play them as well as when I was younger (and the lack of a decent controller didn't help that fact, either — playing on a keyboard isn't always handy), I still enjoyed playing the games I had already beaten and wanted to beat.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"One interesting thing that connected all this together was a program that gave me the basic concept of TASing. It was called Gear, now renamed to 
	[a class=extlink href=http://www.google.com/search?&rls=en&q=%22speed+gear%22&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8 rel=nofollow 
		"Speed Gear
	]a
	". Essentially, this little tool made most Windows applications run slower or faster, with the ability to adjust the speed to one's liking. I didn't use it to submit cheated times in Elma or Crimsonland, but the sheer idea of tool-assisted playing had unconsciously pursued me until…

[p 
	"…I discovered 
	[a class=extlink href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid_Fusion rel=nofollow 
		"Metroid Fusion
	]a
	" somewhere in early 2003. While Metroid was one of my all-time favorite franchises, I couldn't resist downloading and playing it on VBA. When I beat it (took me "only" two days!), I started to browse the internet for additional information I hadn't discovered myself. Thanks to 
	[a class=extlink href=http://www.gamefaqs.com/ rel=nofollow 
		"GameFAQs
	]a
	", I learned that the game had the same old thing built into it: a timer with a reward system, much like that in the precedent Metroid titles. Since I was already suffering from severe 
	[a class=extlink href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention-Deficit_Disorder rel=nofollow 
		"ADD
	]a
	" back then, I was already using savestates in casual play without any back thought; it was then when I suddenly got an idea of getting 100% of items in under two hours to trigger the best ending. I didn't know of rerecording (apparently, VBA didn't even have that function back then), so I just went through the game with the primitive TASing concept: go the fastest known route using savestates and slowdown to eliminate all the mistakes. I didn't finish that run (stopped at about 30%), but it was something I knew I would enjoy watching.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In early 2004, the similar thing happened with the release of 
	[a class=extlink href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid:_Zero_Mission rel=nofollow 
		"Metroid Zero Mission
	]a
	". Once again I was searching the net for information, and while doing that, I discovered another site I use to visit frequently now — 
	[a class=extlink href=http://metroid2002.com/ rel=nofollow 
		"M2K2
	]a
	". I didn't stay there at that time, though, but it helped me to discover another great site rather closely related to TASVideos: 
	[a class=extlink href=http://www.speeddemosarchive.com/ rel=nofollow 
		"SDA
	]a
	". Back then, my internet connection was neither good nor stable, so I didn't download anything from there (especially considering their then-poor capturing and compression schemes leading to low quality or bloated files). Then I just forgot about speedruns for about a year.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In mid-2005, I accidentally stumbled across some speedruns again while browsing 
	[a class=extlink href=http://archive.org/ rel=nofollow 
		"Archive.org
	]a
	", and that time it was Genisto's 
	[a class=intlink href=/342M 
		"SMB3 TAS
	]a
	". While I wasn't a great fan of SMB3 (or a fan of any Mario game at all), the video kept me interested in further examination of this kind of speedruns, so I went to this site and started browsing the videos. I lurked on the forums for a couple of weeks or so, and, after having experienced a lot of desync problems, finally registered on the site.

		"Perfect Cherry Blossom

	" and other games of the Touhou Project some awesome SDA members introduced me to. As of now, I'm playing these and other shmups very often, and am working on score-attacks for some of them. I have also participated in 
	[a class=extlink href=http://shmups.com/ rel=nofollow 
		"Shmups.com

It took me about a year to start fully grasping the concept in its entirety, and start being able to expertize the runs from a technical standpoint. As of now, I've learnt how to use all the tools necessary to produce my own TASes, and currently am in the process of doing one, with one more on hold. This is cool. Note that my ADD still prevents me from TASing effectively, but on the other hand, I try to keep the production level as high as I can since the pace of production is out of question, anyway.
