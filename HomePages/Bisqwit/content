				$LF
				"I often use this nickname that I chose in early 1990s, Bisqwit,

				"In late 2008, five years after I 
				[a class=intlink href=/SiteHistory

				",
				$LF
				"the God of Israel, YHWH Elohim, renewed my spirit (Romans 12:2, Psalms 51:10, Eze. 11:19–20)

				"and set in motion a new direction and plan for my life.
				$LF
				"As part of that motion, I eventually determined that it would be necessary for me to sort
				$LF
				"and prune my obligations. Thus I gave the TASVideos site out in 2009 to new 
				[a class=intlink href=/Users 
					"owners
				]a
				" elected from within its community.

				"Since then, things have been changing for me rapidly at times and slowly at other times,

				"I have been called a jack of all trades, for I love to seek a deep understanding
				$LF
				"about almost everything, but some things clearly fascinate me more than others.
