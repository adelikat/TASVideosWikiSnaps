(Yes, Riddel is even more powerful than Marcy, but there's no black-innate guardian.) I gained the Vigora element as a reward, but then I never found use for it.

				" In the Terra Tower, I keep Leena as Serge's companion rather than Marcy, despite Marcy having better stats in every way. I just like the sight of the Crystalpan C6 (yeah, Rainbow-forged frying pan!) better than the Spectral Gloves which aren't rendered at all. It is an entertainment choice. It also brings some closure to the movie: It begins with Serge & Leena, and it ends with Serge & Leena. And it's a blue-innate character because of two summons. Razzly is the third companion because she also has two summons due to being green-innate (I captured ☆Sonja earlier), and she regenerates stamina a lot faster than Karsh, who has stronger magic.

]p
[ul

		" At first, the save state keys, and frame advance, worked at two frame delay. This made it extremely difficult to perform frame precise control. Later, I managed to fix this problem.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" pSX savestates do not save/restore the echo buffer. This means that sometimes, in the stitched AVI, you will suddenly hear an echo of an unrealized reality. That is because a savestate was loaded when an sound effect or music was playing, returning into some scene that has strong echo. When I learned of this problem, I started alleviating it by loading the state multiple times to let the echo fade away before continuing playing. However, due to laziness or other problems it didn't go away entirely. This problem I cannot fix without pSX source code.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" During battles, the element selection screens are rather laggy. The game loves ignoring quick alterations of input. It took me hours (of in-game time) to find the pattern of input that gets the most fluent element selection and activation, though it's still not perfect.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" The equipping screens are similarly laggy. For some odd reason, the game likes to spend a lot of time rendering screens, and ignoring all input while some sound effect plays. Very late to the game, I discovered means to equip characters without having to wait 4 seconds for the dzing sound to play after every single piece of changed equipment, but those improvements are rather marginal.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" If pSX has the setting "Pause when not focused" enabled, then every time you switch windows, a lag of 1―2 frames between audio and video is introduced. You have to disable that setting to avoid the accumulation of A/V desyncs. To make matters worse, pSX ignores that setting upon start. You have to visit the configuration screen once, change nothing, and click "Ok" for the setting to actually take effect. I forget this quirk rather often, and was not aware of it in the beginning phases of this movie. Therefore the first segments of this movie accumulate up to two seconds of A/V desync, but the desync grows much slower after that.

			[li 
				" (Fight with Dwarf Tank.) The strategy of this battle was largely unplanned, and I made a mistake in it allowing Leena to die from poison. Unfortunately when I noticed that it could not be prevented without using healing elements, I no longer had any savestates that I could have used to redo the battle from start.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				" (Fight with Miguel.) Miguel was a tough one. He does that ☯HolyDragSwd technique which can inflict 700 hp of damage at once, instantly killing a PC. I made the mistake of overwriting relevant savestates after I equipped my party, so I didn't have any Revive elements with me.
				[br 
				]br
				" I wanted to trap HolyLight in this battle, and to do that, I needed to have the party survive any elements that Miguel throws before casting HolyLight. Using the Imbecile element, I managed to make them survive. Intentionally prolonging this battle meant that I had to be extra careful when using more powerful elements such as ☆FrogPrince, lest Miguel be killed prematurely. This dilemma occurs in all battles where I want to trap elements.

				" (Fight with Grobyc.) I wanted him to drop me a Freefall, but he did not cooperate. Oh well, I'll try somewhere else. In the second fight with Guillot, I killed it with ☆FrogPrince. Even though it was a boss fight of sorts, I got my ＠Shiny Dew. Only one ingredient missing for Rainbow Swallow (besides the fabled Hammer), and I'll get it at Gaia's Navel.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				" (Fight with WaterDragon.) I set out to capture either Iceberg or Deluge from the dragon – preferably Iceberg because I'm saving ⍌Deluge for the last dragon – and also to snatch a BluePlate. It turned out to be a difficult task. WaterDragon's behavior is difficult to predict. I had to replay this battle many times. In one of the versions, I managed to capture the Deluge element, but she cast another soon thereafter, annihilating my party. In the final version, I managed to accomplish all I wanted. The party emerged fully healed (save Flu on two characters) from the battle, whereas the dragon emerged beaten and 
				[del 
					"twice
				]del
				" robbed, and humiliated with the Volcano element on a red field and Magnify on.
				[br 
				]br
				" By the way, I hate it when the characters get a Flu. It's such an annoying effect that you practically need to visit the status screen to heal it, wasting time – except that technically, in a TAS, you don't need to (when the effect is inflicted upon a character you won't bring into a battle anymore). You can just counteract the muddled controls and everything looks just fine! And since you can, you 
				[em 
					"should
				]em
				". It's just a lot of work to do that. Which is why I hate it.

				" (Fight with GreenDragon.) After a number of failed attempts for various reasons, I finally got Green Dragon killed. I also stole a Forest Charm (the last missing piece for a single item of Rainbow equipment), a Power Seal, a Cloud Cape (for Starky & Razzly), and trapped ☆Sonja.
				[br 
				]br
				" By the way, there's a bug in the green dragon fight. When Leah goes to see the dragon and the party follows, you can just walk away (until the dragon commands you to "come hither"), and you will see Leah is in two places at the same time. She's walking around at the Wingapede landing site (but doesn't react to the action trigger), but she's also staring at the green dragon in the next screen.
				$LF

				" (Fight with FireDragon.) 1800 hp damage was an awesome sight. Basically FireDragon  was a pushover. Fargo was even poisoned for the whole duration of the fight and still nobody died.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				" (Fight with BlackDragon.) Oops, now would have been a good time to equip that AngelCharm I picked up at Fort Dragonia. Too bad I already disassembled it. So instead of magical, I made the battle physical. I equipped

				"Starky with attack power boosters and launched the fight. The dragon was not kidding when it said groggy. It was a pushover. In the end, it took slightly longer than I hoped though, because trapping the Freefall element required artificially prolonging the battle long enough until the dragon tries to use that element.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				" (Fight with SkyDragon.) I didn't switch characters this time, and Lynx didn't have Mastermune, so this fight was longer than in Molotov|'s movie. Still, I beat it with no casualties, and captured the UltraNova element in the process.

				" (Nudity!) Yay, Serge is back. Now I took the opportunity to do some sidequests I had no chance to do for a long time. Such as get Leena's L7 tech, and get ready to forge rainbow equipment. So I created a Rainbow Swallow and a Prism Vest. (In retrospect, I can see how Mastermune would have been a better choice after all.) I did some needless going back and forth though, bad planning. Oh, and four ☯FlagBearers. These sidequests took me 10 minutes. For comparison, beating the imposter took 1.5 minutes.

				". I pulled off three (3) summons (☆BlueWhale, ☆Sonja and ☆Saints) before it perished. I actually first used ☆Genie (L8) instead of ☆Sonja (L7), but I then redid it (after a couple failed attempts), because after all the trouble I went through to capture ☆Sonja in the first place, I figured that it might be best to show her here. The battle did not become slower because of that. For this, I gained the Vigora element. Let's hope I can put it to some use later. Vigora + ☯MaidenHeart... Hmm. Perv-connotations not intended.

				" (Fight with Dragon God.) Before the fight, I prepared like for a war by explicitly equipping each character with custom selected elements, though I made a few mistakes.

	$LF
	"But it writes a log file detailing when exactly were quicksaves created&loaded. By reading the log file, a program can stitch together the actual successive segments from the recording, to produce the intended movie. With high quality savestates in the emulator (i.e. loading a state restores the emulation, or at least video and audio, precisely to the state it was when the state was created), the stitching becomes seamless.

	$LF
	"A: Yeah. The ~10 hour recording so far takes 80 gigabytes of space. Of course I could shorten it by removing the undone segments, but I do have space, so I want to keep it. Or I could shorten it by recording with better compression, but this is what I have now.

		"Q: I see you are recording the video straight into H.264 format. But video frames in H.264 depend on preceding frames. Doesn't the stitching mess up the reference frames logic of the codec?
		[br 
		]br
	]em
	$LF
	"A: The recorder forces the encoder to create keyframes every time a savestate is created. This way, each segment always begins from a keyframe, and the stitching is flawless (barring emulation bugs). This is accomplished by using the x264 library directly instead of via mencoder.
