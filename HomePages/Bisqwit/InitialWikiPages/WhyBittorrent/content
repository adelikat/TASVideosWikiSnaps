	"The uplink of this server is about 38 kB/s. Divide that by hundreds of
	$LF
	"customers, and you start seeing how "fast" you could download. I'd estimate
	$LF
	"about 0.1 kB/s. (And we're not yet talking about how long you
	$LF
	"would have to wait for the webserver to even answer your requests.)
