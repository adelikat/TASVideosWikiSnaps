		" Well, back on December 2010 (day 22, I think), when I watched a speedrun of Super Bomberman (SNES) on Google Video, I noted the url of TASVideos and when I entered for the first time, that was very surprising. I found several runs of lots of games (principally SNES, since is my favorite console that I played on emulator for years). On a short period of time, TASVideos changed my life because how much impressive is these runs!
