	"It was about 8 years ago when I first discovered TASVideos. I thought it looked pretty cool seeing the games I grew up with being pummeled at an inhuman rate. At the same time, I was beginning to be an outcast where I lived and was getting pretty depressed. But then I remembered TASVideos. I thought to myself that this would be a place where I can finally be accepted. And seeing as how I got a total of 14 TASes published, I can safely say that it kinda worked. :)
