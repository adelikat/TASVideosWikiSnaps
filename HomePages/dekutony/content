	"Hello, I am Kurabupengin. I'm also known as dekutony. I like penguins... and Kirby, and plush toys yeah I'm a weird guy. Known as an expert noob and former Vested Editor in this site. Also the only Guatemalan TASer in the world. I have like 20 or something. Also a Christian.
	$LF
	"I like TASing games... that haven't been TASed before, very obscure and underrated games or potential games with no published TAS here. I don't really remember what was the first TAS I saw but what should matter is how I even got here. I was looking for some help with DeSmuME, so I googled my issue... that somehow TASVideos.org was a result, and the rest is history lol. Trying to improve and behave better over time.
