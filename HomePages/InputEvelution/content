	"Hi! I'm Evelyn, a trans woman living on Kaurna land with a very strong interest in TASing. The Papa Louie cooking games, Eurekamultimedia's 3D GameStudio library and Wii Party are what I'm most interested in at the moment, though I do work on other stuff from time to time. I'm often quite busy with my real life, so I don't get to work on TAS projects quite as much as I'd like to. Projects listed here may take a rather long time to complete or start.
