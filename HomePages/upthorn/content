		" Bust A Move (SNES) - On Hold. I can't find the RNG ram address, so I have no way of telling what color will come up next. I had started under the assumption that it simply ran modulus on the framecount, but that is obviously not the case.
		$LF

	[li 
		" Knuckles Chaotix (low glitch) - My first version is very glitchy, and rather fast, but not very entertaining, because of the constant wall zipping.

		" Knuckles Chaotix (All chaos rings) - The special stages are really the most entertaining part of this game.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Knuckles Chaotix (improvement) - My first version is pretty far from optimum. When I made it, my only means of input was a keyboard which only allows for 4 keys pressed at once. (3 buttons + frame advance). I now have a USB control pad at my disposal. Perhaps I could test, as well, to see if some of the rubber band stuff controls better with 2 players.

	[li 
		" Ristar improvement - Better velocity control is now possible due to ram watch. Better luck manipulation is possible by not being lazy.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Sonic 2 improvement - I know that there are at least 15 seconds of improvement possible due to some previously unknown glitches. Better velocity control may also be possible due to the advents of Ram watch and soniccamhack. Before I start I'll want to get nitsuja's permission to use parts of his run unchanged if they aren't improvable.
