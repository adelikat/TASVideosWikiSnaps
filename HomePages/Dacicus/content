It seems like FCEU 0.98.15 enables PAL mode every time you replay or restart the movie, however, but it doesn't toggle the PAL Emulation checkmark in the Config menu if you disabled it previously.  If you get a desynch on the character select screen, try this: Stop Movie -> Replay Movie -> Enable PAL Emulation -> Disable PAL Emulation.  You could also do NES -> Power instead of the Stop and Replay steps.
