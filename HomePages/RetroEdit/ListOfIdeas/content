Some games are marked as "good" or "bad"; the pages also attempt to maintain forum links, WIP movies, and alternate region versions. Most of them delete games from the list once they've been published.

	" entries have basically obsoleted these pages. Game entries automatically catalog linked user files, submissions, and publications; they can link to the game's forum thread(s), they catalog separate versions of the same game (regions and revisions generally), and it's possible to get auto-generated lists of every game entry for a particular platform. In contrast, the ListOfIdeas subpages have to be maintained by hand and are often poorly maintained as a result.
