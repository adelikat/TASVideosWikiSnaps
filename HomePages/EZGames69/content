	". My name is Colin.  Most refer to me as "EZGames69", "EZGames", or just EZ.  I'm a dude who likes retro video games and loves learning all about them.  Since speed running is all about running games old and new, I tried to get involved as much as I could.

	"I first joined TASVideos around September of 2017 where my first movie was published: http://tasvideos.org/3515M.html.  At the time it was the coolest experience to get a movie I made onto the website.  while the movie itself may not be that significant, It was definitely significant to me.  Ever since then, I've learned alot about how games work and have had so much fun getting major nostalgia from working with the systems I grew up with.

	"One of the things I aim for on this site is to find games that dont have movies.  It doesnt matter if the game would make a good speedrun or not, it just matters if there isnt one.  there are so many games out there that either no one knows about or dont care enough to TAS.  I believe that almost every game should be represented with a movie of its own.  Some games that make for a really good speed game may not have alot of players for it, making the chances of someone coming in an TASing it small.  I want to do as much as I can to find games without movies and make them.  the benifit to this is it gives me more experience with different kinds of games mechanics, so maybe in the future things I learned from doing one game can carry on to the next one I do.
