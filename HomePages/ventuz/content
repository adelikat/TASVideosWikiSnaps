	"3740 - Attacking the fireball seem to be cause of minor lag, check to see if avoiding to kill it will gain any frames faster?

	"5160 - Dinosaur battle, check to see if he would dash up any quicker if not attack him at all?

	"9360 - Flying demon battle, do not grab explosion magic - it was never used in the run.

	"12530 - Jumping in ceiling, it seem like I had slow-down there - it could be jumping too high back there. Fix it there? Also try to be in air as much as possible, landing cause 1~2 frame behind each time.

	"13630 - Red axe man battle, I think it would be possible to manipulate him into throwing axe as soon as possible so to get around behind earlier.

	"16600 - Red armor battle, I am thinking that it could be faster if this enemy didn't duck and shoot so often, try to manipulate him?

	"18040 - Blue wizard, use thunder special twice - should be big time improvement.

	"18980 - I had switched to explosion magic, but it was deselected when final boss shows up. Should save at least 5 frames not doing that.
