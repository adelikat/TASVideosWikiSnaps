	"Hi.  This is my homepage.  I just recently became a judge for TASVideos.  I actually thought quite a bit about it before applying, but thought I could be a good person for the position.  In an odd way, judging movie submissions reminds me of when I worked, way back when, as a projectionist for a cinema.  Before new movies would release on Fridays, we'd usually get them in earlier in the week in reel cans (back before films became all-digital).  From there, the film would have to be "built" (reels attached together) and then previewed to ensure that they were no errors.

	"With a giant, Dolby-surround auditorium to myself, I got to watch many amazing films this way!  Including: Star Wars: Episode II, Lord of the Rings, and a host of other various films.
