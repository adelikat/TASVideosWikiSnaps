	"This page is a compilation of various times and scores that I've achieved in various games.  All the times and scores on this page were achieved without save states and at normal speed, and all games except for Diddy Kong Racing were played without autofire unless specified otherwise.  Games that I don't mention an emulator and rom for were played on the original console.  I live in the United States, so my games are NTSC.  Feel free to contact me through AIM (mjf345) if you want to talk with me about any of these games.
