The game does have some very considerable RNG elements such as the bubbles and the final boss attacks to worry about.

There is potential for a 100% TAS that collects the all bonus coins to access the bonus world after the Mr. Apocalypse fight, though it would be a more accurate of a 100% run if the bonus coins are also collected in the bonus world as well. The 100% rules on SRC do not require those coins but it is something to keep in mind. From the looks of it the red fist is the most damaging and the thunder fist is at least better than the flame fist in terms of damage. There seems to be a possible RNG element since stars can be spent on a roll with random effects, such as having the spinning bolas and invincibility.

A TAS of the Game Gear version might be different enough to warrant its own thing since one of the possible RTA strats is switching off the axe in stage 4-1 for the sword to use it for a room in stage 4-2. I haven't verified if it's actually the fastest strat with a TAS look but it's definitely more consistent for me in RTA.
