	" around 2008. 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Noxxa|href=/HomePages/Noxxa/AllPlatformsChallenge)
	" then started their own page for the challenge around 2016. Having followed this site since I think 2009-2010, I've taken a lot of inspiration and entertainment by the many folks who have contributed to this site. This is my personal page on doing that challenge as well.

	"I'm not doing this just to copycat some of the greats on here, though. I'm always looking for neat and/or interesting games that folks have probably overlooked for one reason or another. One way to show them off is simply just make a publishable TAS for them so they get more exposure. I want to promote the history and culture of gaming, and TASing is a small but unique way of doing that.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The real challenge is that there are a LOT more TASable platforms than there were in 2008 and 2016. At some point I gotta learn to do traditional TASing methods since not everything has a TAStudio-like setup available. I don't expect to ever see this challenge to the complete end but I can certainly try. At the very least I want to get all the Sega consoles TASed.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Any TASes that I list are the first ones I got published for the platform. I also have additional notes that can be interesting. I also conveniently made separate tabs for each group I can think of, though it may not be perfect. Platforms on each list are roughly in release date order.
