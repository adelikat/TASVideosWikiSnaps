	"I am mainly a console speedrunner, but I have pretty recently picked up TASing. I mainly enjoy working on many of the Super Mario games series, these games have always been some of my favorites. I have a number of console speedrun "world records" (most likely WRs anyhow) that I have submitted to www.speeddemosarchive.com.
