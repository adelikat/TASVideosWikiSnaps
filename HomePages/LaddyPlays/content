	"And that's where I'll tell you right now: My name is Laddy, a TAS enthusiast who has been active in the community since January 2023. I was born somewhere in France in August 30, 2005 (18) and still live there right now. I am able to speak French and English.

	"I watched TASes since the age of 6 in 2011... what a long time it is since then now. But it's still amazing that I finally made my decision to join the TAS community after so long, to be able to make some generous contributions. This is just one of my main activities, asides from drawing, photo editing, composing music and walking out. My goal here isn't really to become a pro TASer, but rather to make movies as a form of passion to look deep into the technical side of video games.
