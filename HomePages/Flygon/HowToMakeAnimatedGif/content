	"Showing a short segment of gameplay can be useful both for tutorial pages and for illustration of submissions.  One way to do this is, in lieu of an all-out streaming video, is to create an animated GIF.  This page documents one method for creating such an animation from a TAS.

	"First, you should dump an AVI using the CamStudio codec for the segment of movie that you wish to turn into an animated GIF.  Don't be worried about capturing too much or too little; this can be clipped down in the next step.

[p 
	"Next, you want to open up the dumped AVI in VirtualDub.  You can trim off excess footage by selecting the segments that should be removed using the menu options 
	[em 
		"Set selection start
	]em
	" and 
	[em 
		"Set selection end

	"From here on, you can optionally reduce the frame rate, which is recommended for tutorial related purposes such as showing off a trick or engine bug that requires high precision. Adjusting the frame rate is done through the 
	[em 
		"Frame rate...
	]em
	" selection item under the 
	[em 
		"Video
	]em
	" menu - select 
	[em 
		"Change frame rate to (fps)
	]em
	" and set the frame rate to what is desired.  For example, if you wanted to half the speed for a standard game you would change the fps to 
	[em 
		"30

	" instead of 
	[em 
		"60

	"It is  recommended that your GIF be 120 frames or shorter unless the imagery inside the GIF is simple so as to reduce the file size.  For example,
