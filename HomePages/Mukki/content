I first discovered this site in 2006 by accident when trying to find a video of the 100% Metroid Prime speedrun. I quickly became interested in the various movies here of some of my favorite games and soon wanted to start making my own.  In the real world I am a 21-year-old student from the United Kingdom with an interest in movies, music and video games. Enjoy your stay!

	"This was my first real attempt at a TAS. With hindsight this was a good first project; the game was long enough for me to learn the value of motivation, and the gameplay itself was simplistic enough that I could get good results easily. I spent about three months working on this between mid to late 2006 and I enjoyed it. I'd played the game often during it's release so I was always familiar with it, but much of the game itself wasn't in my immeadiate memory so planning and testing became quite nostalgic, a quality I took with me into future projects. Looking back I was actually able to discover quite a few tricks and shortcuts (a couple that were pretty major too) which I thought was pretty decent for a first effort.

	"This movie, I believe, is very improvable. Although, somewhat surprisingly, I haven't found any new shortcuts or tricks in this game, however I think this could be improved by around a minute or two with better optimisation. I have since often considered starting up a new input file on this game, but have yet to do it and I doubt I ever will. If I were to make a new movie I'd expect it to look far too similar to my first with a few optimisations here and there. I think this game needs the treatment of a new TASer so hopefully someone else can come along and cast an eye over this game and give it a new lease of life.

	"My longest and most intense project to date. I spent about 10 months working on this; I began shortly after submitting Gex 64 in November 2006 and finished in September 2007. I'd wanted to see a Majora's Mask submission ever since I joined the site and watched Guanobowl's Ocarina of Time TAS. There was a huge amount of interest in seeing a run of this game, but due to certain issues with N64 emulation at the time no one seemed interested in making a serious attempt at TASing it. What finally clinched it for me was when I read Petrie911's route; as a fan of the game I found my jaw hitting the floor at just about every line and knew that the finished run would look seriously awesome. I made a run of the pre-Clock Town segment which beat AKA's attempt by two - three seconds and people seemed to enjoy it so I just ran with it and finished the run. It was a long and difficult run, but it was always interesting and I was fortunate in that I began with the same motivation I finished with and so I was always looking forward despite all the redos.

	"Originally, I was very interested in making a second version. The first version has a notable learning curve, both for me as a TASer and the community in general as to N64 TASes. This gives the movie an immeadiately sloppy and inconsistent feel which I dislike and so I was dissatisfied with the movie when I came to submit it. On the same route I suspect that this movie would be beaten by about 3 - 4 minutes due to various improvements. In the end Swordless Link started a run and I abandoned mine. I'm glad he did as he found many things I wouldn't have and he also had much more motivation than I did. Since then many new things have been found and so Swordless' eventual movie will beat mines by a hefty 15 - 20 minutes. The final movie will be very different from mine, which I think is great. Unfotunately, it will skip many of the challenges and other cool stuff in the game, but it will also be more optimal and will add cool stuff of its own. This presents a nice obsoletion setting where the two runs are so different that I can enjoy each run independent of the other.

	"My next finished movie was also my first (and so far only) co-authored run. AKA and I did this across January and February 2008. Co-authoring was new experience for me and I thoroughly enjoyed being able to share ideas, strategies and styles with another TASer. I also felt that it really raised my game as I knew that another persons name would go on the final product and therefore I wanted to make the run as best I could so as not to shame them with obvious mistakes. Both of us liked the game and were interested in TASing it, although admittedly AKA knew 
	[em 
		"far more
	]em
	" about it than I did and had many cool ideas to save time. This project was great fun as it wasn't all about frame whoring and as a result the movie has genuinely creative stuff in it.

	"This movie has speed/entertainment trade-offs, so naturally it is improvable, so on that alone this movie could be faster, but it would look much worse. I like this run as being more entertainment geared, which works well with the otherwise linear level progression. I've suspected that perhaps more could be made of the bosses, but this is pure speculation and I haven't tested anything. So far I have no intention to improve this as I like it as it is. If I ever did it would probably be nothing more than a few hex edits, but don't get your hopes up.

	"I started a run of this very nice game immeadiately after finishing Majora's Mask. I'd hoped to use it for a little respite after that particularly heavy piece of work, but this turned out more difficult than I'd expected. I began this movie in September 2007 and submitted it in April 2008. Aqfaq had posted a few WIPs of this game, but confirmed to me that he was no longer working on it when I contacted him. He kindly agreed to watch WIPs, give advice and share with me the many tricks he'd found. Some of them involved some quite esoteric pixel positioning that I wouldn't have found so the forty seconds of improvement in my movie is greatly indebted to him. It was by this stage that I had become really obsessive over frame shaving, which is why this project took quite a bit of effort. As a result the levels between the Elephant Graveyard (level 3) and Hakuna Matatta (level 6) were in a constant state of redo for months which was quite demotivating. I eventually got it done and am very happy with the finished product.

	$LF
	"to get this under fourteen minutes. However, there are many potential shortcuts in this game that are 
	[em 
		"just

	" impossible. I my time with this game I've seen the rhinos throw Simba in strange ways, enemies used to skip large parts of levels, I've been half inside walls and have even seen evidence of zipping, but none of these has yeildd any improvements. If I could prove a few of the larger ones I'd be interested in giving this another go, but that may be quite a big if. Stylistically, I would like to do more with the Be Prepared boss and, due to all the hex-editing, the dancing in The Stampede is quite badly out of sync, which I would like to fix. Ironically, an improvement to this run may either be very large or non-existent.

	"I wanted to see a run of this game ever since I'd TASed Gex 64, however I feared that it'd be less entertaining due to the increased number of collect-em-up levels. After submitting the Lion King I made a test run and decided that a TAS would be passable at least. This project began in April 2008 and I finished it in November 2008. It wasn't really a continuous effort; I did the first two levels in April and then never touched it again until August. This project was quite different from things I'd done before as I wasn't active on the forums during this time. I wasn't feeling particularly motivated to TAS, but I often picked this game up and played some whenever I had the time. It was nice not to have the pressure of posting WIPs, updates or having to think too much on an eventual submission. As a result this was probably the most fun I've had making a TAS and I think it turned out pretty well too.

I also suspect that rotating the camera in certain ways sometimes allows certain input to be entered a frame or so earlier, but I think this would make the run less entertaining overall and I'm still skeptical as to what the potential gains actually are. In short, I enjoyed this TASing experience, but I think that it was more to do with my state of mind at the time and so I doubt that I would enjoy it as much if I TASed it again.

I finished the second version in early July 2009 and submitted it. This was a worthwhile project due to the game's diverse gameplay styles and surprising variety for an early GB title. It was difficult to keep on top of all the possible solutions due to the many transformations and TASing with each power-up was fun.

	"Originally, I had hoped to make a 100% run of Crash Bandicoot, but due to the excessive load/save times in achieving such a goal I decided to reduce it to an any%. I had set aside an extra few months in my TASing schedule in order to achieve the 100% completion. What was I to do with that time now? Spend it TASing one of the major projects that have been hanging over me for years? Of course not. I picked up something new and decided to TAS Crash 2. I first started messing around with this in August 2009, but it was late September / early October 2009 before I began putting pen to paper on a regular basis. I submitted on Christmas Day 2009. I was able to find more quirks and tricks in this game than I originally expected and so the run was more entertaining than I thought it would be. The ice glitch seemed to be something of a crowd-pleaser, unfortunately I didn't discover it until the second warp room meaning that I had to redo everything from level 2. I considered dropping it after that, but I persevered and I'm glad that I did.

While I don't believe that much of this criticism was justified I do think a nice improvement should be possible. Perhaps it may be possible to take the ice glitch all the way to the end of level 2 with better control. I also think that I definitely should have done more testing with sliding v slide/jumping on different slope gradients as I think that there may be many frames there. The I was able to bypass some of the sewer flamethrowers by sliding past them at certain angles, it makes me wonder if all of them can be skipped in this way. As of yet I'm unaware of specific improvements, but I'm sure that there is much potential in a game like this. I became very bored of this game towards the end of the run and so I won't be the one who makes an improvement to this or a 100% run.

	"Back in 2008, shortly after my Lion King publication I disappeared from the site for many months. I had completely lost my motivation to TAS or be involved in site activities. I occasionally TASed Gex 3 when I was really bored and occasionally dropped in on the forums to see what was going on. I think I went over three months without logging in at all, which is the longest time since I registered here. Towards the end of this period mz released his first pcsx-rr and being a fan of the console and having always wanted to see TASes of many great PSX games I was quietly curious. I started picking at Crash Bandicoot and decided to start posting once again to gauge interest in the project. Response was good, unfortunately the emulator was not stable. With every release I tested this game, but experienced desyncs and sound issues. It was August 2009 before I started this up properly with no desyncs (but still bad sound). I submitted this on Christmas Day 2009. For the most part I enjoyed this project, and the majority of the many grievances I had were emulator, rather than game, related. Having said that I am immensely grateful to mz for the work that he has done on this emulator allowing these runs to be possible. Some parts of this game are incredibly tedious, such as the boulders levels, spin delay optimisation and box planning. Other parts were very enjoyable such as Native Fortress and Sunset Vista, normally levels I hate, because TASing allowed for some creative platforming solutions.

This is a nice little game; it is pretty basic as a platformer, but the ability to possess various enemies and use their powers seemed interesting from a TAS perspective. I submitted my Crash Bandicoot runs on Christmas Day 2009, but I still had a few lazy holiday mornings left to work on something else and as I didn't feel like working on Golden Axe I decided to pick this up. I got quite far in those few days, but I then discovered the rapid fire glitch and so I had to start again. I then later discovered that the lag counter wasn't working properly and so I started again. Eventually I had a finished movie to submit by mid-February.

	"One of my favorite games of all time. One of my favorite TASes of all time. I watched trazz's run almost immediately after joining the site and was blown away by it. I've always had an interest in breaking my favorite runs down to frame level and studying them in depth and so naturally I had always been interested in TASing this. For a long while I lacked the experience and skill to match trazz but I eventually decided to give it a go. This is a short game, but TASing it is challenging. Each screen serves as something if a puzzle that must be solved and there are so many ways of clearing each screen. There is also some difficult luck manipulation in the bonus levels to consider. TASing this is interesting as much of it doesn't involve TASing at all. I found it effective to observe the problem and then spend a few days mulling it over in my head as I went about my business and then testing and balancing various solutions. This worked better than TASing it head-on as many of the best solutions are not immediately obvious. I started working on this in November 2008 and worked consistently until March 2010 with an improvement of over 6 seconds which is more than I thought possible. This is the movie of mine that I am most proud of.

The first four levels have bonus rounds after them and the luck manipulation is frame based which creates a series of frame rules. Therefore each of those levels must be improved by several frames to gain any bankable improvement at all. If there are any frames left they will probably be in levels 6 and 7 since these have no such rules and so are capable of pure improvement. In total I don't believe that this run can be beaten by more than a few frames if it all. I need a break from this game, but in a year or two I'd like to come back to this and try and find the last few frames if they exist.

	"A nice little game that I stumbled across while having a random wikipedia/gamefaqs session. I played it for fun quite a bit before I even considered TASing it as I didn't immediately see the TAS potential. Eventually, as I do with most games, once I had become infatuated with the game's style and atmosphere I decided to record a run. After the submission of the first iteration in early April 2010 TwistedEye discovered an improvement to the second hole. I tried to hex in this improvement, but my efforts constantly desynchronised. I soon discovered that this was because the new strat on Hamburger Hill caused the tee-off to be in a slightly different position on the next hole. I canceled my submission to investigate is I could use this small quirk to my advantage in other holes. I was right and was able to save six seconds. I submitted a new run two weeks after my first which was published. The second run almost didn't happen because the tee-off randomness put me in a position that would have cost me all the time gained in Hamburger Hill. Thankfully, just before I gave up hope, I was able to find

	" the right angle to pull off a strat that was ultimately faster than what I had before.

	"This can probably be improved further. If you try to obsolete this run you should look into the tee-off randomness in more depth. Sometimes I lost frames over my previous submission due to it. I am unaware of how it can be controlled so if you can figure that out you may be on to a nice improvement. Also, you should try and hole-in-one Frantic Fans. I take two shots because my hole in one method (using the last fan as a boost) was ultimately slower. I was able to have the ball maintain high velocity all the way up to the hole without using the out-of-the-way fan, but it

	" missed. Shame. I have no intention to make a third version of this game.

	"I first started recording runs of this game in early 2009 while still experimenting with the new emulator. I wanted to make a full run but didn't get far because the first level suffers from a, thankfully rare, phenomenon in which it is the hardest to perfect. Eventually I decided to let my inhibitions slide and go with what I had as I was unable to improve it further. Optimising this game is incredibly difficult, but the project itself was comparatively incident free. Things became difficult when the routes diverged, but I was able to quickly figure out which was the fastest.

	"This is a game I stumbled upon while looking for good SNES games that I may not have played. I instantly fell in love with it and knew that I would eventualy want to TAS it. I had never used SNES9x before, but I got used to it quickly. This project turned out to be longer than I had anticipated as my memory had screened out the two long autoscrollers in World 6 and the extra levels in World 7. If my predictions had been more accurate and I knew that this would be over an hour I'm not sure that I would have picked it up. Despite it being longer than I thought I finished the run faster than I would have expected as I was able to keep my motivation relatively high throughout. Perhaps it is the wonderful graphics or backgrounds, but this was a very relaxing TAS experience.

	"I know of one improvement and that is in the World 7 'ghost house'. After I press the first switch I drop down the hole and then accross to the right. I could instead continue to the right immediately and drop down a later hole that had a torch I could use to break my fall and avoid the falling animation. This would save ~2 seconds. Other than that I am unaware of any other improvements. I have no intention of TASing this game again.

This game has a great wealth of moves and manoevres and so every screen was very interesting to test and there was always a wealth of options to test on every screen. I had a great deal of fun with this one actually.

	"In mid-July 2010 I was approached by SDA's cyghfer (known here as Orange Claw Hammer) for advice on making a realtime run of Trip World. I was more than happy to oblige, being a huge fan of the game. However, he quickly found numerous improvements to my run, some of them quite major and interesting. I decided to look into making a v3 of this and soon started to find various aditional improvements myself. This new run is 2900 frames (48.33s) faster than my first run.

	"I started screwing around with this game as I originally got to know FBA. I made a test run, but was not particularly impressed because the controls did not allow for the sexy gameplay that BC has a reputation for, and also because most of the game's challanges can be skipped by death. During summer 2010 I was without internet for a short time and as this was the only project I had that I could TAS offline at the time I decided to do a no death run. I was quite pleased with the finished product so I decided to submit.

	"For a while I'd been messing around with Sonic games as they are a lot of fun to optimise, but in late August 2010 I decided to make a run of Sonic Advance that did not use the ultra-spindash glitch. However, as I got to know the game's physics I began to find many improvements to the published run and so I decided to improve it. In total the in-game improvement was over 33 seconds, which I was pleased with.

	"This could be very interesting because technically this shouldn't even be possible. Primo began a WIP of this idea years ago but, to my knowledge, never progressed very far. I've always wanted to see the finished product so I decided to start route planning with a view to TASing it. The route is nearing completion and I've done some TASing. This should be fun as I've never TASed an RPG before and so it will test a variety of different skills. The new VBA also supports lua scripting which will ease much of the stress of this manipulation heavy run. A max-crit luabot would be awesome and I would also like to use it to include on-screen notes and comments. Unfortunately, my current progress desyncs on the new emulator so it's back to Oak's lab for me!

	": The route is coming along nicely. Once Golden Axe is finished I'll be fully committed to this. I'll first hope to finish the route and then write a lua script to help with the manipulation. It would essentially just be a bot that just needs to press the A button and find the max crits in the shortest time. This is very time consuming in real life, but if I could get my hands on such a script I may even get this project done this year.
