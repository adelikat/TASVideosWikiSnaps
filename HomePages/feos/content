				"I was born in 1985, and I got my own NES (actually it was pirated Dendy) at the age of 7. Back then in Russia we had only simple games to buy, such as Lode Runner or Mario Bros, because the industry of pirating Dendy only started. But a few years later we already got such games with mappers as TMNT series, Battletoads series, Zen Intergalactic Ninja, Bucky O'Hare, other complicated games like Rockin' Kats. And of course, I did play Battle City, Mario & Contra with friends (and loved neither of those).
