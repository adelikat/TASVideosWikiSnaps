Back then in Russia we had only simple games to buy, such as Lode Runner or Mario Bros, because the industry of pirating Dendy only started. But a few years later we already got such games with mappers as TMNT series, Battletoads series, Zen Intergalactic Ninja, Bucky O'Hare, other complicated games like Rockin' Kats. And of course, I did play Battle City, Mario & Contra with friends (and loved neither of those).
