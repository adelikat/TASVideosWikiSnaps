	"Everybody knows that when you have unlimited time to ponder solutions, you can end up acting like a super-human. But do we all keep in mind that being a human isn't anything bad by itself? The wise balance around this borderline wasn't quite found yet, but many people out there notice that sometimes it looks 
	[b 
		"too
	]b
	" superhuman. Which is distracting for them and in terms of enjoyment falls into sub-human spirit (like, some kind of autopsist broke the game apart with no respect to anything).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"True, when the viewer is a good gamer, he has a certain kind of knowledge how the games work, and how they can be played by a well-skilled player in real time. And what's exciting for most gamers is when a real person acts above their knowledge (the deeper that knowledge, the more impressed the viewer, as long as what they see is still above their knowledge).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In my opinion, a good TAS must include both fashions: the superhuman precision and the real human touch. All actions must be distinguishable in real time and not look too overloaded. The ideal impression from the fashion must be exactly like from a real person playing, just on an unexpectedly high level. To put that touch into his run, one must make himself maximally familiar with all real-time strats the game allows, since examining the tricks on a TAS level is necessary by default already.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Basically, the ideas you get must come to you when you play in real time yourself, exploiting all kinds of strategies for every possible segment. Then these ideas, after being pulled out with tools, would look suitable for a real time view. We were trying to add a superhuman touch so hard we almost erased the human one (in the finest sense). We must abstract from restrictions real time puts onto our mind abilities, but not from the very soul inside it that encourages the viewer as well as the real-time player of the game we TAS.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"That's why I'm sure good TASes must be done by huge teams. Not only to optimize the hell out of the engine, but also to compare the look with what regular players see and fix it when it looks
