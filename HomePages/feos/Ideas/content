	"Everybody knows that when you have unlimited time to ponder solutions, you can end up acting like a super-human. But do we all keep in mind that being a human isn't anything bad by itself? The wise balance around this borderline wasn't quite found yet, but many people out there notice that sometimes it looks 
	[b

	"True, when the viewer is a good gamer, he has a certain kind of knowledge how the games work, and how they can be played by a well-skilled player in real time.

	"In my opinion, a good TAS must include both fashions: the superhuman precision and the real human touch. All actions must be distinguishable in real time and not look too overloaded. The ideal impression from the fashion must be exactly like from a real person playing, just on an unexpectedly high level. To put that touch into his run, one must make himself maximally familiar with all real-time strats the game allows, since examining the tricks on a TAS level is necessary by default already.

	"Basically, the ideas you get must come to you when you play in real time yourself, exploiting all kinds of strategies for every possible segment. Then these ideas, after being pulled out with tools, would look suitable for a real time view. We were trying to add a superhuman touch so hard we almost erased the human one (in the finest sense). We must abstract from restrictions real time puts onto our mind abilities, but not from the very soul inside it that encourages the viewer as well as the real-time player of the game we TAS.
