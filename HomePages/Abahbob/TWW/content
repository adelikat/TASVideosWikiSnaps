			"Zombie Hover
		]dt
		[dd 
			"When Link has no hearts left and is in the air (not including being knocked down), it is possible to repeatedly jumpslash to gain height and distance. After being knocked down, there are several frames which a jumpslash can be done from the ground by holding down L and pressing A. B should be pressed for one frame and released the next repeatedly to get an optimal hover. To heal out of a zombie hover you must either land on a heart or fairy, or use the Tingle Tuner (which is currently not usable on Dolphin). Sometimes it is possible to zombie hover into a loading zone or to pick up an item, and deathwarp afterwards to gain the desired effect.

			[dt 
				"Wind Waker Dive
			]dt
			[dd 
				"By pulling out the Wind Waker when going down a steep slope you can fall off of the ledge. Alternate methods include climbing up a ledge where pulling out the Wind Waker causes the camera to flip, or using nearly any object, typically bombs, to get pushed off of the ledge. When falling with the Wind Waker out, you will fall through water, which can be used to get underneath islands.

					"Storage
				]dt
				[dd 
					"Storage was originally obtained by pulling out the Wind Waker on the same frame Forest Water expired. This proved problematic, as it could only be done once every 20 minutes and needed exquisite timing and routing. A variation of tradition storage, known as Dry Storage, is now used. By doing a Wind Waker dive onto land and canceling it 3 frames before you hit the ground, storage is obtained.

	" What is Storage?
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Exactly why storage works isn't known. I've created my own idea from what we know. Imagine there is a byte that represents being in a cutscene. Its typically set at 0, and whenever you activate a cutscene, it is changed to 1. Traditional storage occurred whenever two cutscenes were activated on the same frame (Wind Waker and Forest Water). When this occurs, the cutscene byte is still changed to 1. Whenever both of them are canceled, it goes down to a value of 0, then to a value of -1. With Dry Storage, during the Wind Waker dive the value is at 1. Whenever the dive is canceled, the value goes down to 0. At this point, Link is still holding out the Wind Waker and the normal UI has disappeared. Pressing B one more time cancels out of this, and the value goes to -1.

		"Chest Storage
	]dt
	[dd 
		"While opening a chest, Link's collision is altered to allow the animation to flow smoothly. Storage cancels the animation, but keeps the collision. This allows you to walk up walls and clip some ledges simply by walking off of them at an angle. After leaving the room of the chest, you will gain the item, but keep the collision. The collision is returned to normal whenever you change stages, whenever a cutscene starting with a fadeout occurs, or if you open another chest.
		$LF
		[dt 
			"Cutscene Storage
		]dt
		[dd 
			"Whenever a cutscene is stored, it is typically skipped over. Some cutscenes are multiple parts, and it will play the second part of the cutscene. Link will be teleported to the position where he would start the skipped over cutscene, as will any other actors that are moved.
			$LF
			[dt 
				"Text Storage
			]dt
			[dd 
				"Activating text will cause it to get "stored". Whenever another cutscene is activated, the text will be played. By pulling out and putting away the Wind Waker, the text will be brought up while you are able to move around. Certain text boxes will give you storage back after closing them. When gaining storage back in the middle of a cutscene, it is canceled.
				$LF
				[dt 
					"Door Cancel
				]dt
				[dd 
					"By using text storage to cancel going through a door, an effect known as Door Cancel occurs. This is similar to Chest Storage, except on another level. Slopes that are too steep for Chest Storage to climb up can be walked through. Most objects are also able to be walked through. Although this sounds amazing, it can only be done in places where there are doors, a suitable text box, and the ability to pull out the Wind Waker. This only leaves the overworld sea. An unfortunate side-effect of Door Cancel is the screen fading out to either black or white (depending on day/night). This can be overcome with a patch using Dolphin, have fun deciding what to do encoders XD.

	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"Every time link turns around, he gains ~3 speed. The air gauge lasts for 900 frames, allowing for a buildup of about 2700 speed. By getting close to land, Link will regain air, allowing for a superswim of any length. Since the speed gain is dependent on Link turning around, and not on the angle he turns around at, it is possible to turn while superswimming. This makes things very complicated very fast. Turns of 180Â±45 degrees can be made. Two consecutive well angled turns allows for the momentum to be transferred to any direction. Turning at the max angle while still aiming in a single direction allows you to move in the wanted direction while continually building up speed.

When a Lantern Moblin sees Link without the sword, it reacts as if you are in FF1 and it throws you into the jail cell. Because FF1 is on a seperate stage than the normal ocean, this is the only way to access it. There just happen to be some Lantern Moblins in a sub off of NFI.

						[dd 
							"In order to get into the pirate ship to get bombs, typically you have to watch a decent length cutscene to get the password (it doesn't work before watching the cutscene, even if you find the password). By using door cancel you can walk through the door to the pirate ship and hit the loading zone, skipping all that nonsense.

								"By Wind Waker diving into Forest Haven and using a precise zombie hover, it is possible to obtain the leaf with only the Wind Waker and the sword. Early bombs helps here in order to take damage faster and get a faster angle to get the leaf. Combining this with early bombs is crucial, because the leaf is needed to drop bombs during a zombie hover.

Doing a zombie hover over the top of Fire Mountain and healing off of the heart drop from a Kargaroc allows you to get inside without cooling down the island. This is only possible on the J version, as the U version instantly knocks you out because the timer is never set.

This is because watching the cutscene for meeting Ganon at the top of FF2 gives you the Master Sword (and Hero's Shield). After the cutscene you are immediately taken to Hyrule. There are multiple problems with this. You can crash just by approaching the Master Sword Pedastal 50% of the time. And of course there is a dead end by not activating and deactivating the electric barriers inside of Hyrule castle that doesn't let you break down the barrier. The only way that EMS would be useful would be combined with barrier skip.
