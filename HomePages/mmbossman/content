				"Some thoughts on hacked games: I enjoy hacks, because they are very similar to TASes. They require creativity, time, dedication, and knowledge to create. I also tend to be as critical of hacks as I am with TASes. A good hacked game should have a decent amount of variety in its levels and design, show a large amount of polish, be a complete work (i.e. not a work in progress), and be unique from other hacks that may already exist. Unfortunately it seems that there are very few hacks that fit all these criteria.

Your first movie will likely still involve some aspect of "playing" the game, likely at a speed of 20% or less (hopefully less). However, as you gain more experience, TASing will feel less like "playing", and more like "creating". For the best results, frame advance is a must.

				"Vectorman was one of my favorite games as a kid, and I was amazed it didn't have a run when I joined. I submitted my first run, thought it was great, and then nitsuja put me in my place by beating my level 1 time by some ludicrous time (like 30 seconds for a 2 minute level). But due to this, I made a much better second version which ended up being published, and also got a taste of RAM watching, which has helped me out incredibly since. So thank you, nitsuja, wherever you are! I have some ideas for improvements for this, and I may pick it up again sometime in the next year when I tire of trying new games and want to play around with something familiar again.

				"This is the second version of this run, and my first submitted version. It was also my first run published. I've come a long way in my TASing abilities since I completed this, but due to the nature of the game, there isn't very much I can improve. There's a set number of frames between shots, and reload times, so any improvements would come from lag reduction and shaving frames here and there. I doubt any improvements would increase the entertainment value, so I don't think I'll be trying to better this any time soon.
