		"That's So Raven
	]em
	" is an overworld action game released in 2004 that is based on the 
	[a class=extlink href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That%27s_So_Raven rel=nofollow 
		"popular American sitcom of the same name
	]a
	". The game was developed by Vicarious Visions and published by Disney Interactive for the Game Boy Advance. This game is the first of two other video games based on the sitcom, including another one for GBA and a DS game. The game follows the storylines of a few of the episodes of the show.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Most of the game takes place inside various parts of Raven's high school (mostly hallways), though a few levels are set in a shopping mall. It's your typical American sitcom scenario where everyone in the high school are total brats running around causing all kinds of havoc. Yeah, people throwing books at random people, muffins, pizza, and all kind of shit. Trash cans lying in your way. Yeah, very dark. The player's speed in the game when running is pretty quick, but the game is still pretty repetitive in nature.

[p 
	"In the file select menu, a percentage of completion is shown after the file is made. The goal of this TAS is to make it so that the file name would say 100% if you looked at it. In order to do this, you must do the following:

	]li
]ul
[p 
	"What do I mean when I say "bonus requirements"? Well, in each of the first four levels in each of the four episodes, there's a minor character that wants help with something. This is not an actual requirement for beating the game, and doesn't even contribute to the game's storyline, but is just something you can do as an extra feel-good kind of thing.

Anyway, once you collect all of them, you go back and talk to him, and then you're cleared to go complete the level as normal.

]ul
[p 
	"Also, once you complete every one of these tasks and beat their respective levels, you can go back to the main menus of the game and look at the "yearbook" to see that all the entries have been unlocked. Each entry is represented by an anonymous face with a number over it. There should be 16 of them, and no entries represented by a lock. Clicking on yearbook entries takes you to pictures snapped (and compressed) from actual episodes of the TV series. You unlock one of these entries per level that has been completed in its entirety, and obviously the goal is to unlock them all.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I should also mention that talking to the respective bonus person after completing the level's bonus task actually regenerates your health, which can be done by no other means in the whole game. This is interesting because there are no other ways to increase health while playing the game. What makes it even more interesting is that when you start any level, your health defaults to 19, but when you complete a bonus, it regenerates your health to 20, so this is the only way you can ever have actually full health in the game. This feature is irrelevant to the TAS, though.

I did the left test first (which any% used), with frame perfection on the left test. Then, I non-TASed the same test with the method of going to the right, making several minor mistakes, and

So the idea here would be to go into that door on your way, grab the hamburger, and go back in it. Well... Actually, method 1 is a LOT faster than method 2... about X frames faster according to my test... So, yeah, no.
