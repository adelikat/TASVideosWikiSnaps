Content that uses copyrighted content in a way that falls under the doctrine of fair use is legal but cannot be released into the public domain until all of the original copyrighted works used expire automatically (which generally happens 95 years after they're published). So, in the cases when works I publish apply fair use,

My opinions on what is dishonorable and what should be illegal are two very, very different things. Showing up to your customer service job in a clown suit one day and getting fired for it isn't illegal either, and it shouldn't be illegal, but it's still a stupid thing to do and I'd advise that you still shouldn't do it.
