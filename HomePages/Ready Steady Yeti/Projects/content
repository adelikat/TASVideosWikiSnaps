	"There were quite a few projects I've completed in the gaming world, mostly tool-assisted speedruns but some non-tool-assisted ones as well. There are many more to come, too. Because I didn't want all this stuff to clog up my user page, which was a mess at the time of making this page already, I made a separate page for it all to be in. This list does not include obsoleted speedruns.

	" hack that I couldn't even find any other videos for on all of YouTube, even today. It's horribly suboptimal, used a horrible emulator even for its time (end of 2011), used the wrong timing method (RTA time rather than TAS time), and probably ended the movie at the wrong time, but I was very young back then so I didn't understand the concepts, so it's still a milestone and I did learn a lot from it. This video would've been deleted along with my old Giraffecheetah channel if it had not been for patryk1023PL encoding it for me and keeping it on his channel for all these years. Shoutouts to Patryk.
