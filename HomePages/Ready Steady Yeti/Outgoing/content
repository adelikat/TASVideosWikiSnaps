Finishing as many of these TASes as possible is my goal, since every publication makes the TASVideos site more complete. Games with incomplete TASes that I've considered, planned, or am working on currently are all listed on this page.

	"This is an extremely long list of TASes I'm considering. I may or may not have ever played these games yet. Many of them are from my childhood, and others I came across via Google search. Basically how this works is I go through this list when I need new ideas. I play the game in question until I know the game and feel comfortable enough to say that I'd like to TAS it. Then I start planning, and then I start the actual process of TASing the game.

[p 
	"Always when I'm TASing, I find some extra time to screw around. This helps me to find glitches and tricks by either accident or curiosity that I wouldn't find otherwise.

I know this sounds like a minor, newbie problem but there's so much to do, and no documentation anywhere on anyone actually completing the game 100% of the way through. I've tried, and tried, and am still trying. I'm hoping to get it one day.
