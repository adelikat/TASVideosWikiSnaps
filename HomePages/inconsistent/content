	"I like doing TASes of games that aren’t that popular or have little chance of being done by someone else. For example, Pac-Man World 3, the DS version, had one run on the speedrun.com leaderboards before I made a TAS of it. And Kingsley’s Adventure had previously been looked into, but it seemed like no one was interested in doing a full run of the game.

	"I knew of speedruns for a long time, but there weren’t any that I’d be interested in until Klonoa. I looked up the game on speedrun.com and the run looked interesting enough with wall clips, so I learned my first speed game. I didn’t know what a TAS was until I saw lapogne's run of the game, which led me to look into making my own for the All Visions category.

	", and I finished on June 19th 23. It wasn’t the most optimized, seeing as I only spent a month on it, which is why I’m in the process of improving it now.
