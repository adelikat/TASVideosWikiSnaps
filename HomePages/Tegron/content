	"Hi, I'm Tegron, I'm from Poland, I've been a speedrunner since 2019 and started trying TAS in 2023. In 2024, I decided to try my hand at TAS games again as quickly as possible. My main interests in games are horror games (in RPG Maker and similar, other), anime, Super Mario (my favourite is the Mario & Luigi series) and others that I am very interested in. The projects listed here are those that I plan to do in the future, are currently in progress, as well as those that were planned but are currently impossible to complete at this point.
