After Megaman & Bass I have started numerous TASes but for some reason i didn't finish any of them :). To name a few: Megaman Zero 1, Megaman Zero 2, Alfred Chicken, Super Mario All Stars and so on.

Now that I have somewhat mastered encoding, I'm glad to help the site as much as I can. And because of my enthusiasm to helping the site via encoding, some people started talking about promoting me to publisher (mainy because of JXQ's

It was fun helping our society, but now my time has grown limited and I have retired back to plain member - Watching and commenting movies now and then. Although, small part of me feels still like a staff member here so when ever I notice something correct-worthy, I'll be bugging the real staff immediately to get it fixed ;)
