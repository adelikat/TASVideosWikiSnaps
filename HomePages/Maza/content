	"I wandered here, on TASvideos (Nesvideos back then), in the beginning of year 2005. I then got really interested in speedruns, equally to actual speedruns and TASes. After a year or so, I began to work on my very first TAS, 
	[a class=intlink href=/795S

	", which was rejected. I completely understand why it was rejected, especially now that i'm half-publisher. After Megaman & Bass I have started numerous TASes but for some reason i didn't finish any of them :). To name a few: Megaman Zero 1, Megaman Zero 2, Alfred Chicken, Super Mario All Stars and so on.

	"Some time after that I came to think that I could try some encoding, after all I have my PC on for 24/7. So i started testing out and believe me, the first tries sure werent pretty :D. Now that I have somewhat mastered encoding, I'm glad to help the site as much as I can. And because of my enthusiasm to helping the site via encoding, some people started talking about promoting me to publisher (mainy because of JXQ's

	"As you can propably see, I'm interested in TASing games which hasn't been TASed before. Maybe because I want people to notice those games too and start a little "competition", increasing the TASing of those games.

It was fun helping our society, but now my time has grown limited and I have retired back to plain member - Watching and commenting movies now and then. Although, small part of me feels still like a staff member here so when ever I notice something correct-worthy, I'll be bugging the real staff immediately to get it fixed ;)
