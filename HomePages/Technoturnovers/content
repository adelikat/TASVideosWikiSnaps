	"More seriously, I am simply fascinated by the idea of creating TAS videos for platforms that present technical challenges in syncing and recording for the TASer, the less videos for a given platform the better. My thought process goes: niche game for a platform with poor TASing support? neuron activation. I plan on eventually using Hourglass, but that's been stalled by the fact that Windows XP runs like total trash under VMWare with Hyper-V enabled. Hyper-V native runs better, but that lacks any form of real guest additions because it's meant for enterprise use, so getting files on and off the VM would be a total slog. Thankfully, PCem/Windows seems very promising, and I can always disable Hyper-V temporarily if I really need to.

It kinda sucks and is a glitchy mess, but we do these things not because they are easy, but because they are hard. Uses the mouse, so no Hourglass, only PCem; it's also allegedly make in GameMaker, so I might be able to manage some sort of Linux port, but it doesn't open as an archive so the standard "YoYo Runner" method isn't gonna work. It also forces fullscreen besides, which I'm lead to believe that libTAS doesn't like.
