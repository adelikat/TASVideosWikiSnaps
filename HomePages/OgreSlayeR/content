	"I'm OgreSlayeR, I'm 21 years old from the good ol' USA. I love Punk Music, Horror Movies, Women, Video Games (I'm here ain't I?), Drinking and partying. I also enjoy TASing in my free time when I'm not working or doing other RL stuff. I figured I'd make this page so people know what I'm working on.
