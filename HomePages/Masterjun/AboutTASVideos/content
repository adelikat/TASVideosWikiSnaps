	"TAS stands for Tool-Assisted Speedrun or more generally for Tool-Assisted Superplay. Speedruns on their own are a playthrough of a video game aiming to reach the goal as fast as possible performed by a human in real-time. But humans are flawed, make mistakes, and have limits. So we asked ourselves, what would video game playthroughs look like if we go beyond humans skills? A TAS is the answer to that question, a flawless video game playthrough ignoring human limits.
