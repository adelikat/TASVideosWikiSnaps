	"I first knew about the existence of TASes through archive.org. The first runs I watched were SMB1+3 and Track and Field. My experiences of watching SMB1 were not good as it showed illogical tricks like passing though walls and backwards jumping as well as alternate pipe glitches all of which made no sense, although I knew about the wall jump as I'd pulled it off accidentally on many occasions myself. Track and Field had little to offer other than watching the triple jump, but SMB3 did because it had obvious inhuman precision and reactions and took unnecessary risks in the autoscroller levels. I also knew these autoscroller levels had a tendency to lag a fair bit which made me appreciate why all these extra lives were obtained. Still I never checked the site during that period.

Basically the game is a GameCube port of the original N64 game and has graphical updates and removes a few bugs while having overall less lag. The main difference however is that the dungeon concepts are changed meaning that they can be done faster and has an effect on the overworld route. I abandoned after discovering how to get past the Door of Time meaning all dungeons could be skipped, making the runs are effectively the same.

I decided to do an all emerald run because no one had ever done a full run of any Sonic game at that point. I was very new to TASing so my methods were slow, inefficient and struggled to find any improvements and ended up largely following JXQ's run. The run in the end was rejected through being to similar and boring compared to the current any%. In a way I think its better I did this run because it would have looked bad if I improved the current run by only a couple of seconds and then get beaten by 10+ seconds.

Still, I learned a lot about the art of recording 2 player movies. Its not to difficult if you break it down into smaller parts and then slowly combine them altogether, It was unique and fun to do. It was rejected because many of the levels were very boring and simple by nature.

After Nitsuja released the TAS input Plugin I decided to try it out on a few games, SM64 seemed to be the best game as it has very stable emulation and the graphics update each time frame advance it pressed. I asked FODA if I could do a 16 star since I felt he was going to do it himself. So jumped onto it and got started right away. It became  obvious how unoptimized Spezzafer's TAS really was when I started working on the run. To anyone who wants to do N64 TASing,I strongly recommend you use the 0.6 Plugin, because otherwise your runs will be greatly unoptimized compared to what potentially be achieved. They were a few new tricks and strats, most which were found by others including FODA, but I did find some myself. Overall even without the new tricks in comparable sections I was 18 seconds faster overall, through much better precision. Overall my run was 47 seconds faster.

This was never accepted because there was a new trick which saved a small amount of time and wouldn't hex in properly. Just when I was about to update, a new run came up. Generally, I'm not in favour of attempted obseletions as soon as run is submitted. Normally I'd choose to best another run as soon as it becomes published. Since during that time, it allows me to look actively look for new stuff.

	"I was wanting to do an FPS for a long time, my initial choice was Quake, but the game has significant problems such as large loading times, heavy unnatural lag and a few emulation errors. Duke seemed to emulate correctly and its my favourite old school shooter. Since my knowledge was thin on the speedrunning element, I did all the research I could. I wanted to do this on the easiest setting because it only contains more enemies and your really just dancing through them, but I knew the guidelines were that the hardest level needed to be picked. The run was largely enjoyable to make and has a very abusable engine. Unfortunately the programmers were lazy when it came to porting the game. I owned the Saturn version and it was a brilliant port, but the N64 version is noticeably a little choppy. This is fine when playing the game normally since you're carefully ploughing through the levels, exploring them and finding secrets. But its noticeable that frames are being skipped when you're hurtling through the levels. Ironically the game doesn't actually lag that much its just very inconsistent updates between 1-10 frames. The run was rejected because it was deemed unwatchable to some and there were some known improvements.

After this I decided to watch the run. I questioned it and had a go at the first level and managed to improve it by 10 frames. Since it was only a short game I decided to play right through to the end. I ended up improving the run by just under 3 seconds. Decent given that the current run had improved the previous one by 1 and half seconds. However, while it may have seemed that I was Daniel San, Mr Miyagi was really Nitsuja in disguise. He showed off a couple of new fighting strategies which looked cooler and saved a lot of time, he was also able to gain a good number of frames through general optimization.

I wanted to try this out for a few reasons. One being that it was an rpg, two that it was a Game Boy game and three mainly to see if I would enjoy TASing any rpg based games in the future. It wasn't too difficult to make, and it only took a couple of hours to do. Unfortunately I've found that luck manipulation is the most frustrating element in any game, but the key to it in any game is to make it look as hidden as possible. That way people won't think that the run could be improved easily. While I did do a little research, it was quickly pointed out by knowledgeable experts that the run was lacking strategic planning. I quickly conceded defeat and cancelled it.

I came to the conclusion that was being stated wasn't credible, but it was something original that hadn't been thought and tried before. I then started playing the game again on my N64 and messed around in the basement looking for potential locations, but completely dismissing anything that had been thought of in the past. There was a crucial

	" made some time ago that I always kept a note of but never took it to seriously until up to that point. I noticed there was a small ledge in the water just outside the HMC room. I was able after a few attempts to get 3-4 bljs, it soon became clear afterwards that there could be potentially a few other possibld locations. I then told the community that I'd found something. Although there was vocal demands for me to explain it, I didn't want to reveal it right away since I wanted to test it out fully myself. Unfortunately the initial location I found was useless. I then tried the step that was right next to the key door. Unfortunately I couldn't quite manage it but I got so close to getting it to work. I then uploaded an avi show what I'd found. A week later after testing it again, I realised that there was a slight oversight in what I had done, I was able to effectively get a unlimited amount of bljs. At the time I was talking to Swordless Link, since he'd just come back from his holiday. I uploaded an avi so he could see how the trick was done. Although the community was deeply suspicious as to whether or not the trick had been pulled off, we decided to keep this one quiet. Mainly because we we're going to implement it in our own run anyway, plus it was a very nice surprise. Surprisingly, I was a little disappointed that I'd found this and that it killed off a 16 star run, because there were still a few things that could be implemented and perfected. With hindsight I think a 1-star has done more good than harm. Since many people were getting tired of watching 16 star runs which were largely using the same strategies each time. Plus it gives great justification to allow an elusive 3rd category run, this would please both parties who are against both the 1 and 120 star runs for the same extreme reasons.

After watching the previous run I thought it was very improvable and I even found a few time savers before starting, there were a few other potential ones as well, but I either couldn't make them useful or the trick itself backfired. After completing it I spotted a few improvements so I decided to go back and hex them all in. Some of the areas to my surprise were a little random so I had to manually TAS them back in again, usually finding a way to do it better. I feel the movie I did is pretty tight, but could probably still shave a few seconds via memory watch and frame shaving.

However, I managed to find a couple things which would save the equivalent of about 8 seconds overall. I also had a good theory on bypassing the DDD barrier, one of the main barriers to a theoretically best route. There was also a few other minor strategies as well, but they would only be expected to save about 2 seconds over the course of the game. The new stuff was considerably more difficult to implement that I thought initially. Especially when we were truly pushing for frame perfection this time round. Swordless_Link was the one who finally cracked the DDD barrier. Funnily enough I wasn't there at the time when it was found, but I was in for a very shocking surprise when I got back. The discovery saved 45 seconds and most importantly allowed the game to be beaten in 0 stars. The only theoretical improvement left is to open the door in the moat outside the castle, but I really can't see that realistically happening, so I claim that the run has a perfect route through the game. In the end it was worth it, and is probably the most optimal run I've produced to date for any game.

There was a whole variety of strategies which could improve the current run.

I wanted to get other projects out of the way first before starting on it. Mukki was also very interested in TASing the so we decided to work together on it. I wasn't hell bent on squeezing every possible frame like the previous run I just finished.
