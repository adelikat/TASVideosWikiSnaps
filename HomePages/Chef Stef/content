		"Mario vs. Donkey Kong 100% - I cancelled my original 100% run for being too boring but a properly optimized run that skips the minigames would probably be better received. I'm not sure yet whether this would be a straight 100% run or a max score run.

		"Mario vs. Donkey Kong plus worlds - I finished world 3+ before putting this on hold due to optimization concerns. The mini Mario levels were the hardest part of the any%  run to TAS so it's painful having the entire plus worlds TAS be about them! I may revisit this if I can figure out how to optimize it properly.

		"Link's Awakening DX 100% - I originally put together a run up to the 4th dungeon but restarted it because I wasn't satisfied with the level of precision. I put this on hold mainly because of the difficulty of planning the route, which regularly changes as new strategies and tricks are found. I'd like to revisit this eventually (Link's Awakening was the game that got me into TASing, after all) but I don't know if I'll be doing so any time soon.

		" of the first "world" awhile ago. However, there are two issues with a TAS of this game: (1) A TAS aiming for the fastest time would have to destroy each enemy group as soon as it enters the screen; since enemies appear from the side, there's very little to see besides small explosions near the ship. This leaves almost no room for (non-repetitive) entertainment. (2) There seems to be almost no interest in the game on this site. Some interest did spring up briefly after a forum post by myself, but I don't think a movie likely to be this repetitive will be received well as a submission (judging from the first world's length, the TAS would be over 25-30 minutes long and mostly consist of enemy groups being defeated before they enter the screen).

		"Link to the Past (GBA version) palace of the four swords glitched run - I originally had an idea in mind where the TAS would collect certain necessary items via walk-through-walls glitching, then glitch into the Palace of the Four Swords and complete the "boss rush" to trigger the second set of credits. I suspected that it would be possible to skip most of this, though, and 
		[a class=intlink href=/1615M 
			"this published run

		" demonstrates exactly that. Unfortunately, this makes it much less likely that the run I have in mind would be accepted, due to "arbitrary goals". Since the proof-of-concept run has already been published, I'm no longer planning to pursue this run. (On a side note, this

I owe a lot to EightBitGuy who put together a very nice WIP up to world 5 with new strategies that were a good starting point for this improvement. I'm quite satisfied with how this turned out, all things considered.

I'm super satisfied with how this one turned out - we managed to find a lots of hilarious solutions and included a bunch of tricks and glitches for good measure. Incidentally, this movie caused "dead lion" to became a meme in the Nicovideo TAS community!

			"Link's Awakening DX in 1:09:49

I'm quite happy that my Link's Awakening TAS's have been so well-received by the TASVideos community. This one was quite handily obsoleted by Swordless Link's extremely high-quality improvement of almost 10 minutes, featuring some surprising new tricks and ridiculous level of optimization.

This was submitted right before a bunch of new tricks were discovered so I anticipated at least a 5 minute improvement (though I didn't anticipate it taking 6 years). In a way it was fun seeing this remain published for so long.

Here I managed to break the intended solutions many times, getting a cape early and finding clever ways to skip puzzles. I think I like this one better than my Super Demo World TAS. For a while I had a 100% run in the works as well, since it has a few really big surprises within it. I stopped the project since I felt I was losing pace with the latest Mario World tricks and techniques being discovered. I'd like to finish this someday but it's not really a priority right now.
