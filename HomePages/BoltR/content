	"I grew up on video games, and as a result I have a lot of fond memories of late nights with friends just sitting there and playing. This site gives me an opportunity to, in a way, relive those moments from my past. As a result of this, my favourite movies tend to be from games that I spent time playing when I was younger; which is probably the case with 99% of everyone. This can also be seen in the games I have chosen to TAS so far. I've tried to choose games that I've enjoyed in the past, and that I feel would be fast paced enough not to be boring. I will probably be using this page as a place to jot down my ideas for future speedruns. Hopefully this will give other people ideas when making their own. Oh, and it might help me organize ideas or something.
