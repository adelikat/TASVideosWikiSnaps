	"Well, week one of SDAAT is drawing to a close, and so far so good. Enhasa's first game choice seems to have pleased the masses, and seems to have gotten atleast a few people addicted. So I got to thinking, how could I try to help make the tournament even more of a success? Well, this week i've been one of the top scorers, so why not try to help people improve their score? Maybe find out what they might be missing? So here it is, my guide to hitting 700000 points! (Well, atleast 600000) Now, i'm sure some people might complain that this information comes a little late, but I think most of the charm of this game is finding your own routes through the levels. The game gets alot less fun once you are following the same route over and over trying to max your score. Remember the point of this is a tournament is to have fun!
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"So before we get into the specifics of all the levels I will give some general hints and tricks to help get you going.

[p 
	"First and foremost. If you don't yet play the game with the mouse, I suggest you do. You can turn this on by right clicking on the name of the game, and selecting properties. Go to the "Controllers" tab and check the box beside "Enable mouse input". This makes turning corners quickly, and making quick slight course corrections possible. Next I would suggest turning up the sensitivity of the mouse. Do this by hitting tab, and going into the "Analog Controls" menu. You want to change the "Dial Sensitivity" option. I suggest setting it to where you are comfortable and then turn it up a bit. However be careful not to turn it up too high, as if you 'twirl' the dial too fast the game flips out. I personally use 135%.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Second, use Black Steel. Access the character select screen by holding the start button while selecting the stage you are going to play. Black Steel is the one on the far right. This ball is much heavier, so it has higher acceleration, and top speed. This makes it much harder to control, but once you get used to it your level times will lower, and it's MUCH easier to break blocks.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Third, use the button. A lot. As it tells you in the beginner tutorial it has two uses, bumping the table and speeding you up. Tapping the button bumps the table, and holding it speeds you up. 
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		"Bumping is useful for quick acceleration at the start of the level, as well as breaking blocks. Technically speaking you could use it throughout the game for boosts of speed, but that would get very difficult, and random. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Speeding is one of the most important things in the game. You should be holding down the button almost at all times. Yes, it makes it harder to control, but it also speeds you up a great deal, and makes breaking blocks a great deal easier. With Black Steel, if you are holding down the speed button you need roughly a one block width in space to gather enough speed to break a block. That means, if you are sitting on a tower of blocks. All that you need to break them (after the initial block) is hold down the button. You don't need to steer at all,other than to keep yourself from falling off the tower.

[p 
	"The first method of getting points is by moving with the speed up button held down. The faster you are moving the more points you get. You don't get too many points from this in the grand scheme of things, but it's still worth mentioning.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Second, is by running into, or breaking objects. There are four objects that are worth running into for points. Bumpers (500), Blocks (1000), Flyers (1000), and ? blocks (sometimes 1000).
	$LF
	"If you hit more than one of these objects within a 1 second window you get a multiplier to the amount that it gives you, up to 5x. So if you hit a bumper, and pass through a flier, and break four blocks you score would look something like this: 500,2000,3000,4000,5000,5000. For a total of 19500 points.
	$LF
	"Getting huge combos of blocks makes up a good portion of your score, especially in the early levels.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Lastly, the end of level bonus. This works by multiplying the amount of second you have left at the end of the level, by the level number * 100. 
	$LF
	"So if you end level 4 with 56.3 seconds you end up with:  56.3 * (400) = 22520 bonus points
	$LF
	"In level 10 with 86 seconds that's is 86000 points! 
	$LF
	"This obviously becomes a huge part of your score later in the game.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Bonus points. I've never actually seen this happen in Special Mode (similar to the low time slots), but it's possible to get a random character show up on the score screen holding a +1000 point bonus. (Yes! Even Enhasa's kiwi! Though he sadly isn't riding a duck) Note: Apparently it's possible to get this in Special Mode by having all the digits in your time be the same. Example: 33'33

		"While it's a good idea to try and hit all the ? and +time blocks, you have to use your judgment on which to skip. If you miss a time block on your first (or second) pass, and think it will take a few seconds to turn around and get another swing at it? Skip it. There is no sense wasting more time than the block gives you. This goes for ? or +3 blocks that you think you might hit a X block getting. Not normally worth the time. 
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		"Sometimes it's better to just take a hit from a X block. Especially in a level like world 9, it's often better to just take a three second penalty rather than try to finesse your way through a tight spot (possibly eating the penalty anyways). Remember, 5 seconds of dodging is slower than 1 second + 3 seconds of penalty.
		$LF

		"You don't always need to have the marble traveling straight down to the bottom of the screen. It can be to your advantage to have it moving on an angle, or even horizontally across your screen. This is because glacing off a wall can often give you acceleration, this is easily seen in levels 2 and 4.

		"Hitting walls can be helpful, as I said above, it can actually accelerate you with Black Steel.

]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		"Spinning the camera nets you extra speed. Technically. While it doesn't actually move your marble any faster, it can be used move walls to your  marble quicker. Not only does this help by shoving exits into your marble, but it also opens up the biggest glitch in the game; passing through rocks. By mixing the speed of the ball and the rotation of the game world it is possible to put yourself into a wall for a frame before it ejects you. Since the spaces between rocks tend to be very small, it is technically possible to get it to eject you on the oppposite side of where you enter them. Yes, even the ones in level 6. I first really discovered this during my warm up runs for the video to go with this guide, when I passed through one of the walls in level 8. I had previously done it in level 4, but it was just the edge of one and I thought I had blinked or something. I then thought to test it in level 6... where on my first successful attempt got me lodged between three rocks until time ran out. It doesn't give a large advantage, but ever little bit helps.

Not all the bests are from the same play through, the best times I list are from different ones.

[p 
	"Just because you don't hit the goal doesn't mean you won't hit 700k. You will notice that in the video i'm behind them a fair bit at the beginning. By the nature of the game you can often have a run of 'sub-par' play net you a new personal best. Simply because things go your way in the final few levels.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"While it's not seen in the video, you almost always end up breaking the normal block instead of the time block. If that happens you have two options for best speed depending on where your marble is. If it's where the normal block used to be, quickly tilt the camera so the marble is sitting on the cement block with the time block directly above it and bump the table. If you are sitting on top of the time block bump the table and rotate the camera counter-clockwise so it hits the wall on the right of your marble. Remember to hold down the speed button to get the speed to break them.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"At the end of the video I just crash into the X block at the end of level. Normally you can just rotate the camera and circle between both of them. This is a good example of where you don't want you camera pointing straight down. Have it on slightly less steep than angle I did, then tilt it slightly counter-clockwise to clear the first X block, and then quickly clockwise to turn the corner.

	"The approach to the pyramid is probably the hardest part. In order to keep enough momentum to make it all the way from one site of the pyramid to the other you need to hold down the speedup button. However, keeping it held all the way from the wall of +/- blocks will mean you are going to be moving too fast, and it's likely that you will glance off the pyramid and hit the wall on the far side. Simply clicking the speedup button right before you hit the blocks tends to have that effect as well. So the best strategy i've found is to use the wall to slow you down, and then rotate the camera quickly as/after you hit the first block so you slide all the way down the side of the pyramid.

If you are lucky 20000! In the video I screw it up and go around at it from the back. Uhh, avoid doing that if possible.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"At the twisting tunnel like part of the level, don't be afraid to hit walls. As I said earlier bouncing off walls at the right angle can increase your speed. It is possible to get going REALLY fast through this section if you do it right. I don't do the best job of this in the video.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"During the zigzags it's technically best to hit each bouncer to fire you down each zig (or zag?). The downside to this being that it can be difficult to rotate the camera correctly and you either miss the bumper, or it shoots you back the way you came. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Finally the very end. The best you can hope for is bounce off the bouncer and break as many blocks as possible in your combo; it's easily possible to get to x5 here. Use your judgment here; don't get greedy and let your timer run down too low.

]p
[p 
	"Shortly after that you come to the two nooks with the ? in them. There are two ways you can deal with it: The safe way like in the video, or the quick way. The safe way should be self explanatory from the video, just line up with the far one first and then come back for the close one. The quick way employs the quick camera turning trick. Keep your camera parallel to the first ? and quickly rotate it counter-clock wise 90degrees as it's above to pass over the ?, then line up with the second and take it out. The major problem with the quick method is that it's quite easy to miss, and you waste A LOT of time bouncing around by doing so. (You also often hit a X block on top of that)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"A small point worth mentioning. An easy way to squeeze out points right after this section by getting the 1000 point flier, then bouncing off the block, and getting the second 1000 point sticker further down your path. It's REALLY easy to combo this for 6000 points. Yes, I didn't do this in the video, as I said before it's definitely improvable.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Up next is your first STOP/GO block. It is better to ALWAYS wait for this. Just make a run at it like it's set to GO, no matter what. Worst case you hit it and have to wait (you don't bounce much off of them). It's going to take you more time to go around and start breaking the blocks from behind than simply waiting for it to switch to GO and lining it up. You also then don't run the risk of hitting the -5X block

[p 
	"Here is the next block breaking section for the game, and the first annoyingly random part. In the video I get a time stop, but you actually probably want a bonus point here. Bonus points are the only result of the ? block which will keep your combo all the way through the stack of blocks. Getting a time stop lost me 15000 points, but gained me some time, you decide which you would rather have.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Again you will notice I take the long way around, it wastes some extra time to get the +3 point block, but whenever I try to take the direct path through I always hit the X block. In a perfect run after taking the +3 block you would strip the opposite wall of blocks without really slowing down. I've done it once ever, and you normally get stuck, so it's best to just try and hit one or two of them to scrape some points up on the way past.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Through the tunnel you want to either wall bounce, or quickly turn the camera to collect both points fliers. Wasting half a second for 3000 points sounds good to me in an early level such as this. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The second STOP/GO block you need to use your judgment for. I normally just go around if they are set to STOP, but if you are paying attention you can normally tell they will be changing soon so it might be worth waiting. Better you hang yourself up for .5 seconds on the STOP/GO than accidentally grazing a wall and bouncing into the -X blocks.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Finally, getting the ? at the very end is normally worth it. Most of the time you get a Time Stop, but rarely you get a +5 seconds. Also remember to quickly swing your camera when heading for the goal to give yourself some fake acceleration.

	"Yes, it's possible to use the camera spin trick to exit the level through the rocks like people have mentioned in the thread, however I don't like to do it here. The chance of me screwing it up and potentially wasting alot of time (killing a run), does not make up for the extra 0.2 seconds it takes to finish the level the normal way.

	"At the first +3 block is really the first difficult part in the level, you can waste a lot of time trying to be careful, or you could do what I did in the video and make things even worse: Let go of the speed button (ugh). You see me press it again to get the speed to break the +3 block, but I accidentally jump off of it into the X Block. Should have probably just rushed through and took the penalty in the first place.
	$LF

[p 
	"Around the corner is the next disaster area. Hitting one of those bumpers can end a run. It could send you all the way back up the way you came from, or bounce you into a X block. If you hit it once, it's hard to regain control. Luckily it gives you a long stretch to get ready. Can't handle it much better than I did in the video.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"After another long hall, you get to the second run ending spot. The STOP/GO blocks. They aren't actually what the issue is. It's that bumper that you need to worry about. It's best to just take a 3 second penalty and play it safe. You don't want what happened in the video to happen to you...
	$LF

[p 
	"The next section with the ? and +5 is actually one of the easier sections in the level, and you should make it your best friend. If it's nice to you, you can make up for most of the time you have lost. Enter the room and beeline for the ? block. Break it and use the deceleration it gives you to quickly line up the +5 block. Break that and then loop around the X block and out of the room. Pretty easy to get out of here with no penalties.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Up next, the last major obstacle in the run. It's really not too bad, and there are two ways you can approach it. The way that I did it in the video is the safest way, by slipping into the alcove to give you time to line it up. I would probably suggest sticking with this. However, you can also just pull a quick u-turn upon entering the room and just barrel between them. This can be tricky, and if you miss you tend to end up bouncing into one of the corners of the room, wasting a ton of time. This is normally what I try to do, for some reason...

I was really nervous going into 10 and managed to screw it up. BADLY. I've since got a handful of scores in the 710-720k (I think one closer to 730k than what I have listed), but no longer feel like playing the game so I doubt that I'll improve this.

	"This level is all about judging angles, and being able to pick the right one to push against the acceleration pads. This is something that I think is too hard explain in words. You can watch the video to get an idea, but it mostly comes by playing the game. However, once you do this, the level becomes EXTREMELY easy.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"As shown in the video, you want to use the acceleration pads to your advantage in this level. From the very beginning use that first arrow to give you a boost of speed to break through the first barrier. It's normally best to just skip the time blocks here if you miss them, it can be a large waste to get them in you get stuck in the acceleration blocks.
	$LF

[p 
	"Around the first corner I don't turn my camera on a sharp enough angle to avoid the X block. Oh well, no time to worry about that. In the following section I get hung up in the video. To avoid that, stick to the middle of the hall, and avoid breaking blocks. The second you waste breaking a block is directly made up at the end up the level anyways.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Up next is the second wall of blocks, it's normally worth using a steeper angle to avoid rolling too far and breaking the -3 block. If you do break it, make sure you hit the +5 as quick as you can and move on.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Right on the other side of the wall of blocks cut quickly across the acceleration pads so you don't get trapped down at the bottom. This brings you to the long section of accelerators. This next section, and all the way to the blocks at the end of the level can be done in one go, without stopping, and without hitting a wall. Believe me when I say this, it's easier than it sounds. 
	$LF
	"In the video I screw up the first half of this next big section pretty badly. Pick an angle (45 degrees maybe?) that you think will get you down the cooridoor without hitting either wall. If you hit a X block make your angle narrower to try and get through the rest of the tunnel without hitting another one during your invincibility time. At the end quickly spin the camera and get prepared for the next hall. (Don't do what I did in the video and end up in the bumper) After you flip the camera, pick an angle and head down the other side.

	"You will notice that in the hall of boxes in my run I miss a bunch of bonuses and don't go back for them. Oops. This is another judgment call on your part. I looked at my time left and saw 80 seconds left on the clock. Knowing that I have a habit of accidentally knocking the -3 and -5 second blocks, I can work out that chances are if I do go back for them my time will be about the same or worse. I figured better safe than sorry. My goal was to record a run of over 700k, not go for a record.

[p 
	"The last room is probably what most people consider the hardest. It's actually the easiest. As seen in the video if you are Black Steel and are holding the speed button you can just beeline to the end. For a bit of extra speed you can spin the camera a little, but it's safer not to. If for some reason you do end up in the corner, start yourself moving in a circle and then just spin your camera. More often than not you end up hitting the goal.
