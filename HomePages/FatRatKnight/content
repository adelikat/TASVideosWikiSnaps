[p 
	"Deals 3 damage, with a main projectile and two smaller projectiles. Its charged shot sends us flying at 3 pixels/frame for around 60-ish frames. The big reason to pick this thing up is for the flying 3 pixels/frame, which for some reason lets us do a mid-air jump after it finishes. No frame perfect trick here, just release the charge in mid-air, and after it's done, we can jump once any time. Critical for breaking the auto-scrollers of Stages 2 & 4. The fact the charged flame attack also deals 5 damage is convenient for destroying enemies on the way for items, as no normal enemy has more than 5 HP.

Nothing against a 4-damage uncharged projectile that keeps lag low, but just having it gets in the way of weapon select in Stage 5, so it's value is negative.

[p 
	"Deals 3 damage with two really slow shots. The charged shot gives a 6 HP barrier that, so long as it is visible, prevents us from shooting, switching weapons, or pausing. This would be a crippling disadvantage, but Charge Swap lets us get rid of the sprite and keep the barrier, letting us fight back with impunity. That makes it a cool "weapon" we pick up right after getting all the cooler weapons.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Deals 4 damage. The missile isn't fast. Its charged shot deals 6 damage, and basically acts the same. Its one advantage is that the charged shot is basically the only one that goes away when it hits something, mitigating lag. Shame its usefulness isn't up to par with all the good stuff.

[h3 
	" Star
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Deals 3 damage with stars, and it shoots 3 in a spread pattern. Its charged shot deals 6 damage with a pair of pretty fast moving stars in some pattern I find hard to describe. These stars can exist pretty far off-screen and is critical for the Boss Skip, but since there aren't any enemies we can use outside of the end stages, this weapon is left until after we pick up all the good stuff. Would be useful for two Miniboss Skips, but it's impossible to do Stage 6 before Stage 6, and Stage 1 has a rather vital weapon we need rather early.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Deals 4 damage, with an annoyingly long bounce around. As fun as it is to make it work, we can't do much other attacking while it's out, and we've got flame charges to do. Its charge shot fires a pair of 8-damage giant spikeballs that are excellent for taking down bosses, but this by itself isn't really a sufficiently good reason for going through Stage 7 as early as we did. The Leg Upgrade is primarily why we end up with this weapon early, but it also saves a small amount of time over just laser versus bosses.

]p
[h3 
	" Laser
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Deals 4 damage. Not really exciting, but it's still more than basic shots. The charged shot is this mega laser that deals 10 damage and often hits minibosses twice. Lasts just slightly too short to double-hit bosses. The properties of the mega laser also frees our movement in cases where it really shouldn't be freed, which among other small time savers, also allows the Boss Skip to happen at all.

[p 
	"The Ledge Clip is done by falling toward a ledge while facing toward it, then once past it, face away from it. The game is looking at exactly one pixel to see if you land, and it's toward your back foot. This depends on the local terrain, but if there aren't any floor tiles below the ledge, you're going down.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Ghost Fall happens when your feet are below the camera edge. For one reason or another, this disables your vertical collision with terrain. This would be fatal, as terrain is the big thing stopping you from falling to the center of the world, but there's two ways to escape without the die ability: Land on an object platform, or use Flame Charge and jump out. As it happens, every place we Ghost Fall, we have such escapes.

[p 
	"Ceilings don't work. Wall jumps insist on moving you upward in part of their ascending, even after hitting a ceiling. All we have to do is wall jump into ceilings, and provided our skull is thicker than the ceiling, we'll get through. Apparently our skulls are 3 tiles deep, since it is impossible to jump through 4 solid tile blocks.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In case the knowledge is important, the solid tile, the walljump tile, and the spikes tile all count as ceilings and will try to stop our ascent. The floor tiles, on the other side of the ceiling we're clipping through, do not count as ceilings, so all those platforms that look 4 tiles wide don't have the floors on the topside count, so we can go through those platforms.

We need position x376 to land there, yet jumping as late as we can and turning around to move the important pixel further, the best we've got is x374. We are exactly one frame of movement away from meeting it. Again, we are denied this one jump with mathematical precision.

Jumping up on top of the ladder ahead is actually just a bit out of reach of a full jump, but we press Down to climb on the ladder. This lets us grab on to the ladder from a much higher position than Up, as the game is looking at our feet instead of our head for a ladder tile.

The precise timing enables our hitbox to clip just past his hitbox corner, and we're past his head without taking damage. He's got 5 HP, and it ain't easy knocking that down swiftly, but our last bullet is enough and we can end our jump sooner, falling past where he once stood and landing early enough to avoid slowing down.

We travel far enough right to trigger this segment, turn around, and fall past the spikes. This is the Ledge Clip, something you'll see more of when floors become inconvenient like now. Essentially, the important landing pixel moves 8 pixels depending on where you're facing, and the game doesn't extend the spikes under the floor, so after falling a bit, we turn around and sneak the important pixel under the floor.

We have to headbonk on a solid tile down a ways, as the ladder tiles do not extend to the left wall.

	$LF

[p 
	"While the Miniboss Skip does work on some other stages, before we get damaging weapons, the advantage of a 4-damage weapon here does not overpower the advantage of fighting the first boss with the Arm Upgrade. Even Stage 7 has all the advantages it can get: Miniboss Skip, Leg Upgrade, a 4-damage weapon, and even a good charged shot when we get the Arm Upgrade for the boss, and even those are not enough to be worth the difference of 9 hits on the boss (28 hits down to 19) with the Arm Upgrade.

The spikes and floor arrangement is very similar to before, so we just do that and down we go. Point of note, it is possible to time the Ledge Clip to stop ourselves from moving left with floor tiles, but spike tiles do not restrict horizontal movement, so there's nothing we can do to stop from moving 2 pixels left.

Carefully timed jumps move the spawn zones just right so that the spawn points move through the corner spawn zone without us moving upward through that corner zone. If you don't understand, we make a magic jump at a magic spot. Team 4 knew about this for the lower enemy, but didn't figure it out for the upper enemy. It wasn't me who manipulated the spawn zones to prevent the upper enemy from ever existing. Note we can't do it on the right-side enemies, as the spawning zones on the right side are extremely thick, and is still easily within that region when we finish even our largest jump.

For anyone who didn't route for Arm Upgrade first, it's "shoot boss 28 times with 60 frames charging against 96 frames invincibility," as trivial as it sounds. But with Arm Upgrade and only the basic buster, the stategy then becomes "use doppler effect and Charge Storage to optimize 140 frames charging against 96 frames invincibility."

[p 
	"Bosses have 11 main HP and 5 sub-HP per main HP. In total, that means I need to blast away 55 HP. Since there's no chance at overflow damage with 3 damage maximum, it's just counting how many 3-damage shots it will take to remove 55 HP. The answer is 19, with 2 damage to spare. 140 frames of charging is a long time, longer than the 96 frames invincibility by a full 44 frames, plus one more frame because one of them B is released to shoot. 60 frames of charging (okay, 61 because B released to shoot) is well under, and since I have 2 damage to spare, I can replace two 3-damage shots with a pair of faster 2-damage ones, so I can shoot 17 full blasts and 2 decent blasts.

[p 
	"The movement necessary keeps me very busy, at least. Charge Storage requires I take damage, but enables me to shoot a 3-damage charge while keeping fully charged. This is done by releasing B in the moment you lose control, and pressing it the instant control is regained. We lose control thanks to dialog, so we get a free Charge Storage at the very start. Since we haven't been damaged yet, we walk forward to take a hit and repeat the glitch. After that, we generally walk back so we can fire our shot as early as possible, giving it some travel time before hitting the boss, and letting us charge our next shot sooner. The "doppler effect" I was talking about earlier.
	$LF

Sure, this is faster than 140 frames, but the doppler effect makes up for enough of the 140 frames that it still saves time, and lets us take a hit for Charge Storage without the 112 frames wait. Besides, too much damage, and we'd need a Heart Tank, costing 5 frames and is so much less stylish.

As much as 3 pixels/frame is an upgrade to 2, the Arm Upgrade's benefit against the first boss encountered, as well as the side benefits in Stage 7, overwhelms the advantage that dashing gives. The Secret Team is the only one who took Stage 1 without Leg Upgrade, and Stage 7 with both 1 & 8 already done, so their times made it easier to compare routes.

We also had to jump early enough so the back of our head didn't interact with solid or walljump tiles in order to jump as high as we did.

Basically there's a special address (15F0) that gets written to whenever the game wants to lock the player control. Part of the laser's effects are to lock the player in place, and so does the capsule. Since these things don't really account for each other, once the laser object finishes, it unlocks us. We're free to move as we please. As a result, we steal the capsule glow, taking it with us. We have to switch weapons eventually, and the glow ends when we do, so we switch as late as we can.

The center platform is one example where a "failed" ceiling clip was done so they can reach the wall on the right, just high enough to grab on the non-locking portion of the ladder, saving from having to make an extra jump or waiting out the ladder climb.

This is a rare instance where the player's position is more important, because it means an important enemy moves in the right direction sooner. Until then, we manipulate more laser ammo. Fighting 5 HP enemies with only one laser shot left doesn't help, so of course we manipulate lots more ammo in a hurry.

Still, the game keeps track of total damage dealt, and although the overflow damage can't actually remove more than one HP at a time, later hits will make use of the overflow damage and a weak attack or even the 0-damage Muzzle Flash will be able to remove one main HP on the next attack. Basically, the strategy boils down to doing enough damage up-front so that later attacks just need to make the hits rather than damage. You can't defeat bosses faster than 11 hits, no matter the damage.

I have observed getting two hits with the laser, but it is so difficult and unwieldy to do, I simply gave up the attempts and went with single hits. Even if it weren't for the lock break at the door, 11 ammo will not suffice for laser only, so I spend an Ammo Tank during the battle. Other than that, I made sure to get in hits whenever the invincibility timer runs out and all that stuff. Things the leading teams did, you know?

	"Our third stage, we finally pick up the flame weapon. We need it to break auto-scrollers, and a number of sensible moving of right through the air. There's a lot of flat ground to dash on here, which the Leg Upgrade from Stage 7 helps us here more than Flame Charge helps in Stage 7. Apparently, most enemies have 2 or 3 HP here. Rather low compared to the 5 we frequently met in the first two stages we went to.
	$LF
]p
[p

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Dashing requires a double tap to, well, dash. When we jump out of a dash, we are stopped for one frame. The double tap has a 20 frame timer between taps, so we can tap once, do a really fast jump, then finish with our second tap. For a tap to work, we have to release left or right for a frame, which also delays us. By making a tap on the frame we jump out of a dash, we overlap some of the zero speed frames, so that it wastes less time. Then we only need to release for one more frame when we land, as opposed to needing the two taps then. This is done for short ledges, but higher ledges are too high and our 20 frame timer expires before we land.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The higher ones aren't perfectly straight-forward either. Sure, we have to jump higher, and we have to make the double tap to dash when we land. However, the important pixel the game uses when landing depends on our facing, always toward the back foot. The process of facing left requires us to move one frame in that direction, so although we lose 2 pixels, we can dash 3 frames earlier, for a net gain of 1 pixel.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"At the spot where we take damage from a fire, there's another fire we managed to get past. Initially, it is faster to just shoot that short platform and keep dashing, making only one jump, but we took the path we did because otherwise our invincibility runs out a few frames too early and we take damage at the second fire. In fact, the timing is so tight our invincibillity wears off and we're relying on the fact our hitbox is disabled when we're on the invisible frames of the invincibility blinks, for just those last few frames.

	"We enter this segment by dashing straight off the ledge. Yes, I'm well aware of using jumps to give ourselves vertical momentum by the time we reach the edge, and is a common trick in many other games. Yes, I do those jumps on some ledges in this game, in fact. The reason we don't here is because the dash speed makes up for it in fall time, and jumping does not carry dash speed through it. If we were going to a left-side ledge, then I would have jumped, as ending a dash checks the right-side pixel for whether we're over air to begin our fall. We earlier shot a glitched basic bullet to hit an enemy, but destoying it meant lag, and all we needed was to delay the enemy anyway, so it lives.

	"There is a plaform with a ladder in the way. We must take the ladder. We also tap left as we land, so to get a dash ready, and do a Ladder Dash after climbing down. It's a rather mundane use of our first Ladder Dash, as a convenient way to drop out of the ladder earlier, or without the upward bump from jumping off. Keep in mind the ladder locks us in climbing for part of the way.

The next enemy on the wall is taken out with a regular spikeball shortly after. Actually, we were delayed by this enemy a bit, so that our regular spikeball can reach, but it's better than wasting 16 frames of ouch. Note that a spikeball travels at 4 pixels/frame, but we scale walls at 6 pixels/frame, and this is about the only way to get the spikeball to unload off-screen.

On the ground, I tap left to begin the Dash Ready timer, jump up to the ladder, catch on, then dash left from there before the timer ends. Our second Ladder Dash is a lot more glorious than the first, as now you see us fly through the air. Even nicer, this Ladder Dash lets us jump out of it, so we effectively get a mid-air jump from it, and it's enough to make the shortcut to the platform. Yes, it is glorious.

	"Not sure what's up with the last wall jump. Apparently I got better height from exact same input as T4. 4-frame animation rule? We use charged spikeball to swat another 2 HP enemy, and go down to 1 ammo left.

No, it's not that the door refuses to open without a key, but rather that it locks our control, and we're breaking that.

Charged Spikeball does 8 damage per hit, and usually gets in 2 hits with optimal timing. Charge Storage off of dialog, and we typically open with 3 or 4 hits for 24 or 32 damage right off the bat. Since we lack weapons, I do one more Charge Storage by taking damage (twice, to use invincibility to help position the second hurt), fire one more charged Spikeball, and drop straight to negative ammo for 6 hits at 48 damage. Honestly, at this point, I sort of am kind of doing that for show.
	$LF

[p 
	"Then again, no matter how much damage you do, each hit can only remove zero or one bar of boss HP, out of 11 each boss gets. Thanks to all the overflow damage, my basic buster is enough for the remaining 5 hits we need to do with 7 HP of damage to deal. Two charged shots is all that is needed at that point. At no point does the boss spend one frame vulnerable without a projectile lodged in its hitbox. At this point, I'm sure you see why the above strategy is repeated basically forever. At that point, we just try to keep lag low and still beat those bosses.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I've got things to explain. The stage starts off with the auto-scroller vehicle, which is supposed to be mandatory, but Flame Charge is enough to let us skip that. Flame Charge itself lasts around 64 frames, sends you forward through air (or fluids) at 3 pixels/frame, and has a few useful glitches. With the lack of terrain in some places, it is supposed to be impossible to traverse this stage normally, but that clearly didn't stop us.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"We're faster than Team 4 due to the fact we triggered our Flame Charge with our dash counter at 39, not 40. When the Flame Charge ends, it continues whatever state we had, and the ground dash at 39 is just another frame of 3 pixels movement. The ground dash at 40 is a stopped frame. Team 4 missed this detail. Meaning I, FatRatKnight, should be embarrassed about it.

	"This is a long, long segment. Seriously, over 1700 frames with dashing and Flame Charge? That's longer than even most of our boss fights! Please, do not try to imagine what it's like at 1 pixel/frame, for when one does take the auto-scroller vehicle.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Also of note, this segment, and the other "auto-scroller" later in the stage, have broken slopes. Not seriously broken, just that most were misplaced one tile down. This is enough to stop us from just simply dashing on the slope and onto flat floor. If you're curious as to why the short jumps at the top of some slopes, this is the reason. In one case, the actual slope is backwards from what is seen there, and trying to walk on it in the visual downhill direction will have it look like the player is slowly rising to the air before suddenly snapping downward a bunch of pixels to the slope below, then rise again from there.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The first broken slope, a downhill, was taken just fine without a jump using a Flame Charge. This is because a Flame Charge interacting with a floor tile will snap the player to the top of the floor tile, and if this was done from the ground state, will continue moving forward. Jumps are slow, we like ground dashing more, and 5 damage is sure convenient for enemies in the way. We have taken damage twice in this segment, and did a Charge Storage off them both times. The lack of decent ground to dash on generally meant the extra Flame Charge we got out of the deal probably makes up for the slow damage.

	"Considering this miniboss was supposed to be fought in an auto-scroller vehicle, there is absolutely no floor below us. With no place to stand, we would surely fall to our deaths. It's a good thing this miniboss doesn't last long enough to make that a problem!
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"We enter with Flame Charge, with upward momentum from our recent jump. We timed it so the Flame Charge ends as soon as it dealt 5 damage. Switching to laser, we used its charged shot to blast the miniboss. Two hits, 10 damage each, plus the 5 from the Flame Charge, and down goes the miniboss! Then we land on what looks like nothing, and dash on our way.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The laser's timing was chosen to minimize lag, probably due to laggy animation crud lining up with other laggy animation crud to overlap the lag frames. We've taken damage, intentionally, before meeting the miniboss, so that we would remain invincible until we fire the laser, so that the 16 frames of ouch is spent moving us (slowly) rather than flatly wasted, and secondly to make the jump to the invisble terrain easier.
	$LF
]p
[p

[p 
	"Wondering about that invisible terrain? When we defeat the miniboss, we are moved straight into the next segment. Usually, the segments have their latest block coincide with the earliest block of the next one. As the game expected us to fight the miniboss in the auto-scroller vehicle, it would transition and look nice from there. Since we aren't, the standard routine of warping you to the start of the next segment is instead called, and the miniboss' and next segment's blocks do not coincide. As a result, we actually have the terrain warp in around us. My terrain script shows this effect just fine, even if the game's graphics don't. We landed on the save platform here, as you can clearly not see.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Short segment, yet I've swapped between T4's and T3's strats. T4 miniboss kill, T3 save platform location, T3's pixel perfect spot on ladder, T4's ladder headbonk. The pixel perfect spot is so we avoid a bullet later, by the way. In the meantime, we're starved for Flame ammo, and manipulate a whole bunch from a convenient 1 HP enemy.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There's two frames of inserted delay before jumping off the ladder. For some reason, removing the delay causes lag frames later, and I opted to reduce lag count. Part of the reason was because this delay happens to line up the item manipulation I did earlier, which meant less work. Removing lag is basically guaranteed savings, but removing normal frames might clash with frame rules and item drops.

	"Ghost Fall! Whee! Some teams used the Infinite Climb, which is where you climb on a ladder and misalign yourself with it, confusing the game into never finding a ladder tile and causing you to ascend or descend forever, with no respect for any terran. You only get out of it if there is another ladder on the way that's lined up with you, and thus a ladder tile is detected and you are free to move. I didn't do that this run, since it's only 2 pixels/frame, and Ghost Fall uses the falling speed of 4 pixels/frame with zero speed once every 9 frames. Triggering Ghost Fall on this ladder simply meant picking a particular camera position where traversing the thickness of the ladder is enough to trigger this segment.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Some shots were made early this segment to damage a few enemies. This is to reduce the object count as they don't fire bullets, and thus less lag. Flame shot was needed to destroy an enemy on the way, as otherwise we take damage, and the fact we got an item drop is a bonus. An enemy shoots a bullet with a rather nasty timing, needing us to be as far right as possible, one pixel short isn't enough. One more shot to an enemy so we can sneak around the right side of it damage free, and finally pick the left-most position to enter the next segment without causing an enemy to self-destruct and lag the game to pieces.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"About that pixel perfect bullet dodge. When I say as far right as possible, we had to have an odd X position. An even position would not have worked, as we travel in steps of 2 pixels, and wall detection is all-or-nothing. We can't get to an odd position during a fall, so this had to be adjusted from a dash while in the previous segment.

Flame Charge checks our bottom pixel for horizontal collision, and a floor tile gets in the way. Yes, if we loaded this segment earlier and were a few pixels higher, we would continue straight forward, but if we fire it a frame early, we fail to load the segment and collide with camera edge. Yes, the camera would be free to go down if we were a few pixels higher relative to the camera to load this segment with us higher up, but then we don't get the Ghost Fall. Finally, we are falling to our deaths thanks to Ghost Fall, with the only hope of escaping is to Flame Charge. No, there is no way to cut a Flame Charge short.

	" No, actually we use Charge Swap on our Bubble Barrier so that we get rid of the sprite and can still attack and change weapons. The barrier's just invisible. Get used to seeing it. Or not, it's invisible. Team 2 had the inspiration. You'll want a script to see the protection the barrier gives, because otherwise you'd think I have somehow encoded an invincibility cheat into the input file. It's not complete invincibility, the barrier itself has 6 HP.
	$LF

[p 
	"We need to immediately activate the barrier, then immediately use a Flame Charge, with no break in between. This actually makes it important that we do Stage 5 before Stages 2 or 3, as we'd otherwise have a weapon in between flame and bubble, which will slow us down 2 frames to move the cursor an extra step. Since none of the remaining weapons are even worth the 2 frames, here I am, selecting Stage 5 after 4, and if those 2 frames get me a frame rule, it's more than any other route can give.

[p 
	"We're still not done with talking about the first frame of the stage. In addition to Bubble Barrier Charge Swap to Flame Charge, we also don't immediately dash. If we do, we're in screen position X 82. By walking two frames first, we can shift this to screen position X 80. This is yet another example of the importance of the camera, as it is that which loads segments, not our position. And it is vital at the end of this segment that the camera is in a better spot.

	"So, with the

The ladder, aside from its top tile, doesn't interfere with my movement, so I can get into position to trigger the Ghost Fall easily enough. Most teams began falling at screen position X 82, but since we did so at X 80, we fell for a shorter time before triggering the segment. So we're on a different fall cycle when the camera begins moving down, and as a result, we manage to reach the next segment just before we hit the part of the fall cycle with zero speed. I suppose we do manage to fall faster than other teams, by a single frame.
	$LF

[p 
	"The reason we lose 3 frames is because we needed another Charge Swap Bubble Barrier. Pause, switch weapons, unpause process takes 3 frames, if we get zero lag. Technically 4, but the gameplay advances one frame on the moment we press Start to pause. Since we have a barrier that doesn't interfere with our attacks, the plan then becomes to avoid enemies to preserve the barrier, rather than having to get rid of its 6 hits quickly. Enemies are enough in the way that I leave with 4 HP left on the barrier.

This additional height is just enough to reach the first ledge with a lower jump, and we can begin dashing earlier.

Then we jump onto the ladder, get ourselves to a pixel perfect hieght, and dash left before the Dash Ready expires. The pixel perfect height lets us go past the wall and later walljump up it on the wrong side. Finally, the walljumps allow us to rise through the ceiling in that awkward spot. All this so we can save having to climb a ladder only to fall back down.

The 2 HP is important in the next segment, as I'll be too busy with Flame Charge to have a chance to charge the barrier.

	"Trivia: After beating this miniboss, it is possible to almost soft-lock the game, very easily. Just charge up your bubble weapon and use the Bubble Barrier. There are no enemies before you are stopped by a breakable block. With a normal barrier up, you can't shoot, swap weapons, or pause. The barrier will never go away on its own. Good luck finding a way out! (Hint: Find a spot Ledge Clip to escape)

Actually, it'll still hit twice just fine, just that we won't have a projectile embedded in him on the frame he loses invincibility. So we fire our second spikeball early, for 3 hits of 24 damage, and no chance for Charge Storage for another spikeball hit. This works just fine, if for no other reason than the fact we can't really win faster than 11 hits anyway.

	"After that initial hit, standard procedure. Smack boss with enough overflow damage early, and lodge bullets in boss on frames that invincibility wears off. There is a moment the boss uses whirlwind attacks, but there's enough objects to lag us even if we stand still. Taking damage stops this lag, probably because the game's not drawing us, or perhaps the player hitbox is disabled for important frames. Not sure. Just that taking damage removes the lag.

The hit itself is delayed a few frames, and this was to bring the boss further up. We're on the wall to get higher up so the boss does not warp to its next position when it is hit. When the boss dies, it stays up there to explode. Far enough that the explosion particles instantly unload. As a result, we beam out earlier.

Only in the end stages are there spawns in the segment as we scroll. Although it automatically scrolls the camera to the right, moving left will still trigger spawns. In order to move left, we have to use the charged laser to break ourselves out of the door lock. So laser at door, move left when it would spawn something close enough, shoot at it before the boss speaks. Charged Star weapon is basically the only weapon that will reach far enough off-screen.
