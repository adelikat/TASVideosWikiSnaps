	"I am Scepheo. I am a judge, which means I am one of the people who look at submitted runs, see if they follow site rules and guidelines and decide on their publication tier. I also contribute to BizHawk and Hourglass-Resurrection and, on the rare occasions that I have both time and motivation for it, make TASes. For more details on what I do and have done, see the tabs below.
