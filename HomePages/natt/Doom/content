	" should need no introduction.  It's a fast paced first person shooter, with an active speedrunning community.  It has appeared many times on many "most wanted TAS" lists.  The game runs in JPC-RR in principle, but practically speaking, it's far to slow to do any useful TASing.  However, the base game includes a recording format which, if it can be made to meet the requirements of TASVideos, would allow for TASing without being encumbered by JPC-RR limitations.

	"I believe very strongly in verifiable TASes.  In fact, I'm oppossed to some of the emulators that are allowed here on TASVideos.  However, I think that Doom TASes can conform to very strict standards of verifiablity.  The basic concept I want to use is 
	[b 
		"verified playback
	]b
	".  This idea stems from the thought experiment:  If someone makes a TAS on a specifically source code modded emulator (or even a modified game rom), but it plays back in the official emulator with the official rom, is there a problem?  I don't think so; the modded emu and rom are just tools like any others.  So the basic plan for Doom then is to have an officially certified playback method, but any method at all allowed for recording.
