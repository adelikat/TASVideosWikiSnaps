Only really worked on pcejin, where sync can easily be fixed by a method such as the hybrid encode script.  If you have an a/v sync issue, contact me and hopefully we can fix it in some way that does not involve this abomination.

		" pipedec - A VFW "codec" that pipes the raw data to an external application of your chosing.  Works well with x264 and ffmpeg; possibly with others.  Good for avoiding 2GiB limits (a must in gens, which screws up 2GiB split), speeding up dumping (even if your encoder is slow, you get dual core seperate process benefits), and decreasing size by using x264 rgb lossless, which x264vfw does not support.  Note that this will significantly complexificate your workflow, and a hacked FFMS is required for x264 rgb.
