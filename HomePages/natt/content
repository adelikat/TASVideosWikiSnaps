Good for avoiding 2GiB limits (a must in gens, which screws up 2GiB split), speeding up dumping (even if your encoder is slow, you get dual core seperate process benefits), and decreasing size by using x264 rgb lossless, which x264vfw does not support.  Note that this will significantly complexificate your workflow, and a hacked FFMS is required for x264 rgb.
