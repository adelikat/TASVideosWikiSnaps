	"I started TASing back in 2021, when I decided that it would be cool to have a TAS of Iconoclasts, one of my favorite games ever, and I found out it was possible! I've put most of my work on PC TASing, and I'm apparently personally responsible for people trying it out or getting them to know stuff was not just memes. I've done my best to understand some arcane shit like Unity game TASing for instance, not because I'm particularly smart but mostly because I'm relentless and I go the distance to share the games I love. TASing, to me, is just another way to share games I care about.
