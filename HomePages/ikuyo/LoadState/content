	"Hi! This is a prototype post for a monthly roundup post proposal I made in Memory's thread about TAS communication and outreach. I'm aiming specifically for a bulletin board style where I shout out work in different platforms by as many authors as I can manage. I'm working on the tone and general structure as I go. Feedback welcome!

					" 
					(__wikiLink|href=/6368M|implicitdisplaytext=6368M)
					" and 
					(__wikiLink|href=/6371M|implicitdisplaytext=6371M)
					" are significant improvements to some of the oldest standing publications on the site. Lunar Pool in a TAS environment becomes a physics-based puzzle game where small changes can drastically impact the outcome. eien86 not only improved these two by a combined 6 minutes, but also released a new Minimum Strikes, No Friction movie that aims for as few strikes as possible.

				[li 
					" 
					(__wikiLink|href=/6389M|implicitdisplaytext=6389M)
					" is another major improvement to a 8 year old movie. DarkRiolu27 changes the route of the prior run by opting to get the required Stone powerup in the last room, both reducing lag and allowing them to preserve speed in earlier rooms.

				[li 
					" 
					(__wikiLink|href=/6375M|implicitdisplaytext=6375M)
					" contains some counterintuitive routing decisions that pay off, as Walgrey discovered that intentionally driving through mud patches ends up being faster in the long run. Another reminder that optimization in TAS work is not always obvious!

				[li 
					" 
					(__wikiLink|href=/6377M|implicitdisplaytext=6377M)
					" is the first published movie for M3 and their first submission as well! A 7 seconds improvement over the original submission by NemoRuby. Congratulations on a successful debut, and I hope to see more of you!

				[li 
					" 
					(__wikiLink|href=/6380M|implicitdisplaytext=6380M)
					" is both ingenious and funny, as Winslinator forces the CPU to forfeit on an empty board of Reversi by exploiting a glitch. ILLEGAL MOVE indeed!

					" If you enjoy Prince of Persia, you're in for a treat, as three different versions of the game got new movies.

					" beats a lesser known official Flash remake of the original, 
					(__wikiLink|href=/6387M|implicitdisplaytext=6387M)
					" is a showcase of collaboration and tenacity for the Game Boy Color port, and 
					(__wikiLink|href=/6396M|implicitdisplaytext=6396M)

					(__wikiLink|href=/6382M|implicitdisplaytext=6382M)
					" is an interesting fangame movie where Mikewillplays shows clean gameplay. On the other hand, 
					(__wikiLink|href=/6399M|implicitdisplaytext=6399M)
