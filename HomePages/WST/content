	"Hi, I am Ilya Averkov, known in the TAS world under nicknames WST and sylabulus. I am a pure tool-assisting speedrunner, my realtime skills are very poor. I have great experience at TASing Sonic the Hedgehog and it’s hacks; however, Sonic wasn’t the only one game I played in my childhood. In fact, my first «Sonic» game was Somari — a pirated Dendy game which was quite popular in my country in 1990s. Thus, when I first time saw Sonic the Hedgehog on Sega Genesis, I was sure it was a remake/improvement of the more famous (as I thought) Somari.

	"I also played Battle City, Super Mario Bros., Comix Zone and some other games, but I don’t feel like I want to TAS them. There are a lot of Sonic hacks available nowadays, thus, playing the same game again and again never makes me bored. I prefer cooperative TASing with my friends, mainly feeuzz and Qwerty, but sometimes I TAS alone. Most of my TAS projects are just-for-fun runs of separate levels. They are not meant to be submitted or to turn into serious projects, thus, I simply put them on my
