	"I'm a 20-year-old French guy, currently studying in an engineering school.

	$LF
	"I firstly got in touch with speedruns while I was searching for gaming videos, and I then watched a lot of runs on Speed Demos Archive.
	$LF
	"A few weeks later, I stumbled across TASVideos, and I found the idea of transcending games with "perfect" gameplay fantastic.

	"I became an editor on the 2010-06-30 and was promoted to vested editor on the 2010-08-10.

[p 
	"I partly revamped the 
	[a class=intlink href=/Movies/GruefoodDelight 
		"Gruefood Delight
	]a
	" page, and I'm currently trying to encode every movies listed there - I also sometimes happen to encode new submitted runs - as well as keeping it updated when interesting submissions get rejected or cancelled. I actually really like the idea of such a page, that gives a second chance to TASes.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"I also gave a hand with the 
	(__wikiLink|/RejectedSubmissions|Rejected Submissions)
	" page, by figuring out the reasons why some submissions got rejected.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Besides, I try to keep wiki pages updated and correct typos when I see them.
	$LF

[p 
	"I'm not sure I'll start TASing games in the future, as it is a very time-consuming. But I like the "find the optimal route" side of TASing.
