So I just started messing with it, and it eventually resulted in clipping into the spaceship room and beating the game.

I forget the exact time, but I think it took me roughly 4 months to do this one, which considering my work ethic is quite a long time (seriously usually it takes me like a week). A lot of the tricks in this run that I discovered later trickled down into RTA runs.
