However, I found out via messing around that you could get an Attack Star to follow you if you didn't kill it. So I just started messing with it, and it eventually resulted in clipping into the spaceship room and beating the game. Considering how I barely understood TASing at the time, it's a small miracle I managed to figure that out.

I not only had to figure out touch controls, I had to completely route the game from the ground up, due to my suspicion of getting Judgement Triad before Riku, which turned out to be correct. I forget the exact time, but I think it took me roughly 4 months to do this one, which considering my work ethic is quite a long time (seriously usually it takes me like a week). A lot of the tricks in this run that I discovered later trickled down into RTA runs.

I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my words. You think you can get away with saying that to me over the Internet? Think again. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe you off the face of the continent. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you idiot. I will rain fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re dead, kiddo.
