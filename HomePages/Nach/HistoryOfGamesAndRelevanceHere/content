	"Our knowledge of games that people played goes back several thousand years, although our knowledge of the precise rules for these games only goes back several hundred. Rules of a game are important in modern law, as a vague concept of a game cannot be patented, only a particular set of rules for it. The closer we come to the modern video game, the more precise and exacting we generally find rules to be. Modern video games which are based on electronics or computer code have the rules as part of the game itself, and are defined down to the last detail. In such games, the rules are part of the game itself, they can never be violated without making changes to the game itself, and players cannot invent their own ways to play. However, what a game's rules are perceived to be are different than what the game itself knows the rules are, and this is where TASing comes in. A TASer ignores what everyone believes about the game, what the instructions might claim, or what may make the most sense visually, they will follow the game's rules as actually implemented, and find the fastest and most entertaining way to complete the game.
