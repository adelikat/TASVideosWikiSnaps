	"I have been a speedrunner since 2020 when i first started watching runs of Sled Storm by Gawrit. I have been a TASer since ~2021 after Gawrit asked what a Sled Storm TAS could look like, so i decided to become a TASer. Making a TAS has always been interesting to me because of the many things you could do, the many ways you could express yourself through a video. I am mostly against speedrunning, because games are meant to be enjoyed casually. I am also against making TAS, unless they are speedgames that have a built in ingame timer. If the game has a glitch or exploit that makes the game more enjoyable to watch im all up for it.
