				"More than anything else, the focus here seems to be the humiliation of the opponent and the entire game, all the while having fun of course. There are large combos as expected, but even more than that just spur-of-the-moment trickery, including collision detection abuse, playing with the opponent's moves and lots and lots of glitches. Some of the two-player matches crown the run. How is it possible to end a first round with a finisher, like in Smoke/Nightwolf matches? So much chaos, and some of the worst (in a good way) fatalities I've ever seen.

				$LF

			[p 
				"I watched from the shadows as this thing was constructed and viewed the WIPs the TASers posted in the MKTAS community forum. The three players took turns in doing the matches here, and I think it shows in the final result. While there was a plan in their mutual effort, the composition of the run remains somehow messier and more imbalanced (for example regarding use of characters and keeping the entertainment level high throughout) than in the first, "classic" UMK3 run made solely by SDR. That's what bothered me then, and that's what still bothers me a little. Some rounds are glitched so badly you can't really tell what's going on any more, while some other rounds are relatively tame. In this sense, the run could be improved some day... and who knows, there may be more glitches to be found as well?

				"This run is nice in how it shows, intentionally or inadvertently, many N64-specific MKT things. The three-story arena is one thing like that, as is Khameleon and the 3-on-3 kombat mode. Probably many combos and glitches too, but those I'm not an expert on.
				$LF
			]p
			[p 
				"While Khameleon is an interesting character, I feel she is a bit overused in this run. I mean, she is difficult to see properly. But at least her continuing presence makes it feel like she and Shang Tsung are somehow the culprits behind all this glitchiness, ones that have an ongoing rivalry going on between them too. It's like a wrestling soap opera setting. "Oh no, there goes Shang into the pit! Wait, look! He came back and is ready for revenge!" And so on.
				$LF

			[p 
				"The run starts out pretty normally, mainly showing big combos, acrobatics and A.I. oddities at a fast pace. It's not until 12-13 minutes in when the authors start using stuck frame glitch, which is close to being the glitchiest glitch in all of the 2D Mortal Kombats ever. It effects most facets of the gameplay and allows some very strange effects, such as getting stuck in air, totally mangled sprites and (most prominently) these strange glitch characters that start loitering in the fighting arena.

				"It was a pleasant surprise that we got a run of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 on Genesis to this site as well. It fares quite similarly to the SNES version, other than it has worse graphics and sound. There are still plenty of glitches and the action becomes quite surreal to watch on more than one occasion - although it never gets as insane as in the new SNES UMK3 run.
				$LF
			]p
			[p 
				"One thing I'd criticize the runners for is that some characters are used very frequently while others are used infrequently. It's not a coincidence: some characters are simply that much more useful for creating glitchy mayhem with. Other than that, the composition of the run is alright. There are surprises well into the end of the run, and as usual, some especially deranged 2p-matches break up the determined climb of the arcade ladder.
				$LF
			]p
			[p 
				"Dark Noob's and Ksylatron's other work has involved TASing for example Ultimate Mortal Kombat Trilogy on Genesis (a hack with extra characters), so Genesis UMK3 was pretty familiar to them at this point. A pretty good run, worthy of watching if you're a fan of Mortal Kombat at least. It's likely this is not the last we'll see of these two...

				"At the beginning the run is just intense fighting with a little bit of strange going on. However, the further it goes, the crazier it gets. *small spoilers ahead* The gratuitous ice clone fight with two Sub-Zeroes should be your first warning. When I watched this run for the first time, I was really impressed with the glitch that makes the background graphics disappear. Made it seem like the world was ending. It's not that epic to me any more, but the following, even more glitched sections of the run wouldn't be the same without it.

				"At the end, after a botched brutality move and an unceremonious close of the curtains, you are simply left wondering what on earth just happened.

				"Mortal Kombat II is one game in the series I'm not very familiar with. But if this movie truly showcases the utmost potential of this game, I have to say that this game isn't big on big combos (like the GB port). The player kicks ass with a wide variety of moves and no mercy, but the run often remains less impressive than the TASes of, say, UMK3 due to the slower pace and a more casual feel to the fighting. However, the two player-fights here still rank highly in my book and show that this game has great TAS potential in any case.
				$LF
			]p
			[p 
				"One big factor which compensates for the slightly boring vs. CPU matches is the glitch which allows the player to leave invisible projectiles floating in air, disrupting the finishing moves with truly unexpected results. The glitched fatalities are among the best things in this otherwise slightly overlong run.

				"It's a fast-paced run with the biggest priority on showing large combos and dealing large amounts of mayhem with every character (made possible by this game's equivalent of Shang Tsung, Shinnok, who can imitate any other fighter's fighting style and special moves). The author knows what he is doing, reaching the Maximum Damage-limit for combos with ease over and over again. He also visits practice mode in order to do two stage fatalities later, one of which is glitched... not a bad choice.
				$LF
			]p
			[p 
				"A short rant: I think showing regular fatalities in a tool-assisted run is usually not very meaningful. It is catering to the casual audience in a banal way, I mean, you can go watch fatalities from dozens of videos on Youtube if you want. There's nothing superhuman or TAS-only in them. Glitched fatalities can be a different matter, though.
				$LF

				"In any case, the author of the run handles things with style and an attention to general pacing. It's not a bad watch at all, but I personally prefer the newer, rejected run by TheVLACKDEMONN2294 which is more insanely technical, and has a few never-seen-before glitches in it too (to that I'd give 7.2/10).
