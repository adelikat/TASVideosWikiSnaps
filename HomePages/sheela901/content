	"My brother and I discovered TASing when we were watching old games videos, like commonly, Mario, Sonic, etc. We found a video titled something with "speedrun", or TAS. We were surprised when we first saw this movie. Glitches everywhere. We watch them more when we're bored, since they're fun or mysterious to watch. And that's how I found TASVideos.

	"About encoding, I always love computer things, for example, I started with really simple coding, like copying / moving files, from folder to folder, with Visual Studio and the language VB. I don't know why, but I love to see something in the command prompt in action, x264 for example.

	"I decided to help TASVideos with encoding, but I did first tests with feos' script, but it didn't work. I didn't understand what it says; especially with the AviSynth script. But everything is okay now. I know how to use the command prompt.

	"About myself, I'm a 15 years old student, in 10th grade, which basically means that I'm young (I wonder if staff are surprised about this). I don't do much in my life. I always play on my computer, doing technical stuff, since they're fun to play with. I also make GFX (but not advanced GFX) with Photoshop.
