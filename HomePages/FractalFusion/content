	"I discovered the site back in April, 2005 after I found and watched sleepz’s TAS of Super Mario 2 on archive.org. I signed up to the forum on June 15, 2005 (June 16 by GMT+2 time), interested in helping others with TASes. My interest in TASing began when I found a few glitches in Mega Man X2, most notably 
	[a class=intlink href=/MegaManXTricks.html#defeating_bosses_fast_to_avoid_long_invincibility_ 
		"this trick which beats Wheel Gator quickly

	".

[p 
	"My first published run was Mega Man X2 in 32:23, on October 1, 2005. The submission is also notable because it was the one thing that started my now permanent transition to the username "FractalFusion" (I was previously known as "82-35-43"). Since the first publication, I TASed many other games, mostly Mega Man games.
