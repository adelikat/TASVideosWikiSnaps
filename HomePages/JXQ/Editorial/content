Other members, editors, and administrators of the site have expressed this to me in various ways, and I have concluded that others’ vision of where the site should be headed does not coincide with mine.

	"This is a common phenomenon, and the common resolution consists of various members giving their input and discussing the possible outcomes.  I once believed this process existed on this site, but I have now lost that hope.  Actions have been taken that I simply do not understand the reasons for, and cannot figure out how the site is made better as a result.

		"Favoritism
	]b
	": I have always felt an amount of an “in-crowd” at this site, which I never wanted to be a part of.  I lack “seniority”.  I don’t like Mega Man.  I don’t care about AVIs or bitrates.  I can see it being very easy to feel looked down upon for some of these opinions, though I tend to ignore these vibes.  Additionally, things that I first believed made the site more robust actually serve to divide its members – things like starred movies, forum rank, and player status

		"Ego
	]b
	": People who favor one author over another in 
	[em 
		"any
	]em
	" circumstance have no place in the internal affairs of this site.  It is absolutely ridiculous and ultimately destructive to the goal of creating better and better TASes.  It is unfortunate that there are several people in influential positions here who have this attitude.
	$LF

[p 
	[b 
		"Publication
	]b
	": Submissions here do not become “official” in the eyes of the site until they are converted to an AVI.  This is a problem with obsoletions – a publication is not obsoleted when a new movie is submitted, but rather, when that submission is published.  This sometimes takes several months, or the submission may even be rejected, making the current publication, which is clearly obsolete, not displayed as such.

	": Some of this phenomena has been regressing - player ranks are set to be revamped to an automatic assignment based on concrete values.  However, favoritism still exists, and it probably always will in some form.  From my perspective, I've noticed it both for me and against me in different scenarios.  I dislike both directions - toward me more than against me, because if it's against me, at least I can fight it.
