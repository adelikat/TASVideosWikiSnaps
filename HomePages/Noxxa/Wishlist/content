Only recently did TAS tools catch up with systems that this game could be TASed on (my initial hopes were with the 3DS version, but maybe something else can get there first). Between extensive RNG manipulation to shape the world around your needs (looking at seeded RTA runs for inspiration) and a very large expanse of possibilities for ways to reach goals fast, I think a TAS of this game would be great to see.
