	", which I discovered somewhere around 2007. Through further searching through scattered YouTube videos and descriptions, I found the basic ideas of how these movies were made. It did take a while until I found one of those videos which also sent me through to TASVideos - this would be somewhere around late 2008 or early 2009.

	"Having joined the site to comment on the Mega Man 2 submission, I started getting more into the forum and community side. I did not consider myself a seriously capable TASer at the time, although it was around this time that I'd create my first TAS attempts of games such as Mega Man, although they were obviously far below par and I never shared them with anyone. As I gained more experience, I started to put some of my TASes on YouTube and on microstorage - these were generally boss battle exhibitions or other glitch/trick videos for classic Mega Man games. I mainly communicated about this in the Mega Man threads with t3h Icy (who I did a few co-operation projects with, none too serious) and mega_man_3 (later known as GlitchMan), who was working on his

	"In the early days of January 2010, I was approached by AngerFist about an upcoming TAS project. This involved himself, Atma and FractalFusion who were about to start a Mega Man X6 all-bosses TAS. I still did not consider myself a serious TASer at this point, but as a form of initiation I was made to make a TAS of the intro stage. After I did, Atma improved it, and I redid the stage again, and he improved it again. A few iterations later, we figured it was good enough, and I would proceed on the TAS. Because of how actively I started working on the project, none of the other TASers actually ended up having any input on the project - only Rolanmen1, who joined the project midway through, got to have a small amount of input in it. Because the project became basically my own at this point (everyone involved refused co-authorship), I submitted it as my own:

[div class=p 
	"Later on in the same year I'd submit two more TASes, one of Mega Man X5 (the first TAS I'd make that would improve on a published TAS) and one of Mega Man ZX Advent. I'd also make a TAS of Mega Man ZX together with Rolanmen1 (my first full co-authorship), which was submitted a few days after the new year.

	"Despite creating three successful TASes of main-line Mega Man games, and a fourth shortly after year's end, I only got tied for 5th place for Rookie TASer of 2010, behind Ilari, Dooty, p4wn3r, and Rolanmen1 (and tied with Marcokarty). 2010 was a crazy year.

I also got into fighting game TASes around this point, although none of those came very far.

One area of judging that was in demand at the time was handling PSX submissions, which I had a few years of experience with by this point.
