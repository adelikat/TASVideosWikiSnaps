	"Forward speed can be kept above the soft cap and sideways speed becomes an added vector and the resultant becomes the forward speed of the next action. Mathematically, the square of sideways speed is added to the original squared speed. Vectors of short length has a significantly smaller effect, but still has to be done for the maximum gain.

	"In the jump/freefall action, the maximum sideways speed is

	" A stick angle between 84.703 and 95.297 away from the front angle of any magnitude will cause the player to lose a proportion of their forward speed (called "vectoring too hard"). The sideways acceleration formula for freefall is 
	[code 
		"sidevel += NormalMaxSpeed / JumpAccelFrame * JumpSideVelRate * stickMag * sin(stickAngle - frontAngle)
	]code
	". So the maximum acceleration is 
	[code
