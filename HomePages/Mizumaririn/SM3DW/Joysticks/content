	"There are digital notches to help the player to snap to the axis angles. I call them 
	[code 
		"Stick angle
	]code
	" and 
	[code 
		"Game angle
	]code
	" to differentiate between them. A stick angle between -18.000 degrees and 18.000 degrees gets converted to 0 degrees, and a stick angle between 33.300 degrees and 56.700 degrees (smaller notch range) gets converted to 45 degrees. Any stick angle between the snapping angles are linearly expanded to have the full angle range, which is, for a stick angle between 18.000 degrees and 33.300 degrees, the increment is in a 15.3 to 45 ratio, or 1 to 2.941. Which means in TASEditor if you press Ë„ to increase the stick angle by 1, it increases by roughly 3 degrees in game. Think of it like converting from Celsius to Fahrenheit. A summary is given below.
