	"I like the idea of listing movies that a person enjoys for whatever reason.  I think it's fascinating.  Inspired by (and copycatting) pages linked to in forum signatures that (ab)use movies.cgi, and egged on by the discovery of the DisplayMovie module (which can embed the same thing into pages with other arbitrary content, like this bloated sentence), here is an annotated list of my movie suggestions.
