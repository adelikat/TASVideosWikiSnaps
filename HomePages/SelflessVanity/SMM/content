	"Before the peak of your jump, tap in the opposite direction you're jumping in so you don't change your trajectory. Near the peak of your jump, throw it like a normal shell jump. While throwing the shell, you must change direction and face back towards the direction you jumped in. If you did it successfully, the shell will move at the same speed as you, allowing you to jump on it. This trick is frame-perfect.

[div class=p 
	"There are multiple methods of re-grabbing a shell after jumping on it. The most common one is simply called a Regrab. When you jump on a shell right as it's bouncing on something, like a spring or note block, you will jump and grab the shell again.

[div class=p 
	"This next one isn't really a

	", per se, but I wanted to include it anyway. If you jump on the left side of a shell, and there is a grabbable object to the left of it (like another shell), you'll jump and grab the object. This is called a Shell Recycle.

	" A reclaim is essentially the Infinite 1-UP trick done in the air. When this is done in the air, instead of stopping, the shell continues to move. Weirdly enough, reclaims also let you bounce off of shells you can't normally jump off, like spiny shellmets and Dry Bone shells.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The traditional (and harder) method of performing a reclaim is to jump towards a wall. Near the peak of your jump, you should be ~3 blocks away from the wall. This is when you want to drop the shell. Slightly pull back right before you hit the shell, and you should do a reclaim.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"This much easier method, while only possible in SMW, requires you to be a block away from the wall. The position is rather lenient. Throw the shell upwards, then jump when the shell briefly floats. You should perform a reclaim. This upthrow method opens up new tricks, such as spinning into a reclaim and reclaiming with Yoshi.

	"In SMB1, SMB3, and SMW, the fastest method of turning around (besides sideways springs) is bumping into a wall and then quickly steering into the opposite direction. Touching a wall resets your speed and acceleration, letting you change directions fast. In NSMBU and SM3DW, however, the fastest way to turn around is to wall jump. Wall jumps give you a lot of speed in the other direction. It is best to make the walljump as small as possible since you do not get to full speed until you land.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"In SMW and NSMBU, another quick way to turn around, this time with Yoshi, is to slow down (ideally bump into a wall), stick Yoshi's tongue out, and move in the opposite direction you're facing during the lick. This gives you high acceleration, but it's not that useful for turning around since you have to slow down first.

If you have a Buzzy Beetle helmet (sometimes called a Shellmet) on, and you touch the bottom of a Wiggler that is near the surface of lowering water (this moves the Wiggler down with the water), the game freezes. Unlike most crashes on the Switch, though, it does not kick you out of the game. When you close the game, though, it will show you the crash message. The music also keeps playing while the game is frozen. It's believed that this crash occurs because of too much collision with the Wiggler.
