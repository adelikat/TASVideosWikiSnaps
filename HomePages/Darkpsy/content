I've been working with computers for about many years, and have a CCNA certification.  For those of you who don't know what that means, its called "Cisco Certified Networking Associate".  I received this certification by taking a 2 year Cisco Networking Academy course.  I also work on arcade systems, and even managed to get an In The Groove machine working, even after being told by techs that it couldn't be done.
