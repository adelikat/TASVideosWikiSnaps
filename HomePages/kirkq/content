	"At age 15, I began competing in Super Smash Bros Melee tournaments.  I have gotten to know, or at least encountered, many people who appreciate video gaming.  On a similar note, I used to follow competitive Starcraft (the original) pretty regularly.  I would like to see professional video gaming become more mainstream in the future.

	"In the past I have spent a lot of time online playing games such as Diablo 2 and Runescape.  I have since stopped playing games of this nature.  Instead of grinding personal numbers up, I have found it more worthwhile to devote my gaming time to producing a product that other gamers can appreciate.
