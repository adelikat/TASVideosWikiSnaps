This kind of verification is important for (in)validating the accuracy of emulators, as well as a form of preservation of the TAS art created by others. In recording and sharing a working verification of a TAS, the entirety of the TAS, its glitches, its movement, its countless hours of hard work, is validated as working on the games we grew up playing and is preserved as all art should be.
