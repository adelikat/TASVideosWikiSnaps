	[li 
		" 
		[b 
			"Pocky & Rocky (SNES)
		]b
		" - 2 player, hard mode, no hits taken from enemies - not as easy as it seems. I found that powerups don't actually increase the damage you do, but they have smaller advantages. Both players can slide tackle each other on the same frame to spin quickly or through tough parts of stages, this uses health but I won't count it as taking damage.

			"Equinox (SNES)

			"Metal Combat-Falcon's Revenge (SNES)

	]li
	[li 
		" 
		[b 
			"Yoshi's Safari (SNES)
		]b
		" - 100% kills and coins with the expert mode code on, and set to 2-player for more optimal movement
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 
		[b 
			"Popful Mail (Sega CD)
		]b
		" - Using the Boomerang for Mail instead of the Electro Cane because it's faster in many ways in a TAS, and juggling boomerangs in boss fights should be quite difficult and impressive-looking. Also, frame-precise character switching abuse (run, switch, jump, switch, fly) allows skipping at least one series of rooms in the mines and possibly more.

	[li 
		" 
		[b 
			"Sonic the Hedgehog Megamix (Sega CD)
		]b
		" - Whenever it's finished... Anyway it's a great game for TASing in basically every way. Probably warrants multiples TASes.

Should attempt to fight no unnecessary battles, I think it'd be faster (if it's possible). (Whoever does this had better not forget to change the brightness to TV Mode!)
