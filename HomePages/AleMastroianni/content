				"Hi, i'm AleMastroianni, or Tiziano, whichever is fine; i got into TASing in 2018 thanks to ThunderAxe31's interest in my glitches and discoveries in Crash team racing for PSX. 
				$LF
				"I immediately loved the concept and shortly after, started my first TAS on CTR.
				$LF
				"Even though my field of study is medicine and surgery and unrelated from any kind of IT stuff, i'm a firm believer in sharing knowledge and progress of science. The art of TASing is just another way i perceive our human tendencies to constantly strive for "true" perfection, which ironically is almost impossible in most scenarios.
				$LF
				"I'm very grateful to a number of people i had the luxury to interact with, such as lapogne36, thunderaxe31 and theredhotbr, who in the past years have helped me learning more in this field, especially regarding coding and a tiny bit of reverse engeneering.
