	"Hi, this is Randil's page on TASVideos. I'm a 24 year old guy from Sweden who's been doing TASes for about 5 years now. I make almost exclusively NES TASes, mostly because I like FCEU and FCEUX so much. There aren't any specific genre I prefer for TASing a game, and as you'll see, I've done many different kinds of games, but mostly platformers and puzzle games.
