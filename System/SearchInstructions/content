	"The search is sensitive for spelling. For example, ‹
	[a href=/Search.html?subs=1&key=mega+man 
		"mega man

	[a href=/Search.html?subs=1&key=megaman 
		"megaman

	"Much like the Google search, including more words in the search narrows down the search. ‹
	[a href=/Search.html?subs=1&key=Metroid 
		"Metroid
	]a
	"› will find all Metroid-related articles and movies for all consoles, but ‹
	[a href=/Search.html?subs=1&key=Super+Metroid 
		"Super Metroid

	"The quote characters (" ") restrict the search to a literal expression; without quotes it searches for pages with all the given words present somewhere. Alternatively, the period character can be used the same way: ‹
	[a href=/Search.html?subs=1&key="super+mario" 
		""super mario"
	]a
	"› and ‹
	[a href=/Search.html?subs=1&key=super.mario 
		"super.mario
	]a

	$LF
	"The asterisk character (*) can be used to search with a partial word. For example, ‹
	[a href=/Search.html?subs=1&key=Probot* 
		"Probot*
	]a
	"› will find the word Probotector. It can only be used in the end of the word, and not between quotes.
