	"Publishing is the process where an accepted submission gets made into a permanent publication on the site. This process includes encoding the run to site standards and creating the movie page with all the necessary data. Both publishers and encoders can create encodes, but only publishers are able to create publication pages. A related task is re-encoding, in which publishers or encoders create higher quality videos for older TASes.
