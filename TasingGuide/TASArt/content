TAS masters developed ways to keep the art true, and to teach people how to create TAS of the highest standard. That means not just teaching how to hold a brush in your hands, or how to draw strokes. That means teaching all possible aspects that can potentially make your work piece better. Which implies teaching the

Apply as much optimization as you can straight away. Try going over all possibilities of object/background collisions. That means not just test how they collide at different pixels, but also at different subpixels within those pixel borders.

[div class=p 
	"When you are TASing a game, you come up with approximate subdivision automatically. You just keep rerecording and rewinding some segments over and over, while others can be passed with little to no effort. Different tools allow to put subdivision marks differently.

You have more time, more resources, more room for experiments, more precision than game designers could think of.

Frame advancing can give you a good room to exploit game mechanics for entertaining purposes, just don't let yourself miss the forest for the trees - your run is supposed to be watched at regular speed in the first place, so it must be pleasant for a regular viewer. There are some ways to improve potential enjoyment.

	"First of all, try making fun of normal actions distinguishable by an untrained eye. Also, don't use plain twitching unless it can be combined with some unobvious movements (combine different movements, vary the rate, abuse movement interrupts, consider possible sound effects). A tricky skill is to keep all movements organic. This includes not just a well-styled combination of all the features. One shall play around with the internal game flow. Follow the pace of surrounding events, interrupt it. Try to 
	[b

	"Once you get an idea to start TASing something, at first try beating it in real time. If you're new to that game, blind-run it, or watch someone blind-run it, if you're bad at casual play. This way you will get the spirit of it, discover its features and hardships, get the idea the game designers were putting into it that the regular players are facing.

	[b 
		"imitate

Just feel free and open-minded during your work, put in as much effort as you can afford, improve all the speed you can, consult to TAS masters, rewatch your work at normal speed, rewatch the existing masterpieces and compare - and the TAS soul will be put in your resulting run magically by itself.
