	"Most emulators store movies as a list of inputs per frame, where a frame is each time the system draws to the screen. In these cases, the site takes the number of frames in the movie, and divides it by a pre-determined framerate to display the movie length in minutes and seconds.

	"In the case of "subframe" movies (such as from SubNESHawk), the site calculates movie length from the cycle count and cycle rate stored in the movie, and then calculates a framerate such that frame count / frame rate will produce the correct movie length (frame count in this case being the number of times input was polled, rather than the number of screen draws). For these movies, the framerate value is fairly meaningless.
