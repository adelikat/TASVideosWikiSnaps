	"When uploading to archive.org, it is worth creating an entirely separate encode which uses limited range and does not use duplicate frame removal (but is otherwise unchanged) and uploading it as '<filename>_512kb.mp4' to the archive.org mirror; this ensures that archive.org's streaming works properly.
