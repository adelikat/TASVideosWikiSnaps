	"Introduction
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"As anyone who starts TASing N64 games will discover, it is much more difficult than TASing for other systems.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This is especially true if using Mupen64. On this emulator, many games simply do not run at all or have minor or major graphical errors that either dampen or hinder the gaming experience
	[a id=r1 
	]a
	[sup 
		"[
		[a href=#1 
			"1
		]a
		"]
	]sup
	". Games that require the Expansion Pak, a memory add on to the N64 hardware that enabled it to play bigger N64 cartridges and games that had more onscreen sprites, also tend to constantly desync in this emulator. For these reasons, it is recommended that you start your TAS on BizHawk instead.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Additionally, for Nintendo 64 games in general, the difficulty of optimizing movement in 3D space leads to runs being started but never completed.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"These technical frustrations and the unknown TAS suitability of many N64 ROMs makes N64 TASing seem very daunting, something that most would rather leave alone.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"However, it is our hope that if research is done for each N64 ROM, on how suitable it is for TASing, and whether or not someone is already working on it, it will be easier for newcomers to pick a game to run. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"It is of note that N64 TASing is still in the early stages at the moment, and some games will not be able to be TASed until a superior emulator is given rerecording functions

	]a
	[sup 
		"[
		[a href=#2 
			"2
		]a
