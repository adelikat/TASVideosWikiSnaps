	"In the reviewing process, a Reviewer performs basic research on a submission. They verify that it syncs in the emulator, check for optimization, and provide feedback on their findings in the submission thread. Any number of Reviewers can review a submission. A Judge will look over and use these reviews in their own judgement. It is not necessary for a submission to be reviewed before it is judged, however reviews help simplify and streamline the process, allowing submissions to be processed both faster and more thoroughly.

	"In the judging process, a Judge first claims the submission for judgment to avoid having other judges look at the same movie redundantly. They then do any necessary research, including but not limited to watching the movie, potentially testing the game themselves, and asking for feedback. If improvements pop up, it must be decided whether or not it should either be resubmitted or whether it is acceptable to replace the submission file with the improvement. Once any necessary research is performed and the conversation and improvements have settled down, the judge makes a decision, with a judgment note describing the reasoning behind the decision.
