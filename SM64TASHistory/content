	"This was the first published Super Mario 64 run.  In its day it was an astonishing demonstration of breaking the game: MIPS the Rabbit and poor collision detection were used to get the second key early, and a "Backwards Long Jump" trick was used to get up the supposedly-infinite staircase and access the last level early.  This "Backwards Long Jump," or BLJ, became one of the most important moves in any% Super Mario 64 speedruns, while MIPS is now, sadly, entirely missing from them.

	"(Almost) Exactly a year later AKA (Mitjitsu) produced a run that was 46 seconds faster than Spezzafer's orginal run. It was largely improved by better precision via use of version 0.6 of the TAS input plugin, which introduced a "virtual analogue stick," as well as new glitches and strategies.

Not needing MIPS meant not needing the first 15 stars of the 16 star run, resulting in an astonishing 1 star run. This was a kind of Holy Grail for players, and the new movie by Mitjitsu and Swordless Link sparked shock waves of awe.
