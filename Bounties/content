This page in no way indicates that any of these bounties are real and will actually be paid for if a player happens to achieve a goal. This page is in no way considered accurate regarding rules, conditions, or monetary rewards derived from achieving a goal. Players should not assume that rules/goals/objectives posted here are comprehensive and complete enough that the user claiming to offer a bounty will actually feel satisfied by any TAS which achieves the stated goal. Players should not assume those offering the bounties are still around and active on the site, or that their heirs will honor any bounties they once offered. Players should not assume that any bounty will actually be paid for even if the user offering the bounty is satisfied with the TAS which accomplished the objectives. Players should not even assume that any bounty is anything more than a hoax or a ploy to get others to make certain TASs.

However, if a goal/objective requires the TAS be accepted and published on the site, do not assume the judge will try to accommodate for any particular bounty. In fact, players should suspect that one claiming to offer a bounty may bribe a judge to reject the movie to avoid paying a larger sum - the bounty/award itself. If someone offering a bounty is a site judge, all the more so should a player presume the TAS will be rejected and they will never get paid.
