	"The Genesis/Mega Drive version of this game is a run 'n' gun where both Batman and Robin must stop Mr. Freeze from freezing Gotham City. In order to keep the duo busy, he also frees the Joker, Two-Face and the Mad Hatter, each with their own agenda. The Joker celebrates his birthday wreaking havoc in Gotham and stealing diamonds, Two-Face tries to take over the city from above, and the Mad Hatter is creating a robot army in his surreal lair.

	"The game can be played two-player simultaneous with one player as Batman and the other as Robin. Both characters play identically and both use melee attacks as well as batarangs, bolas, or shuriken in long-range attacks. There are four levels consisting of several stages and ending in a boss fight. In some levels the game switches to a side-scrolling shooter, in which the players must control the Batwings.
