	"As a single-screen platform game, 1 or 2 players can attack enemies by trapping them in bubbles, using magic powerups, and bumping into trapped enemies. There are 100 levels in the game, but the "good ending" doesn't appear unless 2 players play through the whole game together. Once this is achieved, the game also has a second quest that makes the game faster and more difficult, culminating in a true ending whereby Bub and Bob are finally reunited with their family.
