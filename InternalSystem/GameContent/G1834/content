	[em 
		"Daikatana
	]em
	" is a first-person shooter with RPG elements by John Romero and the other creators of 
	[em 
		(__wikiLink|displaytext=Doom|href=/GameGroups/179)
	]em
	" and 
	[em 
		"Quake
	]em
	", with similar levels, weapons and music. While the PC version runs on the Quake II engine, this N64 port has different physics and omits the AI partners from gameplay. Also, the titular sword cannot be used outside of the penultimate boss fight, and skill upgrades are assigned automatically as EXP points are earned.
