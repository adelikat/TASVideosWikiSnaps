	"Seven stages are present in the prototype build leaked online, along with some boss battles and cutscenes with English text. Available moves include a standard punch combo, a jump kick, a rolling move, a special somersault kick, and a throw. Some of the controls are bugged and some cutscenes automatically skip, which might actually be good for a TAS.
