	[em 
		"Butterfly 64 DS
	]em
	" is a meme ROM hack of 
	[em 
		"Super Mario 64 DS
	]em
	" by Skelux, and is a port of their 
	[em 
		"Butterfly 64
	]em
	" hack of the original 
	[em 
		"Super Mario 64
	]em
	". Rather than a game, it is an exhibit of a butterfly flying in a circle. The only working controls are rotating the camera left and right on the touchscreen, and there is no other way to interact with the software.
