	"The player interacts with the world with a simple point and click interface directing a small, white-clad humanoid with a little cap and brown boots (called simply "gnome" by the creator). The goal is to solve a series of puzzles and brain teasers. The puzzles are sequentially linked forming an adventure story. The game contains no inventory or dialogue, and the solving of puzzles mainly consists of clicking on-screen elements in the correct order. Solving a puzzle will immediately transport the player character to the next screen.
