	" (1999) began a series of games that mixes characters from several Nintendo-made games into a unique fighting game. It relies not on wearing down the opponent's "life" but increasing damage until he or she can be literally knocked off the stage. Wildly popular, this game has inspired many lazy days of casual multiplayer gaming but also intense competitive tournaments that happen to this day.
