	"This Japan exclusive is a puzzle game seen from a top-down perspective. The goal of each level is to open the exit by pushing a magic stone on a designated spot. The player character, May, can push objects one tile ahead without moving herself, used to get stones across water that she can't cross herself. She can also create magic bubbles to move stones or other bubbles, creating chain reactions to maneuver stones into the desired position.

	"As the game progresses, levels become increasingly difficult and new hazards and enemies are introduced. Enemies follow a set movement pattern and can sometimes be stopped by the bubbles. Later levels also introduce different types of tiles that make movement or bubble creation harder.
