[div class=p 
	"There are major differences between the Japanese and international versions, with 
	[em 
		"Blaster Master
	]em
	" having a new title screen, a new intro, a modified section in Area 4 and graphical changes. The European version has a few exclusive bugs such as stopping movement by pausing and allowing double (and more) jumping. Also in that version is a changed zip mechanism which allows warping through things you really shouldn't be able to warp through.
