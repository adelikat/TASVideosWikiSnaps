	". The physics of this game allow for many interesting acrobatics, like running up the walls and ceilings at breakneck speed. As such, these abilities are abused to the point where, in some parts, Pond bounces around as fast as Sonic does.

	"Following the game's plot, the evil Dr. Maybe attempts to take over the dairy industry, for which he constructs a giant stronghold on the Moon. Because, as you probably know, its surface is made of cheese. The overworld map spans over 100 levels, but most of them are optional.
