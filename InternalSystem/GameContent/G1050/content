	"In the middle of the night, while his parents think he is asleep, Keen returns to his backyard clubhouse, his Bean-with-Bacon Megarocket still cooling down from his recent Martian excursion. He flies to the Vorticon Mothership, sneaks aboard and docks his ship at the weakest area, the Bottom Galley. With incredible luck, Keen finds a nearly empty Vorticon HyperPistol, the weapon of the Vorticon Elite. It's not much, but it'll be enough to take out the X-14 Tantalus Rays and save Earth!
