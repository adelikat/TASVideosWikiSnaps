[div class=p 
	[em 
		"SonicCD++
	]em
	" (or 
	[em 
		"Sonic CD Plus Plus
	]em
	") is a hack of 
	[em 
		"Sonic the Hedgehog CD
	]em
	" by qiuu and snkenjoi, adding the 
	[em 
		"Sonic the Hedgehog 2
	]em
	" (16-bit) style Spin Dash and the newer Homing Attack into the game. This enables the gameplay to be significantly speedier, while 
	[em 
		"Sonic CD
	]em
	" is known to be one of the more slow-paced games in the classic 
	[em 
		"Sonic
	]em
	" series.
