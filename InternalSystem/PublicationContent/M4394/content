	"This run reaches a good ending by "dying" with health remaining. This is done by activating a scripted explosion sequence on the roof of the Nakatomi building while standing just out of range of the blast. In-game time is advanced quickly by damaging John's feet and making repeated trips up and down the stairs. In addition, Heinrich's position is manipulated so the detonator can be collected quickly.
