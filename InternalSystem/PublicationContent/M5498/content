You play as a prisoner of war named Bart, a special forces soldier fighting in what appears to be Vietnam in the middle of the Cold War. Bart has managed to blow up the bars to his prison cell and with nothing but his super hard fists and ingenuity, he must now escape the POW camp and earn his freedom out of country by killing all that oppose him.
