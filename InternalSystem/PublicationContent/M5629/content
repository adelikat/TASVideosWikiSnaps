	" is a simple platforming game for the PICO-8 platform that was created for Ludum Dare 45. You control a snowball that gets bigger as it rolls over snow, and your goal is to get to the finish line in each level and create a snowman out of the snowballs you make. Watch out for the lava that doesn't melt the snow around it for some reason.
