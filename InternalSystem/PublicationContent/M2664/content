[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Montezuma's Revenge
	]em
	" was one of the first platform games, combining treasure hunting, multiple rooms and puzzle solving. The player controls Panama Joe as he explores labyrinthine 16th century Aztec temples filled with enemies, obstacles, traps and dangers. Panama Joe can jump and climb ladders, but doesn't have much to offer in terms of combat, making it imperative for him to steer clear of enemies.
