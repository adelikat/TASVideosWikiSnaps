	" (C.C.R.: Annex 1 - The Algorithm) is a homebrew adventure game for the MSX that was developed for the MSXdev18 contest. The game starts with a man who suddenly wants to jump off the top of a tall building for mysterious reasons. As you progress through the game, you'll come to learn why the man has come to that point, as a government conspiracy entraps him and many others involving a mysterious algorithm.
