[div class=p

		"Tower of Heaven
	]em
	" is a platforming game that was first released as a Windows game made with GameMaker and was later ported over to the Flash platform. The art style for this game is meant to evoke the looks of old Game Boy games. Here, you play as a humanoid trying to climb a really tall tower in defiance of the wishes of the tower's deity owner. To prevent you from climbing any further, the deity puts up rules that must be followed if you are to continue. If they are broken, you are struck by lightning and must start over from the beginning of the floor you were on.
