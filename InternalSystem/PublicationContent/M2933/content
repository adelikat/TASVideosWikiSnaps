	[em 
		"Coca Cola Kid
	]em
	" is a platformer starring Coca Cola's Japanese mascot of the 90s. On his way through the levels, the kid can make use of a skateboard, but has to continue by foot if knocked off. Enemies can be defeated by kicks and flying kicks. Unsurprisingly, energy is restored by collecting cans of a certain soft drink.  Its gameplay bears a very strong resemblance to 
	[em 
		"Sonic the Hedgehog
	]em
	", which is no coincidence, since it's built off of the 
	[em 
		"Sonic the Hedgehog engine
	]em
	" and was made by Sega.
