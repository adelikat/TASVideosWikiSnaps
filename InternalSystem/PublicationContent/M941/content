	"This game (along with 
	[em 
		"Pocket Monsters Red
	]em
	") is the Japanese version of the first generation of 
	[em 
		"Pokémon
	]em
	" games and is the first ever 
	[em 
		"Pokémon
	]em
	" game. This run abuses a bug that was fixed in later releases of 
	[em 
		"Pocket Monsters
	]em
	" that allows a player to warp freely though the world. Victory is achieved in a matter of minutes with this route. Normally, the game takes well over an hour at the fastest to finish. To see a more substantial run of
