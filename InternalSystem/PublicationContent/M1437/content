	"The use of glitchy warps is not new to Castlevania runs, but what is new is the creative use of switching between the main characters for basic character movement. We dare you to not have

	"In order to ensure that the weapon choice and route is optimal, the author created an 
	[a href=/2513S 
		"alternate fully optimized test run

	" with a new route. The run enters the final boss sooner with a weaker weapon (Final Sword), but spends more time fighting â€” so much so that 2/3 of the movie is spent fighting Dracula! Even though the emulator version was the same as the one used here, the final time is still over two minutes higher.
