		"We're Back! - A Dinosaur's Story
	]em
	" was developed by Beam Software Pty., Ltd. and released in 1993. Interestingly, the same game was released in various forms, with four editions released in separate regions: 
	[em 
		"We're Back
	]em
	" in the USA, 
	[em 
		"Baby T-Rex
	]em
	" in Europe, 
	[em 
		"Agro Saur
	]em
	" in Australia, and 
	[em 
		"Bamse
	]em
	" in Sweden. The other versions are almost identical except for the graphics; likely they were rushed out to capitalize on popular licenses in different regions.
