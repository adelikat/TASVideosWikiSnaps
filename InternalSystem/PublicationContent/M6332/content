	" is Flash puzzle platformer that mixes supernatural themes with science fiction. You play as a kid scientist who is out to rescue his baby brother from vampires. He will have to use his special photon gun to eliminate the vampires and other supernatural creatures if he's going to get his baby brother out of whatever predicament the vampires have put him in. The gameplay focuses on redirecting photon balls so they can hit matching vampires and kill them. The color of these photons can be changed by hitting a non-enemy object of a different color.
