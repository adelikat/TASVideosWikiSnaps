	" is a homebrew platformer that was created by mitch3b and link_7777  for the 2018 NesDev homebrew competition. Its Chinese title 田鸡 (simp.)/田雞 (trad.) is a pun where the word as a whole is the name for the East Asian bullfrog, but 田 means "field" or "farm" and 鸡/雞 means "chicken". You play as a frog whose goal is to collect keys to open portals to other mysterious worlds and face the titular Chicken of the Farm. You can also collect special golden flies along the way.
