		"Space Quest
	]em
	" series of adventure games. The player navigates Roger Wilco around with the arrow keys and interacts with the world by typing commands. Like in the previous game, there are many ways for the player character to die. Much of the gameplay is dedicated to avoiding the many traps and hazards Roger will meet on his way. Some actions must be performed quickly in order to prevent Roger from getting killed.
