		"Wildwaters

	" (also known as "Extreme Kayak" and "X-Stream") is a cancelled racing game that was in development by Looking Glass Studios for the Nintendo 64 in 1998-1999. The project was announced at E3 1999 by the company's publisher, Ubisoft, while the studio was working on Destruction Derby 64 (released in the same year), but sadly it was discontinued the following year. The game features an engine with real waterflow physics on the river, an impressive feat on the N64.
