	[em 
		"Devil Island
	]em
	", also known as 
	[em 
		"Emo Dao
	]em
	" (惡魔島), is an action role-playing bootleg game for the Game Boy Color developed by Vast Fame. It copies Konami's Japan-exclusive NES game, 
	[em 
		"Getsu Fuuma Den
	]em
	", with its gameplay. The game's aesthetics are styled after the 
	[em 
		"Castlevania
	]em
	" franchise, also by Konami. Much like 
	[em 
		"Castlevania
	]em
	", the player's default weapon is a whip, except it can be held down for rapid fire.
