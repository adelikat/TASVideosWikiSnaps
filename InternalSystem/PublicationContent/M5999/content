	" is a futuristic racing sports game that was released only in Europe. Set in the far future of 2049 AD, the featured sport in this game is a vehicular sport that resembles hockey but on a much larger scale. Four players control vehicles known as "Dodgems" that are dropped into huge bowl-shaped arenas and are tasked with fighting for a puck, grabbing it, and launching it into a goal that moves around the arena. While this may sound easy, the game is rather difficult due to the lack of map that shows the puck, goal, or enemies, the unfair AI opponents, and the incredibly sensitive controls.
