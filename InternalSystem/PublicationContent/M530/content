	[em 
		"Tetris
	]em
	", going from a 2D rectangular grid to a 3D sphere. Instead of making complete lines to clear the board, the player smashes Tetris blocks into a covered sphere until the core is exposed, which usually ends the level. Along the way, the player racks up points from various block-breaking combos.

	"In this movie, Acmlm plays through the "Time Trial" mode, where you have to get as many points as possible under a time limit. Watch him rapid-fire Tetris blocks so fast that no one else has any idea what's going on. Even the game itself is confused. Levels do not end properly until the entire sphere is blown apart. As for the timer when it reaches zero, well, see for yourself. :)
