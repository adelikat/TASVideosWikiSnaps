		"The Goonies
	]em
	" is a licensed platformer that is based on the movie of the same name. It was developed by Konami and was released only in Japan. It very loosely follows the plot of the movie, starting from the middle with the Goonies themselves in the Fratellis' restaurant. Everyone but Mikey has been captured by the Fratellis and imprisoned in various areas. It's up to Mikey himself to rescue his friends and find the treasure of One-Eyed Willy.
