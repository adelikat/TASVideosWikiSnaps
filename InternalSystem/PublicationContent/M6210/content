[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Hardhat Climber
	]em
	" is a platforming game for the Commodore 64 that was published in the January 1984 issue of the 
	[em 
		"Compute's! Gazette
	]em
	". Taking clear influence from 
	[em 
		"Donkey Kong
	]em
	", you play as a construction worker whose objective is to pick up toolboxes scattered across many girders. This is not as easy as it sounds, however, as there are barrels falling and rolling down from the top that can knock you off the girders. Can you climb up and down the girders to collect all the toolboxes without falling off?
