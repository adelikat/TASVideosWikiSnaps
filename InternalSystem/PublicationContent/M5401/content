	]em
	" is a math-focused educational game for various systems such as the Apple II, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum. You play as a guy on a pogo stick trying to climb the floors, and the way to do that is to pick the floor tile with the pictogram that best matches the numerical fraction shown at the top of the screen. Pick the wrong one and the tile collapses, causing you to fall down one floor. As you climb the floors, the pictograms start to become more visually complicated to make it harder to pick the right one.
