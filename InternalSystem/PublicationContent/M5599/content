[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Rose & Camellia
	]em
	" (薔薇と椿) is an action game that was developed by Nigoro, the same creators that made 
	[em 
		"La-Mulana
	]em
	". Taking place in a slightly anachronistic version of Regency era Britain, Reiko is about to be the Matriarch of the Tsubakikoji family after the death of her husband and eldest son of the family, Shunsuke. However, the rest of the household object to this, seeing Reiko as a commoner who married into the family that doesn't deserve such prestige. Reiko must now stand her ground the way people in the Regency era did: by slapping them into submission.
