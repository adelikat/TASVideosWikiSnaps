	"Earthworm Jim is the unlikely story of an earthworm who finds a suit with super powers and goes on a rampage to protect Earth and his puppy Peter(?). The game follows the absurd spirit of the story: for example, the suit can use Jim for a whip, there is a boss who attacks by vomiting fish, you fight lawyers in hell, and in one level, you swing on bungee cords made out of snot.
