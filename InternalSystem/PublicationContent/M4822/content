[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Tomarc the Barbarian
	]em
	" is an action game where Tomarc the Barbarian must rescue Senta from a cave she got herself lost in. Senta also managed to get herself kidnapped and is imprisoned in a cage that can be opened by Tomarc's sword. Unfortunately, Tomarc lost his sword in the same cave, so he must now find his sword and rescue Senta before the cave bats eat her alive. Special to this Atari 2600 is the ability to switch between two characters to control, Tomarc and Senta, and both characters continue to be affected by their environments even when you're not controlling them. While Tomarc is used to find the sword to rescue Senta, Senta herself is controlled to fend off the bats that are trying to kill her.

	" decides not to go through all that trouble in this run by using a good amount of RNG manipulation to get a cave layout that requires the least amount of movement needed and controlling only Tormac to get the sword and rescue Senta as fast as possible.
