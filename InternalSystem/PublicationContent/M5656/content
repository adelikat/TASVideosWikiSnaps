	" is an action-platforming game that was made in 2021 for the Sega Genesis, many years after Sega ceased support for the system.  In this epic game, you play as Gareth, one of the royal guards of the Kingdom of Asteborg. The kingdom is under attack by Zadimus and his horde of demons, who swore vengeance after being defeated in a great war in the past. As Gareth is the son of one of the heroes who helped end the war, it's up to him to stop Zadimus from conquering Asteborg and save the world from the demon invasion.
