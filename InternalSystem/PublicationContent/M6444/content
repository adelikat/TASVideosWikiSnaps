	" is a platforming game where our hero Jack goes to rescue his brother and the royal family from their imprisonment in King Demon Beelzebut's cursed pyramid. Along the way, he meets many enemies who start as mummies and change forms when they hit the ground. He also finds bomb-filled rooms at the end of each round, which work like warp rooms with a twist: you can warp ahead to the bomb room of the next round if the first lit bomb is the last bomb collected.
