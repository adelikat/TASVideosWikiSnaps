	" franchise. The NES version involves the four turtles, Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello, as they compete against each other in the Shredder's contest. It has a basic fighting system with strikes, throws, and special moves. During a match, a red ball can be dropped, which can then be used by either fighter as a power-up.
