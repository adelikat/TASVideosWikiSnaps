		"INK

	" is a minimalist platformer where the player controls a white square, and must get to the exit on each level. All walls and platforms are initially invisible, and must be gradually revealed by splashing them with colorful paint; a splash of paint erupts from the player character whenever it is killed or does a double jump.
