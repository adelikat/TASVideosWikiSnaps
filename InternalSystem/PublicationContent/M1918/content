	[em 
		"Secret of Mana
	]em
	" is a widely popular action RPG published by Square. It is internationally regarded as the first game of the 
	[em 
		"Mana
	]em
	" series, though the Japanese title is 
	[em 
		"Seiken Densetsu 2
	]em
	", so it is the sequel of 
	[em 
		[a class=intlink href=/1752M 
			"Final Fantasy Adventure
		]a
	]em
	". It utilizes real-time battles like many other action RPGs while including some unique features such as the Ring Command and multiplayer action.
