	]em
	" is a critically acclaimed first-person action game released on the Nintendo 64 in 1997. It stars a hero of controversial descent, being a pre-Colombian Native American time-travelling warrior, referred to as Turok. As such, he must stop an evil entity known as The Campaigner from conquering the universe with a time-controlling artifact called the Chronoscepter (amazing, really). This also was the reason for stuffing the game full with anachronisms, so you'll see high-tech weapons and teleporters together with magic crossbows and dinosaurs.

	"Turok has been famous for being the first fog navigation simulator of its time. The omnipresent fog was included to obscure the low rendering distance that was used in order to increase performance on N64's hardware, but it also resulted in a somewhat claustrophobic feeling throughout the game. To further confuse the disoriented player, the majority of wall textures are nondescript and repetitive, making it easy to get lost at times.
