	"This game is known in the 
	[a class=intlink href=/Glossary 
		"TAS
	]a
	" world as being a pain to play due to the RNG (random number generator) being much harder to manipulate than most other games. As a result, seemingly random actions throughout the game are actually intentional manipulation of the RNG to ensure favourable outcomes, such as avoiding monsters or good battle outcomes.

	" is about 24 minutes longer than this one. Even before that, any run that was under 3 hours long was deemed to be very difficult to perform.
