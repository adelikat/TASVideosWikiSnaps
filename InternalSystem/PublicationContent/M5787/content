	[em 
		"Gift
	]em
	" is a puzzle-platformer that was released for the Game Boy Color and the PlayStation. As with most handheld console ports, the Game Boy Color version is different in that it is a top-down platformer instead of a 3D platformer. The story is meant to be a parody of games such as 
	[em 
		"Mario
	]em
	" or 
	[em 
		"The Legend of Zelda
	]em
	", where a simple bartender and yet unlikely hero is sent out to on a dangerous mission by a mysterious organization to rescue a princess, who is "waiting for her Prince Charming" while in a deep sleep.
