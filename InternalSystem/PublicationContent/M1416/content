	"Super Gussun Oyoyo is a puzzle game best described as a mixture of Lemmings and Tetris.  Two treasure hunters named Gussun and Oyoyo are exploring a dungeon when an earthquake occurs, causing the dungeon to begin sinking.  The player controls blocks akin to Tetris pieces, leading Gussun to the dungeon exit before it submerges completely.
