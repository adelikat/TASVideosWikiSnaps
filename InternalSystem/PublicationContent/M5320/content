	" is an arcade-style shoot 'em up for the Commodore 64 that was published in the May 1985 issue of the 
	[em 
		"Compute's! Gazette
	]em
	". The premise of this game involves a hapless farmer on another planet who unfortunately has an alien invasion encroaching on his farm. With some quick tinkering, he equips a robot with a laser gun to shoot down the aliens and avoid whatever they can throw at him. All the farmer needs is one shot at the alien mothership and the aliens go away.
