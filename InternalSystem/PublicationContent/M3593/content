		"Jail Break

	[em 
		"Escape from New York
	]em
	", wherein Manhattan has become an island prison from which the hero must rescue the President of the United States, who is being held hostage.  In 
	[em 
		"Jail Break
	]em
	", the game's hero, Aki, must fight through 5 stages to rescue the warden of a prison following a mass escape.

Climbing sheer walls, moonwalk shooting, killing aligned groups of enemies with a single bullet - no hostage shall be afraid anymore!
