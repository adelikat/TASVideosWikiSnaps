[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Tom and Jerry: Frantic Antics!
	]em
	" is a licensed video game that is loosely based on the animated film 
	[em 
		"Tom and Jerry: The Movie
	]em
	". It plays out the general events of the movie, but with no talking or singing from any of the characters, including from Tom and Jerry themselves. It is instead a platformer that turns the events into more video-game appropriate set pieces.
