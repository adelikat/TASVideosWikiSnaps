[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Spot: The Video Game
	]em
	" is a licensed variant of Reversi starring 7UP's mascot at the time, Spot. The objective of the game is to either take control of the entire board with your own discs or capture all of your opponent's discs, leaving none for your opponent to play with. Spot would later star in other video games such as 
	[em 
		"Cool Spot
	]em
	" and 
	[em 
		"Spot Goes to Hollywood
	]em
	".
