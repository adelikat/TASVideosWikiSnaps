	"In this game, Johnny and Tom can use several different types of weapons, such as the elements of ice, fire, and thunder.  They can collect a limited number of super attacks, denoted by the letter "B" under their health bars, to hurt everything on the screen and damage bosses heavily.  Also, health does not refill between levels.
