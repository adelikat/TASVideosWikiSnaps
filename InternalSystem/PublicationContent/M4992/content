	" is an arcade racing game that was originally released 1988. It later received ports to the NES and the Sharp X68000 in 1990. In the game, you race against multiple vehicles across cities, deserts, and ocean highways to the finish line. Unlike most racing games, you have a limited fuel supply. Crash at any moment and you lose a substantial amount of fuel. Run out of fuel and you lose the game.
