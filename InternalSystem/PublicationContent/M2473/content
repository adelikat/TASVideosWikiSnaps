	"Prepare to be blown away watching large complex levels completed in under 20 seconds on average. Enjoy seeing extremely tight movement with enemies all around without getting hit, or getting hit yet somehow managing to complete the level anyway. Be dazzled as a dozen teleporters are all simultaneously manipulated to keep enemies away from our hero. Be sure not to fall off your seat when you see Jetman passing through spikes unharmed or completing levels with just the right amount of fuel, and narrowly avoiding certain doom from becoming trapped in reappearing walls.
