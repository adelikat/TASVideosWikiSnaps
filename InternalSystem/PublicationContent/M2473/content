		"Jetpack

	" is a platformer game (
	[a class=extlink href=http://www.adeptsoftware.com/jetpack/ rel=nofollow 
		"now freeware
	]a
	"), featuring a man equipped with a jetpack which he uses for flying (if it has fuel, otherwise he can jump) and a phase shifter for temporarily getting rid of troublesome bricks. His goal is to collect all the green gems in 100 devilish stages and avoid hordes of enemies.

	"Prepare to be blown away watching large complex levels completed in under 20 seconds on average. Enjoy seeing extremely tight movement with enemies all around without getting hit, or getting hit yet somehow managing to complete the level anyway. Be dazzled as a dozen teleporters are all simultaneously manipulated to keep enemies away from our hero. Be sure not to fall off your seat when you see Jetman passing through spikes unharmed or completing levels with just the right amount of fuel, and narrowly avoiding certain doom from becoming trapped in reappearing walls.

	"Since the action is so fast paced, there's an alternate YouTube encode at 43% speed, and alternate download encodes at 50% and 75% speeds. It is recommended to watch this run at a slower speed to fully appreciate the timing and many of the tricks performed.
