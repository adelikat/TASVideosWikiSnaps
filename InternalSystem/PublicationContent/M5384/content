[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Rayman 3
	]em
	" is the 3rd game of the 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Rayman series|href=/GameGroups/51)
	".  It was originally developed to be the GBA version of 
	[em 
		"Rayman 2
	]em
	", which is why the plot mostly centers around 
	[em 
		"Rayman 2
	]em
	"'s plot.  Globox swallows a Dark Lum, so Rayman goes out to find a cure.  However, Admiral Razorbeard attempts to get the Dark Lum out of Globox to make himself more powerful.  Rayman must get a cure for Globox while also stopping Admiral Razorbeard's plans.
