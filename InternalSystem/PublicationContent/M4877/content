[div class=p 
	[em 
		"SimAnt
	]em
	" is a simulation game where you control and cultivate a colony of ants and pit them against another ant colony. However, as these ants are in the backyard of a suburban home, they must also defend themselves against the humans that might kill them, deliberately or not. Exclusive to the SNES version is "Scenario Mode", where you are given various scenarios with which to defeat the enemy ant colony in, each with their own hazards.
