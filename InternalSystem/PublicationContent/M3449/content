	"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the sequel to the Sorcerer's Stone for the Game Boy Color released on November 5, 2002. This game is similar in gameplay to the original game with it's turn-based RPG combat system, but now allows use of Harry Potter's two best friends Ron and Hermione in his party in order to help fight creatures. This is the last game that was made for the Game Boy Color.
