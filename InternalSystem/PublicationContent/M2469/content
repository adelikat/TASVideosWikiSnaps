	"Like its predecessor, 
	[em 
		"Phantasy Star II
	]em
	" is a party-based Japanese RPG with randomly appearing enemies and turn-based combat. Eight characters can join the quest and can be swapped in and out at will to participate in a combat party of four. Characters can dual-wield and equip a wide variety of weapons, including firearms. Various techniques which require "TP" (technique points, equivalent to magic points in comparable games) are learned by different characters at specific levels. Unlike the first game, 
	[em 
		"Phantasy Star II
	]em
	" utilizes the same top-down view for both navigation and dungeon exploration; the now-2D dungeons are notable for their complexity.
