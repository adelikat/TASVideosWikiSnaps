		"Double Dragon 2
	]em
	" is a beat'em-up game starring Billy (or Bimmy, depending on the game version) and Jimmy Lee in a quest to get revenge on a gang for killing Billy's girlfriend. Their journey starts on city streets, but it eventually goes to a variety of places like a helicopter, a dark forest, a haunted mansion, and a final fight bordering on the supernatural. You must play the hardest difficulty, Supreme Master, in order to reach the true final boss.
