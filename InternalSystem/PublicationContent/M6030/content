[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Mouse Trap
	]em
	" is an arcade game that was developed by Exidy and later ported to the Atari 2600, ColecoVision, and Intellivision. It is considered to be a 
	[em 
		"Pac-Man
	]em
	" clone of sorts, where you play as a mouse whose goal is to eat all the cheese pellets in a maze without getting caught by cats. Bones can be collected that turns the mouse into a dog, which can eat the cats. What makes this game different from 
	[em 
		"Pac-Man
	]em
	", however, is the inclusion of doors that can be switched around by using their respective colored buttons. These doors can block the cats if needed. There is also a hawk that can spawn and fly around and can eat the cat or dog if touched.
