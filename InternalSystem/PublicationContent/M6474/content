[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Intellivision for NES
	]em
	" is a homebrew collection of NES games that were originally for the Intellivision. It was developed by Carl Mueller Jr. to demonstrate that Intellivision games can be ported to the NES with minimal changes to the original code. One of these ported games is 
	[em 
		(__wikiLink|displaytext=Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Cloudy Mountain|href=/1892G)
	]em
	", renamed here as 
	[em 
		"Adventure
	]em
	" for licensing reasons. It differs from the original by having all the tools available at the start, making it easier.
