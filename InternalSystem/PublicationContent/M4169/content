	"The goal of 
	[em 
		"Delta Warp
	]em
	" is to gather all the 'Delta Power units' in each stage as quickly as possible. To do this, you must navigate your 'Delta' around the stage, changing its colour between white and black to match the colour of the Delta Power unit. Moving across the stage with the joystick will cause the Delta's colour to alternate with each space. However, pressing A or B will rotate the player-unit around the diamond patterns that make up the stage without the colour changing. The complexity of the levels gradually increases with the introduction of new mechanics such as multi-floor stages and special tiles that change the properties of the Delta.
