	" is an escape room-styled Flash puzzle game by Factory.112 and the third game in the 
	[em 
		"Home Sweet Home
	]em
	" series. You've just escaped your father's home theater room, but you are still insistent in going back in there and watching a movie. You decide to take a bathroom break only to find the bathroom door padlocked and a note on it. It seems your family has been messing with you and is daring you to find the key to the padlock. You could just ignore their games and use the neighbor's bathroom instead, but you play along anyway for the sake of the plot.
