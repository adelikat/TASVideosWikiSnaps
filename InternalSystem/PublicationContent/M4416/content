		"Alien 3
	]em
	" for the SNES is a game loosely based on the movie of the same name. The game consists of six stages, and in each, you are given a series of missions to complete that include rescuing prisoners; repairing pipes, fuses, and junction boxes; welding doors shut; and destroying alien eggs, as well as the mother alien. Once you have accomplished all missions in a stage, you move on to the next stage where you will receive new mission objectives. Missions are outlined via a terminal, and a series of blueprints help you navigate your way through the complex.
