[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Bagdad
	]em
	" (sic) is an arcade-style game for the Commodore 64 that was published in the November 1984 issue of the 
	[em 
		"Compute's! Gazette
	]em
	". In this game, you are a guy on a flying magic carpet roaming Baghdad until genies suddenly start attacking you out of nowhere. You must now get rid of these genies by trapping them in bottles and collecting them. Fail to collect a bottle in time and a genie breaks free, forcing you to trap them again.
