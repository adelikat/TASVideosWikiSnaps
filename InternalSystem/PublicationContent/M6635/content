	" is an arcade-style Genesis game in which a flightless blue bird named Flicky must rescue her Chirps and bring them safely to the exit. In doing so, she must travel through a series of houses, some being in Egypt, others in space. She must also avoid the tigers led by Tiger and the chameleons led by Iggy, who just happen to be in the houses too. Luckily, there are miscellaneous items on the ground Flicky can throw to really send them rolling!
