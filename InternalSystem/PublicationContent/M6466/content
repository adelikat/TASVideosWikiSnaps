Your mission is to go out into a war-torn desert village and rescue your fellow balls from their imprisonment by the enemy. The main gameplay mechanic is that Ballz is unable to stop moving and can only change directions by hitting a wall. As you progress, Ballz's scientist creator will wirelessly give him genetic enhancements that can help you beat certain levels.
