		"Top Gun

	" is a game based on the movie of the same name. The NES version was developed by Konami in 1987, and they decided to make it a flight simulator from the view of the main character Maverick's airplane cockpit. There are four missions, and each has two parts: a flying mission where enemy planes, an enemy base, and finally a space shuttle must be shot down and a landing mission where the plane must be precisely landed on an aircraft carrier.

	"While it is very difficult in real-time play to land the plane successfully because of the precise speed and angle necessary, TrenchAce makes it look easy in this run. Have a watch if you've never made it to Level 2.
