	" is a beat 'em up platformer that's an adaptation of the action family '90s movie of the same name. What makes this game special from many others like it at the time is that it was made with unusually close collaboration with the production of the original movie; the movie uses the Sega Game Gear with a version of the game as a magical plot device. Despite that, the game itself doesn't share much in common with the movie; for one, there's no surfing and Adam, the one who uses the Game Gear in the movie, is absent.
