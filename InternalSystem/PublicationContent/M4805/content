	" is a platforming game for the Commodore 64 that was originally published in source code form in the Compute!'s Gazette. The princess has been held captive by a disembodied dragon head, and it's up to you to rescue her while traversing conveyor belts and avoiding flying eraserheads and giant bells. Along the way, you get keys to unlock doors to the princess and collect cherries and flowers for extra points.
