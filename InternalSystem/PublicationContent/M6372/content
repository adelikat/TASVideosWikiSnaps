	[em 
		"Arkanoid
	]em
	", a brick-breaking arcade game in the vein of 
	[em 
		"Breakout
	]em
	". Like its predecessor, it has received ports to many home systems, but it never saw a port for NES consoles outside of Japan. New additions to this iteration include more powerups, such as laser cannons, and the ability to choose which level you want to go to next after beating one through the use of warp gates.

	[em 
		"Arkanoid II
	]em
	" as fast as possible without using any warps that allow you to skip stages. A brute force script was utilized to optimize each stage as much as possible and choose which warp gate at the end of each level to go through based on which stage is faster to complete.
