	" is an arcade puzzle video game developed by Atari. It is essentially a Tic-Tac-Toe game with tiles, where the player must match up similar colored tiles either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Each wave requires the player to make a certain amount of "Klaxes" to proceed to the next wave, and sometime specify if it needs only horizontal, vertical, or diagonal ones.
