		"Home Sweet Home
	]em
	". Having just escaped your bedroom, you just remembered that your father has remodeled one of the rooms in the family house with a home theater setup. With the house all to yourself, you decide to chill and watch a movie in that room. However, as soon as you enter, the door suddenly closes, locks itself shut, and reveals itself to not have a doorknob. Time to do the same thing you just did in your bedroom again.
