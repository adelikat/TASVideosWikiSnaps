	"In this final instalment of the famous Phantasy Star saga, our protagonist, while out on a routine assignment, uncovers evidence pointing to a sinister threat to the entire solar system; one thing leads to another and he and the rest of his party eventually find themselves fighting the root of all evil.  Such a quest would normally take at least ten hours, but with copious amounts of luck manipulation, it can be reduced to just over an hour and a half.
