	" uses Eri through all 7 missions without dying. Eri is chosen because of her ability to aim grenades in 8 different directions and receive twice the number of grenades from the bomb/grenade item. The extra grenades become useful throughout the run and make her a lot faster than the other characters, especially in the final mission. Despite not dying at all, this run still manages to beat the previous run in this category by
