[div class=p 
	[em 
		"PICOHOT
	]em
	" is an official demake of the game 
	[em 
		"SUPERHOT
	]em
	" and was made by some of the same developers. As with 
	[em 
		"SUPERHOT
	]em
	", the gimmick of the game is that time only moves as fast as you do; time runs normally when you run at full speed and comes to a complete stop when you do nothing. With this power, your goal is to defeat all the enemies in your path with whatever you can find and use, whether it be shooting them with a gun, throwing bottles at them, or just punching them to death.
