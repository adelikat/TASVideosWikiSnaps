[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Little Lancelot
	]em
	" is a 2018 NTSC conversion of the licensed action platformer known as 
	[em 
		"The Legend of Prince Valiant
	]em
	", which is based on the animated TV show of the same name. As the company that did the conversion did not hold the video game license to the cartoon, the names and graphics were changed to be more like the mythology that the cartoon was based on. You play as Little Lancelot (Price Valiant in the original game), who wants to prove himself and achieve knighthood by finding the Viking Ring of Peace and bringing it to King Arthur. With only a crossbow, Lancelot must venture through hazardous marshes, treacherous forests, and dank caves to fulfill his mission.
