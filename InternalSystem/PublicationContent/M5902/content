		"The Terminator
	]em
	" is a licensed action-platforming game that is based on the movie of the same name. It loosely follows the plot of the movie, where you follow Kyle Reese in his time-traveling mission to stop the T-800 from assassinating Sarah Connor, the woman who will give birth to the leader of the resistance against Skynet, John Connor. What makes it very different from the original movie is that you play as Kyle throughout the entire game, even during the final factory level, with Sarah herself only being shown in cutscenes.
