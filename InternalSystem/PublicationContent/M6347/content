[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Arkanoid: Doh It Again
	]em
	" is the third game in the 
	[em 
		"Arkanoid
	]em
	" series of 
	[em 
		"Breakout
	]em
	"-like games and the sequel to 
	[em 
		"Arkanoid: Revenge of Doh
	]em
	". Unlike the previous two games, this one wasn't released for the arcades and only saw releases on the SNES and Windows PCs. 
	[em 
		"Doh It Again
	]em
	" expands on the game of the original 
	[em 
		"Arkanoid
	]em
	" with more types of breakable objects and powerups and more bosses to fight other than Doh. These new powerups include having the ball break through bricks without bouncing and a force field that can catch a missed ball for one hit. There are also hazards that can destroy your ball if the ball hits them during their attacking phase.
