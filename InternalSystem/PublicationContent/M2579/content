	". Your task is to destroy the Death Star before its construction is finished. You start the task outside the shield perimeter of the Death Star, where you have to combat different imperial vessels and avoid the death ray while waiting for an opportunity to slip through one of the random openings in the energy shield. After reaching the Death Star, you must reduce its structure up to the point where you can hit the core. In the following destruction of the station, you must avoid collision with the Death Star's debris.
