	[em 
		"Dragon View
	]em
	", is a side-scrolling role-playing video game released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in November 1994. Released in Japan as 
	[em 
		"Super Drakkhen
	]em
	" and otherwise known as 
	[em 
		"Drakkhen II
	]em
	", it is meant to be a prequel to 
	[em 
		"Drakkhen
	]em
	" although it bears little resemblance to its predecessor. It uses the same pseudo-3D overworld system for which the series is most famous. Other features of Dragon View are its side-view action role-playing game (RPG) hybrid gameplay (used when exploring more detailed areas such as towns and dungeons), its well translated first person storyline, and its emphasis on player-driven undirected exploration.
