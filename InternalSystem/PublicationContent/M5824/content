	[em 
		"Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee
	]em
	" is a puzzle platformer for the PlayStation with a distinct pre-rendered '90s CGI art style. It focuses on Abe, a Mudokon that works for RuptureFarms, as he eavesdrops on the Glukkon executives planning to turn him and his kind working in the factories into food to make up for their dwindling livestock. Horrified by this news, Abe decides to escape the slaughterhouses, save the native wildlife RuptureFarms has been exploiting, and liberate the rest of the Mudokons from the tyranny of the Glukkons.
