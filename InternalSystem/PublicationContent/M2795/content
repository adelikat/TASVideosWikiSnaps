		"Metal Force
	]em
	" is an unlicensed game developed by Open Corp. (who also made 
	[em 
		(__wikiLink|displaytext=Buzz and Waldog|href=/2064M)
	]em
	") and released in 1994 in South Korea. It is of surprisingly solid quality for an unlicensed title. It controls similarly to classic 
	[em 
		"Mega Man
	]em
	" games, except you have two different weapons which you can switch between and upgrade by collecting power-ups from enemies. Aside from that, it is a linear adventure comprised of 7 missions, with a boss battle at the end of each. The stages of each mission are quite expansive and packed with enemies and obstacles.
