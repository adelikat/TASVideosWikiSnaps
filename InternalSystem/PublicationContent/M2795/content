	]em
	") and released in 1994 in South Korea. It is of surprisingly solid quality for an unlicensed title. It controls similarly to classic Mega Man games, except you have two different weapons which you can switch between and upgrade by collecting powerups from enemies. Aside from that, it is a linear adventure comprised of 7 missions, with a boss battle at the end of each. The stages of each mission are quite expansive and packed with enemies and obstacles.
