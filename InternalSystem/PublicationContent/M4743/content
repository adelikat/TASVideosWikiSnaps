	[em 
		"Mega Man X
	]em
	" series, a spinoff of the 
	[em 
		"Mega Man
	]em
	" series. Throughout the series, Zero continues to tell X that one day, X will be just as strong as him. However, X wants to show that he doesn't need the strength of Zero to defeat the Repliforce. In fact, he goes as far as to not collect any items on his quest to defeat the army, just to flex on Zero.
