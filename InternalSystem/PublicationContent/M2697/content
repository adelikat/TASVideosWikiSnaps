	"There are eleven stages in total, and you can play as any of the main Secret Ninja Team Nyankii members. They include Yattaro, leader of the team, who uses his Cat's Eye Sword as his main weapon; Pururun, the only female on the team, who attacks with projectiles and her razor-sharp nails; and Sukashii, who uses an umbrella to dispatch his enemies. In this run, you'll see a lot of use of the cat who can fly to create shortcuts, but the other cats are used from time to time for their special abilities.

	"In this game, there's an important bug in which Yattaro can perform a Level-3 ninpo attack on the very first frame of a boss fight and kill the boss immediately. This works for every level except the second.
