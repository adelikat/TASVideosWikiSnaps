[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Nonsense
	]em
	" is an extensive ROM hack of 
	[em 
		"Super Mario World
	]em
	" featuring levels made by various romhackers from the SMW romhacking community. These levels are difficulty-focused, but unlike many other similar SMW romhacks, this one tries to avoid the characteristics that found in many "Kaizo" romhacks. The difficulty is meant to be more fair with less cheap hazards, and there are little to no puzzles to solve. The ROM hack also features wildly varying level designs, styles, and music with no discernable theme, hence the name 
	[em 
		"Nonsense
	]em
	".
