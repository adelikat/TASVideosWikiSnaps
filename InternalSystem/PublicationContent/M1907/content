		"Space Quest IV: Roger Wilco and the Time Rippers
	]em
	" is the fourth installment of the Space Quest adventure series, and the first Space Quest game with point-and-click gameplay, as compared to its text-based predecessors. In this game, Roger Wilco is thrown into the future at Space Quest XII, and must stop Vohaul, whose consciousness lives inside another person. To do so, he must time-travel within the future (Space Quest X and XII) and to the past (Space Quest I) to gain information needed to achieve this goal.
