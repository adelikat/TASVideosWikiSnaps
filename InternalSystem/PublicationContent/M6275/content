	", also known in Japan as 
	[em 
		"Super Chinese
	]em
	". Being one of the first action RPGs, this game combines the standard early video game RPG mechanics with battles that have you fighting your enemies in real-time instead of through turn-based combat. With certain battles, however, the combat is instead turn-based, but still uses stats that are gained from leveling up during regular real-time battles. As for the story, Jack and/or Ryu have decided to save their country called Chinaland from the invading Blu Boltar, who has kidnapped the emperor.
