	[em 
		"Snood
	]em
	" is a puzzle game that was first developed for Mac OS in 1996 and was later ported to other platforms such as Microsoft Windows, the Game Boy Advance, and iOS. It is very similar to 
	[em 
		"Puzzle Bobble
	]em
	", where the objective is to clear a board full of different-colored orbs by shooting at them with more orbs. If three orbs of the same color are connected by the shot, they are cleared from the board. Power-ups cab be collected and chain matches can be done to clear the board even faster.
