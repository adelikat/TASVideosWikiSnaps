The daimyō lords of each castle are each given an evil sphere of power, and they use this power to summon armies of ninja and monsters to terrorize the nearby villages. Shōgun Tokugawa Ietsuna sends out samurai apprentice Takamaru to investigate the castles, defeat each castle lord along the way, and stop the aliens.
