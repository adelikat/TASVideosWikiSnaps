	"In 
	[em 
		"VVVVVV
	]em
	", the player controls Captain Viridian, who is lost in an alternate dimension, in search of the missing members of the spaceship's crew. Instead of jumping, the player is able to control the direction of gravity, allowing the captain to flip between the floors and ceilings of the environment. The graphical style of the game is heavily influenced by the Commodore 64.
