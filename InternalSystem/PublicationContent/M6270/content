		"Boktai: The Sun Is in Your Hand
	]em

Much like its predecessor, the GBA cartridge features a physical solar sensor to detect ultraviolet radiation with the idea that you would use the power of the sun to help you play through the game, with none of the game's mechanics being tuned for having access to max sunlight. For this run, the UV inputs are done internally in mGBA.
