	" is a homebrew platformer for the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS that took part of a NEO Flash homebrew competition. In this game, you play as a cat that's just strolling across the city, collecting stars and avoiding enemies like huge birds and bouncing balls with eyes. At the end, you fight a giant rat that attacks you with blocks of cheese.
