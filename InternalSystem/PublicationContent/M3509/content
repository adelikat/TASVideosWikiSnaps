	[em 
		"Jungle Hunt
	]em
	" is an arcade game produced and released by Taito in 1982.  The original version of the game, 
	[em 
		"Jungle King
	]em
	",  was the subject of a lawsuit levied against Taito by the estate of Edgar Rice Burroughs for copyright infringement for using a likeness of the Tarzan character.  
	[em 
		"Jungle King
	]em
	" featured a long-haired feral man in a fur loincloth swinging from vine to vine in the jungle, and most damning of all, an unauthorized reproduction of actor Johnny Weissmuller's famous Tarzan yell.  As a result, the hero of the game was replaced with a stereotypical Victorian era "gentleman explorer", the vines were changed to ropes, and the Tarzan yell was replaced with a short tune.  On a technical note, 
	[em 
		"Jungle Hunt
	]em
	" is one of the first games to feature parallax scrolling.  And the music has a rousing jungle beat!  
	[em 
		"Jungle Hunt
	]em
	" was later adapted for the various home gaming platforms of the day, including the Commodore 64 (of which we have
