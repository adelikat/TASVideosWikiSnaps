[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Red Remover
	]em
	" is a Flash puzzle game that was developed by Gaz Thomas. The objective of the game is to remove all the red objects on the screen, either by clicking on them to disappear or getting them off the screen. To make the levels more challenging, there are also green objects that have to stay on the screen. And to make them more interesting, some objects in some levels are affected by gravity differently, meaning that they either fall up or to the left or right instead of falling down.

	" completes all 40 main levels in record time, minimizing the time it takes for the game to determine if a level is completed or not whenever possible. The bonus levels were not done as they were not considered necessary for beating the game.
