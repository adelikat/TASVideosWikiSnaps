Radiation and strange viruses have combined to physically transform the human population into vile, disgusting mutants. However, a scientist named Dr. Kildare, who aims to reclaim mankind's lost genetic heritage, returns six people to normal to fight for humanity as the Ex-Mutants. Your job, as one of the Ex-Mutants, is to rescue the other Ex-Mutants and find power cells for Dr. Kildare.
