		"POWA!

	" is a homebrew platforming game for the Game Boy Color. It is a throwback to the cutesy platformers made for the console such as 
	[em 
		"Kirby's Dream Land
	]em
	" and 
	[em 
		"Trip World
	]em
	", and its level design and difficulty harkens back to those times as well. You play as Powa!, who has traveled far from their village in search for medicinal herbs. After getting the herbs, Powa! must now travel back to their village, going through various obstacles and dangerous places in the process.
