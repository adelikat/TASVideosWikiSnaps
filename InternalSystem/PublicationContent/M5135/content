	" is a chess video game that uses the name of the United States Chess Federation for branding purposes. It comes with both a one player mode and two player mode. In one player mode, you play against the AI with the difficulty of your choice. The higher the difficulty, the longer it takes for the AI to come up with a move to play against you, with some moves even taking hours to happen.

The moves taken by Winslinator are chosen so that the AI won't spend too long calculating its next move. They are not meant to be the most optimal moves used in an actual chess game.
