		"The Lost World: Jurassic Park
	]em
	" is a licensed action platforming game that is based on the movie of the same name. It very loosely follows the plot of the movie, where various companies have sent hunters to Isla Sorna to capture dinosaurs for their own purposes. You control a nameless hunter whose objective is to prevent these hunters from capturing the dinosaurs and smuggling them off the island. As with a lot of licensed games at the time, the game features other minigames to add variety such as an driving minigame where you avoid hazards and reach the end of the level.
