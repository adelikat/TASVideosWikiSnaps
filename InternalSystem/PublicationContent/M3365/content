	"This movie takes advantage of several small tricks and glitches to achieve the best ending, Ending S, in roughly 12 and a half minutes. Among them are an inventory glitch, which allows skipping through dialogue, and a select glitch that allows Jennifer to run through the psychopath by clicking an object on the screen.
