	" In this first-person dungeon crawling game, you play as a wizard named Rooks, who is the last of the Card Masters, an order of wizards who use special cards that have tremendous magical power in them. An evil magician by the name of Galneon threatens the world by threatening to release the evil goddess Rimsalia and has killed all those who opposed him, including most of the Card Masters. Rooks must now go on a quest to stop Galneon and Rimsalia before they destroy the world.

	" utilizes large amounts of RNG manipulation for this run to complete the game as fast as possible. Unlike most other games, the battle RNG is most often not determined by what was inputted by a controller during a frame, but by the actions taken in previous frames. This kind of RNG along with the traditional input-based RNG made for a difficult RPG to TAS.
