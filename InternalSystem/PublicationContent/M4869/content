[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Wonder Boy
	]em
	" is an arcade game developed by Sega that serves as a sort of precursor to the 
	[em 
		"Adventure Island
	]em
	" series. You play as a tribal jungle boy known as Wonder Boy, who must rescue his girlfriend Tina from a dark king with his trusty hatchet and skateboard. It has received ports to the Sega SG-1000 and Master System, the former essentially receiving a remade game due to system limitations and lacking items such as the skateboard.
