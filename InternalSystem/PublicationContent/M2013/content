	[em 
		"Commander Keen 6
	]em
	" is also the third 
	[em 
		"Keen
	]em
	" game to get absolutely destroyed at TASVideos.  Watch as Keen goes over, around, or through everything in his way to beat the entire game in a bit over three minutes.  Reading the author's comments is recommended, and probably mandatory if you want to know what happened.
