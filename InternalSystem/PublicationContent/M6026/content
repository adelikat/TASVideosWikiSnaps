	" is a short platforming game for the TIC-80, a fantasy video game console similar to the PICO-8, that was developed for Weekly Game Jam #56. You control two characters, with the directional buttons controlling both characters simultaneously — albeit with one character's movement mirroring the other's — and each one having their own jump button. The goal of each level is to reach the exit without dying. The exit itself can be blocked off either with locked doors that require keys or barriers that can only be removed through switches.
