[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Pepper II
	]em
	" is an maze arcade game that later saw a port to the ColecoVision. Despite the name, the game has no predecessor. In each level, your objective is to color in all the rectangles in the maze by drawing lines around them. If you backtrack, the lines are recolored back to normal. In the process, you must avoid demons that are out to get you.
