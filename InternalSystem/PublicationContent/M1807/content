		"Metal Slug 2
	]em
	", the second installment of an immensely popular run'n'gun series released on the Neo Geo MVS. The games are notable for incredibly detailed pixel graphics, fluid animation, and good humor; but the real key to their longevity is, of course, their high difficulty as far as survival goes.
