		"Fort Apocalypse
	]em
	" is a game developed by Synapse Software and released for the C64 in 1982. The war with the Kralthans is on, and they've taken prisoners. These people must be rescued from the Draconis caves and the Crystaline caves that are located just outside the titular Kralthan main command center. The Fort is too powerful to attack directly, but perhaps a single rocket copter, carefully controlled, might be able to do what an army cannot. However the caves are narrow and the enemy has still setup impact shields, defenses and Hyper-Chambers within their depths.
