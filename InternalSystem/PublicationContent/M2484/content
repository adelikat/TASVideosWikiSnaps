[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Eryi's Action
	]em
	" is a sidescrolling platformer where Eryi must charge through a series of devious traps and enemies in order to stop Farta and recover her melon. There are so many of these traps, in fact, that the developers designated the game a "trapformer". In many cases, the most obvious path through an area does not work, and only clever thinking or trial-and-error will allow Eryi to proceed safely.

		"Super Mario Bros.

	": enemies are defeated by being jumped upon, a flagpole must be reached at the end of each stage, and there are even mushrooms (which can be used as trampolines).
