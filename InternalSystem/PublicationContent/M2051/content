	" chronicles the adventure of a crocodile (creatively named Croc) who runs and jumps through four worlds in order to save his Gobbo friends. However, thanks to a glitch in the physics engine, Croc adds another trick to his repertoire: the ability to float. In this run, the player makes heavy use of the floating glitch and various other tricks to rescue all the Gobbos, collect all the jigsaw pieces, and complete the secret fifth world.
