[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Difficult? Punch-Out!!
	]em
	" is a difficulty-oriented ROM hack of 
	[em 
		"Punch-Out!!
	]em
	" that was partially inspired by the Title Defense mode from the Wii version of 
	[em 
		"Punch-Out!!
	]em
	". In this romhack, all the attacking patterns from every opponent are changed up and any punch, with the exception of those from Super Macho Man and Mike Tyson, can knock you down. Yes, even Glass Joe can knock you down with one punch. Little Mac also does less damage this time around, making for even longer matches.
