	" ROM hack designed by Cheezepin and PyrolluxJay for the Chaos Mario Team Competition in 2025. This hack is unique, in that it is instead a tower defense game in which you have to defeat a team of Marios out to get the star at the end of the various stages. It features a main campaign as well as endless and Gauntlet modes, the latter two being infinite games.
