	[em 
		"Action 52
	]em
	". According to the manual of the game, you are Alfredo, apparently some sort of wrangler of giant living, walking pasta. Your supposed objective is to get all the various shapes of pasta back to the pot before time runs out. In actuality, the pasta is hostile and wants to kill you, and your objective is to get to the end of each level without dying.
