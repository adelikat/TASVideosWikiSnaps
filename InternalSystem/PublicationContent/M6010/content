The game stars '90s Japanese comedian and impressionist Kunihiro Matsumura as he travels Japan as a karateka to cement himself as the strongest ever in history by fighting various criminals and martial artists, who are portrayed by other Japanese comedians. Unusually for a fighting game, it is quite dialogue heavy so it can represent each comedian's forte and niche.
