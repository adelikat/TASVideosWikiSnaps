		""The point of the game is get all Freddy's bones on every stage then kill the boss while trying to avoid getting sleep, otherwise you will have to go through dream world where there are stronger enemies but you can use the dream warriors. I only do that once in the run and only because it is imperative to go on, you have to wait about a minute to get sleep so I had to stand still for a minute doing nothing so the sleepy counter was as fast as possible."
