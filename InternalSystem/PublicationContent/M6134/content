	" is an FMV game that was animated by Don Bluth and his studio. It was initially released on LaserDisc-based arcade machines and was revolutionary for featuring fully animated cutscenes as part of a video game. In the years to follow, there would be various attempts at porting the game to various video game consoles. Many of them became standard platformers like the NES and SNES version. Some retained the core gameplay and design like the Sega CD and Game Boy Color versions. The Game Boy Color version is unique in that the cutscenes from the original arcade game were faithfully reanimated to fit the console's limitations. Not all cutscenes were included, however.
