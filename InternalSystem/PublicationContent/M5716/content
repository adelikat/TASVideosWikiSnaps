	" is a single-level homebrew platformer for the Game Boy that was originally made as a PICO-8 game. It was the author's first attempt at creating a game for the Game Boy with the 6502 assembly programming language. As the title implies, you navigate through a small ice cream castle so you can reunite with your ice cream cone lover at the top.
