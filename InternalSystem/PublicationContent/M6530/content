	" is a licensed multiplatform game that is based on the film of the same name. The DS version differs from the Wii, PC, and Xbox 360 versions in that it is a side-scrolling platformer instead of a third-person action game and takes far more liberties with the movie. The result is that our hero Larry Daley is even more of an action hero than in the original movie as he can collect special tablets that can grant him superpowers.
