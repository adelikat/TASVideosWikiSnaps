	"You are a knight charged to save the four kingdoms of the world, except normal weapons are ineffective against the monsters. Instead, you must use your sword to strike a glowing orb called the Trialight like a pinball around the screen. The Trialight is used to destroy enemies and obstacles as you make your way through dungeons.
