	[em 
		"Peggle: Dual Shot
	]em
	" is a pachinko-like puzzle game and a port of the original 
	[em 
		"Peggle
	]em
	" to the Nintendo DS. The objective of the game is to shoot a ball down a board of pegs and clear it by hitting 25 orange-colored pegs without running out of balls. To make things quicker and easier, you can use a Peggle Master's ability to clear many more pegs with a single ball by hitting green pegs. Abilities include a ball that pierces through pegs effortlessly, pinball-life flippers that can hit the ball back up, and pegs that clear the other pegs around it when hit.
