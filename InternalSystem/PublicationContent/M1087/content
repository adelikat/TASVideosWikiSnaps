	[em 
		"Batman: Return of the Joker
	]em
	" (1991) is the sequel to the first 
	[em 
		"Batman
	]em
	" game for the NES. Being one of the later NES titles, it shows surprisingly good and fluid visuals, fullsize art, and decent sound â€” all without slowdown issues!

	"The gameplay has undergone some changes compared to its predecessor. A welcome addition to it is a slide movement, similar to the one in the 
	[em 
		"Mega Man
	]em
	" series. A not-so-welcome addition is that half the stages are autoscrolling, and there are no close combat weapons now.
