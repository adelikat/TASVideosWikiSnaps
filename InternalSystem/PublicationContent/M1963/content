		"The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons

	" is a Game Boy Color game that carries over much of the graphics from 
	[em 
		(__wikiLink|displaytext=Link's Awakening|href=/2076M)
	]em
	". Surprisingly, much of the game engine is completely different and developed by Capcom. In it, the Oracle of Seasons, Din, is kidnapped by Onox, General of Darkness. Link must travel throughout both Holdrum and Subrosia to collect the 8 Essences of Nature, power up the Rod of Seasons, and defeat Onox.
