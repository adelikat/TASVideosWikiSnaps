		"Sabrina the Teenage Witch: Potion Commotion
	]em
	" was released for the GBA by Ubisoft in 2002. It is based on 
	[a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_the_Teenage_Witch_(TV_series) rel=noopener external nofollow 
		"the sitcom
	]a
	", which is itself based on the Archie Comics spin-off series of the same name (which began in 1962). In the game's plot, several dramatic things happen with Hilda and Zelda (characters that never show up in gameplay) messing up their spells and making some sort of catastrophe that Sabrina has to fix, each catastrophe defining one of the four worlds. Along the way, Sabrina collects ingredients, which are later mixed up in a potion mini-game at the end of each world, and unlocks spells, which she can use to defeat enemies, grow vines, and so on.
