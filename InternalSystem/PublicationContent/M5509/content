	" is a side-scrolling homebrew game that was created in 2013 for the 23rd anniversary of the Japanese release of the Super Famicom. In this game, you play as a cat that's riding a rocket through various bizarre lands and dimensions. Your goal is to get the end of the level while avoiding all obstacles and enemies. The rocket is constantly moving forward and all the buttons on the controller only move the rocket up.
