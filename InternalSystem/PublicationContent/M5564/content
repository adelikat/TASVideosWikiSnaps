[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Disc Blitz
	]em
	" is a simple shoot 'em up for the Commodore 64 that was published in the January 1989 issue of the 
	[em 
		"Compute's! Gazette
	]em
	". The goal of the game is to shoot down endless waves of flying saucers with your fighter ship as long as you can without getting hit by any of them. As always with games like these, you have a limited number of lives, so care must be taken.
