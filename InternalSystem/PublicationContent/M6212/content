		"Illusion of Gaia

	" is a role-playing game that was developed by Quintet and published by Enix. It has gameplay with one notable quirk in its progression system: characters get stronger not by gaining experience points but by getting special items dropped by enemies that permanently boost their stats. As for the story, it can be described as some sort of combination of alternate history and standard medieval fantasy tropes; magic and monsters thrive while ancient landmarks, both from real life and from mythology, are scattered throughout the world. You play as Will, a young boy and the only survivor of a father and son expedition to the Tower of Babel, which he has no memory of. After a chance meeting with a mysterious being named Gaia and runaway princess named Kara, Will's psychic powers awaken and he learns about a ominous comet that threatens the well-being of the Earth. Together, both Will and Kara will have to venture out and find a way to save the Earth.
