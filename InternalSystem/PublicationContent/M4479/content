	" is an NES demake of the 2016 puzzle game "The Witness".  The game features a various collection of grid puzzles, with each one unlocking a new puzzle or a new area on the map.  Some puzzles will have different symbols that signify different ways a puzzle has to be solved, such as separating colored dots or drawing different shapes with each line.
