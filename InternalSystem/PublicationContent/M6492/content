[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Eagles & Gators
	]em
	" is an arcade-style video game for the Commodore 64 that was published in the September 1986 issue of the 
	[em 
		"Computer's Gazette
	]em
	". It is a two-player game where the objective is for one side to push the barrier separating the two towards the opposing side. This is done by clamping onto the barrier with precise timing. However, the opponent can get you to unclamp with by clamping unto you with similarly precise timing. When one side has more eagles or gators clamped onto the barrier than the other, they start pushing the barrier. The game is over when a side is completely overtaken.
