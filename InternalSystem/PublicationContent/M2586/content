		"Sorcerer's Kingdom
	]em
	" is a turn-based RPG published by Treco in 1992.  In addition to an exceptional soundtrack, the game features a leveling system similar to Final Fantasy 2 (NES), in that your characters gain stats based on the actions they perform in combat.  The plot places you in the role of a young man whose renowned father turns up missing after seeking to rid the Kingdom of an ultimate evil power.  Desiring to follow in his footsteps, the lad seeks an audience with the King to set out as an adventurer, himself.

	"Normally, this game requires ample amounts of grinding up your OFFENSE stat in order to damage bosses.  ars4326's run minimizes this aspect down to its bare requirements, by using heavy luck manipulation and exploiting the game's leveling system.  In doing so, the final boss is slain in just under one hour.  Not bad for a day's work!
