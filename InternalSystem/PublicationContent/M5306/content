		"Super Diagonal Mario 2: The Ultimate Meme Machine
	]em
	" is a ROM hack of 
	[em 
		"Super Mario World
	]em
	" that sets out to do what it says in the subtitle, be the "Ultimate Meme Machine". It is an ambitious joke hack that is filled to the brim with in-jokes, memes, and internet culture references that were popular throughout the 2010s. It also includes music that was popular during that era and some pretty questionable gameplay mechanics. Oh, and Mario is tilted at a 45 degree angle.

	", not wanting to pass up the opportunity, decides to break this romhack apart into even smaller pieces than it was originally produced in. In fact, some of the glitches performed here aren't even possible in the original 
	[em 
		"Super Mario World
	]em
	". However, due to how the romhack is designed, it can be hard to distinguish between what is a glitch and what is a deliberate design choice. But for more eagle-eyed viewers, this may not be a problem.
