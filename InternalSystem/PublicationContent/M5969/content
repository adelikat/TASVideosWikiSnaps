		"Original Memory Game
	]em
	" is the name of the Milton Bradley version of the classic card matching memory game. It was adapted into many formats, including as part of a three pack Game Boy Advance multicart that included 
	[em 
		"Candy Land
	]em
	" and 
	[em 
		"Chutes and Ladders
	]em
	". The game is simple: with a set of cards face down, you flip over cards to find matching pairs.

	" as fast as possible, with some RNG manipulation done to produce a card layout that requires the least amount of cursor movements to solve.
