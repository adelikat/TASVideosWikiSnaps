	" is the first Godzilla video game for the NES. In this game, you play as both Godzilla and Mothra as they travel across planets to beat various other monsters such as Hedorah, Gigan, and King Ghidorah. On each planet are many alien armies that are there to stop you from reaching the monster that controls each planet. To portray this, each planet is shown as a virtual gameboard with Godzilla and Mothra on one end and the enemy monster on the other. Each space is either empty, has an alien army, or has an enemy monster. You level up by destroying anything that gets in your way, and you progress to the next planet by defeating an enemy monster in one-on-one combat.
