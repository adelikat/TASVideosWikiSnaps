		"The Pact
	]em
	" is a short homebrew puzzle-platformer for the Game Boy Color. The simple premise has sworn enemies Bop Bop the Rabbit and Wile F. the Dragon being forced to work together to escape Cayate the Ogre's castle after he traps them there. Each character has their own unique quirk: Bop Bop is the only one that can end the level by reaching the exit, and Wile F. can walk on spikes. Both characters have the ability to turn into statues that freeze in place while they take turns moving. This can be used to get around various obstacles in each room.
