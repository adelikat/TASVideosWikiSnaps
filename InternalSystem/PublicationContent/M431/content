	"Kick Master is a game which might seem a bit slow-paced at first. However, as the character gains levels, he acquires special moves which add greatly to his speed and versatility and thus to the movie's entertainment value. The author collects maximum experience points from the enemies in the beginning in order to get a fast sliding move earlier which speeds up the game immensely. This results in some pretty fast action.

	"Note: The more difficult quest mentioned after the credits only seems to double all the enemies' hit points.
