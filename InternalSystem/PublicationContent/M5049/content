	[em 
		"Super Mario Bros. 2
	]em
	" is the infamous sequel to 
	[em 
		"Super Mario Bros.
	]em
	" that was released only in Japan for the Famicom Disk System. Considered too difficult and too similar to the original game, it was skipped over for localization in favor of making 
	[em 
		"Doki Doki Panic
	]em
	" into the actual 
	[em 
		"Super Mario Bros. 2
	]em
	" for the NES. This game would later be remade in 
	[em 
		"Super Mario All-Stars
	]em
	" as 
	[em 
		"Super Mario Bros: The Lost Levels
	]em
	".

	", Argentu-M, and Endless Wind collaborate to create a run that collects every item in Worlds 1-8 except for Poison Mushrooms as fast as possible. World 9 is not played as it does not contain any items, and Worlds A-D are not played as that requires completing the game eight times in a row to unlock.
