	"The game is well known as having the first console speedrun with the world record of 5.51 by Todd Rogers in 1982 according to Twin Galaxies. This record is known as the oldest, unbeaten world record in all of speedrunning. Omnigamer decided to try and match the elusive 5.51, and disassembled the entire game looking for how the 5.51 was achieved.
