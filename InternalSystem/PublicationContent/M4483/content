	") is a brawler-platforming game for the Super Famicom that is based on the anime of the same name. In the game, players take control of Shintaro as he races across an island, trying to figure out where all of the monsters are coming from. Shintaro has various martial arts the player can use to fight enemies, such as dive kicks, a quick punch, and even a ki-wave. The players defeat enemies with these moves while platforming, dealing with bosses periodically.
