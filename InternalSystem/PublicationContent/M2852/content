	"As usual with the 
	[em 
		"Bishi Bashi
	]em
	" games, it's full to the brim with random and rather off-beat mini-games that often times pokes fun at Konami's own franchises (such as Track & Field and Beatmania). Most of the mini-games are either of the button mashing variety (such as the mini-game in which the player has to throw a tantrum faster than his siblings to get a toy by stomping his feet on the ground repeatedly), but there are also games where the player has to time which button to press (one such game is very similar to Dance Dance Revolution).
