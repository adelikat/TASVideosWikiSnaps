	"After Splinter taught his students how to teleport short distances, it was all over for the Foot Clan. Michael Jackson also taught them how to moonwalk, because this was the 80's and Michael Jackson was cool then. It never spoiled things that with 2 players the game spawns around 8/5 more enemies than with one player. The increased HP didn't help the bosses to stand that sudden turtle attack either.
