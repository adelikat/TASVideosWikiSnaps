	" was one of the original breakthrough titles in the stealth gaming genre. It follows Solid Snake, a soldier who is infiltrating a nuclear weapons facility on a remote Alaskan island in the Fox Archipelago, codenamed Shadow Moses. Snake must rescue two hostages from FOX-HOUND, a high-tech special forces unit gone rogue, and then stop FOX-HOUND from launching a nuclear warhead.
