		"Metal Gear Solid
	]em
	" was one of the original breakthrough titles in the stealth gaming genre. It follows Solid Snake, a soldier who is infiltrating a nuclear weapons facility on a remote Alaskan island in the Fox Archipelago, codenamed Shadow Moses. Snake must rescue two hostages from FOX-HOUND, a high-tech special forces unit gone rogue, and then stop FOX-HOUND from launching a nuclear warhead.

	" was planned for use in this branch from the start, because of a lengthy Liquid Snake monologue you can skip in Integral but not in the original version, as well as the added precision of analog controls; however, old PSX emulators could not play Intergral. With the switch to the higher-accuracy PSXHawk,

	"The raw improvement over the
