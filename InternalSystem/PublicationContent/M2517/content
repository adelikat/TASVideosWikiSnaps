		"Bionic Commando
	]em
	" (1988) is a platform game with a hero who can't jump, but can quickly latch onto objects with his bionic arm. The name of the original (Japanese) version of the game literally translates to 
	[em 
		"The Resurrection of Hitler: Top Secret
	]em
	". Nintendo censored the Nazi references for the North American version.
