	[em 
		"Lunar Ball

	", known as 
	[em 
		"Lunar Pool
	]em
	" in the US, is, as the name suggests, a pool game for the NES with the curious ability to adjust the friction of the surface of the pool table.  Indeed, it is quite possible to play with 
	[em 
		"no friction
	]em
	", and while this may sound easy, it actually proves to be impossibly difficult due to removing the major obstacle from the balls just continuing to roll forever, causing the game to never end.

	" is highly advisable to explain some of the oddities such as the occasional pocketing of the cue ball. (In short: The cue ball is deliberately pocketed in order to avoid getting a perfect score on every level because the point counter would take unbearably long to tick all the points, up to a half minute per level.)
