	"Rockman & Forte (ロックマン&フォルテ), known as Mega Man & Bass in the western world, used to be the last game chronologically released for the original Rockman/Megaman series, until Rockman & Forte Mirai kara no Chōsensha (ロックマン&フォルテ 未来からの挑戦者) was released on the WonderSwan handheld system. This game bears a striking resemblance to Mega Man 8, not only in style, but in excessive graphic detail.

	" takes apart the game with some glitches that allow Forte to zip around in walls. This run is 5:23 faster than the previous run, mostly due to an item called Counter Attacker (Cost Attack in Mega Man & Bass GBA) that allows more damage to a boss if Forte is low on health. This also explains why Forte takes much damage throughout the run. Read the author's comments for more details.
