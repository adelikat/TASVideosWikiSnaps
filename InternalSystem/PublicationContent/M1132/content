	[em

	" series, until 
	[em 
		"Rockman & Forte Mirai kara no Chōsensha
	]em
	" (ロックマン&フォルテ 未来からの挑戦者) was released on the WonderSwan handheld system. This game bears a striking resemblance to 
	[em

	]em
	", not only in style, but in excessive graphic detail.

	[em 
		"Mega Man & Bass
	]em
	" GBA) that allows more damage to a boss if Forte is low on health. This also explains why Forte takes much damage throughout the run. Read the author's comments for more details.
