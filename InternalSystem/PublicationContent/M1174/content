		"Kick Master
	]em
	" (1991) stars a hero named Thonolan, who 
	[em 
		"really
	]em
	" likes kicking things. Obviously, the first thing you'll see him doing is kicking some odd-looking trinkets out of the enemies. By doing so repeatedly and collecting the trinkets like a true hero, he levels up and gains new abilities, allowing him to kick the various enemies stronger and faster than before. You will marvel at the laws of physics being stomped by Thonolan's feet.
