	" of Super Mario World, created with 
	[a class=extlink href=http://fusoya.eludevisibility.org/lm/index.html rel=nofollow 
		"Lunar Magic
	]a
	", contains a Star World which contains themed levels that connect to various locations on the map. Like the original Super Mario World, these levels can be used as a makeshift warp zone. This movie demonstrates this path - navigating the Star World to charge straight to Bowser, leaving much of the game untouched.

	" primarily as a result of the new Pokey Stun Glitch, which almost completely bypasses Desert Star World. See the
