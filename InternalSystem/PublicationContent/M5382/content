		"Kuri Kinton

	" (功里金団) is a beat 'em up game that was developed by Taito only for the arcades. You play as a special Chinese policeman who is tasked with infiltrating an underground criminal base to rescue a fellow police officer and his daughter. Good thing you can throw energy blasts that can damage people at a distance. Each level in the base has a martial arts boss that you have to fight in order to proceed. Die once and it is game over unless you insert another credit.
