[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Pico Pico Pirates
	]em
	" is a Satellaview game that plays similarly to 
	[em 
		"Whac-A-Mole
	]em
	". You fight off a bunch of mole pirates that pilot a ship that suspiciously resembles an SNES controller. Each hole in the ship corresponds to a certain button on the controller, including shoulder buttons. As the levels progress, the mole pirates will move their ship more erratically, making it harder to keep track of what mole holes to attack.
