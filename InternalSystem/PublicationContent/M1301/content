	"Bonk's Revenge is the second game in a popular PCE/TurboGrafx-16 platforming series. Thankfully despite the console's unpopularity some of the games in the series were ported elsewhere. Bonk is a caveman with a giant noggin he willingly uses as a weapon against his enemies. He can also break the laws of physics by using his enormous head as leverage to glide in midair.
