	" is a puzzle Flash game about a hungry rabbit that goes out in the middle of the night for something to eat. As it is almost pitch dark outside, the rabbit is unable to find food on its own. Thankfully, you are there to help the rabbit. Find the rabbit the food it wants, but take note that these foods can be rather tricky to find.

	" beats the game in record time by exploiting a programming design flaw where all of the clickable parts of the game can be interacted with off-screen at the very beginning. Being able to click on things outside the window bounds is an actual Adobe Flash quirk.
