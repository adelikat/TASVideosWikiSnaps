		"SwordQuest: EarthWorld

	" is the first in a series of adventure games released for the Atari 2600. The games came with comic books that explained the plot of the games and contained clues needed to progress. Those that manage to solve the cryptic puzzles would then have a chance to submit their results to Atari and win prizes totaling up to $150,000. Unfortunately, the fourth game and the contest itself were cancelled in the wake of Atari's financial collapse. While the contestants would be compensated, the story of the series was left unfinished.
