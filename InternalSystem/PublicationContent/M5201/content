	" is a homebrew platformer for the Atari 2600 that was created for the Strawberry Jam 2 game jam. The story in the game has Kelly Kangaroo and her love Rosie the Rabbit on a date when a mad scientist Contemptus Mundy, jealous at how happy Kelly and Rosie are, kidnaps Rosie and brings her to his motherbase in the clouds. Kelly must now go up there and rescue Rosie, avoiding all sorts of weird animals and monsters. However, the only way to truly free her is by collecting six strawberries that are scattered throughout the game.
