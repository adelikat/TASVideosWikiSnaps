	" is a homebrew platformer for the Game Boy Advance that was created as part of a university student's final project. You follow the short space-hopping journey of Yerba, a anthropomorphic rabbit that's traveling to the moon. Along the way, Yerba gets contacted Lo, an old friend who goes way back with him. Follow the two and learn the more about the relationship between them and how it came to be.
