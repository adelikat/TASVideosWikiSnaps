[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom
	]em
	" is a licensed shoot 'em up that is based on the 
	[em 
		"Buck Rogers
	]em
	" comic strip. It was one of the first third-person rail shooters for the arcades and has seen ports for many home consoles and computers, from the SG-1000 to the Commodore 64. As those systems have less powerful hardware than the one the arcade version uses, they often either change up the mechanics or have much less enemies to shoot down. The game itself has you pilot a space fighter to thwart the Planet of Zoom and its invasion force. Only by destroying the source ship can the Planet of Zoom be truly stopped.
