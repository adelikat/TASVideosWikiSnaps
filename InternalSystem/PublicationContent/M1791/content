		"Keitai Denjū Telefang
	]em
	" (携帯電獣テレファング) is a series of video games produced by Natsume and published by Smilesoft. The games are monster-battling games, where the player contacts various creatures using a cell phone-like device called a D-Shot in order to get them to battle the foes he or she will encounter. The name of the series derives from Keitai, which is Japanese for "cell phone," since phoning creatures is an integral part of the game, and "fang," to symbolise the various beasts involved.
