[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Batman: The Junkyard Challenge
	]em
	" is a ROM hack that aims to provide a much more challenging version of 
	[em 
		"Batman
	]em
	" for the NES. Platforming is much more difficult, mistakes can be punished harshly, and enemies and hazards litter the levels. The enemy is also more difficult and the items now have different drop rates. This romhack is certainly made for those who found NES 
	[em 
		"Batman
	]em
	" too easy.
