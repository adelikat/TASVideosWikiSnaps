	[em 
		"RosenkreuzStilette
	]em
	" is an action platforming doujin game that was developed by independent Japanese studio 
	[em 
		"[erka:es]
	]em
	". The gameplay takes heavy inspiration from the classic NES 
	[em 
		"Mega Man
	]em
	" games, and the art style is evocative of the IGA-era 
	[em 
		"Castlevania
	]em
	" games and early Type Moon games such as 
	[em 
		"Tsukihime
	]em
	" and 
	[em 
		"Fate/stay night
	]em
	". It also has a generally rich plot with a good amount of worldbuilding for a doujin game.

	"Taking place in a medieval fantasy setting, the game revolves around the Magi, magic users who were persecuted for practicing magic. The Magi fought the Holy Empire for their freedom and rights and eventually won, finding their place as a branch of the empire's military called Rosenkreuzstilette, or RKS for short. Tensions remained, however, which led to one of their commanders, Count Michael, ordering a brutal strike against Holy Empire out of fear for his fellow Magi. Spiritia, who was away at the time, returns to find the rebellion in action and the Count's daughter Iris suddenly being whisked away by the dragon Talos, supposedly on the orders of the Count himself. Spiritia, with the help of her friends, must now rescue Iris and quell the rebellion before things get even worse.
