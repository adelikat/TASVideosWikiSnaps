		"Mario Artist
	]em
	" series of games that were created for the short-lived Nintendo 64DD. In this game, with a bunch of prefabricated polygon parts, you can create models that you can use in three game modes, "Experimental World", "Sound Bomber", and "Go-Go-Park". "Experimental World" has you use your model to explore and collect new parts. "Sound Bomber" has eight microgames that you play using your model and serves as a precursor to the 
	[em 
		"WarioWare
	]em
	" series. And "Go-Go-Park" is a minigame where you wind up your model and have it race and reach a designated finish line without going over a bridge.
