	" is an edutainment game for the Atari 2600. With a given word shown to you for a few seconds and a 99 second time limit, you are to scroll a set of letters from the alphabet and zap each letter in the correct order to form the word, then finish the round by shooting the alien emoji. You can also use the alien emoji in place of any letter, but the round must be finished with it and another one won't be given to you unless you shoot down five asteroids.
