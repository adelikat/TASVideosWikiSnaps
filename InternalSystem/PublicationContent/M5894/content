	" is a homebrew platformer for the Game Boy Advance that was created for the GBA Game Jam 2021. You play as a black cat that's on an adventure, going to various places ranging from up in the sky to below the ground. There are strange things in the world this cat inhabits, some plain weird and some outright hostile, sometimes even both! However, this cat has no fear and braves their way through everything thrown at them.
