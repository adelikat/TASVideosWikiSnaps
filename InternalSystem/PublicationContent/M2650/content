	" is a cave exploration / treasure-hunting game inspired by classic platform games and rogue-likes, where the goal is to grab as much treasure from the cave as possible. Every time you play the cave's layout is supposed to be different, but now the Spelunker guy decides to make sure the cave is in his favor by finding everything he needs in no time before zipping his way to the end.
