	" is a simulation game where you control and cultivate a colony of ants and pit them against another ant colony. However, as these ants are in the backyard of a suburban home, they must also defend themselves against the humans that might kill them, deliberately or not. The mode played in this run is "Full Game", where your goals are to eliminate the enemy ant colony and drive out the humans from their home.
