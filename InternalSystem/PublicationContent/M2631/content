		"Super Metroid
	]em
	" is a classic game that normally takes 
	[a class=intlink href=/1368M 
		"much longer
	]a
	" to beat. However, by abusing a glitch involving going through a door as the game is returning from the pause menu, 
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/total 
		"total
	]a
	", 
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/sniq 
		"sniq
	]a
	" and 
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/cpadolf 
		"cpadolf
	]a
	" manage to corrupt the game's memory and make it jump to controller input. Once they gain control, they execute arbitrary code to tell the game to immediately jump to the ending only seven minutes in!

	[a class=intlink href=/2600M
