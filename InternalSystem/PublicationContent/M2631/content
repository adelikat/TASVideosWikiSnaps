		"Super Metroid
	]em
	" is a classic game that normally takes 
	[a href=/1368M 
		"much longer
	]a
	" to beat. However, by abusing a glitch involving going through a door as the game is returning from the pause menu, 
	(__wikiLink|user:total)
	", 
	(__wikiLink|user:sniq)
	" and 
	(__wikiLink|user:cpadolf)
	" manage to corrupt the game's memory and make it jump to controller input. Once they gain control, they execute arbitrary code to tell the game to immediately jump to the ending only seven minutes in!

	[a href=/2600M 
		"previous one
	]a
	" in this category by over five and a half minutes through a totally new glitch. It also finishes with a record ingame time of
