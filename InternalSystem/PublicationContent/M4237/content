[div class=p 
	"In 
	[em 
		"Boing!
	]em
	", you are a bubble named, with great originality, Bubble. The object here is to bounce on each of the thirty-six squares and turn them all on. You start at the bottom left. The Bubble Eater starts at the bottom right. He will chase you around the play field and if he catches you, you lose one of your lives. Pin starts at the top of a row and moves down. If you are hit by Pin, you pop and a life is lost.
