	" is a button-mashing homebrew game for the NES that was released in 2002. The premise of the game is as follows: In the far future of 7250, the world has become a dystopia where the judicial system has degraded to a duel to the death. The plaintiff and defendant in each court case are strapped to linked up electrical chairs equipped with foot pedals. The one who stomps on the pedal the fastest won't be electrified to death.
