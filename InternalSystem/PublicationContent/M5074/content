[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Karoshi
	]em
	" (過労死), meaning "death from overworking". This is supposedly the concept behind the Flash game 
	[em 
		"Karoshi: Suicide Salaryman
	]em
	", which was made by a couple of Western developers. You play as a wage slave that wants to commit suicide, but it turns out that it's not easy to do so in your workplace, which is filled with falling safes, loaded guns, and electrical hazards. With a couple dozen lives to spare, you must figure out a way to kill yourself in each room by solving puzzles, which will then lead to you exploding with enough blood to fill a tanker truck.
