[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Lego Batman
	]em
	" is a weird unlicensed Sega Genesis game from Russia. While it is very loosely based on the 
	[em 
		"Lego Batman
	]em
	" IP, the game design appears to be original. What story could be gleamed here has Batman collecting Lego gears while beating up random bad guys for some reason. Then Batman goes to Christmasland and has to get back stolen gifts from random places and eventually rescues Santa Claus.
