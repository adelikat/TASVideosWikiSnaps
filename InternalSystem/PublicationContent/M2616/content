	]em
	", is one of the most notorious games to have been released for the Nintendo 64. Here, Lex Luthor pulls off yet another stunt: this time, he and Brainiac have developed a virtual reality version of Metropolis to trick the people of the fair city. Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen are the first to be tricked and trapped by the nefarious duo. It's all done to pull in Superman, the world's strongest hero, in order to take him down. But as the man himself, your job is to destroy any and all hopes of the bad guys' chances.
