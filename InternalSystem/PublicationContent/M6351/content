	" is a licensed isometric racing game that was original developed for the arcades and later saw releases on home consoles and computers such as the NES and the Commodore 64. The NES version was developed by Rare and published by Tradewest and features an exclusive track. The game has standard Indy car racing elements. Your car has both health, fuel, and turbo boosts. If it runs out of health or fuel, it will slow to a crawl. All three can be replenished through pit stops, with health refilling the fastest. Winning races earns you money that can be used to purchase car upgrades.
