	[em 
		"Alfred's Adventure
	]em
	" is platforming game released exclusively in Europe for the Game Boy Color and a remake of the game 
	[em 
		"Alfred Chicken
	]em
	". This game has you play a chicken named Alfred, who goes on an adventure to rescue a fellow chicken named Billy Egg, who was kidnapped by evil "Meka-Chickens" for their cloning "eggs-periments". These Meka-Chickens are also planning to take over the world, by the way. At least that's what the manual says. What the game has you do is go through some really weird levels and complete them by pecking at a certain number of balloons in each one.
