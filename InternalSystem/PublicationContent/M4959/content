The premise of the game is that three humans have became giant mutated monsters due to various experimental mishaps. Now that they're monsters, their goal is to roam the nation, destroy everything in their paths, and crush any and all opposition, whether it be civilians trying to defend their home to the military trying to bomb them down.
