[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Rockman 2 Plus!
	]em
	" is a ROM hack of 
	[em 
		"Mega Man 2
	]em
	" that changes the levels and the graphics. The settings for the lands of each Robot Master appear have themes that deviate from the usual robot science fiction setting of 
	[em 
		"Mega Man
	]em
	", with a level that's full of clocks and a level that appears to be straight out of 
	[em 
		"Castlevania
	]em
	". Even the Robot Masters have wildly different graphics, with one called "Liquidman" being a mass of water.
