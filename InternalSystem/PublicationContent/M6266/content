[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Soul Escape
	]em
	" is a horror Flash game from the escape room subgenre. For reasons unknown, you find yourself trapped in a dimly lit, dank room of concrete and prison bar cells. The atmosphere in the building you're in is haunting and uninviting, and you wonder how long has it been since anyone has actually used the building. You now have to figure out a way to get out of the building or else someone or something gets you and consumes you, either literally or figuratively.
