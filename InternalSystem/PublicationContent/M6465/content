[div class=p 
	[em

	"  is a Flash platforming 
	[em

	" fan game and the spinoff to 
	[em 
		"Super Mario Bros. Star Scramble 2
	]em
	". As with the previous games, the gameplay is exactly the same, only with the game set on a place called "Ghost Island" where there's only one Big Boo. The only other major graphical difference is that the level select screen is now just a grid of levels to choose from, unlike the level hub of the first game or the 
	[em

	]em
	" style map of the second game.
