	[em

	[em 
		"Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3
	]em
	" for the Sega Genesis that adds in every character and stage that was in the first three 
	[em 
		"Mortal Kombat
	]em
	" games. It also adds in characters, combos, sounds, and special moves that were in the original arcade versions but not in the console versions, along with some special romhack original goodies. However, care was not taken into balancing the game when adding all the characters. Some of them may have very distinct and noticeable advantages over many others.

	" chooses to play 2 player-controlled characters against 1 CPU-controlled character, using Chameleon and Woman Chameleon, and lets loose with all the wacky and game-shattering combos and specials the romhack has to offer. The result is something that has to be seen to be believed.
