[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Air 2
	]em
	" is a ROM hack of 
	[em 
		"Super Mario Bros.
	]em
	" by U1 and a revision of the ROM hack 
	[em 
		"Air
	]em
	", which was also created by the same author. It is a puzzle-oriented ROM hack which requires knowledge of 
	[em 
		"Super Mario Bros.
	]em
	" glitches in order to solve. What makes 
	[em 
		"Air 2
	]em
	" different from 
	[em 
		"Air
	]em
	" is that it lacks the infinite jumps feature 
	[em 
		"Air
	]em
	" had and all hidden blocks are marked at the start.
