	[em 
		"Super Mario Bros. Deluxe
	]em
	" is a remake of 
	[em

			"Super Mario Bros.
		]a
	]em
	" with some new game modes, including a challenge mode where coins and time remaining are crucial to gaining the target score, and a race mode where Mario competes against Boo to reach each level's finish first.

	"This run completes the Original mode, and 33 frames faster (ignoring lag frame differences due to different emulators) than the 
	[a class=intlink href=/2426M

	]a
	". While this mode looks like a direct port of the NES game, there are different physics and glitches, making optimizing
