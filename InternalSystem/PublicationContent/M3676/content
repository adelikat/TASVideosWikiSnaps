	"The game follows a blue-haired protagonist (named by the player, but originally called Kyou) as he journeys on his quest to become a T-Fanger. Along the way, he encounters Diabolos, who is not content with humans entering the Denjuu universe and so is killing off the Antenna Trees, thereby cutting off access to the Human World.
