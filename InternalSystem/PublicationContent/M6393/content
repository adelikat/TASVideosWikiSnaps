	" is an arcade platforming game by Nintendo that jumpstarted some of their most successful franchises. It was ported to numerous home consoles and computers, from the Famicom to the TI-99/4A. The game starts off with Jumpman's girlfriend Pauline being kidnapped by a giant ape known as Donkey Kong and brought to various industrial sites. Jumpman must now save and reach Pauline without dying to fall damage, the barrels thrown by Donkey Kong, or the other hazards from the industrial sites he's in.
