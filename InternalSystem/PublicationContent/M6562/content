Taking place in the mystical world known as Edda, it was once ravaged by the war between Alphas and the Demi-Humans, led by the evil god Ragmeira. Alphas eventually managed to defeat them and seal them deep underground, allowing humanity to prosper. However, the seal is weakening and Ragmeira will soon break free and cause havoc one again. It's up to you and five other adventurers to go off on a quest to find the lost power of Alphas and purge the world of Ragmeira's presence one and for all.
