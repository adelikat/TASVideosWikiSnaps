	"At a time when computer games were being blamed for violence, bad language, epilepsy and everything else the ‘moral majority’ needed a scapegoat for, LJN gave us this game, based on the toy line of the same name. You play a crash test dummy, trying to progress through levels filled with hazards such as cars and fireballs, while trying to preserve your limbs, within the time limits.
