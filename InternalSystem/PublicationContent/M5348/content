[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Rockman 3: Stalker Attack
	]em
	" is a ROM hack of 
	[em 
		"Mega Man 3
	]em
	" that is itself a modification of the ROM hack 
	[em 
		"Rockman 3: Burst Chaser
	]em
	". Like with that romhack, the main change is that Mega Man goes faster. Unlike with that romhack, the level and graphic design has been changed accordingly, with different boss mechanics and new enemies. The only things that have been retained from 
	[em 
		"Burst Chaser
	]em
	" is the changed music and the enemy and boss AI.
