[div class=p 
	[em 
		"MURDER
	]em
	" is a timing-based Flash game where you play an assassin whose goal is to usurp the king and take his place. If you do usurp the king, you then must watch your back for others that want to do the same to you. Be sure to catch the right people, lest you be overthrown immediately.
