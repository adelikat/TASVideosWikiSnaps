	" is a top-down maze shooter released in 1982 for the Mattel Intellivision. You are trapped in a maze while robots, spiders, and bats relentlessly track you down. The key to survival is to destroy as many of them as possible -- before they get you!

The robots aren't shown any mercy once an Invisible Robot is killed, which appears after 80,000 points is reached, and marks all of the game's content being showcased.
