	"The game is normally played by selecting one of three leagues, known as Knight, Queen, and King leagues. This TAS plays through all three leagues.  Each race, aside from the final ones in each league, are finished after entering in 2nd place to skip the winning animation, because of this, there is an alternate encode provided that shows each race ending in 1st place, to achieve the fastest in game time.
