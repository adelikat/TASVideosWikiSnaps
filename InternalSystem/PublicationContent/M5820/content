	" is a vehicular combat game that was developed by Namco for the arcades and later ported to the PlayStation. It features 3D graphics mixed with 2D sprites all in a third-person view (which can be changed to a first-person view). In this futuristic game, you control a hovercraft that's equipped with cannons and guns. You are to face off against another player, computer-controlled or by another player, and destroy them before they destroy you by maneuvering around the field and making use of cover and pick-ups that are scattered across the field.
