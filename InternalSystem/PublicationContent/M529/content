	"Normally, shooting bubbles stops Ariel, so a speedrun would try to avoid all the enemies.  However, the author manages to fire shots with little movement delay thanks to a glitch involving turning around.  Luck manipulation is also used to beat the bosses quite quickly.  For more details, see the submission comments.
