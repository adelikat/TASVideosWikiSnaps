	" tells the tale of Sir Daniel Fortesque, one very deceased knight, and his quest to rid the land of undead legions and Zarok, the wicked magician who created them. The gameplay is very reminiscent of the action-platformers of old, consisting largely of running around each stage hacking up baddies, though there is also a good share of puzzles to be solved.
