	"The game spans eight levels including an intro stage and a final boss rush. Several enemies are taken from 
	[em 
		"Rockman X
	]em
	" and 
	[em 
		"Rockman 8
	]em
	", with the bosses being either recycled from previous 
	[em 
		"Zook Hero
	]em
	" games or being edits from other official 
	[em 
		"Megaman
	]em
	" games. The main character's design is based off of X.
