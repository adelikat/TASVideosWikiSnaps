[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Sonic Battle
	]em
	" is a fighting game spinoff from the 
	[em 
		"Sonic
	]em
	" series. Rather than being 3D side-scrolling like many traditional fighting games, this game employs a 3D isometric view – not a static, sprite-based field though, it is comprised of actual texture-mapped polygons. The character sprites are 2D though, and while you think it wouldn't work – it does.

[div class=p

	" improves on the previous "Challenge Mode" run by over a minute by utilizing a Sonic-exclusive glitch where he can repeatedly one-shot opponents with his super moves without spending any super meter.
