	[em 
		"Challenger
	]em
	". In this game, a train gang has taken over a passenger train, and it's up to you to get to the engine of the train and stop it before the train gang gets the train to a mysterious location. On your way to the train engine, you must evade gangsters that will try to gun you down and snake birds and ghosts that are out to get you for some inexplicable reason.
