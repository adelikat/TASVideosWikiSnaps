		"Buster Brothers

	", also known as 
	[em 
		"Pang
	]em
	", is a well-known series of puzzle games. This is the first release of the series, ported to the Game Boy. The author decided to pick the GB version for TASing because the levels are simpler, which makes the run shorter and easier to optimize.

	"The plot is rather simple. Some "bubbles" are attacking the Earth and you must travel across the world busting them. The game has 50 stages divided into 17 locations: Mt. Fuji, Mt. Keirin, Emerald Temple, Australia, Taj Mahal, Leningrad, Paris, London, Barcelona, Athens, Egypt, Kenya, New York, Maya, Antartica and Easter Island. It offers the option to start from Leningrad and thus skip 18 levels. However, p4wn3r ignored this and went through all the levels to show the entire game.
