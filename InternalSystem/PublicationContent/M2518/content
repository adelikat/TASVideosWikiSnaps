	"In this TAS of 
	[em

	]em
	", the author aims to beat the game as quickly as possible. He achieves this by exploiting a large sequence break which involves "tricking" the game into warping Link directly from the Deku Tree (the first dungeon) to Ganon's Castle. Child Link then goes on conquering the whole castle without a single thought about becoming an adult beforehand.
