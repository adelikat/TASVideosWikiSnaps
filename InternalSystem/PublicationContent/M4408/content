	]em
	" is an unlicensed demake of 
	[em 
		(__wikiLink|displaytext=Resident Evil|href=/1876M)
	]em
	" for the NES by Waixing. Its Mandarin name is 
	[em 
		"生化危机 Bio Hazard
	]em
	", where "生化危机" means "Resident Evil." The game's physics and aesthetics are based off of the GB game 
	[em 
		"Resident Evil Gaiden
	]em
	".

	"Like the 3D game it is based on, this game requires the player to navigate a zombie-infested mansion while managing inventory space, ammunition, and puzzle items. Unlike the original 
	[em 
		"Resident Evil
	]em
	" however, shooting zombies is accomplished via a mini-game where a moving reticle must be stopped when in range of a target. Also unlike the original game, ammunition does not stack, and items are not droppable.
