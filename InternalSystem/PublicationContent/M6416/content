[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Late for Work
	]em
	" is short, time-attack focused ROM hack of 
	[em

	]em
	" The quick story here is that Mario is late for a work meeting with the Princess, and that means he only has 100 seconds to complete each level or he dies. Sounds straightforward enough, but the level has been changed up to require some glitching to get around some obstacles. Unlucky happenstance?
