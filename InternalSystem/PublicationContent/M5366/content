[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Puffle Launch
	]em
	" is a standalone spinoff game in the 
	[em 
		"Club Penguin
	]em
	" franchise. Puffles are the furry pets of penguins in 
	[em 
		"Club Penguin
	]em
	", and some of them like to be daredevils. This game chronicles the exploits of one of those Puffles, as he shoots himself out of a cannon and onto various helpful devices so he can get to the finish ring. However, it appears that there is a devious individual up to no good in the skies. Perhaps this one daredevil Puffle could uncover who that individual is?
