	" is a very famous game for the NES. There are normally two main ways to beat it: the quick way 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=using warp whistles to skip worlds|href=/3812M)

	". However, thanks to some esoteric memory corruption involving glitched pipe travel, it's possible to jump right into the princess's room in under three minutes! Bowser is never seen in this run at all.
