	" (1991) is a difficult platformer because of its intricate routes and bosses, but the author makes short work of both. In particular, this movie sports some of the shortest boss fights of any game. It also provides entertainment through varied character and vehicle use (thankfully, the game still manages not to lag immensely even with all the action thrown in).
