[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Trap
	]em
	" is a puzzle game for the Commodore 64 that was published in the May 1988 issue of the 
	[em 
		"Compute's! Gazette
	]em
	". In a mysterious dimension filled with rectangular prisms, there are two things, a square and a sphere. Energy is limited and precious and sharing isn't an option. As the square, your goal is to steal the sphere's energy by trapping it. This is done by passing over prisms and turning them into another color, making them impassable by the sphere and you. Be careful not to trap yourself, however, and you only have a limited amount of time before you run out of energy and die.
