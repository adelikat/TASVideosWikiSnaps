	"X-Men: The Official Game is based on the third X-Men film. The game lets you control either Wolverine, Colossus, Iceman or Nightcrawler through twenty-five stages of a traditional side-scrolling beat'em up platformer. You move through the levels usually to find the exit. The stages can scroll from left to right, top to bottom or are designed more like a labyrinth. Enemies are defeated using a variety of punches. The characters differ hereby in range and the damage they deal. Each character also has his own special attack and some character-specific abilities. For example, Colossus can smash certain materials while Wolverine regenerates his health over time.
