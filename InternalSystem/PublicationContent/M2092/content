		"Dragon Unit

	" (also known as 
	[em 
		"Castle of Dragon
	]em
	") is an obscure arcade game about a castle with a dragon in it.  Perhaps it's not the most original sounding game; but it does have nudity, gratuitous violence, and Engrish to make up for it.  The action is very fast paced, and with the help of TAS skills, the dragon master is dispatched quicker than a hard boiled egg.
