		"Myst

	" is a puzzle-solving point-and-click game that was originally released for the Macintosh. The version shown in this run is a homebrew demake for the Atari 2600. Due to the significant technical limitations of the Atari 2600, the entire game wasn't able to be ported over. Only enough of the game was implemented that the result can be considered "complete and beatable."
