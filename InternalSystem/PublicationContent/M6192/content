	" is a colorful game that's very long for a NES game. King Dedede stole the Star Rod, split it into pieces and gave it to his minions, and it's up to Kirby to piece it back together. The game features a vast amount of copy abilities, ranging from laser to the single-use Crash ability, which defeats every enemy on screen.
