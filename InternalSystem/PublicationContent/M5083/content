	" is a wrestling game for the NES that was developed by Tecmo. What makes this wrestling game stand out from the others on the console is the addition of live commentary that narrates what's happening onscreen. In addition, whenever you or the opponent perform special signature moves, a replay can happen that will show the move being performed in slow motion. In between matches, you can play bodybuilding minigames that can increase the damage your moves can do in later matches.
