		"Spiritual Warfare
	]em
	" (1992) is an unlicensed NES game created by Wisdom Tree. The company specializes in the niche market of Christian-themed video games. The gameplay in 
	[em 
		"Spiritual Warfare
	]em
	" is very similar to 
	[em 
		"The Legend of Zelda
	]em
	" (1986). The game's story is taken directly from the Bible (Ephesians 6:12-18):

	" For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.

	$LF
	[b 
		"13.)
	]b
	" Therefore, take unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and, having done all, to stand.

	[b 
		"14.)

	[b 
		"helmet of salvation

	[b 
		"sword of the Spirit

	", which is the Word of God,
	[br

	$LF
	[b 
		"18.)

	" praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints.

	"The Christian concept of spiritual warfare is a metaphor for fully accepting whatever Christ teaches. The ongoing spiritual war against Satan requires the 
	[em 
		"whole
	]em
	" armor of God, meaning that a faithful Christian should always obey the Lord's authority in order to defeat evil.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"The author of the TAS utterly ignores the philosophy of obtaining the whole armor of God in order to defeat Satan. The power of prayer, rather than the Helmet of Salvation, is enough to protect the hero's physical body from dynamite explosions.
