	"Pugsley's scavenger hunt is an extremely fast paced game, which makes it difficult. It is made even more difficult by playing on the hardest setting, which gives Pugsley only one single heart, meaning that he dies in one hit. The movie itself looks very impressive and it really gives the impression that the player knows what he is doing.
