	" is a run-and-gun arcade game that is based on the cartoon of the same name and developed by Konami. Following the premise of the cartoon, the main cast of anthropomorphic bovine characters were originally ordinary animals until a mystery comet crashed near them and turned them into walking, talking animals. They formed their own city, Moo Mesa, and ran it like a Wild West town, complete with sheriffs and bandits. One of the denizens of the town, Lily Bovine, has been kidnapped by the notorious Masked Bull. Its up the C.O.W.-Boys and Buffalo Bull to get back Lily and stop the Masked Bull's reign of terror.
