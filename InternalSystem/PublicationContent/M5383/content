[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Dam Busters
	]em
	" is one of 52 games that are bundled in 
	[em 
		"Action 52
	]em
	", an unlicensed but very well known multicart for the NES. This game is very simplistic and involves a beaver traveling across dams to the finish line while avoiding other beavers. Also, this beaver can shoot mysterious projectiles that can blow up enemy beavers somehow.
