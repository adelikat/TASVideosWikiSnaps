	"Pokémon Sapphire, along with Pokémon Ruby and Emerald, is part of the third-generation Pokémon games, after Pokémon Gold and Silver. Noticeable differences include the graphics and interface, Pokémon abilities, and the running shoes that allow the player to move around in the outside overworld very fast, before getting the bike.

	"This run improves on its predecessor by over 12.5 minutes (mostly from skipping unnecessary battles), while catching the same five Pokémon, and taking advantage of critical hits and Pokémon abilities. Mudkip, the chosen starter, is a Water Pokémon that has Water/Ground evolutions. Almost all battle action involves this one Pokémon, with the legendary Kyogre (exclusive to Sapphire) leading the last couple battles.
