	" is set in 2455 AD, in a dystopian future brought on by the actions of a man named Kage Mishima, who now rules the earth. However, this future is actually an alternate timeline created by the mystical Daikatana sword, which allows the one who wields it to travel through time. A martial arts teacher, Hiro Miyamoto (no relation to Shigeru), journeys to recover the Daikatana and return the universe to its natural timeline.
