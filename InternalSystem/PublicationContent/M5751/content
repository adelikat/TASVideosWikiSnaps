[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Digger

	" is one of the games that came with the disk of Issue 21 of Compute!'s Gazette, released in March 1985. In this game (and unlike the PC game of the same name), players find themselves in an underground area with three trolls, which need to be defeated by dropping a boulder on them.
