	"This run is different from the 
	[a class=intlink href=/2618M 
		"any% TAS
	]a
	" in that it does everything necessary to achieve the maximum score. This means avoiding falling down pits (which decreases your score by 100 each time) and following a much longer route in order to obtain all items. This route allows the author to show off a glitch that spawns a balloon earlier than intended, which is used several times.
