	"Pokémon Sapphire, along with Pokémon Ruby and Emerald, is part of the third-generation Pokémon games, after Pokémon Gold and Silver. Noticeable differences include the graphics and interface, Pokémon abilities, and the running shoes that allow the player to move around in the outside overworld very fast, before getting the bike.

	[a class=intlink href=/893M 
		"previous run
	]a
	" by 96 seconds, mostly due to using a different Pokemon a third of the way through.  Mudkip, the chosen starter, is a Water Pokémon that has Water/Ground evolutions. After the third gym, Machop, a Fighting type, is used. Its ability allows the Attack stat to be multiplied by 1.5x if it receives a status condition. The paralysis effect is no accident.
