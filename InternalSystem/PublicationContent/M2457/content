		"Pok√©mon: Blue Version

	" is part of the first generation of games within its famous series, known for having a very large number of beneficial glitches. In fact, the game can be completed in less than one minute of in-game time using save data corruption (as evidenced in the 
	[a href=/1860M 
		"run of the Yellow Version
	]a
	"), but this run avoids such techniques in favor of activating an entirely different glitch.
