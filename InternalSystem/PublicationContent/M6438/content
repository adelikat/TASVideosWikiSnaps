	" is an adventure simulation game developed and published by Magnetic Images for the Amiga in 1989. Putting the player in the role of a gold miner, they are free to explore the town and surrounding caves. The only restrictions is that they needed enough food as well as a safe place to sleep, with money being earned in a variety of ways. It is also notable for not having a single environment for the player to operate in, as the locations of mines and rivers as well as the characters that could be met were different on each playthrough.
