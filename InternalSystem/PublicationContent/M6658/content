	"Set in the year 21XX, sapient robots known as Reploids have been created based on the greatest creation of the late Dr. Light, X. In recent times, some of the Reploids started to develop bugs in their programming and became violent androids known as "Mavericks". One of them, Sigma, was the leader of a group meant to police them known as the Hunters. He plans to rally as many of Mavericks and his fellow Hunters as possible to stage an anti-human rebellion and enforce his vision of Reploid supremacy. It's now up to X and fellow Hunter Zero to stop Sigma before humanity is wiped out.
