	" is a platform/puzzle game where a boy and girl work through a series of 100 puzzles. This breaks a curse and returns them to human form. Completing each level involves climbing ladders and moving blocks so that each enemy can be defeated. A rewind function is present for trail+error attempts to get to the solutions. But that feature isn't needed here.
