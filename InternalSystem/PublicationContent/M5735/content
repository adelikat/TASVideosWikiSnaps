[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Rock Paper Scissors
	]em
	" is a homebrew puzzle game for the NES. It is a falling block take on the rules of the classic game Rock Paper Scissors in a similar fashion to 
	[em 
		"Tetris
	]em
	". Here, pieces that can overtake certain other pieces (e.g. rock beats scissors) can plow through a column of those same pieces until it either hits the bottom or another piece that it cannot overtake. The game ends when all levels are beaten or column is stacked to the top of the screen.
