	" is a space shooter and one of 52 games bundled in the Sega Genesis version of

		"Action 52
	]em
	". According to the manual, you are in a spaceship flying through man-made space caverns, which in the game look like chipped off parts of the Death Star floating in space. Your goal is to navigate through the caverns and get to end while avoiding enemy ships that, unlike you, can pass through the cavern walls unharmed. Luckily, your spaceship has laser guns you can use to shoot down the enemies.
