	" Aliens have stolen Christmas presents in a city that were meant for children and hid them in the city park, probably for safekeeping, as they plan to escape the planet with them. Santa's little helpers now have to get the presents back so that they go back to under the trees of all the city children who behaved well. In addition to a one player mode that follows this story, there is also a competitive two player mode where the one that gets the most presents wins.
