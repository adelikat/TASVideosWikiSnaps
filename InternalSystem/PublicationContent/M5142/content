	" (ハイドライド３ 異次元の思い出), which was originally released only in Japan for the MSX, PC-88, Famicom, and other systems. It has  a simple plot of a hero trying to find the source of an ominous evil after the main fairy of his land disappears and a mysterious fissure opens up in the middle of the land. It has a number of features that were novel for RPGs at the time such as hunger, sleep, and weight meters, and it even makes the genre transition from traditional European fantasy to space sci-fi for a brief moment.
