	"In the 22nd century, the scientists, learning the ancient ways of magic, discovered a new technique that made it possible to create artificial beings by mixing the DNA of humans and animals. Those new creatures, known as Gears, had no will of their own and were destined to obey humans forever. However, a Gear named Justice was somehow capable of disobeying the humans and making his own decisions. He organized a rebellion of Gears, that was later repressed by the knights of the Sacred Order. He was thrown into prison, but recently has broken free, and the Order organized a tournament to find out who is capable of hunting him down again. Among the contenders is Sol Badguy, a man with an unclear past, and his rival Ky Kiske, one of the most skilled knights of the order. The conditions of the tournament are, however, very strange. Spilling blood is allowed, and the first prize is the fulfillment of any wish the winner has.
