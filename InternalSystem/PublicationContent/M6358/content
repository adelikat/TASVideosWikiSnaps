[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Scrabble
	]em
	" is a popular word board game that has seen many iterations on many platforms. The objective is to earn points by forming words with a given set of letter tiles on a 15x15 playing board. More uncommon letters are worth more points, and there is a blank tile where any letter can be used that is worth nothing. Points can be multiplied by placing the tiles on special squares on the board.
