	[a class=intlink href=/1360M

	]a
	", containing very difficult jumps, many enemies, problematic terrain, poisonous mushrooms, and, at worst, koopa jumps over walls or across pits. Most of it is senseless rehashing of elements in places where they don't belong (like amateur hacks). It's so difficult to beat that Nintendo of America released a wholly different game given a Mario theme as 
	[a class=intlink href=/1724M 
		"Super Mario Bros 2
	]a
