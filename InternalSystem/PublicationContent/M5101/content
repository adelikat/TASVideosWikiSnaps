	[em 
		"Mario 3: Around the World
	]em
	" is a bootleg video game for the Sega Genesis from Russia.  While the game itself is very basic but with some awkward controls, it's one of many Russian bootleg games that have become infamous online for having some rather disturbing game over screens (none of which show up in this run). Many assets were stolen from other places such as the music and sprite work.
