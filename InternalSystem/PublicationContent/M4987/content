	" is a chess game for the NES with a few neat gimmicks. In addition to standard 2D depictions of chess pieces you get to play with, you also have "3D" pieces that walk and interact with other pieces like they're real people. You also have animations for when pieces overtake and destroy other pieces. There are also features to aid in gameplay such as letting the game suggest moves to you if you're stuck and being able to take back moves and play again.

	" decides to play the game using 3D pieces on the hardest difficulty. Moves have to be considered not just to minimize CPU thinking time, but also to take the lengthy "3D" animations into account and minimize those as well. To make things quicker, a glitch was performed that allows for two moves to be played in a row when doing a take back during a CPU's turn.
