		"Yathzee

	" [sic] is one of many ports of the dice game Yahtzee to the Commodore 64. The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible by rolling five dice to make certain combinations. Points are earned depending on the scoring category chosen. A Yahtzee is when all five dice have the same number and is worth 50 points, the most of the categories. Unique to this particular port is the usage of a synthesized voice, which sounds pretty rough due to being on an 8-bit computer.
