[div class=p 
	[em 
		"TRAPPED
	]em
	" (stylized as 
	[em 
		"-TRAPPED-
	]em
	") is a story-driven Flash adventure game and the first entry in what is known as the 
	[em 
		"Trapped
	]em
	" trilogy. You play as a man who wakes up to find himself trapped in a guarded bathroom and with no memory of how he got there or who he is. Help him figure out how to get out and solve the mystery that surrounds him and his true identity by solving a series of moon logic puzzles filled with egregious contrivances. Also, a Bible is involved.
