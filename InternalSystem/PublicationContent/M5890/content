	" is a Flash role-playing/pseudo-life simulation game. You play as a guy who suddenly wakes up in the 2nd dimension, where everyone is a stickman in a very small city. As with many other life simulation games, your goal is to make it to the top of the social ladder without dying, either under a set time limit or with an infinite amount of time. Get a job, gamble, and interact with others to get by and affect your wealth and karma.
