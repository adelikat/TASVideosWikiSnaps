		"Super Pinball
	]em
	" is a pinball simulation game for the Famicom that released exclusively in Japan. The objective of the game is to get the mahjong tile needed to complete a winning hand for a game. Other than that, you don't actually play mahjong along with pinball. Instead, you gain the tile by beating a series of pinball tables. These tables include a sports car level, a casino level, a 
	[em 
		"Breakout
	]em
	" level complete with movable paddle, and a robot boss battle.
