	[em 
		"Final Fantasy Adventure
	]em
	" is the first game of the 
	[em 
		"Seiken Densetsu
	]em
	" (聖剣伝説) series, but it does contain some classic 
	[em 
		"Final Fantasy
	]em
	" elements. The series is probably best known for the SNES game 
	[em 
		(__wikiLink|displaytext=Secret of Mana|href=/1918M)
	]em
	". This game was later remade on the Game Boy Advance as 
	[em 
		"Sword of Mana
	]em
	". Its gameplay resembles that of a 
	[em 
		"The Legend of Zelda
	]em
	" game, but with level building.

	". He also improves the previous run in this category by 
	(frames|amount=184954)
