	[em 
		"Final Fantasy Adventure
	]em
	" is the first game of the 
	[em 
		"Seiken Densetsu
	]em
	" (聖剣伝説) series, but it does contain some classic 
	[em 
		"Final Fantasy
	]em
	" elements. The series is probably best known for the SNES game 
	[em 
		[a href=/1918M 
			"Secret of Mana
		]a
	]em
	". This game was later remade on the Game Boy Advance as 
	[em 
		"Sword of Mana
	]em
	". Its gameplay resembles that of a 
	[em 
		"The Legend of Zelda
	]em
	" game, but with level building.

	"In this run, 
	(__wikiLink|user:Touch-me)
	" utilizes a glitch to warp across the map, cutting down the completion time by a lot compared to the 
	[a href=/2109M 
		"warpless run
	]a
	". He also improves the previous run in this category by 
	(frames|amount=184954)
	" minutes thanks to a big new warp glitch that allows him to reach the top of the Tower of Gemma early.
