	]em
	" is a card game for the Famicom that was released only in Japan. It is a variant of the falling block puzzle game where you match playing cards by the poker hands they make. If three or more cards make a Flush, Straight or any better poker hand vertically or horizontally, the cards are cleared and you earn money based on the poker hands made. In order to complete a game, all the cards on the board must cleared and a money requirement must be met.
