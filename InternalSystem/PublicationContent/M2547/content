	"A 100% run covering the whole castle is also available 
	[a href=/2661M

	[a href=/2584M 
		"Richter
	]a
	" version. If you want to see a run on Replay mode that can skip many cutscenes, see 
	[a href=/2666M 
		"this run

	". A run with clear save without memory corruption is also available
