		"Maniac Mansion
	]em
	" (1990) is a unique game by LucasArts that has some weird humor and, in the NES version, cool music. It features cutscenes, multiple ways to win, useless items (like Chuck the Plant), and microwavable hamsters. In the storyline, Dave and two of his friends infiltrate the Edison family's mansion in order to rescue Dave's girlfriend. To save her, the teens must get access to the inner lab, deal with Purple Tentacle, shut down the ZOM-B-MATIC, and defeat the evil Meteor.
