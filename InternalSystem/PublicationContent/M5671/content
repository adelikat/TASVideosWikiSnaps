	[em 
		"Echo
	]em
	" is a memory game and one of 52 games that are bundled with the Sega Genesis version of 
	[em 
		"Action 52
	]em
	". It plays just like the electronic toy 
	[em 
		"Simon
	]em
	" and follows the same rules. The game will give you a pattern to memorize and your objective is to input back the pattern to the best of your memory. As the game progresses, it will give longer patterns and give you less time to memorize them.
