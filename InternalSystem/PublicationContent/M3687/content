	" is part of the first generation of games within its famous series, known for having a very large number of beneficial glitches. In fact, the game can be completed in less than one minute of in-game time by save data corruption as shown by 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=this run|href=/2687M)
	", and it can be completed in around 10 minutes using a more "conventional" glitch, as shown by 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=this run|href=/3655M)
	". These runs break the game, and avoid much of the gameplay intended by the developers.
