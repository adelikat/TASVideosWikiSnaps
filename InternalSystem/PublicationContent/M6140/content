		"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

	". It involves a bunch of mediocre rockers who find magic stones that turn them rock star trolls that can outdo the competition. These crystals are coveted by an evil alien race called the Saurians, led by the music-hating Zok, who then invade Earth to find these rock stars, now known as the "Stone Protectors".
