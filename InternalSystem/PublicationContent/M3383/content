		"Sylvester and Tweety in Cagey Capers

	" was the first game to star the iconic Looney Tunes duo. As Sylvester, your goal is to catch Tweety as he moves across the level away from you. The game has a difficulty slider adjusting how hard the canary is to catch. Of course, this TAS slides it all the way up.
