	" (ローゼンクロイツスティレッテ) is a platform game published by independent Japanese studio 
	[em

	".  Gameplay resembles a 
	[em 
		"Mega Man
	]em
	" clone, with Spiritia collecting various weapons from each boss defeated, and alternate protagonist Grolla playing more like Zero from the 
	[em 
		"Mega Man X
	]em
	" and 
	[em 
		"Mega Man Zero
	]em
	" series.
