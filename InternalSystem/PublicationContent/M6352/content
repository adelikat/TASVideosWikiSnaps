		"And Then There Were None
	]em
	", the game revolves around solving the mystery behind the murder of Mr. Boddy/Dr. Black, with six people who were in his mansion at the time named as suspects. The objective is to determine who the culprit is, where the crime took place, and what weapon was used for the murder. Clues are collected by moving around the board and searching the mansion, which then can be used to make a deduction.
