[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Cats 'n' Dogs
	]em
	" is a board game-based video game for the Commodore 64 that was published in the January 1988 issue of the 
	[em 
		"Compute's! Gazette
	]em
	". It is a variation of the game 
	[em 
		"Connect Four
	]em
	", but with the theme of raining cats and dogs. To make things more interesting, there is a Dog Catcher that randomly appears in any spot whenever a cat or dog is dropped. If the Dog Catcher catches a cat or dog, the animal is lost for the turn.
