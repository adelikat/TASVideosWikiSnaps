	" of Jaws, the attack level is upgraded to 3, which is the minimum required to kill Jaws in a single encounter. 30,000 points are needed to get the mini-sub which has double attack power. Because of this, a regular encounter is substituted for a Jaws encounter, so that Jaws can be hit for more points.
