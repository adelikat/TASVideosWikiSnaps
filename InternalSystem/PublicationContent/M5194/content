	" is a unique action puzzle game that released only in Japan. On a grid of active rails are balls of varying colors and railway switches that can be changed on command. The objective of the game is to get the yellow and blue balls to their respective colored seats on the grid. White balls can be used to help the yellow and blue balls get to their destinations. Red balls destroy other balls they touch. Having a yellow or blue ball touch a red ball will fail the level.
