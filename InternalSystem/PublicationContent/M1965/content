	"This is the fifth game of the series originally known as 
	[em 
		"Dragon Warrior
	]em
	" in the US; it remained untranslated until a port to the DS was released in 2008, where it received the name 
	[em 
		"Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride
	]em
	". It tracks the life of our hero, the son of Papas, over a large span of time from his adventurous childhood through tragic adolescence and a joyful marriage as he and his family fight to defeat evil.
