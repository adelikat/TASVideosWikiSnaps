	"This category is especially difficult since Samus does not receive her extra suits until quite late in the run. As a result, most of the gameplay in Norfair is a desperate race against the clock as Samus's health decreases constantly in the heated areas. Needless to say, every single energy tank matters much more than it ever would in a normal run. Also, water areas in Maridia are quite difficult to navigate quickly without the Gravity Suit.
