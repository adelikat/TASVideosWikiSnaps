	" has been adapted to many video game consoles, including the Sega Master System and Game Gear. Like the other versions, the Master System and Game Gear versions are both side-scrolling action games. In fact, they both have identical gameplay. The player controls Aladdin, making his way through a variety of locations, including the streets of Agrabah, the Cave of Wonders, the Sultan's palace and more. Gameplay takes several different forms: some levels are chases, others are standard platforming affairs. There are also several magic carpet rides in the game, in which the level scrolls automatically and the player must make sure to avoid any obstacles in the way.
