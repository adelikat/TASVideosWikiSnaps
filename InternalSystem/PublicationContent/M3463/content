	"This movie contains a newer route and newer strategies which allow for a much faster completion than were possible when the last run was made. Several large glitches in the game are not used in the run, such as the Reverse Bottle Adventure or the Get Item Manipulation glitch. These are avoided because it would make the completion of any dungeon completely arbitrary; they can be seen in an old

	"This TAS is played on the Japanese version of the game. The reason for this is that the text is significantly faster than in the English version, which means that far less time (roughly 12 minutes) is spent waiting for text boxes and cut scenes to end before getting back to the action.
