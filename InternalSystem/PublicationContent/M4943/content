[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Hangman
	]em
	" is a simple guessing game that is usually done on pencil and paper. With a set number of blank spaces representing a word or phrase, you guess which letter appears in that word or phrase. Guess right and the letter appears in one or more of the blank spaces. Guess wrong and a stick figure body part is added to a noose. The game ends when either all spaces are filled or the stick figure is complete.
