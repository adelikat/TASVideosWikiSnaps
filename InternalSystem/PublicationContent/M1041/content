	"As a result, we get a pretty wild mishmash of RoboCop's and Terminator's backstories in a silly plot accompanied by equally silly gameplay. This includes seemingly inescapable bullet sprays, leotard-clad baddies, exploding heads, hidden 1-ups conveniently placed in molten lava, and so on. The sheer frustration RoboCop experiences from all this madness can only be vented by banging his head on a rock!
