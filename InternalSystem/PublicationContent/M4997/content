	" is a video game that was released for the Intellivision in 1987, years after Mattel had stopped supporting the console. Originally conceived as a 
	[em 
		"He-Man
	]em
	" game, it was instead designed as a sequel to the arcade classic 
	[em 
		"BurgerTime
	]em
	". As with that game, you play as a chef in a weird world filled with giant walking food that wants to kill you. Your objective is to kick big balls of edible food off the level and into a plate at the bottom. To stop the killer food from getting you, you can kick the food balls over them or use special peppers that can immobilize them.
