	", you play as Eric, a typical scamp of a schoolboy whose school report is due, and is so bad that his parents can't be allowed to see it. This means retrieving it from the headmaster's safe, by obtaining every piece of the pass-code from the teachers, by hitting each of the shields with your catapult. However, if he gets caught by one of them, he'll have to write several hundreds of lines, which can quickly ramp up if you're not careful.
