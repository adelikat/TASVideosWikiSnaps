	" (ドンドコドン2) is a platforming game for the Famicom that was released only in Japan. It is the sequel to the arcade game 
	[em 
		"Don Doko Don
	]em
	", which was also only released in Japan. In this game, you play as a dwarf that's tasked with collecting the ingredients to an antidote that will turn a recently transformed frog prince back into a human. Featuring the usage of a large mallet and the ability to throw knocked out enemies, the game can be a little reminiscent of 
	[em 
		"Super Mario Bros. 2
	]em
	" and later 
	[em 
		"Mario
	]em
	" games that made more use of Mario's hammer.
