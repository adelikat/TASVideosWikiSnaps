		"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back

	" is a licensed video game adaptation of the movie of the same name. It loosely adapts Luke Skywalker's arc from the movie with some changes to the plot to make it more action-oriented and more successful in his efforts. These changes include Luke getting back to Hoth base alone with his Tauntaun alive, him managing to take down more than one AT-AT and a couple of other AT-STs by himself, and him killing Boba Fett in a dogfight up in the skies of Cloud City.

	" in this run improves upon their previous run by 91 seconds thanks to better strategic use of the Force and a neat glitch that allows Luke's Tauntaun to make midair jumps, allowing them to skip chunks of the first Hoth level in the process.
