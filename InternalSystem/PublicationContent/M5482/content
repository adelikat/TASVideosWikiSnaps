[div class=p 
	[em 
		"The Deepest Sleep
	]em
	" is a point-and-click adventure game by scriptwelder and the third game in the 
	[em 
		"Deep Sleep
	]em
	" game series. It continues from where 
	[em 
		"Deeper Sleep
	]em
	" left off, with you somehow escaping the Shadow Person that cornered you and finding yourself in the "Deepest Sleep", a state of sleep even deeper than the "Deeper Sleep". You must now find a way to escape this perpetual nightmare, even if it means becoming the very thing you fear the most.
