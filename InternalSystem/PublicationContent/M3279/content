		"The Adventure of Little Ralph
	]em
	" (ちっぽけラルフの大冒険) is a Japan-exclusive action platformer for the Playstation. In this game, the player controls Ralph, who has been turned back into a child by the evil demons who have invaded his homeland. In order to stop them and return to his former self, he must get through each area filled with enemies, traps, and many hidden routes. In addition to the typical running and jumping, there are regular boss encounters utilizing the same mechanics as the platforming sections, as well as the occasional Street Fighter style encounter where Ralph doubles in height to defeat the bad guys.
