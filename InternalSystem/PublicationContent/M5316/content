	]em
	" is a promotional video game that was created to advertise the Purina company's Chuck Wagon brand of dog food. It's based off the premise in the commercials made during the 1970s for the dog food, where a dog would chase a miniature chuckwagon that served as the spirit of the dog food itself. The game adapts this premise by having you help the dog navigate a maze to get to the chuckwagon while avoiding obstacles such as a dog catcher and what appears to be a partially intangible dog totem. The game was only available through mail order from the Purina company itself, and any unshipped cartridges were ultimately destroyed by Purina themselves, making it a particularly rare game.
