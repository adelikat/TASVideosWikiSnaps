[div class=p

	" is part of the first generation of games within its famous series, known for having a very large number of beneficial glitches. In fact, the game can be completed in less than one minute of in-game time using save data corruption (as evidenced by 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=this run|href=/2687M)
	"), but this run avoids such techniques in favor of activating an entirely different glitch.
