		"Pokémon: Red Version
	]em
	" is part of the first generation of games within its famous series, known for having a very large number of beneficial glitches. In fact, the game can be completed in less than one minute of in-game time using save data corruption (as evidenced by 
	(__wikiLink|2687M|this run)
	"), but this run avoids such techniques in favor of activating an entirely different glitch.
