	" "the Master", who awakens from his slumber only to find that the human civilization is completely wrecked, and hordes of demons are roaming free. The Master has two roles: to open new locations for humans to inhabit, and to deal with the catastrophes happening there, which usually have something to do with grotesque monsters, as represented in side-scrolling action stages, and to help develop the civilization anew by controlling it during the overhead phases through a bow-wielding cupid who also repels mischievous demons, as presented in the form of an overhead simulation.
