	"Because Peacock the hero is not a very smart hero, he cannot walk and use his arms at the same time (a common video game character disability). Thus he must jump to be able to use his arms. If he is charging a bigger shot when he lands, he forgets to walk for a few frames, so you cannot charge up a shot too early. It's all very delicate.
