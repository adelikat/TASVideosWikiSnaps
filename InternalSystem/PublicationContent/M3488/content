	". Though not as famous as its predecessor, this game has many improvements and new mechanics from the series. Levels are selected from an overhead map and can be replayed. Mickey gains several abilities from levels which are necessary to proceed, such as the ability to shrink himself. Many stages are finished by collecting a star to open the exit door, and there are plenty of puzzles and platforming tricks to keep things entertaining.
