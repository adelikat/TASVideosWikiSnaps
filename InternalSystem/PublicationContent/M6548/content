	[em 
		"Mario's Super Picross
	]em
	" is a puzzle game by the Jupiter Corporation and third game in Nintendo's long running 
	[em 
		"Picross
	]em
	" series. It features a wide selection of nonogram logic puzzles to solve, a good number of which form images of characters from the 
	[em 
		"Mario
	]em
	" franchise. To solve a nonogram puzzle, certain squares on a grid have to be filled in according to numbers on the sides, which dictate how many squares each column and row can be filled in. A row or column having multiple numbers means that there are multiple continuous segments of those lengths that have to be filled in that row or column. To help solve some of these puzzles, the game provides a co-op mode that can allow another player to assist.
