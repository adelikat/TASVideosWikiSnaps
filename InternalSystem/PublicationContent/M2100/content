	"In this game, the second most diabolical evil genius in the universe - The Dark Queen, kidnaps Princess Angelica, and Pimple - a battletoad. Rash and Zitz must save them, by traveling through the most insane multilevel set of plans ever designed. This includes falling down huge shafts, racing through obstacle courses at breakneck speeds, riding on snakes through a massive maze of spikes, passing through a killer ventilation system, navigating through a missile defense system, climbing a never ending revolving tower, and much much more. Along the way, The Battletoads must also face off against an evil army of robots, genetically engineered rodents, to say nothing of The Dark Queen herself.

This run took a glitch found there, and exploited it further, to the point where our heroes are defeated, the game is over, and The Dark Queen in all her evilness just gives up and returns Angelica and Pimple, to go off and hatch an even more evil plan for
