[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Tower of Hanoi
	]em
	" is a puzzle game that dates back to 1883 at the very least when French mathematician Ã‰douard Lucas brought the game to the West. With three rods and a tower of discs on a rod at one end, the goal of the game is to get all of the discs to the rod at the other end while following these rules: 1.) Only one disk may be moved at a time, which then has to be placed on top of another stack or on an empty rod, 2.) No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.
