		"Rescue Time
	]em
	" is an NES homebrew game that takes inspiration from time-travel stories, specifically 
	[em 
		"Back to the Future
	]em
	". The story starts with a genius named Austin using a time machine he built to send his friend Joe into the past. However, he is unable to bring back Joe with the machine himself and decides to send a boy named SJ to the past with a personal time-traveling watch that's powered by NES cartridges. It's now up to SJ to rescue Joe before his watch runs out of power and sends him back to the present.
