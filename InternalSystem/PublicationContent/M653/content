	(__wikiLink|user:Bisqwit's)
	" 5th attempt at this game, about 7 seconds faster than his 
	(__wikiLink|676M|previous attempt)
	". This movie uses Luigi for 1-1 (and still takes the long route), otherwise it is the same route & character choices as previous attempts.  This seems to be the first movie to fully use the ceiling route in 7-2 in the way it is done today.
