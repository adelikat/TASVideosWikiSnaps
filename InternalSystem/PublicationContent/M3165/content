	[em 
		"Osman

	" is a arcade game in the spirit of 
	[em 
		"Strider
	]em
	". It's a very obscure and underrated arcade game, which didn't see much of the light of day, thanks to various issues with the hardware... and the fact that the game is unforgivingly hard. The game never once lets you breathe, and in unassisted play, there are a lot of things to manage at the same time. This, along with the 3 health you start out with, can make clearing with just a single credit a nightmare.
