[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Trio the Punch: Never Forget Me...
	]em
	" (トリオ・ザ・パンチ) is a rather bizarre beat em' up developed by Data East for the arcades. It later saw a port to the PlayStation 2 as part of an arcade compilation called 
	[em 
		"Oretachi Gēsen Zoku
	]em
	". From what can be discerned, there doesn't appear to be any sort of coherent through-line connecting all the levels beyond jumping from one setting to another. You choose a character, go through a level, get some words on the screen, then move on to the next level. These levels often don't follow standard game-play conventions, with bosses appearing at the start of some levels and certain levels having only a few enemies before the end-level boss.
