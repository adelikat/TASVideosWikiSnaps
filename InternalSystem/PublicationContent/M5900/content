[div class=p 
	[em 
		"One Button Vania
	]em
	" is a Flash platformer with one particular gimmick: there is only one button to use to control the character. You play as a knight that's been tasked to save the world from an invasion of monsters led by a mysterious evil. There's one catch to this knight, however: he's constantly walking and he can't control the direction in which he moves. Master the one-button controls as you collect special skills and powerups that you can switch with the press of another button. (The knight can still only use one skill at a time, which is controlled by one button.)
