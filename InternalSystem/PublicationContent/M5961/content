	" is a homebrew platformer for the NES that was released in 2015 for download and 2019 on physical cartridges. You play as a Magic Painter known as Claude, who found himself trapped in a colorless world with nothing but his magic paintbrush. To escape, he must add color to walls, floors, and ceilings while avoiding enemies sent by the mysterious people that trapped him. Adding colors opens doors that will bring Claude closer and closer to returning home.
