	"When you land on your spot, if it is just a regular spot, you play an action game for points, weapons, hearts, etc. If it has a red circle, you spin again. If the space you land on has a red circle connected to another red circle by dashes, you move forward or backwards to the second circle. If the space has a red circle with a question mark in it, you take a pop quiz of three trivia questions then get to select either a key, a heart or move ahead one, two, three or four spaces.

	"When you spin, if you get the book instead of a number, you get a pop quiz of three questions. If you get the happy face, something good happens like move ahead ten spaces, get a key, get a heart, etc. If you get the sad face, something bad happens like lose your turn, move back 1 space and lose your turn, and so on.
