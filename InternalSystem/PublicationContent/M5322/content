		"Plotting

	" in Europe, is a puzzle game that was initially released as an arcade game and was later ported to consoles such as the Famicom and the Game Boy and home computers such as the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. The goal of the game is to clear a grid of full of blocks so that there's only one of each block left. This is done by throwing blocks at other blocks of the same type. If the thrown block hits one of a different type, they switch places and you get the other block.
