	"Using a series of glitches, Keen completes only four stages to get to the end game, only one of which takes any significant length of time, and destroys the Quantum Explosion Dynamo, the core of the Omegamatic in the impossibly short time of 2:02. In the process, he manages to inadvertently prevent the Shikadi from accomplishing their escape (though you have to watch the ending very closely to figure out that this has happened here).
