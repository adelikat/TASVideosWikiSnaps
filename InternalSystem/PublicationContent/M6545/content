[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Arise
	]em
	" is an escape room-style Flash game by Tomylee Inc. It takes heavy inspiration from the 
	[em 
		"Saw
	]em
	" movies and many other cheap horror B-movies. You play an unnamed protagonist who goes into the woods in the middle of the night despite the warnings not to. You get knocked out and later wake up to find yourself in a dank concrete building. The goal is to get out of there without getting killed or being annoyed to death by pop-up monsters.
