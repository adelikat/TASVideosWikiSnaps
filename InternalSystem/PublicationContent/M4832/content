	" is a role-playing game that was originally developed for the Amiga and the Atari ST by Infogrames. An innovative game at the time, it featured an open world that can be explored from a 3D perspective. During the process of being developed for the SNES by Kemco, the story was heavily altered by mistake due to a botched translation job. The original story involves four people who got shipwrecked on the island ruled by the Drakkhen, a race of lizard people that threaten to take over the world. In order to take back the island and save humanity, the four heroes must find the nine gem tears in order to summon the Dragon God that will help them.
