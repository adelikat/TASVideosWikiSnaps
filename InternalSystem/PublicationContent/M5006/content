		"My Friend Pedro
	]em
	" is a platforming-shooter Flash game that was later remade in Unity for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. A mysterious man has found himself in the middle of an alleyway seemingly with no memory what just happened before. A floating, talking magic banana named Pedro then appears and convinces him to kill a bunch of gangsters. To aid the mysterious man, Pedro teaches him that the pills he was forced to take before he became unconscious allow him to slow down his perception of time. With that ability and all the guns he can find, the mysterious man sets off on a rampage for unclear reasons.
