[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Tetris Blast
	]em
	" is a spin on the classic Tetris formula. The new type of blocks, bomb blocks, detonate when they are part of a line that gets completed and destroy the blocks around them. A chain reaction of bomb block explosions or a carefully positioned square of four bomb blocks can take out the entire screen.
