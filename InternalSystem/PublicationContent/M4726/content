	" compared to 
	[em

	" plays the Survival mode on the Chicago level and manages to create a 2:14 (in input time) long run that completely exhausts the stopwatch timer for the mode. This is done by exploiting a flaw in the map where there are zones where the police do not spawn at all, allowing the car to idle right next to a building without being harassed by the cops.
