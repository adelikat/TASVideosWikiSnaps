	"Marble Madness is a 3D'ish game similar in its style to
	$LF
	"Snake Rattle 'n Roll. The objective in these two games is
	$LF
	"quite different, though. In this game, the player must roll
	$LF
	"a marble from point A to point B. This is of course not as
	$LF
	"easy as it sounds. And certainly not as easy as it looks in
	$LF
	"this movie.
