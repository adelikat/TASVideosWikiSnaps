	" for the Sega CD is a licensed side-scrolling beat 'em up that is based on the 1992 movie of the same name.

The main difference from the movie, however, is that Jonathan Harker appears to be more focused on making sure giant spiders, bats, rats, and other critters are not overwhelming him than trying to rescue his fiance Mina Murray from Dracula.
