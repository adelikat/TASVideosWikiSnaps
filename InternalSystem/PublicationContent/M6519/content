		"Congo Bongo

	" is an isometric platforming game that was developed by Sega for the arcades before being ported to many home consoles and computers. It features a safari explorer that's out to catch a wild ape after it set fire to his tent. The only problems are that he is at the bottom of a mountain and the ape is at the top and there are many other animals in the way. None of this will stop the stubborn explorer from getting the revenge he wants, however.
