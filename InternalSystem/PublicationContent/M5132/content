	" is an arcade game developed by Konami that was ported to home consoles such as the Atari 2600 and the Intellivision by Parker Brothers. You play as an ambitious grave robber that's plundering the tomb of Tutankhamun, hoping to find riches and treasures. Unfortunately, there are a bunch of magical curses and wild animals such as dragons that can kill you in one hit. You can shoot them off with your gun, but you can't shoot up or down. You also can only carry one key in a time, and there are multiple locked doors in each level.
