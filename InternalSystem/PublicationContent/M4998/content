		"The Polar Express

	" is a video game for the Game Boy Advance that is based on the movie of the same name. As with many licensed games at the time, it loosely follows the story of the movie, but with a good amount of liberties taken to make it more suitable for a platformer. Witness as a boy boards a train, gets himself into some sticky situations in the North Pole that probably never happened in the movie, and possibly meets Santa Claus?
