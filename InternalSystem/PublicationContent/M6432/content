	[em 
		"Super Mario Bros. Enhanced
	]em
	" is a ROM hack of 
	[em 
		"Super Mario World
	]em
	" that recreates the NES game 
	[em 
		"Super Mario Bros.
	]em
	" under the 
	[em 
		"Super Mario World
	]em
	" engine. Unlike 
	[em 
		"Super Mario Bros. Deluxe
	]em
	", however, 
	[em 
		"Enhanced
	]em
	" is not meant to be as faithful and retains a lot of gameplay elements from 
	[em 
		"World
	]em
	"; Mario can stock up on powerups, previous levels can be replayed, and the spin jump is retained. Nonetheless, all 32 levels from the original 
	[em 
		"Super Mario Bros.
	]em
	" have been faithfully recreated, along with eight original levels unique to this ROM hack.
