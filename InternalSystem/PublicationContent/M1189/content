	"Inspector Gadget is a cartoon series featuring a bumbling cyborg, his clever niece Penny and her super intelligent dog Brain.  Despite his many useful abilities like helicoptering and a hand that comes out of his head, the Inspector must constantly rely upon Penny and Brain to defeat his arch-nemesis Dr. Claw week after week.  However, in this game he must save Penny from several kidnappings without such aid.  In another major departure from the television series, Dr. Claw's face is shown briefly.
