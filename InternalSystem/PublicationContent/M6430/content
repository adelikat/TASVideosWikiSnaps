		"A Nightmare on Elm Street: Son of a Hundred Maniacs
	]em
	" is a homebrew horror game for the NES that was originally made as a PC game in 1999. In this fanmade spinoff of the franchise, you play as sadistic slasher monster Freddy Krueger and your goal is to kill off all the teenagers in town in their sleep. You do this by infiltrating their dreams and killing them in the nightmare worlds you create for them, often playing with them in messed up fashions. However, these kids are not as dumb and helpless as they seem, so better have a keen memory.
