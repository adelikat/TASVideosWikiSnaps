The story is standard fantasy fare where our hero Alen goes on a journey to stop the evil emperor Babilom and the demon god Alcahest from conquering the world. As with many other action RPGs made at the time, it has standard experience point and companion systems and is played from a top-down perspective. Certain characters can join your party as you progress, and you can collect items to help boost your stats.
