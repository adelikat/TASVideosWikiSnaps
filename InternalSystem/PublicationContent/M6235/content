	" is a light gun shooter game that was developed by Nintendo in 1974 for the arcades. It later received a port to the NES in 1985. Taking place in the Wild West, you play as a gunslinger out to get other gunslingers. Each level is a quick draw duel where whoever shoots the other as quick as possible wins the duel. The NES version comes with three modes: Game A where you duel one person, Game B where you duel two people at a time, and Game C where you try to gun down as many outlaws outside their saloon hideout before you get gunned down yourself.
