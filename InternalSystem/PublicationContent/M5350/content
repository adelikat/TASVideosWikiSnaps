		"Batman
	]em
	" is a licensed NES video game adaptation of the 1989 Tim Burton movie of the same name. Here, the hero of Gotham City goes against the villains of Gotham City, the Joker and whatever unfortunate lackey that teams up with him. His fists are more powerful than any weapon in the world, but he rarely kills anyone. It's not like his enemies can hurt him anyway. After all, he's the hero, and heroes are supposed to be invincible. But let's not dwell on that and enjoy the excellent graphics and music by Sunsoft.
