[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Arrow of Death Part 2
	]em
	" is a text-based adventure game for multiple microcomputer systems, including the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. It is the third game in Brian Howarth's 
	[em 
		"Mysterious Adventures
	]em
	" series and the sequel to 
	[em 
		"Arrow of Death Part 1
	]em
	". Continuing where Part 1 left off, you have managed to find all the pieces needed to assemble the Arrow of Death. Now you must actually assemble it with some help and travel the lands so you can find Zerdon and destroy him in order to save the kingdom. Be careful, though. Zerdon may not be alone.
