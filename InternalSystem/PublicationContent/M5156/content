	" is a GBC homebrew platformer where you play as a little green blob in its journey to get the finish flag at the end of each level. Play through 20 levels filled with various platforming mechanics, but do mind the blob's size. Move too much or fall too much without getting to the finish line and the blob shrinks into nothingness.
