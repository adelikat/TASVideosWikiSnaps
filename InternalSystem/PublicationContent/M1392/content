[div class=p 
	[em

	" makes a particularly interesting run as there are many weapons that can be used to increase mobility. However, many of these weapon abilities require the use of the X-Buster upgrade, which is skipped in this movie. In fact, in this movie, 
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/FractalFusion 
		"FractalFusion
	]a
	" does not collect any of X's upgrades! However, he does rescue Zero by fighting three optional X-Hunter battles. This is arguably the hardest set of goals to accomplish in a run of 
	[em
