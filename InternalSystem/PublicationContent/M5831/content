		"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
	]em
	" for the Sega CD is an adventure fighting game and a licensed adaptation of the 1994 movie of the same name. Unlike the movie, the game is entirely in the monster's point of view as he figures out who he is, what he wants, how the populace reacts to him, and why all the animals and people want to kill him. It also has some fighting game-like segments, complete with a health bar, and the usual mechanics to be expected from a 2D fighting game.
