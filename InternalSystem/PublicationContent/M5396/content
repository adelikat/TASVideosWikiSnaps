[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Ooze
	]em
	" is one of 52 games in the infamous multicart 
	[em 
		"Action 52
	]em
	" and one of its premiere titles aside from 
	[em 
		"Cheetahmen
	]em
	". You play as some small guy wearing a green outfit with a pointy hat in a world filled with dripping ooze and moving blobs of ooze. Your goal is to get the end of the level, which is as easy as it sounds except for the last level, which is annoyingly hard either due to bad level design or as a curveball to ensure that you won't get promised prize code for beating the game.

	[em 
		"Ooze
	]em
	" as fast as possible, casually strolling through half of it.
