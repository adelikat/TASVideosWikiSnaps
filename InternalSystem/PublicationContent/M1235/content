	"This game is based on the movie of the same name, although some liberties are taken to give Arnold a chance to punch some hobos with boomerang tophats and go on an even more extended car chase than in the actual movie. There is also some terrible yet strangely hypnotic music. Although normally lag should be avoided as it can slow completion time down, in this case it was often abused to prevent enemies from spawning that could be troublesome.
