		"Contra: Hard Corps
	]em
	" is the only game of the 
	[em 
		"Contra
	]em
	" series released on the Genesis / Mega Drive console. In this game, you get to choose between four characters, each with different abilities and weapons. The Japanese version was chosen because, for some reason, it gives the players a health bar, allowing them to take some damage without dying.
