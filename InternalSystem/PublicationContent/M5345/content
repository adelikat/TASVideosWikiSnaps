	[em 
		"Rockman 2: Yendor Code
	]em
	" is a ROM hack of 
	[em 
		"Mega Man 2
	]em
	" by romhacker Yuki Miyuki. Unlike many romhacks of the game, the graphics and the music essentially remain unchanged. 
	[em 
		"Yendor Code
	]em
	" instead focuses on modifying the special weapons, level design, enemies, and the bosses, making the game slightly harder overall.
