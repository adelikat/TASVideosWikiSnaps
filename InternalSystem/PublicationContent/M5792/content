[div class=p 
	[em

	" is one of many, many space shooters that came with 
	[em 
		"Action 52
	]em
	", the most well-known multicart ever made for the NES. According to the manual, there are space pirates coming towards your home planet, intending to destroy it by causing solar flares and sending shock waves, and it's up to you to stop them. In the actual game, you appear to navigate caverns while avoiding or destroying ships that are heading in the opposite direction. You are not required to destroy any of them throughout the whole game.
