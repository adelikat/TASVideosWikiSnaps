	[em 
		"Super Mario 4
	]em
	" (also known as 
	[em 
		"Super Mario Land 4
	]em
	") is an unlicensed bootleg game, which is a hack of the Game Boy game 
	[em 
		(__wikiLink|2143M|Crayon Shin-Chan 4)
	]em
	", originally by Bandai. The hack changes a large amount of content. The level design is completely different and is the main subject of the game's criticism due to the borderline unfair increase in difficulty when compared to 
	[em 
		"Crayon Shin-Chan 4
	]em
	". The game has four levels, and each of them is incredibly lengthy.
