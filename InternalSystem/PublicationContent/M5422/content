	[em 
		"Action 52
	]em
	". According to the manual, you play as some sort of hairy bigfoot creature named "Fuzzy". His goal is to get to the land of Guru, but there are walking combs, brushes, and hair dryers that are out to get all of his hair. It's up to the player to get Fuzzy to his destination.
