			"Sonic

	]em
	" is a pseudo-fighting game, akin to 
	[em 
		"Super Smash Bros.
	]em
	" from Nintendo. Rather than being 3D side-scrolling, this game employs a 3D isometric view – not a static, sprite-based field though, it is comprised of actual texture-mapped polygons. The character sprites are 2D though, and while you think it wouldn't work – it does.
