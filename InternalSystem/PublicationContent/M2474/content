	[em 
		"Phantasy Star
	]em
	" series, the protagonist, while out on a routine assignment, uncovers evidence pointing to a sinister threat to the entire solar system.

Such a quest would normally take at least ten hours, but with copious amounts of luck manipulation, it can be reduced to just under an hour and a half.
