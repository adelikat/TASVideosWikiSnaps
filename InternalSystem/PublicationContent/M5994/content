[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Same Game
	]em
	" (さめがめ) is a tile-matching puzzle game for the Super Famicom that was released only in Japan. It is an adaptation of the game 
	[em 
		"CHAIN SHOT
	]em
	", which was originally developed by Kuniaki "Morisuke" Moribe for the FM-7 and FM-8 personal computers. The game is simple: with a grid of blocks, the goal is to clear it up as much as possible. To do this, matching blocks that are adjoined are cleared for points. Blocks that were above them then fall down, and columns without blocks are shifted over. More points can be earned by clearing even bigger sets of adjoined blocks.
