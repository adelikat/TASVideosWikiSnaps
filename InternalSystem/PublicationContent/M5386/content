	". The story for the game as described in the magazine goes like this: you play as a fighter pilot in the mineral-rich solar system that is Quolerus fighting aliens known as the Knarbots, who are hoarding Quolerus for themselves and have erected a force field around it. Break through the force field and destroy the Knarbot motherships so that others can mine from Quolerus again without threat.
