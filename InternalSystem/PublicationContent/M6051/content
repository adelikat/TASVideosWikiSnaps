[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Rockman: Install Metal
	]em
	" is an extensive ROM hack of 
	[em 
		"Mega Man 5
	]em
	". Like many other 
	[em 
		"Mega Man
	]em
	" romhacks of similar scope, just about everything is changed: the music, the graphics, the level design, the enemy AI, and even the weapons. The new music includes songs from games such as 
	[em 
		"Live-A-Live
	]em
	", 
	[em 
		"Little Nemo
	]em
	", and 
	[em 
		"Battletoads
	]em
	". Expect settings you wouldn't expect in a 
	[em 
		"Mega Man
	]em
	" game and some subversion of established NES 
	[em 
		"Mega Man
	]em
	" level tropes.
