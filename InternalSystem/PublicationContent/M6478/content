	" ROM hack originally made by Selbi with technical assistance by vladikcomper in 2010, with the latest release occurring 15 years later. Its name is a mix of the word "eraser" and the German word "Scherz" ("joke" in English). It features revamped levels based on the first game's, with a completely changed level order as well as a rather bizarre story line and ridiculous challenges/mechanics.
