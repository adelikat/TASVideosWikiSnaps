[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Do NOT Press The Yellow Switch
	]em
	" is a ROM hack of 
	[em 
		"Super Mario World
	]em
	" by Daizo Dee Von and was part of the 72 Hour Questionable Level Design Contest of 2022. The only playable level is the Yellow Switch Palace, but the game seems oddly insistent that you press the yellow switch. At the same time, the title of the game tells you 
	[em 
		"not
	]em
	" to press the yellow switch. Why is that? In the original game, it makes yellow blocks spawn in place of yellow dotted-line blocks. That should be it, right?
