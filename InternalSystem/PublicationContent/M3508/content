	"In the Metal Gear universe, VR serves as a substitute for combat experience, allowing trainees to learn how to use weapons and participate in advanced combat scenarios without having to actually be on the battlefield, similar to the training programs in

	". This concept of artificial or digital training serving as a poor manâ€™s replacement for combat experience (particularly where child soldiers are concerned) has been a running theme in the series.
