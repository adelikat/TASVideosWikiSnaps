	" was a game developed by SETA set to be released in 1991 for the Nintendo Entertainment System. After SETA folded, a prototype cart was picked up by

	]a
	", who then released it to the public. In this prototype, you take control of a genetically altered super chimpanzee with pro wrestling-style moves and guide him through a hi-tech maze to rescue his adopted family. Why wasn't this released again?
