	"This video game adaptation of 
	[em 
		"Jaws
	]em
	" appears to be based on 
	[em 
		"Jaws: The Revenge
	]em
	", with some elements from the first 
	[em 
		"Jaws
	]em
	" movie. The game has you hunting down the shark as with the second half of 
	[em 
		"Jaws
	]em
	", but it also appears to be set in the Caribbean like with 
	[em 
		"Jaws: The Revenge
	]em
	". Unlike 
	[em 
		"Jaws: The Revenge
	]em
	", you cannot survive being chomped on and dragged underwater by the shark.

	" opts to not die in this run to save time, which would have skipped a bonus stage as he collects shells to power up. The good thing is that by completing the bonus stage perfectly, enough points can be gained quickly enough to get the mini-sub, which can kill the shark more quickly.
