	" is a Super NES video game created by Datam Polystar. It is a hybrid of action and puzzle elements. Each level is a single screen. The first image that the player sees is a landscape, for example, a forest or a town. The image will then fade into a "corrupt" version of the landscape, for example, the trees become rotten and buildings become ruined. Each screen has a "Qualify" target that shows how much of the screen must be cleared before the game continues to the next level. The player can then use the Magical Chalk to section off an area of the landscape, using either the borders of existing cleared sections or the borders of the screen. When a full shape is completed with no holes in its borders, the smaller of the two sections created is "purified" and returned to the original state shown at the beginning of the level.
