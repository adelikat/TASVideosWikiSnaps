		"The Addams Family
	]em
	" (1991) is an extremely difficult game in which Gomez Addams must find his missing family members and recover the family's home from their greedy lawyer, Tully Alford. Gomez must collect US$1,000,000 in order to get through the security door in the basement. The game is very badly programmed; Gomez must avoid objects by a significant distance in order to avoid taking damage.
