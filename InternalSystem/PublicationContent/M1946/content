		"EarthBound

	", also known as 
	[em 
		"Mother 2
	]em
	", is a great RPG, designed by Shigesato Itoi in 1994-1995. It is best described as "random," but in a good way. The game has a great emphasis on humor; indeed, many things in the game are almost caricatured, from subplots to characters. It also has a versatile soundtrack.
