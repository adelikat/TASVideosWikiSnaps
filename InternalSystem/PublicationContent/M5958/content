	" is a sports game that came bundled in the Intellivision 10 video game system, which is part of a series of plug-n-play NES-on-a-chip gaming systems that use the Intellivision name. Unlike many other games on the system, this one doesn't appear to be based on any particular Intellivision game. In 
	[em 
		"Long Drive Golf
	]em
	", you are pitted against a computer-controlled opponent on the driving range, where the goal is to hit the golf ball as far as possible. Whoever drives it the furthest wins the round.
