	". It utilizes a top-down perspective and features a stamina bar as a central gameplay element. You play as a protagonist who has woken up to find themselves stranded on an island filled with resources and zombies. You must collect resources and craft items in order to survive and escape the island. The appearance of zombies seems to hint at something sinister on the island, however.
