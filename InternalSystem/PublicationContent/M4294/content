	" - in fact, it even uses the engine from

	]em
	" (known as 
	[em 
		"Pocky & Rocky with Becky
	]em
	" in the US), which Vast Fame are rumored to have obtained legitimately from its developers. This game's US release was translated as 
	[em 
		"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King
	]em
	", but the movie scenes that appear before each stage are captured from 
	[em 
		"The Fellowship of the Ring
	]em
	".
