	"Due to the highly repetitive nature of this game, the hidden 9th input button (the console's Reset button) is used to enable stage select to warp to the final (12th) level. This results in an unusually long gray screen at the start of the movie. Starting on the final level with 3 lives and only the initial pea-shooter for a weapon normally makes the game near impossible to win.
