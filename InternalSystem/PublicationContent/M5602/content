[div class=p 
	[em 
		"40xEscape
	]em
	" is another game in the escape room Flash subgenre created by Bart Bonte. What's more unique about this one, however, is that you have to escape from the same room 40 times, each time having its own puzzle. The puzzles can get a little more esoteric over time with each successive one. Think you can complete the gauntlet?
