	" is a game about a geeky, cowardly teenager named Lester. After falling asleep next to a cargo crate, he is accidentally loaded onto a ship that then gets hijacked by pirates. Jumping ship with nothing more than a life jacket, Lester lands himself on an island and must now find his way home. But how can such an unlikely nerd trek their way through such dangerous and unknown land? Well, he'll just have to tough it out.
