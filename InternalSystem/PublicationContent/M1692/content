	" and 
	(__wikiLink|user:FractalFusion)
	" plays on the hardest difficulty, Xtreme, and uses both X and Zero. The physics of Zero's sword make it the ideal boss killer, however some bosses have unavoidable invincibility periods, so X is sometimes used to attack during these periods. Some new tricks like duck dashing and saber climbing help save 19 seconds over the previous movie.
