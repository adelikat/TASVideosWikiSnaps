		"ZX Dev MID Remakes
	]em
	" competition.  It takes place in the same universe as the Alien movies created by Ridley Scott.  In this game, you play as a woman awaken from stasis to find her shipmates all dead and the ship overrun by aliens.  As with most Aliens based stories, the AI on the ship has decided that the alien creatures are more important than yourself and is trying to get them back to Earth at all costs.  You are tasked with escaping the ship by running around and activating various terminals to open doors to new pathways through the ship; ultimately leading to the escape pod.
