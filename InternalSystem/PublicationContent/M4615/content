		"Rampart

	" is a tower defense video game from 1990, released on many plaforms including the SNES. Along with the 2/3 player battle modes, the SNES game also contained a more expansive single player campaign with just under 50 levels. The game follows a 3-phase system: battle → repair → place cannons → battle. Failing to build a wall around a castle results in losing a life, where destroying all enemy ships completes the level.
