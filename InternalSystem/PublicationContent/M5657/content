	" is a platforming game with a simple gimmick, an oversized rocket launcher. Luckily, you're immune to its explosions, so it is used in this game as a tool to get from place to place through rocket jumping. The objective of the game is to destroy a number of bombs in each level with the rocket launcher before getting to the exit.
