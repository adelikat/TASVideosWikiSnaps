	]em
	" is a text adventure game that was originally created in 1972 by Gregory Yob and later saw ports to numerous other computer systems, including one for the ZX Spectrum by Wilko Schr√∂ter. The game has you in a pitch-dark and complex cavern filled with rooms that are all connected to each other. In this cavern contains the Wumpus, a monster you are tasked to hunt with a bow and arrow. You must utilize your other senses to figure out where the Wumpus is, lest it catches and kills you or you fall into a bottomless pit.
