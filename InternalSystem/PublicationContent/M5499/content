[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Don't Escape
	]em
	" is a point-and-click puzzle game developed by scriptwelder and the first game in the 
	[em 
		"Don't Escape
	]em
	" series. In this game, you play as unnamed shapeshifting lycanthrope that really doesn't want to kill innocent people. You must use whatever you can find in the house you live in to lock yourself inside and take preventive measures before the full moon goes up and the werewolf in you rises and possibly escapes.
