[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Bloxorz
	]em
	" is a popular logic puzzle game where you roll a 2x1x1 rectangular prism across a board and have it fall down a 1x1 hole on the other side. As the game progresses, it introduces new mechanics such as switch-activated platforms and teleporters that split your prism into 1x1x1 cubes that can roll separately and join back together later. It has since received an official port to HTML5 and unofficial ports to iOS and Android.
