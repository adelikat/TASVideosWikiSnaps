	"My Zelda video is turning out pretty good so far.  I finished the third

	"level today (level 8 in my speed run).  After you see how fast I kill the
	$LF
	"darknuts (enemies that look like knights) in level 8, it will become obvious
	$LF
	"that the comment that battles could have been optimized better won't be
	$LF
	"necessary anymore once my video is on your page :)  I also killed the level
	$LF
	"8 boss very fast.  Also, now that I have the magic key, the other levels
	$LF
	"should go more quickly.  I attached the fmv of what I did so far.  Even if
