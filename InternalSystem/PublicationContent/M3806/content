	"The game has a great emphasis on a humor, and indeed many things
	$LF

	"In contrast to the 
	[a class=intlink href=/3769M 
		"in-bounds run of this game
	]a
	", this run skips most of the plot. There are several major collision detection bugs, including one showing that the Skip Sandwich is a fitting name for the item in ways the developers never intended. The author is able to move around the game's areas freely, completing the bare minimum number of tasks needed to keep the final battle from locking up.
