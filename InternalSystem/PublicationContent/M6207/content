The story is basically the same as the animated movie. Rarity, a princess pony of Unicornia, finds herself in Breezie Blossom after accidentally using a wand that teleports her there. There, she makes friends with the residents there and at Ponyville, including Pinkie Pie, Minty, Rainbow Dash, and Spike. Meanwhile, her friends back in Unicornia venture out to find her.
