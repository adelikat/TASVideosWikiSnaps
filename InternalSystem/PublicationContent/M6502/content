[div class=p 
	[em 
		"dlroW oiraM repuS
	]em
	" is a ROM hack of 
	[em 
		"Super Mario World
	]em
	" made by IsoFrieze. It features the same levels as the base game, except the levels are now in reverse order (i.e. the first stage played is Larry's Castle, and the last stage before Bowser's Castle is Yoshi's Island 1). Notably, the player starts at the end of each stage, and has to make their way back to the start of it.
