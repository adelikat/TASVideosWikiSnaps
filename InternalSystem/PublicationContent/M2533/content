		"Solar Jetman
	]em
	" is a space adventure game where the main excitement comes from the physics of the game. In the game, you explore planets with a small module you fly around, towing fuel tanks and other artifacts back to the mother ship, often from planets with a ridiculous level of gravity and narrow hazardous caverns. Anyone who has played this game surely knows how difficult it can be, while being entertaining for hours after hours.

	"This movie features many changes compared to the previous author's movie, leading to an improvement of about 7 minutes. There's a new warp in the very beginning. A different module is purchased, which lets the player tow wormholes closer to the fuel items you have to collect and allows for some new physics abuse. Some different items are used, such as anti-gravity items. For more details, see the submission comments.
