	"Solar Jetman is a space adventure game where the main excitement comes
	$LF
	"from the physics of the game. In the game, you explore planets with a
	$LF
	"small module you fly around, towing fuel tanks and other artifacts
	$LF
	"back to the mother ship, often from planets with a ridiculous level
	$LF
	"of gravity and narrow hazardous caverns.
	$LF
	"Anyone who has played this game surely knows how difficult it can be,
	$LF
	"while being entertaining for hours after hours.

	"This movie features many changes compared to the previous author's movie,
	$LF
	"leading to an improvement of about 7 minutes. There's a new warp in the
	$LF
	"very beginning. A different module is purchased, which lets the player tow
	$LF
	"wormholes closer to the fuel items you have to collect and allows for some
	$LF
	"new physics abuse. Some different items are used, such as anti-gravity
	$LF
	"items. For more details, see the submission comments.
