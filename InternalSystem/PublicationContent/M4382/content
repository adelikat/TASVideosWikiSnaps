[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Super Contra 7
	]em
	" is a pirate game based off the 
	[em 
		"Contra
	]em
	" series, developed by E.S.C. Co (alias of Waixing) in 1996 for the Famicom. It is likely a hack of either 
	[em 
		"Contra
	]em
	" or 
	[em 
		"Super C
	]em
	", given that the engine appears to be a modified version of the 
	[em 
		"Contra
	]em
	" engine.
