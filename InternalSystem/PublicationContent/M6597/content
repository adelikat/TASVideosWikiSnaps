		"The Lion King

	" is a licensed platforming game that is an adaptation of the Disney animated movie of the same name. It generally follows the plot of the movie, from Simba's cub years to his reclamation of Pride Rock from the evil Scar. Like most licensed games, portions of the movie that don't have much action have been given more to do in the game for gameplay purposes.
