		"Touhou Project
	]a
	" series by Team Shanghai Alice. There are four playable characters: Reimu Hakurei, Marisa Kirisame, Sanae Kochiya, and Reisen Udongein Inaba, each with their unique shot and spellcard (otherwise known as a "bomb" in other (bullet hell) shoot-em-ups). It also features two main game modes: Legacy Mode, which functions similarly to the other Touhou games, but also Pointdevice Mode, a gameplay mode that removes lives and continues from the game but adds chapter checkpoints.

With the help of the Ultramarine Orb Elixir (or not), the girls must now set out to stop this invasion and find the perpetrator behind this incident.
