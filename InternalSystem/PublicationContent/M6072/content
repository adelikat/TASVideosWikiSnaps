	[em 
		"Shin Megami Tensei
	]em
	" and the fourth game in the 
	[em 
		"Megami Tensei
	]em
	" series of video games. Taking place after the "Balance" ending of 
	[em 
		"Shin Megami Tensei
	]em
	", the world is rife with chaos, most of it uninhabitable and overrun by demons. The only place where humans can live is Tokyo Millennium, an encapsulated city run by the Messians. In this Western-style JRPG, you play as Hawk, an amnesiac gladiator who fights to win a life of luxury in the demon-free center-district. He will soon learn about his destiny as he learns about the prophesied savior of the human race, the people that run Tokyo Millennium, and a dilemma involving both angels and demons that threaten the world.
