	[em 
		"Mega Man ZX
	]em
	" is the first 
	[em 
		"Mega Man
	]em
	" platformer on the DS. It is also the first 
	[em 
		"Mega Man
	]em
	" game to have the choice of a male or female protagonist (the latter is used in this run). Unlike previous 
	[em 
		"Mega Man
	]em
	" series, this series features a new system where the protagonist is actually a humanoid who changes forms using different biometals (collected mostly from bosses).
