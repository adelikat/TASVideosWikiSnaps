	"Mega Man ZX is the first Mega Man platformer on the DS.  It is also the first Mega Man game to have the choice of a male or female protagonist (the latter is used in this run). Unlike previous Mega Man series, this series features a new system where the protagonist is actually a humanoid who changes forms using different biometals (collected mostly from bosses).
