	" was a game released for the Atari 2600. In it, you play as an explorer named Pitfall Harry. As you travel through the jungle, your goal is to collect all 32 treasures hidden throughout the world within the time limit the game gives you (which is 20 minutes). You also have only 3 lives while exploring the game, and touching an enemy or falling into a tarpit or water will cost you a life. If you die three times, it's game over for Pitfall Harry, and the game offers no continues.
