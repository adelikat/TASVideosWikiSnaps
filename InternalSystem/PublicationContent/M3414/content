	"This movie of 
	[em 
		"Sonic Advance
	]em
	" is unique as a speedrun in one aspect: Sonic moves so fast that the "camera" of the game cannot even
	$LF
	"follow him. Therefore, he is rarely seen in the movie.

[p 
	"On the rare occasions we get to watch Sonic, we get to enjoy seeing him
	$LF
	"moving through walls, charging up for another dash, or making short work of bosses.

	"Besides the super fast speed itself, the speed also provides Sonic an ability
	$LF
	"(glitch) to pass through platforms and walls under certain conditions.

	"While this movie appears to be around 3 seconds slower than the 
	[a href=/1665M 
		"previous movie
	]a
	", it is in fact faster. This is due to more accurate emulation and also including the GBA boot sequence.
