		"Overclocked

	" is a very short and superficially simple homebrew NES platformer that was developed for the ByteOff! 2020 Game Jam. You control a mouse cursor, and your goal is to get to the floppy disk on the other side of the level. A second player can also control the floppy disk itself and both of you can work together to make contact. However, if you or the second player doesn't move in a certain way the game dictates, both of you will be reset to your starting positions. Sounds frustrating, doesn't it?
