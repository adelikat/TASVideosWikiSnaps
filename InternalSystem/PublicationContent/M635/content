	"As for the movie itself... it was Arc's second TAS of this game, and the first version that was published. In subsequent versions, more and more special attacks which do double damage were used to defeat the bosses, but in this first published version, only regular attacks were used. Also peculiar to this run is that damage was taken at places where it could have been avoided without losing time, while damage was avoided where taking damage would have saved time.
