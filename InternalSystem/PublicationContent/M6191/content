		"Pop'n Tanks!

	" is a tank combat game that was released only in Japan. It was published by Enix and features character designs from manga artist Mine Yoshizaki, which were incorporated into the animated cutscenes. A notable feature it has is its rather expansive tank customization, featuring over 250 parts to exchange and swap out, including various long-range and short-range weapons like flamethrowers. Its combat, in addition to the standard tank capabilities, also gives you the ability to jump and stomp on your enemies. The Story Mode has you choose between eight characters, each with their own backstories, and fight against a bunch of other competitors for various reasons, from the friendly to the petty.
