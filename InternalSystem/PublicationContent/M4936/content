	" is an NES homebrew game made for the 2019 NESmaker Byte-Off Competition. It has a simple setting of two guys finding a cave that leads to an underground maze full of gems and monsters. They must then collect as many gems as they can under a time limit, avoid (or kill with a special item) any monsters along the way, and go back the way they came.
