	"George Jetson was about to run out to work when his pal Captain Zoom appears out of thin air. Zoom tells him that Zora, the leader of SPREE ("Space Pirates Reveling in Evil Enterprises"), is planning on looting this solar system of all its resources! Unfortunately, in his last encounter with Zora, Zoom has used up all his strength and now he is powerless, so he asks George to take over. He gives George his Pneumo Osmatic Precipitator (or P.O.P.) and bids him good luck. Can George save his family and this galaxy?
