	" is a somewhat darker sequel to the original game involving Vectorman, an "Orbot" (robot made of orbs) whose task is clean up the pollution that covers the Earth. In this game, Vectorman's sludge barge suddenly gets blasted down by a missile. He escapes and ends up in a mysterious research facility infested by mutant insects led by the horrendous Black Widow Queen, whose plan is to take over the Earth and kill all humans, as expected.
