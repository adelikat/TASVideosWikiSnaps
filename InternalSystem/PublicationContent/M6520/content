	" is a ROM hack of 
	[em 
		"Metroid: Zero Mission
	]em
	" that was initially designed to demonstrate a specific romhacking tool for the game. It was later polished up to be a solid romhack in its own right and released on April 1st where the joke is that the Easy Mode was made to be very easy for a specific person in the Metroid Construction community. It features lots of custom music and textures, well-made puzzles, and a couple of modifications to Samus's weapons.
