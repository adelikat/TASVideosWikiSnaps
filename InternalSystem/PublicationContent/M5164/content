	" is a video game that's very loosely based on the movie of the same name. While the movie has Kevin McCallister defending his house from the Wet Bandits, in this game, he must avoid them from capturing him while saving the other houses in the neighborhood from being totally robbed and damaged by them. And it appears his neighbors have some really weird stuff in their houses, yet Kevin, Harry, and Marv can break into them no matter what security systems they have.
