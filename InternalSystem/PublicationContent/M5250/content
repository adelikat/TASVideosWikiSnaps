	" is a simple homebrew skateboarding game for the Game Boy Color. It is an autoscroller with two modes that differ in their controls. Challenge mode has you jumping over obstacles and pits, and any crash will cause you to explode into a bloody mess. Freestyle mode gives you the freedom to perform a number of skateboarding tricks, and the only way to fail a level is to fall into a bottomless pit.

	" collaborate to complete all 19 levels in Challenge mode as fast as possible. The 20th level is a killscreen where you immediately fall into a bottomless pit at the start and is considered the end of Challenge mode.
