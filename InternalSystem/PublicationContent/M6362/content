[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Tents and Trees
	]em
	" is homebrew game for the Channel F and a variation of a nonogram logic puzzle. Like with a normal nonogram, each row and column has a number that dictates how many tents can be in those rows and columns. 
	[em 
		"Tents and Trees
	]em
	" adds an additional rule where each tent must be directly next to a tree.
