	[em 
		"Pringles
	]em
	" is a simple unlicensed homebrew game starring an older version of the 
	[em 
		"Pringles
	]em
	" mascot, complete with the hair and proper shading. In a world full of 
	[em 
		"Pringles
	]em
	" chips, 
	[em 
		"Pringles
	]em
	" cans, and gigantic ingredients, the goal is to get the 
	[em 
		"Pringles
	]em
	" mascot to the exit by eating 
	[em 
		"Pringles
	]em
	" chips, which boost the mascot upwards with each chip. Higher rankings for each level is achieved by going the longest in the air without touching the cans.
