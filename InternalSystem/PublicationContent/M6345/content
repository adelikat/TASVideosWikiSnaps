		"Sailor Moon
	]em
	". In this game, you choose from one of the Sailor Senshi and duke it out with the rest of them in a competition to see who gets to be the leader of the Sailor Senshi. In addition to every character having their own strengths and quirks, each player gets to allocate a number of point to boost the stats of their chosen character, adding more depth into strategizing for fights.
