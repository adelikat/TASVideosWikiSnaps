[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Omega Race
	]em
	" is a shoot 'em up that initially developed by Midway for the arcades and later ported early systems such as the Commodore 64, Atari 2600, and the ColecoVision. Taking place in the far future of 2003, you control an "Omegan Fighter" spaceship that's tasked with destroying enemy droid ships. Using controls and having graphics similar to 
	[em 
		"Asteroids
	]em
	", you use your thrusters to get around and shoot down all the ships and mines on the screen.
