[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Star Duel
	]em
	" is yet another space shooter bundled in the Sega Genesis version of 
	[em 
		"Action 52
	]em
	". This game looks and plays similarly to 
	[em 
		"Asteroids
	]em
	", featuring triangular ships that can fire and have thruster. Unlike that game, this is a two-player combat game where both ships are faced off against each other. Whoever can destroy the other ship wins the round. The person with the most rounds won wins the game.
