	[em 
		"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2: Battle Nexus
	]em
	" is an action platforming game for the Game Boy Advance that was developed by Konami, and is the second game to be based on the 2003 version of the 
	[em 
		"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
	]em
	" cartoon. Unlike the other games of the same name that were released at around the same time, which were 3D beat 'em ups, this version is a 2D action platformer with stealth and shoot 'em up segments. And unlike the 3D beat 'em up versions, this version doesn't appear to have any sort of story arc, with the turtles going around the world and in space defeating bad guys.
