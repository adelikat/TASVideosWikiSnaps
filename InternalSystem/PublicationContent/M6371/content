		"Lunar Pool

	", also known as 
	[em 
		"Lunar Ball
	]em
	" in Japan, is a billiards simulation game for the NES. Taking aspects from mini golf, the game has you play billiards on a variety of different-shaped pool tables, The goal in each table is to pocket all the numbered balls by hitting them with the cue ball. There is also a friction setting that determines how fast the ball decelerates as it travels, with a friction setting of 0 making it so that a ball will only slow down if it hits another ball.
