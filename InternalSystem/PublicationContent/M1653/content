	"This Star Wars game is quite versatile. It features a sort of overworld, optional items and quests, a lot of platformer action, some first-person spaceship shooting and you even get to blow up the Death Star! You can't see all of that in this movie, but it's very entertaining nonetheless. The game's plot is based on the first
