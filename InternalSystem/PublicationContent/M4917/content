[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Dark Cut
	]em
	" is a Flash game that appears to have been inspired by the 
	[em 
		"Trauma Center
	]em
	" series. Instead of using modern medicine technology, you are in the Middle Ages performing surgery with whatever tools and rudimentary knowledge they had at the time. Thankfully, this game gives you instructions on what to do. Do them right and the patient is good as new. But be cautious of who you treat.
