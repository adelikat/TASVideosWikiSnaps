	" is a platformer puzzle game released for the Genesis / Mega Drive in 1994. It is an entirely different game from the SNES version of the same name. After going around to collect various props from the studio to open up a hip culture shop, Pinky and the Brain plot their newest plan for world domination. They will take the items the Warners acquired to achieve this, but not if the Warners have anything to say about it.
