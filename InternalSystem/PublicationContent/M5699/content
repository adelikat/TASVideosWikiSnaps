	[em 
		"Metroid: Zero Mission
	]em
	" that is themed around Halloween and is the winner of Metroid Construction's 2017 Fall Contest. All of the levels are entirely new and most of the graphics have been replaced with either original ones or graphics inspired by games like 
	[em 
		"Super Mario World
	]em
	" and the GBA 
	[em 
		"Castlevania
	]em
	" games. It also has a few tweaks to the original gameplay like the addition of a tractor beam power up from the 
	[em 
		"Metroid Prime
	]em
	" series.
