		"Jumpman Junior
	]em
	" is a game developed by Randy Glover, who described it as a "lite" version of 
	[em 
		[a class=extlink href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumpman rel=nofollow 
			"Jumpman
		]a
	]em
	" containing 12 levels for users without disk drives. In it, you need to defuse all of the bombs placed on Jupiter by terrorists. To do this, you must climb up ladders, touch the vines, and, of course, jump.

		"Note

	": The character should not be confused with Mario, who was originally named Jumpman. Interestingly enough, Glover cited 
	[em 
		[a href=/Game/nes-donkey-kong 
			"Donkey Kong
		]a
	]em
	" as inspiration for this game. It is not known whether the naming is a coincidence or not.
