	[em 
		"Darkwing Duck
	]em
	" (1992) is a platformer somewhat similar to 
	[em 
		"Mega Man
	]em
	" in gameplay and difficulty. The arrow gun allows the player to climb up walls and use creative shortcuts so that the absolute shortest route can be taken. In case you are wondering why the character keeps on jumping so much, it is because he has to wait a short amount of time before being able to walk. With constant jumping these stops can be avoided.
