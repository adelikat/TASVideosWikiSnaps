[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Super Mario Bros. Special: 35th Anniversary Edition
	]em
	" is a ROM hack that effectively ports over 
	[em 
		"Super Mario Bros. Special
	]em
	" to the 
	[em 
		"Super Mario Bros.
	]em
	" engine on the NES. Every level has been recreated and various items and enemies such as the Hammer and Sidesteppers were added. The only things not recreated are the noticeably different jumping physics and the screen-by-screen scrolling that were present in the original game.

	" all improve on their previous run by 2.16 seconds thanks to better optimizations involving framerules. Unlike most 2D Mario games, 
	[em 
		"Super Mario Bros. Special
	]em
	" didn't have any warps, and this was faithfully kept in this romhack. This means that every level has to be completed.
