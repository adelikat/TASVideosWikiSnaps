		"Daymare Cat: 10-year Anniversary

	" is a remastered version of the Flash platformer

		"Daymare Cat
	]em
	". The game now runs at 60 fps, the platforming mechanics have been tweaked, and parts of the art style have been updated, most notably Cat's walking animation. The story and levels themselves are almost exactly the same as in the original game, with an optional shortcut added that bypasses having to enter a cosmic monster to further proceed in the game.
