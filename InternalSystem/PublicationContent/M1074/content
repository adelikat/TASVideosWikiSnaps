	"This Super Metroid 
	[a class=intlink href=/1686S 
		"movie by Cpadolf
	]a
	" aims for in-game time, making use of the fact that the in-game timer is stopped during 
	[a class=intlink href=/SuperMetroidTricks.html#MechanicsOfTheInGameTimer 
		"certain events
	]a
	". It's 25 seconds slower than 
	[a class=intlink href=/793M 
		"Hero of the day's Super Metroid any% TAS
	]a
	" in real time, but completes the game in 24 minutes and 4 seconds by its timer.
