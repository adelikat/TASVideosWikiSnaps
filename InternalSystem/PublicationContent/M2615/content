	"This TAS runs through the Master Game mode of 
	[em

	" on the Sega Saturn. While the basic gameplay is very similar to any game in the 
	[em

	]em
	" series (especially the

	"  
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=runs|href=/1464M)
	" 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=found|href=/1777M)
	" at TASVideos), there are some key differences in this run. Rather than having multiple themed worlds with a boss at each, there is one temple with 20 floors and a boss after every four floors. More importantly, though, many important powerups are lost after each floor in the Master Game mode. This means the player needs more creative routes for laying bombs to get the fastest time.
