[div class=p 
	[em 
		"the classroom
	]em
	" is a Flash game where the objective is to cheat on your test by copying the answers off of the classroom geek. Sounds easy enough, but the teacher is keeping a vigilant eye on the students, and the geek often sits in seats that can be far away from you. And there may be something dysfunctional about the school you're attending. At least you have eidetic memory to make cheating easier.
