	[em 
		"Mon Mon Monster
	]em
	" is a platforming game that was released only for the MSX computer system and a different take on 
	[em 
		"Frankenstein
	]em
	". Instead of Victor Frankenstein only creating one monster and destroying another before it was complete, he manages to create both the classic monster, given the name "Franken", and another completely different monster known as "Megard" (メガルド). Neither a lumbering simpleton nor an eloquent outcast angry at the world, Franken is compassionate and cares about the state of mankind. In contrast, Megard turns out to be a demonic being that wants to create an army of monsters and devour all of mankind. Finding them a hindrance, Megard killed Victor Frankenstein and banished Franken from his castle. Franken must now go back and save the world from Megard and his demonic army.
