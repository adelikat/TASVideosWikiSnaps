[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Pokémon: Blue Version

	" is part of the first generation of games within its famous series, known for having a very large number of beneficial glitches. In fact, the game can be completed in less than one minute of in-game time by save data corruption as evidenced in the 
	[a class=intlink href=/1860M 
		"run of the Yellow Version
	]a
	", and it can be completed in under half an hour using a more 'conventional' glitch, as shown by the 
	[a class=intlink href=/2457M 
		"other run on the Blue Version
	]a
	". These runs break the game, and avoid much of the gameplay intended by the developers.

For more details about the techniques used in this run, and for their definition of what constitutes a light glitch, as always, please read the
