	" is part of the first generation of games within its famous series, known for having a very large number of beneficial glitches. In fact, the game can be completed in less than one minute of in-game time by save data corruption as evidenced in 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=this run of the Yellow Version|href=/4329M)
	", and it can be completed in ten minutes using more "conventional" glitches, as shown by the 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=other run on the Blue Version|href=/3901M)
	". These runs break the game, and avoid much of the gameplay intended by the developers.

For more details about the techniques used in this run, and for their definition of what constitutes a light glitch, as always, please read the
