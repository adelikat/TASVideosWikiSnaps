	" is a fast-paced platformer for the PICO-8 fantasy console developed by rarelikeaunicorn. It follows the journey of Astra, tired of being picked on for being the smallest star in Constellation Station, and as such, she goes on an adventure in order to build her own constellation. The game also features a collectable in the form of stardust, which are spread across the 15 stages of the game.
