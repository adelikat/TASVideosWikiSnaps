The player takes on the role of a young adventurous man named Monobe who is searching for the past of his people. He is equipped with an arm-mounted device called an "e-rad" and what is believed to be magic armor. These devices allow Monobe to project energy bolts and create energy ropes to swing on, in addition to basic fighting skills, running, jumping, and rolling. The player must use his skills and his devices to traverse the many strange lands of the game.
