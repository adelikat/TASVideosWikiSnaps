	", or The Legendary Starfy, is a platform game developed by TOSE and published by Nintendo. The story is that a cute little star named Starfy accidentally releases a powerful demon from a magic jar. The demon, Ogura, then takes over Starfy's home in the cloud-kingdom of Pufftop and causes a storm which knocks Starfy into the water below. With the help of some new water-abilities and new friends, Starfy journeys to return to Pufftop and seal Ogura away once again.
