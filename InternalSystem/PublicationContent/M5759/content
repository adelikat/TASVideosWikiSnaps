	[em 
		"Lava 16K
	]em
	" is a homebrew platformer that was originally developed in 2014 using the BASIC programming language and under the name 
	[em 
		"Lava
	]em
	". It was later recreated in 2021 using the Z80 assembly language, making it load and run much faster than before. In 
	[em 
		"Lava
	]em
	", your main objective is collect a number of orbs in each level, using either your crab walker to get around and your jetpack to get to hard-to-reach places. The jetpack has a limited fuel supply that can be replenished by collecting fuel packs. Be careful, as monsters lurk around every corner and the lava can catch you by surprise.
