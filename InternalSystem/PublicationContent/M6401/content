	" is an action strategy game that was developed in 1989 for the DOS computer platform. Taking place in the era of Feudal Japan, you start off the game as a lowly samurai doing the bidding of his lord. Your goal is to rise up the ranks of the hierarchy by any means necessary, whether it be through more conventional methods such as creating political relationships with others or with dirty methods like killing your way to the top. As you rise, however, the responsibilities get heavier and your enemies start playing dirtier. Dominating all others soon no longer becomes an option. Be careful, as there are very limited ways to continue the game should you die. Your life may be your last.
