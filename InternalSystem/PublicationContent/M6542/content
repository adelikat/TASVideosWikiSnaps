	[em 
		(__wikiLink|displaytext=The Big Adventure of Owata's Life|href=/4293G)
	]em
	" among other things. Described as a "masocore" game, it features unexpected traps designed to take the player (as "The Kid") by surprise, thus relying on trial and error to get past them. It also features a lot of sprites and music taken from other games. The plot is also straightforward, as "The Kid" simply sets off on an adventure to become "The Guy".

Note that the input file extends past the credits, as there's one final apple that needs to be dodged, as it triggers a Game Over otherwise.
