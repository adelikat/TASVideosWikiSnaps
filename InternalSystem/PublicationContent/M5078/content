	" is an extensive ROM hack of 
	[em 
		"Mega Man 2
	]em
	" that adds gameplay mechanics borrowed from the 
	[em 
		"Mega Man X
	]em
	" series and puts you in the shoes and point of view of a different protagonist. You play as Mega Man CX, an evil clone of Mega Man that may or may not have been created by Dr. Wily. Your goal is to take down Dr. Light and all of his Robot Masters, including Mega Man, and stop them from stopping Dr. Wily. There are also lots of references to other video games and even TV shows such as 
	[em 
		"Kamen Rider
	]em
	". See if you can list them all!
