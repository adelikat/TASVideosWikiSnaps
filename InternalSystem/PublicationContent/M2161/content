[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Clu Clu Land
	]em
	" is an odd Nintendo puzzle game in the same vein as the old PC game 
	[em 
		"Clockwerx
	]em
	". The goal of the game is to uncover patterns of golden ingots buried under the ground by passing over them. You do this by moving your character to the pegs and having her grab onto and spin around them.
