	[em 
		"Q Boy
	]em
	" is an unlicensed game created and released by Sachen in 1994. Dr. Mouse has stolen the Flower of Dream and has terraformed the planet Phantom for his own nefarious purposes. Q Boy must now travel to the four ends of the world to look for the Flower of Dream and defeat Dr. Mouse and his associates. Despite the similarities to games like 
	[em 
		"Kirby
	]em
	" and 
	[em 
		"Mega Man
	]em
	", it is a completely standalone game.
