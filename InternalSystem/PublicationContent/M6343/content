		"Elevator Action
	]em
	". It was released to the arcades 11 years after the first game and was later ported to the Sega Saturn as a Japanese-only release. The premise takes inspiration from more recent action movies and other video games. You play as member of the counter-terrorist team DEF, and your mission is to foil the plans of an international terrorist organization led by Red Suit. These plans range the gamut from kidnapping the loved ones of important world leaders to stealing and using nuclear weapons, all to incite a worldwide revolution against the old world order.

	"The gameplay greatly expands on what was established in the first game. While the game still focuses on getting to certain doors and entering them, there's now more emphasis on combat. You can now wield more weapons and uses parts of the environment other than elevators such as oil drums and electric fences to defeat your opponent. There are now three characters to choose from, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, and a two-player mode to make things more interesting.
