	" (オー!バキューン) in Japan, is a shooting game developed by Raizing and published by Namco for the PS1 in 2000. A lightgun is used to complete a series of mini-games, done by firing at on-screen targets in which an objective must be reached. Unique to the PS1 version is the Adventure mode, which puts a higher emphasis on exploration, with the completion of mini-games giving item rewards in order to progress in the haunted mansion.
