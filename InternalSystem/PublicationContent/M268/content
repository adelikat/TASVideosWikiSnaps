		"Resurrection of Hitler: Top Secret
	]em
	" (ヒットラーの復活) is the original (Japanese) version of 
	[em 
		"Bionic Commando
	]em
	". It is a platform game with a hero who can't jump but can quickly latch onto objects with his bionic arm. One can guess from the game's title that the hero's objective is to end the Nazi's efforts to resurrect Adolf Hitler.
