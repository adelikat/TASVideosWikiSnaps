	" is a licensed isometric platforming game that's loosely based on the Disney animated movie of the same name. As with many other video game adaptations of movies, this game only takes parts of the plot that would serve the game design. For this one, it's the premise of one Jim Hawkins going off on an interstellar quest to look for the fabled treasure of Captain Flint. The fact that Jim is part of the crew of the Legacy is somewhat glossed over as he goes off on his own to go solar surfing and do some platforming.
