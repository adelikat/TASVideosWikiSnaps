	" fighting game and was later changed to being a homage to that game due to the developers being unable to secure the rights to

	"'s characters. The gameplay is tag team based, where players choose two characters and switch between them midfight when needed. The character not in use will have their health slowly regenerated. Combos can be performed with both characters at once for extra damage.
