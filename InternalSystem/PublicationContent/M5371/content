	" is a homebrew puzzle game for the Sega Genesis starring a guy named Hara who finds himself on a series of islands up in the clouds every day he wakes up. He wishes to break this cycle and travels from island to island for a solution. To travel the islands, he must place red crystals on altars which will spawn keys that are needed for travel. Along the way though, there will be obstacles Hara will encounter that will make it harder to get those keys. Luckily, he has a special pathing ability to that allows him to get around those obstacles.
