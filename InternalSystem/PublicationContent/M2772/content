	" is a game released only in Germany that's based on a Danish call-in game show for kids. It includes six levels (one of them is exclusive of this version) which are directly based on mini games from the TV show. The goal is always to both survive and collect as many money bags as possible. The amount of required bags to beat a level depends on the chosen difficulty level.
