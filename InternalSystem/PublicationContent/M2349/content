		"Sega Galaga
	]em
	" is the only port of the classic arcade game that has a different name. It is effectively a completely different game than the arcade version. While the basic concept is the same, this version has simplified sound and rules, no challenge modes and all of the waves are identical, although the enemy movement increases and decreases in cycles reaching the fastest speed at level 35.
