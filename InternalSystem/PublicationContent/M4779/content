		"AlterEgo
	]em
	" is a puzzle platforming homebrew game that was originally made for the ZX Spectrum. You play a character that has a phantom alter ego that moves in mirrored fashion with them, either vertically or horizontally. This character can switch place with their alter ego to get around obstacles, but a limited number of times. The goal of the game is to collect items needed to complete the level while avoiding hazards along the way.
