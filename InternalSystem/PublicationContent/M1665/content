	"Note: There are two encodes available for download; the first one is the original version, and the second one is a comparison encode: you can see the original version to the left, and what you see to the right is something made with a special emulator, hacked to force the game's camera to focus on Sonic, making it much easier to follow what Mukki is doing with him. The second YouTube stream displays these views side-by-side as well.
