	" in Europe (not to be confused with the game of the same name for the Sega Master System), is a space shoot 'em up for the Sega Game Gear. The story takes place in the far future, where Earth is now protected by a number of armored defensive satellites. An unknown object the size of the moon has attached itself to one of these satellites and has taken control of it. Space pilot Alice Waizen was testing a prototype GG Aleste II ship when she is alerted about the alien threat and is tasked to stop it.
