	" is a good-looking platform game with some autoscrolling parts where the player gets to control a car. The game is great fun to play because of its sharp and accurate controls, and also because of its nice graphics.

	"The run itself is very entertaining. Even if you haven't played the game, the game's fast pace guarantees that you won't get bored watching this movie.
