[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Rayman 3
	]em
	" is the third game of the 
	[em 
		(__wikiLink|displaytext=Rayman|href=/GameGroups/51)
	]em
	" series. It was originally developed to be the GBA version of 
	[em 
		"Rayman 2
	]em
	", which is why the plot mostly centers around 
	[em 
		"Rayman 2
	]em
	"'s plot. Globox swallows a Dark Lum, so Rayman goes out to find a cure. However, Admiral Razorbeard attempts to get the Dark Lum out of Globox to make himself more powerful. Rayman must now get a cure for Globox while also stopping Admiral Razorbeard's plans.

[div class=p 
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/NinjaCocktail 
		"NinjaCocktail

	" improves on their previous run by 25.13 seconds thanks to a new glitch that allows Rayman to turn invisible and walk through locked doors to collect the required Lums at the expense of the camera not focusing on Rayman himself.
