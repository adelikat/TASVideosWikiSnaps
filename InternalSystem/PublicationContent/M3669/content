		"Zool: Ninja of the "Nth" Dimension
	]em
	" is a fast-paced side-scrolling platformer. The protagonist can run, jump, climb walls, and shoot enemies. Power-ups for Zool are scattered across the levels. These include life-spending hearts, smart bombs, shields, more powerful jump-skills and a twin Zool. This "twin" imitates the original's motions a few seconds after he performs them.
