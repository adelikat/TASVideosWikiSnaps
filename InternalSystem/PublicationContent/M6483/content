	" is a platforming game for the Sega CD that was developed and published by Sega. The hero in this strange game is the titular Wild Woody, an anthropomorphic pencil that can erase enemies with his butt and draw items that he can use to help himself out in a pinch. This pencil was brought to life by a powerful totem head that tasks him to find the other totem heads that he's a part of so they can be brought back together and put the universe back to normal from their reality warping shenanigans.
