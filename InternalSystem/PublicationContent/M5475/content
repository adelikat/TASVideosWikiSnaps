		"Compute's! Gazette
	]em
	". You play as a gunslinger in a saloon and your objective is to gain as many points as you can by shooting down filled mugs filled with beer until time runs out. You have a limited number of bullets and the only way to get more bullets is to shoot playing cards in a specific order. There are also desperados that can steal bullets from you unless you shoot them down and rats that you can shoot for extra points.
