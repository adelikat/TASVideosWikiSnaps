	[em 
		"The Zombie Manor
	]em
	", is a homebrew NES from the same developer that gave you the 
	[em 
		"KUBO
	]em
	" series and 
	[em 
		"SkateCat
	]em
	". You play as a tanuki that's on a quest to get his special magic item in an abandoned mansion in order to undo a curse. However, it is full of zombies and and other classic horror creatures, and you don't have any weapons to fight them off with. You must use your surroundings to fight them off and get your magic item back.
