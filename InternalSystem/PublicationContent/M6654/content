[div class=p 
	[em 
		"DK: King of Swing Remix
	]em
	" is a ROM hack of the puzzle-platforming game 
	[em 
		"DK: King of Swing
	]em
	", which itself is a spin-off of the 
	[em 
		"Donkey Kong
	]em
	" series. It adds a a whole set of new levels and allows characters other than Donkey Kong to play them, unlike the original game. As with the original game, the gameplay is similar to 
	[em 
		"Clu Clu Land
	]em
	" in that you control Donkey Kong with very simple controls as he climbs and swings up poles and get him to the finish line.
