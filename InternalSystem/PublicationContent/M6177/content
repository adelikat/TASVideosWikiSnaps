		"Kirby's Dream Land
	]em
	" is a classic platforming game for the Game Boy and the first game in the long-running 
	[em 
		"Kirby
	]em
	" franchise. As it is the first game, it lacks certain established elements, most notably Kirby's signature ability to gain the abilities of the characters he eats. In the magical place known as Dream Land, the self-appointed King Dedede has stolen all of his subjects' food for a midnight feast. Kirby now bravely sets out to stop the gluttonous penguin and recover the food.
