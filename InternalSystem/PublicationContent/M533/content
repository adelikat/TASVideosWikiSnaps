	"Dragon Warrior is an epic RPG series which now spans 8 games across many systems.
	$LF
	"The second game greatly expands on the first to include a party of three heroes
	$LF
	"(all descendents of Erdrick and the hero of DW1) and battles that may include
	$LF
	"many enemies.
	[br

	$LF
	"The world is much bigger and there are many big dungeons to explore as well.
	$LF
	"Luckily there are new abilities and items to make this easier.
	$LF
	"Enemies can randomly drop items when defeated and there is a lottery which
	$LF
	"is the precursor to the casinos which appear in each later DW game.
	$LF
	"Finally, you might notice that many of the enemies in this game appear
	$LF
	"in later games, particularly DW8.»»
