	[em 
		"Naruto: Ninja Council
	]em
	" is licensed game that is based on the manga 
	[em 
		"Naruto
	]em
	". Its story covers from the start of the manga all the way to the "Chuunin Exams" arc, with chunks of the plot omitted here and there. Its gameplay offers a mix between action platforming and more traditional fighting game elements. It also offers music that sounds rather interesting coming from a Game Boy Advance game from 2003, more so 2006 when the game came out overseas.
