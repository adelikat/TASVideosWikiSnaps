[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Powerball
	]em
	" is a 
	[em 
		"Breakout
	]em
	"-like game for the Commodore 64 that was published in the May 1987 issue of the 
	[em 
		"Compute's! Gazette
	]em
	". Like the game it takes after, the goal is to move a paddle around to get a bouncing ball to hit all the breakable bricks on the screen. You can get powerups from some of bricks to make completing the levels easier. However, what sets this game apart from the other 
	[em 
		"Breakout
	]em
	" clones are the bouncing colored "Slivers" that serve as obstacles for the ball.
