	" (1990) is a critically acclaimed SNES game which combines two major gameplay phases: a god simulator and an action platformer. You play the role of a deity called the Master, who awakens from his slumber only to find that the human civilization is completely wrecked, and hordes of demons are roaming free. Player's role as the Master is to restore and help develop the civilization anew, by controlling it during the overhead phases through a bow-wielding cupid, who also repels mischievous demons. The second part of the role is to open new locations for humans to inhabit, and to deal with the catastrophes happening there, which usually have something to do with grotesque monsters. This is where the action stages are used.
