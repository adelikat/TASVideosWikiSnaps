	[em 
		"Super Mario Bros. 2
	]em
	" is the infamous sequel to 
	[em 
		"Super Mario Bros.
	]em
	" that was released only in Japan for the Famicom Disk System. Considered too difficult and too similar to the original game, it was skipped over for localization in favor of making 
	[em 
		"Doki Doki Panic
	]em
	" into the actual 
	[em 
		"Super Mario Bros. 2
	]em
	" for the NES. This game would later be remade in 
	[em 
		"Super Mario All-Stars
	]em
	" as 
	[em 
		"Super Mario Bros: The Lost Levels
	]em
	".
