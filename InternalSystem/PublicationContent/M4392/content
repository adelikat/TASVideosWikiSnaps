[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Prehistorik Man
	]em
	" (not to be confused with the game of the same name on the SNES, which is the sequel) was a platform game for the Game Boy, made by Titus Interactive. This game is actually a port of 
	[em 
		"Prehistorik 2
	]em
	", which was made for MS-DOS and Amstrad CPC. Even with the major cuts out from the original PC game, 
	[em 
		"Prehistorik Man
	]em
	" seems to still be a rather faithful port, and pulled off some very interesting technical feats for the Game Boy.
