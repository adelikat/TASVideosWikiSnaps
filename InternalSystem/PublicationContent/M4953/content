	" is an NES adaptation of the Hanna-Barbara cartoon of the same by Atlus. It stars main big bad Dick Dastardly and his canine sidekick Muttley as they travel the world to ruin the lives of various racers from the cartoon. And while Dick Dastardly may be calling the shots, it appears that Muttley is the one doing all of the heavy lifting as you play the entire game as him, throwing bombs and flying with his spinning tail around levels.
