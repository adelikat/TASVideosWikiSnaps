	" the first installment of the 
	[em

	[a href=/1246M

	"A run that beats the game even faster through save data corruption is available 
	[a href=/2547M 
		"here
	]a
	", and a 100% run covering the whole castle can be found 
	[a href=/1592M 
		"here
	]a
	". If you prefer the main character to have muscular bare arms and to pray to the rain gods to defeat bosses, you may enjoy the 
	[a href=/1275M 
		"Richter
	]a
	" version. If you want to see a run on Replay mode that can skip many cutscenes, see 
	[a href=/2666M
