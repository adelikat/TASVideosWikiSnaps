	"A run that beats the game even faster through save data corruption is available

	(__wikiLink|1592M|here)
	". If you prefer the main character to have muscular bare arms and to pray to the rain gods to defeat bosses, you may enjoy the 
	(__wikiLink|1275M|Richter)
	" version. If you want to see a run on Replay mode that can skip many cutscenes, see 
	(__wikiLink|2666M|this run)
