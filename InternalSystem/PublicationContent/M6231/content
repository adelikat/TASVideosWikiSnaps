		"NHL Hockey '94
	]em
	", is a hockey sports game by EA Games and the third game in their 
	[em 
		"NHL
	]em
	" series. It introduced a number of features that made it one of the most popular entries in the series, the most notable being the addition of the "one timer" hockey technique. It also added the ability to manually control the goalie, numerous hockey teams and rosters from the 1992-1993 series, and various organ songs based on both hockey team anthems and popular songs from the 20th century.

	" completes a single game of hockey as fast as possible by manipulating the AI opponent into standing around and doing nothing for most of it. This in effect saves time over properly playing the game by keeping movement-induced lag to a minimum. Input is also ended as early as possible during the third round with enough RNG and AI manipulation to ensure that the player team scores a point with no further input by the player themselves.
