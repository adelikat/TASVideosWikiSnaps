	[em 
		"Stone Protectors
	]em
	" is a beat 'em up video game in a British multimedia franchise trying to capitalize on the "group of badass dudes with an attitude" craze in the '90s popularized by 
	[em 
		"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
	]em
	" and 
	[em 
		"Toxic Crusaders
	]em
	". It involves a bunch of mediocre rockers who find magic stones that turn them rock star trolls that can outdo the competition. These crystals are coveted by an evil alien race called the Saurians, led by the music-hating Zok, who then invade Earth to find these rock stars, now known as the "Stone Protectors".
