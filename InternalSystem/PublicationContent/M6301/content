	" is a rhythm game for the Nintendo DS. Developed by the same team that made 
	[em 
		"WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgames!
	]em
	", 
	[em 
		"Rhythm Heaven
	]em
	" takes the creative and rather wacky minigames from that game and puts a rhythm twist in it. Various songs are played over these minigames and the objective often is to tap to the beat of the songs. Some of these songs even include Japanese vocals that you can sing along to!
