	[em 
		"Meat Boy
	]em
	" is a Flash game made by Jonathan McEntee and Edmund McMillen, where Bandaid Girl is kidnapped by Dr. Fetus, and it is up to the titular character to save her. It has many of the hallmarks of McMillen's signature art style, which would later be fleshed out in full in 
	[em 
		"The Binding of Isaac
	]em
	". Later, Team Meat released 
	[em 
		"Super Meat Boy
	]em
	", which is based off of this game.
