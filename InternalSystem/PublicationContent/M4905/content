	" is an odd war game involving Nazis, time travel, moon rocks, and aliens. American scientists have received a bunch of special items and a message in the future telling them that the Nazis have won World War II with the use of Lunarium, a special metal that was used by the Nazis to make sterilization and intelligence-lowering bombs. The scientists give you these special items, which includes a jetpack, and put you on a quest to save the world from the terror of the Nazis by invading their depots, stealing their rocket parts to make a rocket ship and their Lunarium to use as fuel, and flying to the moon to shut down their Lunarium mines. But be cautious, the Nazis may have had some help along the way.
