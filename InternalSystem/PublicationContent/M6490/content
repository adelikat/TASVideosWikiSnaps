[div class=p

		"Summer Challenge
	]em
	" is a sports video game for Sega Genesis that is based on the Olympics competitions. It was initially published unlicensed by Accolade and was later reissued with one after their lawsuit against Sega. The player chooses a country to play for and competes in a series of sports games to get the best scores and medals. These exciting games include archery, horseback riding, cycling, and other sports. All of this is rendered on a small portion of the screen with low frame rate 3D CGI graphics.
