	[em 
		"Escape From the Room With the Six Stars
	]em
	") is one of many escape room Flash games by Yomino Kagura. As the name implies, you are trapped in a room with six grey stars on a shelf. Also in the room are a monitor, a few safes, a checkered box, and a weird futuristic table contraption. You will need all of these to figure out where the key to the door is.
