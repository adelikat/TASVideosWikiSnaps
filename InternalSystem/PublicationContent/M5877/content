	" for the Sega Genesis is a homebrew port of the Flash game of the same name by the late Felix Wiesner. It is the first game starring the titular Castle Cat, a cat with a head that resembles a castle battlement and contains a loaded cannon and lots of maces. In this more relatively grounded installment, you follow Castle Cat as he climbs up a tall castle and battles the dragon at the very top, all the while fighting off knights, whirlwinds, and jesters.
