Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to rescue Dr. O and Shannon from the grubby clutches of the Sinister Seven as quickly as possible. As you fight your way through each area, you must obtain information and vital ID cards. Your progress is blocked at every turn by acid flames, raw sewage, scorching steam, high voltage electricity and poison gas.
