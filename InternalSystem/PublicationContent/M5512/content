		"Checkers

	" is a video game based on the board game checkers. It was made for the Atari 2600 by Activision. What's notable about this version of the game is that the screen turns black when the opponent AI is computing moves to make against you, and given how fast the Atari 2600 is, a regular game can take nearly an hour to play.
