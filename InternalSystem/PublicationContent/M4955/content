	[em 
		"Frusion Breakfast Brawl
	]em
	" is an official parody of 
	[em 
		"Punch-Out!!
	]em
	" by the Danone company. It was made to advertise their Dannon Frusion smoothies. You play as a guy who just got out of bed in their t-shirt and boxers boxing large anthropomorphic personifications of breakfast staples such as a bowl of cereal, a bacon egg sandwich, and a cream cheese bagel. Beat them all to win the game.
