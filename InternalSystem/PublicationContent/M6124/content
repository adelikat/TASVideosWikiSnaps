	"Specifically, this game is based on the short "Duck Amuck" where Daffy Duck is the target of this rogue animator. Although this time instead of the animator messing with him, it's the person playing the DS video game. Various situations can arise while messing around which eventually leads to minigames. The more of these games the player wins, the angrier Daffy will become until he blows up and demands to know what is happening.
