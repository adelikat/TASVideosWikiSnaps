[div class=p

		"10 Second Run
	]em
	" is a fast paced simple platformer released for DSiWare.  The game consists of 50 stages in which the player needs to run to the ending within a 10 second limit.  While some of the stages seem easy to play through, the short time limit can make it more intense to play as the player must be nearly perfect in execution to make it in time.
