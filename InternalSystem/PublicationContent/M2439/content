	[em 
		"Mega Man 3
	]em
	" (ＵＳＡのロックマン３) is the first game in the 
	[em 
		"Mega Man
	]em
	" / 
	[em 
		"Rockman
	]em
	" series to introduce sliding (though the ability to charge the Mega Buster would have to wait until game 4). It also introduced Rush the robotic dog, who provides the abilities of Rush Coil, Rush Marine, and Rush Jet. Furthermore, after you beat the 8 robot masters, the game makes you revisit modified versions of four stages to fight the Doc Robots, who imitate the robot masters from 
	[em 
		"Mega Man 2
	]em
	". This set a precedent in the 
	[em 
		"Mega Man
	]em
	" series to have additional stages between the main robot masters and Dr. Wily's fortress.
