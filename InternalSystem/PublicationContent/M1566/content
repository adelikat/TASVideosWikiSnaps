		"Virtual Boy Wario Land
	]em
	" was a platformer released for the Virtual Boy system in 1995. The main objective of the game is to traverse the 14 levels and find a hidden key in order to open up the next level. There are treasures hidden along the way; this TAS collects them all and therefore achieves the best ending.
