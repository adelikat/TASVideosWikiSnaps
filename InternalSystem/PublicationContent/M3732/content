	" is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up video game initially released in arcades in 1984 by Jaleco. The arcade release was distributed by Williams and known as 
	[em 
		"Aeroboto
	]em
	" outside Japan. It was later ported to the MSX and to the Famicom. Taking place in the year 2701, the player controls a robot which can transform into an aero fighter on a mission to stop an alien super weapon from reaching the Earth. The robot may move forwards, backwards and jump, and the aero fighter may travel anywhere on screen but has limited fuel in which to do so. A combination of the two must be used to avoid obstacles, as well as to destroy any on-screen enemies for extra points.
