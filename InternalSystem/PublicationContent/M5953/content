[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Crown of Kings
	]em
	" is a version of the Intellivision adventure game 
	[em 
		"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Cloudy Mountain
	]em
	" that can be found in the Intellivision 10 plug-n-play NES-on-a-chip game system. As with the original game, the goal is to traverse across the land into mountains and dungeons and search for pieces of a broken crown so it can be reassembled and repaired. Each dungeon and cavern has a randomly generated layout, and a number of them contain crown pieces that are guarded by powerful dragons.
