	") is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up that was developed by Masaya for the PC Engine CD. It later saw ports to Windows PCs, the Wii, and the Nintendo Switch. It features gameplay that's very unconventional for a shoot 'em up. Lives are timed and represented by hourglasses. They're lost when either a life is lost or when they run out. More powerful moves are only done by inputting special button combinations instead of using only a single button. And to make up for the hitboxes being large and tall, there's a dodge button that makes the player invisible for a moment.

	"Unlike the previous game, ancient bodybuilding brothers Adon and Samson are the protagonists instead of Idaten and Benten. They are off to investigate anomalies in the Builder system after Idaten left to investigate himself and never returned. With Benten now relegated to a support role, Adon and Samson are off on a strange adventure filled with scantily clad men and women.
