	[em 
		"Madagascar: Operation Penguin
	]em
	" is a licensed video game spin-off of the animated movie 
	[em 
		"Madagascar
	]em
	". Despite what the name would have you believe, it predates 
	[em 
		"The Penguins of Madagascar
	]em
	" series by three years. This game focuses on the penguins Skipper, Kowalski, Private, and Rico and they hatch a plan to escape from the New York zoo they're in and with the help of a few other animals. As this game was only released a couple months after the first 
	[em 
		(__wikiLink|displaytext=Madagascar|href=/1605G)
	]em
	" video game for the Game Boy Advance, it reuses a good number of assets and mechanics and essentially plays just like the previous game.
