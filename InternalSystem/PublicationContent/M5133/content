	" is a chess video game that uses the name of the United States Chess Federation for branding purposes. It comes with both a one player mode and two player mode. In one player mode, you play against the AI with the difficulty of your choice. The higher the difficulty, the longer it takes for the AI to come up with a move to play against you, with some moves even taking hours to happen.
