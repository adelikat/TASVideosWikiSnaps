	" in Spain, is a platformer notable for being one of the first computer games to have a cutscene that sets up the game. The premise is that Bugaboo, who is supposed to be a jumping flea but looks more like a frog, has fallen down a deep cavern and must jump his way back up lest a huge winged monster comes and gets him. The player controls him by carefully timing the power of his jumps. The more powerful the jump, the farther Bugaboo goes.
