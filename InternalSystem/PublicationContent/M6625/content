[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Darkwing Duck
	]em
	" is a platformer somewhat similar to 
	[em 
		"Mega Man
	]em
	" in gameplay and difficulty. The arrow gun allows the player to climb up walls and use creative shortcuts so that the absolute shortest route can be taken. The Game Boy port is notably laggy in places, in particular when multiple projectiles are on screen.
