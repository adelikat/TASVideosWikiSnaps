[div class=p

	" is a platformer by Athena. The game's description has some awkward English, but it seems to say "the world fell into spells and went crazy". Your heroes are the Karasukun brothers, a pair of ravens, who go fight back after their house is attacked. The game is notable for its beautiful and trippy graphics.
