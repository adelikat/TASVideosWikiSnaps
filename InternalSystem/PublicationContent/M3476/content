		"B.C. Dash
	]em
	" is a platformer game for the Uzebox, developed by Paul McPhee and released on October 25th, 2009. The goal is to pass through a single long hazardous stage, filled with tricky jumps, awkard terrain, and many different artifacts and powerups along the way. After reaching the finish line, your fastest time is recorded and the stage loops again for another run.

		"The Uzebox is a retro-minimalist homebrew game console. It is based on an AVR 8-bit general purpose microcontroller made by Atmel. The particularity of the system is that it's based on an interrupt driven kernel and has no frame buffer. Functions such as video sync generation, tile rendering and music mixing is done realtime by a background task so games can easily be developed in C. The design goal was to be as simple as possible yet have good enough sound and graphics while leaving enough resources to implement interesting games. Emphasis was put on making it easy and fun to assemble and program for any hobbyists. The final design contains only two chips: an ATmega644 and an AD725 RGB-to-NTSC converter.
