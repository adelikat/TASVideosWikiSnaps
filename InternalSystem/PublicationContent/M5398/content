		"The Impossible Quiz
	]em
	" is a Flash game that's more like an unconventional logic puzzle game than it is a quiz game. You are given a number of questions, most of which have four answers to choose from, and you must choose the answer that is considered right by the game itself. One big tip when playing the game is that the answer may be hiding in plain sight in front of you.
