	"This run collects all of the pieces of furniture, which causes a certain room in the castle to become heavily decorated. This run uses wall-sinking glitches to warp very quickly between different parts of the castle, but it still explores a large portion of the castle. For another run featuring Juste which uses wall-sinking and ignores the castle decorations, please see
