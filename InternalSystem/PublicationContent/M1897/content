	"In this game, the player controls Juste Belmont, one of the later descendants of the Belmont clan.  The goal of the game, as usual for Castlevania games, is to defeat Dracula in his castle.  Along the way, some bosses are beaten, and some abilities and items are obtained.  Furthermore, to obtain the best ending, Juste is supposed to acquire all of Dracula's remains and Maxim's bracelet.

	"This run collects all of the pieces of furniture, which causes a certain room in the castle to become heavily decorated.  This run uses wall-sinking glitches to warp very quickly between different parts of the castle, but it still explores a large portion of the castle.  For another run featuring Juste which uses wall-sinking and ignores the castle decorations, please see
