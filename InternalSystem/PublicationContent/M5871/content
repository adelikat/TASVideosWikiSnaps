	" for the Sega Genesis is a homebrew port of the Flash game of the same name by the late Felix Wiesner. You play as a cat whose head resembles a castle battlement. Equipped with weapons that castles are expected to come with such as cannonballs and maces, you stroll along the tropical docks of Miami and encounter sports cars, beached octopuses, and killing flying fish with wings. This all culminates in fighting some guy in a squid costume.
