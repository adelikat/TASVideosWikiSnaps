	" is an open-world adventure game for the ZX Spectrum and the sequel to

		"Skool Daze
	]em
	". The gameplay is essentially the same as in the previous game, where you can either complete the main quest or mess around in the school and with your classmates like the delinquent you are. What 
	[em 
		"Back to Skool
	]em
	" adds is more areas to explore, including a girls' school you can sneak into and flirt in, and more items that can be used to mess around with, such as alcohol and rats.
