	[em 
		"Oddworld
	]em
	" games. Abe's job is to free his fellow Mudokons who are being used as slave labor to dig up the bones of their ancestors. The Glukkons use the bones to make Soul Storm Brew. Abe's vocabulary is limited to "Hello", "Follow me" "Wait" and "Work". He must use these commands to direct slave Mudokons to their freedom. When enough slaves in a level have been saved, you go on to the next level to do it all again.
