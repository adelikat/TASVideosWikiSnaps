		"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III - Radical Rescue
	]em
	" is the final Turtles game released for the Game Boy. Unlike the other Game Boy Turtles games, it isn't a sidescrolling beat 'em up game, but is actually a Metroidvania by Konami released years before 
	[em 
		"Symphony of the Night
	]em
	". Each Turtle has a unique ability that they can perform. You start as Michaelangelo, and the goal is to rescue the 3 other turtles, Splinter, and April. To do this you must fight several D-List Turtles villains like Scratch and Dirtbag before fighting the big bad (cyber) Shredder who is guarding April.
