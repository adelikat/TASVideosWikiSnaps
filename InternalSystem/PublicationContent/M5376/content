[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Race Ace
	]em
	" is a racing game for the Commodore 64 that was published in the May 1990 issue of the 
	[em 
		"Compute's! Gazette
	]em
	". On a top-down perspective, you race other cars and motorcycle down a highway through various lands. Reach the finish line as soon as you can to score a high amount of points. In a way, this game is similar to 
	[em 
		(__wikiLink|displaytext=Road Fighter|href=/2249M)
	]em
	" for the NES, minus the vehicular combat.
