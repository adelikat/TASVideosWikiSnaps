	"You play as the Road Runner, and you spend each level running to the left trying to dodge obstacles and avoid Wile E. Coyote. The road is littered with landmines and speeding trucks, which will kill the road runner on contact. They can also kill Wile E., but he respawns again after a few seconds. Wile. E. also has guns set up at certain portions of the road, roller skates, and a rocket ship which he can use to try to grab the road runner.
