	"Dragon Fighter is a cross-over between a platformer and a shooter. It starts out in platform mode, where you can collect dragon points. When you have enough, you can transform into a powerful dragon, turning the game into a autoscrolling shooter. The game scrolls slowly in this mode, but the dragon moves fast.
