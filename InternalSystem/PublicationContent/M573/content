	"Dragon Fighter is a cross-over between a platformer and a shooter. It starts out in platform mode, where you can collect dragon points. When you have enough, you can transform into a powerful dragon, turning the game into a autoscrolling shooter. The game scrolls slowly in this mode, but the dragon moves fast.

	"By continuously switching between the two modes, it allows the player to go as fast as possible, which makes an otherwise boring game interesting.
