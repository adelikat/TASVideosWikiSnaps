		"Kung Fu
	]em
	" (1985) is a simple beat-'em-up game in which the protagonist known as Thomas has 5 floors of bad guys and bosses to fight through in order to save Sylvia, his girlfriend. Unfortunately, as the final screen tells us, their happiness "does not continue long" â€” a common arcade trope to make the player beat the game in a second loop.
