		"Lagrange Point

	" (ラグランジュポイント), is a very late (as in, released in 1991) Japanese-only RPG produced for the NES. This game is notable because Konami teamed up with readers of Family Computer Magazine (ファミリーコンピュータマガジン) to form a group, called 芸夢工房 (
	[em 
		"geimukoubou
	]em
	", art dream workshop), in order to make this game. The readers were permitted to design the characters, monsters, events, message-texts, music, the title-screen, and such. With enhanced sound for the NES due to Konami's VRC7 sound generator Integrated Circuit, the game is considered a masterpiece to many Japanese people.
