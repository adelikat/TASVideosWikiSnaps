	" is a space shooter that initially developed by Mattel for the Intellivision and later had an unlicensed port of sorts by a third-party company to the Intellivision 25 plug-n-play NES-on-a-chip game system. You control an armed spaceship that's undergoing an incursion into the trenches of what is not called the Death Star, a superweapon that's threatening to blow up the Earth. Your mission is to destroy all the weapons silos before the superweapon fires on the Earth, all while avoiding enemy spaceships that are in your way.
