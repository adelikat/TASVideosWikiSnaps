	", released in 2015, is a 2D Metroidvania centered around the protagonist Trace, a scientist who finds himself on the world of Sudra after an experiment gone wrong, separated from Earth by a deadly void called the Breach. When Trace arrives on Sudra he finds its civilization collapsed due to the release of a deadly pathogen in the act of biological warfare. With the help of the Rusalki — giant war machines that guard this world — Trace has to uncover the truth behind the fall of Sudra, confront the perpetrator behind it, and return back to his home world across the Breach.

	" games and some other platformers of the era and employs a number of unconventional storytelling and gameplay design decisions, and is all-around well-polished. If you enjoy action platformers or exploration-driven games with a solid sci-fi plot, playing through the game before watching the TAS is highly recommended so that the latter 1/4 of it (and especially the 4th boss, Vision) become easier to comprehend.
