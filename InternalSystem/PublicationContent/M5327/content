	" (1987) strongly resembles the arcade game 
	[em 
		"Breakout
	]em
	" (1976). In 
	[em 
		"Arkanoid
	]em
	", the paddle is actually a spaceship, and the bricks are space walls. The goal of the game is to break through the space walls and defeat the villainous Doh in order to escape from the space labyrinth.
