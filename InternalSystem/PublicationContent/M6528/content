	" is an FMV game that was animated by Don Bluth and his studio. It was initially released on LaserDisc-based arcade machines and was revolutionary for featuring fully animated cutscenes as part of a video game. In the years to follow, there would be various attempts at porting the game to various video game consoles. Many of them became standard platformers like the NES and SNES version. Some retained the core gameplay and design like the Sega CD version shown here.
