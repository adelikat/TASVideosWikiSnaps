		"Time Gal
	]em
	" is originally a Laserdisc arcade game developed by Taito and Toei Corporation and released in 1992. The Sega CD port, however, was developed by Wolf Team and published in the US by Renovation Products in 1993. Luda stole a time machine in the distant future and wants to alter the past to suit his desires, and it is up to the titular character (known as Reika in the original Japanese version) to stop him. The English version is notorious for having very cheesy English acting.
