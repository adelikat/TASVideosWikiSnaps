	" is an arcade-style shooter game that was developed for the ZX Spectrum and Commodore VIC-20 by Ultimate Play the Game, who would later become known as Rare. You play as a Jetman, whose goal in each level is to gather enough fuel supplies for his spaceship so he can leave and go to the next level. Every four levels, he has to construct a new spaceship by finding the pieces for them so he can leave. Along the way, he must avoid hostile aliens and asteroids due to being a fragile one-hit wonder.
