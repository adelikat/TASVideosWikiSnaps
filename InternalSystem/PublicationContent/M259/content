	" (1990) is the story of a studly 16-year-old boy named 
	$LF
	"Astyanax who is summoned to the world of Remlia in order to save the 
	$LF
	"enchantress Princess Rosebud from the evil wizard Blackhorn, who

	[em 
		"Astyanax
	]em
	" is a somewhat clumsy game. For one, Astyanax is twice as 
	$LF
	"big as he appears, and so he is easily hit unless one plays carefully. 
	$LF
	"The controls are also very bad. The sum of these factors is that it's 
	$LF
	"a difficult game to play, but that's part of what makes this movie interestingâ€”especially for those who have played this game.
