	[em 
		"Donkey Kong Jr.
	]em
	" where players get to solve math problems with Donkey Kong Jr. There are three modes: "Calculate A", where two players compete to create a sum number that equals the number Donkey Kong holds up using numbers on vines and arithmetic operations laying around; "Calculate B", which is a harder version of "Calculate A"; and "+−×÷ Exercise", where players can brush up on their basic math skills.
