		"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone
	]em
	" is an adaptation of the book of the same name for the Game Boy Color. It retains most of the important points of the plot from the original book and turns it into a turn-based role-playing game where you can play various minigames, learn spells, make potions, and fight more creatures than Harry did in the book. There are also a number of items to collect such as the Famous Witches and Wizards Collector's Cards, which can be combined to produce certain powerful magical effects while in combat.

	" decide to use a very dark form of magic, memory corruption, to skip most of the game and right to the credits. This is done through the usage of a Chocolate Frog at a certain point in the game and the careful management of a huge number of items, half of them being candy and desserts. By doing this, Harry never steps foot on the school grounds of Hogwarts and never learns about Lord Voldemort. For more information on how this was done, you can read the
