	" is a platforming game and the third game in the 
	[em 
		"Pac-Man World
	]em
	" series. Unlike the previous games, this iteration puts more focus on combat instead of just pure platforming. There are segments where Pac-Man has to defeat a certain number of enemies in order to progress. As for the story, Pac-Man is tasked by former antagonist Orson to save the Spectral Realm from having its energy drained by the evil genius Erwin. If Erwin isn't stopped, the Spectral Realm could collapse into Pac-Land and destroy both worlds. Pac-Man must now stop Erwin with the help of Orson and fellow ghosts Blinky and Pinky.
