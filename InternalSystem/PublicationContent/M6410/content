[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Prince of Persia
	]em
	" is a platforming game that has been ported to many systems, from the original Apple II to the SAM Coup√© computer. It is commonly regarded as a progenitor of the cinematic platform genre. Rather than following the more common jump-and-run mechanics, it focuses on careful advancement through fairly complex levels, emphasizing the protagonist's vulnerability and survival aspect. Rotoscoping technique is used to give more realism to the animation of the characters' movements.

	"The story follows an unnamed traveler from a faraway land traveling to Persia and falling in love with the Sultan's princess daughter. Grand Vizer Jaffar learns of this and imprisons both of them in the dangerous palace dungeons with the traveler at the bottom and the princess at the bottom and gives the traveler an ultimatum: marry the princess or die. The traveler must now find a way to outsmart and defeat Jaffar and save the princess.
