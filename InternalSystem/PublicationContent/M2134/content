	"A port of the PC game from the well-known King's Quest series, King's Quest V is an adventure game infamous for its numerous dead ends, long fetch quests, and overly obscure solutions. The game is highly restrictive, with minimum points necessary to beat the game being not much less than the maximum 260 points, and as such, this TAS goes for the maximum.
