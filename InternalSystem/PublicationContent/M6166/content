	" but with Mario. Mario needs to get from Tucson, Arizona to Las Vegas, Nevada, but overslept and the bus left without him, so he has to reach there on his own. However it is very hot on the road so Mario needs to keep jumping or he will die, and also there is a speed limit where Mario can't go TOO fast or he will also die.
