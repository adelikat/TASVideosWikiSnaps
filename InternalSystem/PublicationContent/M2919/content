	"The minigames themselves are very straightforward and usually involve only the Triangle, Cross, and Circle buttons. This is a direct holdover from the original arcade machines, which featured a three-button layout. Some minigames also include the directional pad to increase the button-mashing even further. For example, in the first minigame the player has to fend off mobsters by pressing the D-Pad in the direction they're coming from.
