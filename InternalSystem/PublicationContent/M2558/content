	[em 
		"Super Metroid
	]em
	" is a very popular game with a long history of speedrunning and glitch exploration. One such glitch involving pressing Left and A together allows selecting glitchy beam combinations with a wide variety of side effects, most of which cause the game to crash. However, it was recently discovered that under the right conditions, one of the beam combinations (known as the "charged Space/Time Beam") can be used to reprogram the game! Thus, like
