	") is a Flash game in the escape game genre and the 44th game in the 
	[em 
		"Neat Escape
	]em
	" series. This iteration has an uncommon premise to be found in this sort of game. You are called over to your friend's coffee shop for a challenge. If you can escape from within the locked building, you can eat and drink whatever you want. The challenge comes from finding the key, and there are puzzles to solve and codes to decipher to order to find the key.
