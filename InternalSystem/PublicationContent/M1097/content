		"Contra: Hard Corps
	]em
	" (1994) was the first game in the series to be exclusively released on a non-Nintendo console. The game took a lot of elements from previous installments and spiced them up with even more dynamic combat, different playable characters, nonlinear plot and about twice the amount of boss fights.

	"In this movie the author takes the secret "fifth ending", thereby skipping most of the game. If you want to see runs which play more of the game, then you should see 
	[a class=intlink href=/1731M

	]a
	" (with the quickest "normal" ending) or 
	[a class=intlink href=/1755M 
		"this run
	]a
	" (with the "best" ending).
