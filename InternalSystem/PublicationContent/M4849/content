	" romhack where Mario can acquire the ability to throw Bob-ombs to destroy blocks that even he can't destroy as Big Mario. In doing this, NesDraug, the creator of the romhack, created puzzle levels that would normally be impossible without using lots of glitches and are intended to be solved with the Bob-omb powerup. In addition, Mario can run faster and jumping on enemies now causes him to jump much higher.
