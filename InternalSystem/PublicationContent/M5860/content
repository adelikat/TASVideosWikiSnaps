[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Hyperbeatz

	" is a homebrew rhythm game for the NES that plays very similarly to 
	[em 
		"Dance Dance Revolution
	]em
	". You tap buttons to a pattern of corresponding arrows and buttons that scroll up towards a timing zone and receive points based on how well your taps are synchronized to the music. Miss any arrows in the pattern and you lose some life from your life meter. Lose all of it and you lose the song. There are 16 songs in the game, and each song has a set of arrow and button charts that are rated based on how difficult they are.

	" take on all 16 songs and all the charts they have and achieve the maximum score possible in all of them by doing perfect plays. To reduce lag, the scroll speed has been set to maximum and the "Boost" modifier, which accelerates the arrows as they reach the timing zone, was used.
