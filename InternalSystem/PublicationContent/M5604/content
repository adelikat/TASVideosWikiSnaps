[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Snake Pit
	]em
	" is a variant of the game 
	[em 
		"Snake
	]em
	" for the Commodore 64 that was published in the December 1987 issue of the 
	[em 
		"Compute's! Gazette
	]em
	". As with the game it's based off of, you play as a snake that grows with each piece of food it eats. The objective is to eat as much as you can while continuously moving until you either hit a wall or a part of yourself. 
	[em 
		"Snake Pit
	]em
	" differs from most 
	[em 
		"Snake
	]em
	" ports in that the food is a group of mice that come out of designated mouse holes instead of randomly spawning around the screen.
