[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Mario Forever: SMW Edition
	]em
	" is a ROM hack of 
	[em 
		"Super Mario World
	]em
	" that ports over the PC fan game 
	[em 
		"Mario Forever
	]em
	" to the SNES. Aside from retaining the physics of 
	[em 
		"Super Mario World
	]em
	" instead of trying to replicate the original Multimedia Fusion-built physics, the ROM hack is basically faithful to version 4.0 of the original fan game, including all the levels from the original, as well as a new secret world.
