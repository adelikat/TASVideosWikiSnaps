	"Virtual Boy Wario Land was a platformer released for the Virtual Boy system in 1995.  The main objective of the game is to traverse the 14 levels.  Each level has a key you must find in order to open up the next level.  There are treasures hidden along the way.  This TAS gets no treasures and thus achieves the "bad ending".
