[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Anarchy
	]em
	" is a puzzle game where the goal is to shoot a number of blocks in each level using a tank under a set time limit, all while enemy droids are chasing after you. Once all the blocks are shot, an exit opens up and you have to get there before the droids get you or time runs out. Introduced in the later levels are yellow blocks which materialize in different places when shot, creating new passageways and more opportunities in how to tackle those levels.
