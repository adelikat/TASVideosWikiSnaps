	"Here's another run-of-the-mill platformer, released concurrently for the Amiga and Genesis/Mega Drive.  Bubba, a delivery man for the local zoo, is abducted one day by aliens; accompanied by the appropriately-named sentient stick Stix they must try to find a way back home.  As this run demonstrates, this takes a lot less time than you might expect.
