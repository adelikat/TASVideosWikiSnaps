	"Unlike those other runs, which are played on the Japanese Famicom version of the game, this run uses the USA version. This is because the USA version has a hard-difficulty mode you can access by naming your character "AKAMA" at the start. In this difficulty, you cannot recruit any allies, and there are more enemies that generally do more damage. To make this even harder, Fortranm takes a route that visits the Sunken City as Stage 6, showing off a difficult stage that no other run of this game shows.
