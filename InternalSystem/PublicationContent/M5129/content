[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Tom & Jerry Room Escape
	]em
	" is one of many, many "escape room" Flash games made by 123bee. You play as Tom, who somehow got locked inside of the house by a Jerry the size of a big dog. There is only one way out of this house, a single kitchen door. No windows, no other doors, just that one door. It is up to you to find a way out, no matter what it takes or how complicated your actions must be.
