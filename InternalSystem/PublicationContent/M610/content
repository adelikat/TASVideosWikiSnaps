	"This time it's the very old game 
	[em 
		"Circus Charlie
	]em
	". I made it mostly because I played this game as a child and it is a great memory for me ;) Hmm, the gameplay is comparably to 'Kung Fu', 'Balloon Fight' or 'Popeye'. Very old and easy and it goes on forever. However it just loops after stage 5 so I stopped my fmv there.

	"Hmm, I don't know if you have played this game but as I said it's very simple. Basically you can just jump and move forward and try to get the timing right. It's harder than it looks ;P You are a horrible little clown avoiding stuffs in a circus.

	"And finally, if you even bother on reviewing it and decides it wouldn't be a "time attack game" im not gonna be dissapointed. I mostly did it cus it's fun for me. Maybe some others shares my opinion but I think this is more rare than Trojan. Anyways I thought it could be worth a try. It's still a NES game and it's completed as fast as possible. Do whatever you want with this one.
