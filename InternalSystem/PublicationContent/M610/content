		"This time it´s the very old game Circus Charlie. I made it mostly because I

		"played this game as a child and it is a great memory for me ;) Hmm, the
		$LF
		"gameplay is comparably to Kung Fu, Balloon Fight or Popeye. Very old and
		$LF
		"easy and it goes on forever. However it just loops after stage 5 so I
		$LF
		"stopped my fmv there.
