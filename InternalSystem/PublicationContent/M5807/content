	" is a licensed adaptation of the stop-motion cartoon series of the same name from the United Kingdom. It is comprised of minigames that have something to do with Postman Pat's occupation of postman for the village of Greendale. These include processing letters on a conveyor belt, a memory game involving postcards, fitting packages into the back of a van, helping a child pack his backpack at the last minute, and feeding barnyard animals.
