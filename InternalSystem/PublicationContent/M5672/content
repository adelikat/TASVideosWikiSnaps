[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Speed Boat
	]em
	" is an action game and one of 52 games that are bundled in the Sega Genesis version of 
	[em 
		"Action 52
	]em
	". It is yet another autoscroller from the collection, just like 
	[em 
		"Slalom
	]em
	" and 
	[em 
		"Sunday Drive
	]em
	", where the objective is to get to the end of the level without crashing into anything. This time, you're on a speed boat and you must avoid other speed boats and fishermen on their own tiny boats.
