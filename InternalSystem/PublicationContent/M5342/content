	[em 
		"Polarium Advance
	]em
	", known as 
	[em 
		"Tsuukin Hitofude
	]em
	" (通勤ヒトフデ) in Japan, is a puzzle game that serves as the sequel to the Nintendo DS game 
	[em 
		"Polarium
	]em
	". Like in that game, the goal is to clear a grid of black and white tiles by flipping a number of them over by drawing a single uninterrupted line over them. Once the tiles are flipped over, solid horizontal lines of the same color are then cleared off. As the puzzles progress and the difficulty increases, elements such as tiles that can't be drawn over get introduced.
