	", starring walking talking rabbit ronin Miyamoto Usagi. It was developed for the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC and has Usagi traveling across the countryside encountering bandits, ninjas, and Buddhist priests. It features a karma system that also acts like Usagi's second health bar. Doing good deeds such as donating to priests and peasants and killing armed hostiles will increase it while bad deeds like attacking or even drawing your sword in front of unarmed people will reduce it. If the karma drops to 0, Usagi will drop down and cut his entrails out in shame.

The bunny hopping is part of an attacking bug where Usagi is locked to a constant attack state by continuously jumping right after attacking. Because of this, the run has Usagi mowing down everything in his path, even monks and peasants.
