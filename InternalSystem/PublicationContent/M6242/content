[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Super Mario Bros. Star Scramble
	]em
	" is a Flash platforming fan game that's based off of the 
	[em 
		"Mario
	]em
	" franchise. It features original graphics and gameplay objectives that are different from most 2D 
	[em 
		"Mario
	]em
	" games. Instead of reaching the end flag goal like most of them, you have to find and collect a number of Shine Sprites in order to unlock a door that completes the level when entered. These levels then culminate in a boss battle against Bowser.
