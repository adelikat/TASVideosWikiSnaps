	[em 
		"The Lost Levels
	]em
	" is so cruel a set of levels from the 
	[em 
		"Super Mario Bros.
	]em
	" series, Nintendo decided to replace it with a whole other game and give it a Mario theme, known as 
	[em 
		(__wikiLink|displaytext=Super Mario Bros 2|href=/510M)
	]em
	" in North America. It was later released as "The Lost Levels" in 
	[em 
		"Super Mario All-Stars
	]em
	". It's the only game in the set that saves your progress at individual levels rather than the start of worlds. It's that bad.
