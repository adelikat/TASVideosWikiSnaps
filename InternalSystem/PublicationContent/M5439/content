	" is a puzzle game for the Commodore 64 that was first published in the December 1989 issue of the 
	[em 
		"Compute's! Gazette
	]em
	". The objective is to completely shut down a rogue security computer by sending a series of electric pulses down its circuits and towards pyramid-shaped power points, guiding them by switching on and off circuit gates. Destroy all of those power points and the computer turns off. Should any of the pulses hit a circuit gate, the process fails and you must start over.
