	[em 
		"Mari0
	]em
	" is a PC game created by stabyourself.net in 2012 that combines the classic 
	[em 
		[a class=intlink href=/1715M 
			"Super Mario Bros.
		]a
	]em
	" with the puzzle-platfomer 
	[em 
		"Portal
	]em
	" by giving Mario a portal gun. The game launched with 2 "mappacks", with the one most people played being the 
	[em 
		"Super Mario Bros.
	]em
	" mappack containing the original set of levels. This TAS instead showcases the other mappack which features 18 
	[em 
		"Portal
	]em
	"-inspired puzzles spread across 9 different levels.
