	"This movie contains several new glitches and sequence breaks which allow for a much faster completion than were possible when the last run was made. Several large glitches in the game are not used in the run, such as those which allow the player to manipulate memory addresses to obtain items without physically picking them up. These are avoided because it would make the completion of any dungeon completely arbitrary; they can be seen in an old

	"Unlike the previous movie of this category, this TAS is played on the Japanese version of the game. The reason for this is that the text is significantly faster than in the English version, which means that far less time (roughly 12 minutes) is spent waiting for text boxes and cut scenes to end before getting back to the action. English subtitles were added to the encode for people interested in what was said.
