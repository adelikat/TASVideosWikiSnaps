		"For the Frog the Bell Tolls

	") is a Japanese-only action-adventure game with RPG elements. In this funny, cool, and unique game, Prince Sabure is on a journey to save the Mille-Feuille Kingdom and its beautiful princess before his rival does. Along the way, he gains the ability to transform into a frog and a snake and can use these new powers to make it to the overtaken castle even faster.
