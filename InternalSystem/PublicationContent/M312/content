	"And what an awesome movie it is: it demonstrates as many glitches of the
	$LF
	"game as possible. Some of the glitches save time radically, some save
	$LF
	"a little of time, and some don't save time at all but just look cool.

	"It uses death as a shortcut, but in contrary to the usual, this death

	$LF

	"A somewhat similar trick can be done in Mega Man 2, but in Rygar,

	"Note: This PAL game movie was erroneously recorded at NTSC setting,
	$LF
	"resulting in 16.7% too fast playback. Thus the movie is significantly
	$LF
	"faster than it should actually be. The real length is 07:27,
	$LF
	"that is 25 seconds faster than the previous version.
