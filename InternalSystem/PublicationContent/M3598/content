	"Although it is possible to warp large distances within the game by using out-of-bounds glitches, making it possible to skip directly to the end, this movie refrains from saving and resetting, which is required to perform that sort of long-distance warp. However, glitches are used for other purposes, such as bypassing obstacles.
