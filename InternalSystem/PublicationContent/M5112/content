	" is a homebrew Game Boy Color game that was created for and the winner of the Scream FM game jam. You play as a food delivery guy that travels a secluded and mysterious trailer park to fulfill an order. Nothing seems right in this trailer park, and it is filled with lots of opossums. Suddenly, you find your car sabotaged and rendered inoperable. Figure out the mystery behind all this and escape before something bad happens to you, or worse.
