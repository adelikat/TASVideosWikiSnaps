	". The premise of the game has you en route on a Delta Minor to aid in managing a virus outbreak when suddenly the dilithium crystals powering the warp drive of your Enterprise-looking ship break. Your objective to survive in the orbit of a nearby planet while a team beams down to the surface to mine the dilithium crystals necessary to resume your journey. It's not as easy as it sounds as hostile drones orbit the planet and you have a limited amount of energy to spare for both your energy shield and phasers.
