	[em 
		"Tetris 2 + BomBliss
	]em
	" is one of the many versions of the famous Soviet puzzle game. There are, naturally, two variations featured on this cartridge: regular 
	[em 
		"Tetris
	]em
	" with several modes, as well as a new game called 
	[em 
		"BomBliss
	]em
	".

[p 
	[em 
		"BomBliss
	]em
	" is slightly different from regular 
	[em 
		"Tetris
	]em
	". In each stage, the well is filled with a preset pattern of blocks and bombs. Completing a line will, unlike Tetris, not clear it. It will, however, activate any bombs within the completed line, which can then destroy the blocks. The goal is to clear the entire well of blocks.
