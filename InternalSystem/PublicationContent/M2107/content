	"Plok is in a hurry, so he looks for opportunities to travel faster. He finds slides lying around almost everywhere. He finds nice presents making him a lot faster. He finds tiny holes in the Flea Pit for big shortcuts. He finds helpful sawblades, nice guys pushing him into the right direction, and even a lovely fish which helps him climb a mountain. Even water helps him climb a mountain to discover one more slide. He also takes advantage of the fact that he can do bigger jumps without his legs.
