	" (釣り先生, 
	[em 
		"Fishing Teacher
	]em
	") is a fishing video game that was released only in Japan by J-Wing. It features three modes, a "Free" mode where you can fish to your heart's content without any hurdles, "Tournament" mode where you compete with others in a tournament to catch the biggest fish, and an "Online" mode where you can compete with others that have the same game with a Game Boy link cable. To add depth, Tournament mode features RPG mechanics that affect how well you can fish such as stamina, a hunger meter, and changeable equipment. It also has random encounters such as wild animals and island rangers that have to be dealt by either offering your catches to them or improving your reputation with the islanders.
