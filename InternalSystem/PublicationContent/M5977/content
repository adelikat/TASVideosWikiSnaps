	]em
	" is a small adventure game for the Commodore 64 that was published in the September 1985 issue of the 
	[em 
		"Compute!'s Gazette
	]em
	". In what appears to be a homage to 
	[em 
		"E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial
	]em
	", you play as an alien who finds himself stranded on an alien planet. Your goal is to find a phone with which to call for a rescue ship so you can go home. This is done by collecting candy, which allows the alien to find the phone. However, you have a limited amount of time to do all of this before the alien succumbs.
