	"This run takes care of money problems by finding a nameless, glitched party member and taking all his stuff. Teleportation is used in some places it normally can't be by resting to reset the forbidden flag. Walking backwards is employed when it reduces screen draw time. Temple blessings are used rather than a cleric, and items are used instead of a sorcerer.
