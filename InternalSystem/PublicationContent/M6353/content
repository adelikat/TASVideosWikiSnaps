[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Trio the Punch: Never Forget Me...
	]em
	" (トリオ・ザ・パンチ) is a rather bizarre beat em' up developed by Data East for the arcades. It later saw a port to the PlayStation 2 as part of an arcade compilation called 
	[em 
		"Oretachi Gēsen Zoku
	]em
	". From what can be discerned, there doesn't appear to be any sort of coherent throughline connecting all the levels beyond jumping from one setting to another. You choose a character, go through a level, get some words on the screen, then move on to the next level. These levels often don't follow standard gameplay conventions, with bosses appearing at the start of some levels and certain levels having only a few enemies before the end-level boss.
