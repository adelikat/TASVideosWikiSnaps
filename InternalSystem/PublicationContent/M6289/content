	" series. In the game, you choose from one of four members of the band: A keyboard and brass-playing bunny girl named Purika, a blue-haired guitarist named Coke, the sun-loving pianist named Miruka, or the afroed drumming robot named Geroppa, and battle against one of your bandmates to see who can jam better.

Playing as Geroppa and playing through the songs flawlessly on the Special difficulty by hitting every single note perfectly which normally requires a lot of precision, the player gets a high score of 2,596,800 points, and 100% on the seven songs that are played.
