	"One of the traits The Mask seems to give Stanley is extreme speed, so naturally, aside from a couple of boss fights, the gameplay is extremely fast throughout the movie. The Mask also has a variety of special powers, most of which are seen in this run. These powers cost M points to use, which have to be managed carefully over the stage.
