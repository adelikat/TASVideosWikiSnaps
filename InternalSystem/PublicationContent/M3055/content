	"Based loosely on the plot of the movie of the same name, this game is about a man named Stanley Ipkiss, who finds a powerful mask known as The Mask. However, the evil Dorian Tyrell has also become aware of this and kidnaps his girlfriend in order to obtain it.

	"One of the traits The Mask seems to give Stanley is extreme speed, so naturally, aside from a couple of boss fights, the gameplay is extremely fast throughout the movie.
