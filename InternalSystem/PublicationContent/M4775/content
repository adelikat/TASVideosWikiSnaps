[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Cyclo 8
	]em
	" is a bike platformer that's similar to the 
	[em 
		"Trials
	]em
	" series. It has a rudimentary physics engine where you control which way the bike flips as it moves. The goal is to get to the finish line as fast as you can, all while getting collectables along the way.
