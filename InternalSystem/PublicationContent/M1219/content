	[em 
		"Ninja Gaiden Shadow
	]em
	" (aka. 
	[em 
		"Shadow Warriors
	]em
	") is actually a licensed GB port of 
	[em 
		"Shadow of the Ninja
	]em
	" on the NES console. Because of this, it is fairly faithful to the original despite starring Ryu Hayabusa, the main character of the 
	[em 
		"Ninja Gaiden
	]em
	" series.
