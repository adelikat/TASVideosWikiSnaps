	" is a text-based adventure game for multiple microcomputer systems, including the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. It is the first game in Brian Howarth's

		"Mysterious Adventures
	]em
	" series. You take the role of a nameless adventurer whose task is to recover the titular Golden Baton, an invaluable artifact which holds the power to maintain balance and peace in the land, which has been stolen from the Palace of King Ferrenuil. Many have tried before you did and none returned. Can you succeed in where they failed and bring peace back to the kingdom?
