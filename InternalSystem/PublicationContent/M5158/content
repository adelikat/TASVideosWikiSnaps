		"Battle Chess

	" is a chess game for the NES with a few neat gimmicks. In addition to standard 2D depictions of chess pieces you get to play with, you also have "3D" pieces that walk and interact with other pieces like they're real people. You also have animations for when pieces overtake and destroy other pieces. There are also features to aid in gameplay such as letting the game suggest moves to you if you're stuck and being able to take back moves and play again.
