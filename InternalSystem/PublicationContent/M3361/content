	]b
	": There are multiple audio tracks included with the downloadable encodes. Track 1 is the combined audio of both games panned so that the left channel is the audio of Donkey Kong and right is that of Donkey Kong Jr. Track 2 contains Donkey Kong's audio and track 3 contains Donkey Kong Jr's audio.
