	" is a 1991 side-scrolling beat 'em up game that was developed by Atari Games and based on the 1989 movie of the same name. Loosely following the plot of the movie, you follow Michael Keaton's Batman as he investigates the dealings and terror caused by one Jack Napier, a.k.a. the Joker. Along the way, you rescue Vicki Vale from the Joker, speed through traffic shooting down the Joker's goons on the road with the Batmobile, and eventually confront the Joker himself.
