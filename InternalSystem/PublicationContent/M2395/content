	"The second installment of Adventure Island for SNES. Unlike most of the games in the Adventure Island series (except for 
	(__wikiLink|1304M|the fourth NES game)
	"), this game features a large overworld and side-scrolling stages without time limits. In this game, fruit isn't important at all, but you must find items and beat bosses in a certain order to progress further in the game.
