	[em 
		"Disney's Extreme Skate Adventure
	]em
	" is a skateboarding game released in 2003, using the same engine as 
	[em 
		"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4
	]em
	". The game allows you to skate as characters from 
	[em 
		"Toy Story
	]em
	", 
	[em 
		"Tarzan
	]em
	", and 
	[em 
		"The Lion King
	]em
	". The gameplay is similar to that of 
	[em 
		"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4
	]em
	", but containing simplified controls and limited tricks. There are three main modes of the game, Adventure Mode, Free Skate, and Versus. Unlike regular 
	[em 
		"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater
	]em
	" games, there is no actual story mode to complete. Instead, there are goals scattered across every level.
