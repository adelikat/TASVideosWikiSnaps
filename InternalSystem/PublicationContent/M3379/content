	"Disney's Extreme Skate Adventure is a skateboarding game released in 2003, using the same engine as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4. The game allows you to skate as characters from Toy Story, Tarzan, and The Lion King. The gameplay is similar to that of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, but containing simplified controls and limited tricks. There are three main modes of the game, Adventure Mode, Free Skate, and Versus. Unlike regular Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games, there is no actual story mode to complete. Instead, there are goals scattered across every level.
