	" is an action RPG game based on the tabletop RPG game of the same name. It has a cyberpunk fantasy setting where cybernetics, megacorporations, and the ability to jack into the Matrix coexist with magic, elves, and orks. The plot involves a man named Joshua, who spends most of the game figuring out who killed his brother Michael so he can avenge him, but not without a few obstacles along the way.
