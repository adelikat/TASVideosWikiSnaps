[div class=p

		"Pictionary
	]em
	" for the NES is a video game adaptation of the word-guessing game of the same name that was published by LJN. It has two game modes: Regular Mode and Alternative Mode. Regular Mode has the game draw pictures for you to guess from, which it will only do piece by piece when you complete various minigames. Alternative Mode works more as an assist to an actual game of Pictionary; you draw the picture yourself based on given category card and other people playing the game must guess what is. You must then choose which team had the right answer.
