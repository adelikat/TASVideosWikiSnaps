		"In the 13th century, the Cathars, clerics who preached about the poverty of Christ and defended life without material aspirations, were treated as heretics by the Catholic Church and expelled out of the Languedoc region in France.

	"" Players take control of Jean Raymond, who can do no more than walk, crawl, and jump, as he explores the old church, discovering its terrible secrets the deeper he goes.
