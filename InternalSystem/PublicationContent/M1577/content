	"Of all the challenging ways to play 
	[em 
		"Legend of Zelda
	]em
	" that people have attempted on an NES console, one of the most famous is the "swordless" challenge. In this challenge, the player must beat all of the game, up until the final boss Ganon, without using a sword. It is not possible to damage Ganon without a sword, however, so many swordless runs reach Ganon's room and either die there or crash the game.

In the meantime, sit back and watch a run which relies heavily on luck manipulation and effective bomb usage to beat the game very quickly. For more details, see the run's comments.
