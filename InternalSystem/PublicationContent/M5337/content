	[em 
		"Super Mitch Bros. 3

	" is a ROM hack of 
	[em 
		"Super Mario Bros. 3
	]em
	" that is focused on difficulty and the usage of various quirks and mechanics of the SMB3 engine. Unlike something like 
	[em 
		"Kaizo Mario 3
	]em
	", 
	[em 
		"Super Mitch Bros. 3
	]em
	" focuses a little more on genuine difficulty and requires that the player combine puzzle-solving skills and knowledge of the SMB3 engine to beat its 20 levels.
