	" series, released for the Wii in 2008. While its core mechanics are the same as its predecessors (where the genre’s traditional health bar is replaced with a percent counter, with the goal of knocking opponents off the stage instead of reducing their HP to zero), 
	[em 
		"Brawl

	" changed many aspects of the game from 
	[em

			"Super Smash Bros. Melee
		]a
	]em
	", resulting in the game generally being considered the "slowest" in the series as a result.

	[em

	" is the first game in the series to have a dedicated story mode, called "The Subspace Emissary", which is the main focus of this TAS. The Subspace Emissary is mostly composed of side-scrolling platforming levels with cutscenes and beat-’em-up sections called "Ambushes" - similar to games like 
	[em 
		"Kirby Super Star
	]em
	" - while also containing the traditional versus matches and bosses like its predecessors.

Pervasive luck-manipulation throughout the movie ensures that the author always gets the right item or sticker to go even faster, whilst attaining 100% completion.
