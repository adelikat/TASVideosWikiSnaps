[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Super Contra 7
	]em
	" is a bootleg game based off the 
	[em 
		"Contra
	]em
	" series, developed by E.S.C. Co (alias of Waixing) in 1996 for the Famicom and other Famiclones. It is probably either a hack of 
	[em 
		"Contra
	]em
	" or 
	[em 
		"Super C
	]em
	" or some sort of bootleg original that borrows heavily from the 
	[em 
		"Contra
	]em
	" engine. It has graphics stolen from 
	[em 
		"Mighty Final Fight
	]em
	" and 
	[em 
		"Shatterhand
	]em
	", but the music appears to be original. The game design here appears to be very odd, with standard enemies that don't shoot at you and power ups that sometimes don't work how they should.

[div class=p 
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/longbao 
		"longbao
	]a
	" for this run decides to take a pacifist approach like with many other 
	[em 
		"Contra
	]em
	" games and not kill any enemies unless it's absolutely necessary to progress. This leads to a lot of enemies just chasing after the player character.
