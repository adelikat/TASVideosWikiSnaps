	"Rygar is an action game involving a hero with a shield as a weapon.  Normally, the
	$LF
	"hero must obtain items, such as a grappling hook, to be able to explore the world of
	$LF
	"Garloz, and he must also defeat five bosses to gain access to the final area. 
	$LF
	"However, these requirements can be circumvented with glitches.  Indeed, this run
	$LF
	"kills no bosses except the final boss and does very little leveling.
