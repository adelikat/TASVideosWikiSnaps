	[em 
		"Rygar
	]em
	" is an action game involving a hero with a shield as a weapon. Normally, the hero must obtain items, such as a grappling hook, to be able to explore the world of Garloz, and he must also defeat five bosses to gain access to the final area. However, these requirements can be circumvented with glitches. Indeed, this run kills no bosses except the final boss and does very little leveling.
