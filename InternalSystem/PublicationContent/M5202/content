		"A Simple Platformer Game
	]em
	" is a homebrew NES platformer that was created for the 2020 NESMaker Byte-Off. As the name suggests, it is a simple platforming game, but one that appears to be a little unstable. The game is built around the concept of a "kill screen", where the game will eventually become unbeatable or even literally unplayable when played long enough. But does the game really have a kill screen? You'll have to play it to find out.
