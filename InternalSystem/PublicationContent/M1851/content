	"In the direct sequel to 
	[em 
		"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time
	]em
	", Link is back to being a lone boy without a fairy. One day, he is attacked by Skull Kid and his two fairies, Tatl and Tael, and they steal his ocarina. After pursuing Skull Kid, he is transformed into a Deku Scrub. Link continues pursuing Skull Kid all the way to the Clock Town (now with the help of Tatl the fairy, a more 'in yo face' version of Navi).

	"This TAS of the game is the result of three years of hard work and many restarts due to new discoveries. It features many never-before-seen tricks and glitches, and completes every dungeon without getting a single boss key. Everything is done out of order, in ways that will amaze the viewer and keep them on the edge of their seat the entire way through, including a whole new way of warping between the areas in the game's over-world, and a new method of traveling that makes even the longest stretches in the game seem tiny.
