	" is the 47th game of the unlicensed 
	[em 
		"Action 52
	]em
	" multicart. Described as a 
	[em 
		"Donkey Kong
	]em
	"-type game, Hambo has to reach the door at the top of the level whilst avoiding various hazards such as rolling balls, spikes and candles. It is also notorious in that you start off with only one life, and the game's obstacle generation can kill Hambo within frames of starting the level, which can lead to a very quick game over.
