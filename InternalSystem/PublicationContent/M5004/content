[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Win, Lose or Draw
	]em
	" is an NES game that is based on the 1980s American game show of the same name. The premise of the game is based on Pictionary. With two teams, the first team slowly draws a picture that serves as a clue to an answer based on a category while the second team tries to guess what the answer is based off of how much the first team drew. Points are earned from the time remaining after correctly guessing the answer.
