	" is a simple homebrew puzzle game where the goal is to turn a grid filled with squares of different colors into a single large square of a single color. Starting from a single square of a certain color, you change the color of that square so that it matches the color of an adjacent square, assimilating it. From there, you then continue to change the color of the chain you created, assimilating more squares until the entire grid is one single, uniform square.
