	"Like the first movie, a two-player run makes for some interesting things, like Chip and Dale carrying each other around, and heavy abuse of death to take advantage of balloons. By killing off one character, he respawns on a floating balloon, thus going ahead of the other character. Unlike the first, however, this run frequently destroys bosses by
