	".  One of the submissions to this contest was titled "My QLDC Level", created by Faro and MM102, which won first place in the contest. This hack only contains one level, but the journey to get to the level is the real challange, as Mario has to make his way through the over-world map while avoiding enemies as well as solving puzzles.  Was the journey to the level worth it?
