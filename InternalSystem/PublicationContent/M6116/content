	" is an unusual game that is a mix of racing/puzzle genres. The player controls a slowly spinning stick called the Helirin, and must maneuver it through a series of mazes. The player controls the direction and speed of movement but not the Helirin's constant rotation.

Note that you can only access the credits by completing the third of every regular world, except for Lost Land, so the author opts to complete the last level of Grasslands as fast as possible at the very end.
