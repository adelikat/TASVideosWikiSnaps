		"Frankenstein's Monster
	]em
	" is a homebrew port of the Atari 2600 game of the same name to the Intellivision. As with that game, the goal is to build a barricade around Frankenstein's monster before it comes to life. To do this, you must venture in and out of Frankenstein's castle to retrieve materials needed for the barricade, avoiding giant spiders, bats, and pits of acid along the way.
