	[em 
		"Impossible Game(boy)
	]em
	" is a homebrew platformer that was made for GBJAM 9. It is named after 
	[em 
		"The Impossible Game
	]em
	" and has graphics inspired by 
	[em 
		"Geometry Dash
	]em
	", both games it also takes its autoscrolling gameplay after. Unlike the latter, however, 
	[em 
		"Impossible Game(boy)
	]em
	" is not focused on jumping to rhythm of the music. It is more like the former and 
	[em 
		"Space is Key
	]em
	" where visual reflexes are more important to advancing through the levels.
