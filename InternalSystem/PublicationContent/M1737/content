	[em 
		"Dragon Crystal
	]em
	" is an early Roguelike RPG in the vein of 
	[em 
		[a class=intlink href=/1012M 
			"Fatal Labyrinth
		]a
	]em
	" or 
	[em 
		[a class=intlink href=/1485M 
			"Azure Dreams
		]a
	]em
	" - thus, naturally, it's vulnerable to the same type of luck manipulation in its random level generation to allow the protagonist to miraculously find stairs up in the opening area of each floor and complete the game in record time.
