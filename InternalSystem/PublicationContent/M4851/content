[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Marble Madness
	]em
	" is an arcade game where you roll a marble down or up a tall structure to the finish line while avoiding obstacles and falling off the structure itself. The Genesis version, however, is not directly comparable to the original arcade version.  In addition to having much worse audio quality, the rules on where (and what) the marble can go (and do) are relaxed, allowing for many shortcuts not possible on the NES.
