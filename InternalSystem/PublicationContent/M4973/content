	[em 
		"Ghostbusters II
	]em
	" for the NES (not to be confused with 
	[em 
		"New Ghostbusters II
	]em
	", which was developed by HAL Laboratory) is a licensed video game that is based off of the movie the same name and was developed by Imagineering, who developed games such as 
	[em 
		"Bart vs. the Space Mutants
	]em
	" and 
	[em 
		"Ghoul School
	]em
	". It loosely follows the story for the movie, reenacting set pieces such as going through the abandoned transit tunnels full of slime and piloting the Statue of Liberty across the city. Breaking the norm from most linear scrolling games at the time is that you go from right-to-left instead of left-to-right. It also has driving levels and shoot 'em up levels for some variety.
