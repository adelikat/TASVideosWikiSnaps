	"The 
	[em 
		"Samurai Shodown
	]em
	" series differs from other well-known fighting games of its time in a couple of ways. First, all characters can use a weapon, usually a sword (or occasional animal friends, like a dog or a falcon). Second, the games focus more on hard hits instead of combos, showing a slowdown effect when powerful strikes are landed.
