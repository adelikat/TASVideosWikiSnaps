	"The game is a basic platformer but thanks to a certain weapon
	$LF
	"this movie never gets boring. The arrow gun allows the player
	$LF
	"to climb up walls and use creative shortcuts to optimize all
	$LF
	"movements so that the absolute shortest route can be taken. In
	$LF
	"case you are wondering why the player keeps on jumping so much,
	$LF
	"it is because landing and not jumping again immediately makes the
	$LF
	"player stop for a short period of time. With constant jumping these
	$LF
	"landings can be avoided.
