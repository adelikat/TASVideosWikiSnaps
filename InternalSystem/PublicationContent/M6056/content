[div class=p 
	[em 
		"DamDam Stompland
	]em
	" is a rather unique combat game for the PlayStation that was released only in Japan. The goal of the game is to defeat your opponent by stomping on their shadow in under one minute. Whoever gets three successful stomps before time is up wins the game. There are seven characters to choose from, each with their own unique abilities. Items that spawn on the stage can be used to either aid you in stomping your opponent's shadow or to defend your shadow from being stomped. The game appears to have been built around the fact that the PlayStation can render shadows of 3D models in real-time.
