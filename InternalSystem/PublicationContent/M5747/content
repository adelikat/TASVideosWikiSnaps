	" is yet again another space shooter in the most infamous NES multicart known as 
	[em 
		"Action 52

However, there appear to be meteors that are homing on to you for some inexplicable reason and Tetris blocks that are in your way. Thankfully, your ship is armed with space guns that can destroy them.
