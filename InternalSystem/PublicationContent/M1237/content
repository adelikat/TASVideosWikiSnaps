	"Not quite defeated after his first world-conquering in Gex 64, the evil Rez has returned. This time he has kidnapped the do-able Agent Xtra in order to pull Gex the gecko back into the media dimension to rescue her. You can bet that Gex will get into even more silly costumes, collect TV remotes, and bounce himself silly in this second installment.
