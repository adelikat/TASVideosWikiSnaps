[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Bald Bull's Punch-Out!!
	]em
	" is a ROM hack of 
	[em 
		"Mike Tyson's Punch Out!!
	]em
	" where every opponent is replaced with Bald Bull. While one might think that this makes for an incredibly repetitive romhack, each fight is actually different from each other in certain ways such as different AI patterns or additional handicaps on either Little Mac or Bald Bull. However, Bald Bull won't take his beatings lying down eventually, so don't let Little Mac's guard down.
