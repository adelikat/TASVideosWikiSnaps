	[em 
		"Shin Satomi Hakkenden
	]em
	" and its film adaptation of the same name. It is an early role-playing game for the Famicom that was released only in Japan. In this game, you choose from one of eight samurai who are spiritually related and all descended from the ritual union of a dog and a woman. The objective is to find and defeat the evil queen Tamazusa, all while trying to recruit the other seven samurai that you didn't choose to play as to make the journey easier.
