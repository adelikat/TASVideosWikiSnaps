[div class=p 
	[em 
		"The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle
	]em
	" is a licensed puzzle video game that's based on the 
	[em 
		"Looney Tunes
	]em
	" cartoon shorts. The objective of the game is to collect all eight carrots in each level so Bugs Bunny can find and rescue his one-time girlfriend Honey Bunny. It differs from most other similar games in that Bugs is entirely unable to jump. With the only methods of dealing with enemies being an uncommon punching glove pickup and kicking other objects, the game's challenge comes from having to find other ways of avoiding enemies in order to complete the levels, usually by taking different paths.
