[div class=p 
	[em 
		"AirXonix
	]em
	" is a modern 3-dimensional remake of the famous 
	[em 
		"Xonix
	]em
	" game. In the older 
	[em 
		"Xonix
	]em
	" you controlled a device, which moved over a field with several monster-balls wandering inside. The objective was to cut the balls away from as much spare field as possible. The rules of 
	[em 
		"AirXonix
	]em
	" are almost the same, except the device you control is flying in the air and everything is in full 3D!
