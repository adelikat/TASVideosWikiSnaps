		"Looney Tunes 2: Tasmanian Devil in Island Chase
	]em
	", is a licensed platforming game developed by Sunsoft for the Game Boy. Unlike the other games of the same name that were developed around the same time, this one has a different plot with the Tasmanian Devil himself escaping from the ACME zoo and thwarting poachers that want to put him back. As he escapes the poachers, Taz finds himself on various islands with odd attractions such as wild animals that want to kill him, a dangerous amusement park, and highway cars that don't care whether or not they run him over.
