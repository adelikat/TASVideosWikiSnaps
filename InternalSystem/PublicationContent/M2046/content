	[em 
		"Super Contra 7
	]em
	" is a pirate based off the 
	[em 
		"Contra
	]em
	" series, developed by E.S.C. Co (alias of Waixing) in 1996 for the Famicom. It is likely a hack of either 
	[em 
		"Contra
	]em
	" or 
	[em 
		"Super C
	]em
	", given that the engine appears to be a modified version of the 
	[em 
		"Contra
	]em
	" engine.

	"The game features a pretty psychedelic soundtrack and several glitches that aren't present in other Contras, and Marx makes sure to use them well. The last boss cannot forgive him for beating the game this way and finally takes Marx' life, while losing his own.
