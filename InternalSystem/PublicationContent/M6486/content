	" (史上最大の倉庫番), is a puzzle video game for the Sega Genesis. It is one of several takes on the game 
	[em 
		"Sokoban
	]em
	", which was originally developed for the PC-88 in 1982. The objective is simple: you push boxes to cover up specific storage tiles on a grid. It's not as easy as it sounds, however. As the levels get harder, making mistakes can cause the level to become unwinnable since the boxes cannot be pulled, often requiring restarts. As for the story, a warehouse worker wants to get a girlfriend and a sports car by pushing boxes around for money.
