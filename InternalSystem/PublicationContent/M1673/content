		"Mendel Palace
	]a
	" is an action-puzzle game.
	$LF
	"When playing in real-time, it becomes more action than puzzle, and when TASing, it
	$LF
	"becomes more puzzle than action. The idea is to shove your opponents into the walls
	$LF
	"of the arena by flipping over ground tiles. This is harder than it looks, since the
	$LF
	"enemies often approach in swarms and can kill you with one touch.

	"Flipping can also reveal some other tile types. For instance, the sun tile flips over
	$LF
	"everything else, which often cleans up the arena in a hurry. However, there are also
	$LF
	"extra enemy spawn areas that can be uncovered, especially in the last levels. For
	$LF
	"more details, see the run's
