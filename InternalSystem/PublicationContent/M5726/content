[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Maze Master
	]em
	" is an arcade-style game for the Commodore 64 that was published in the October 1988 issue of the 
	[em 
		"Compute's! Gazette
	]em
	". The game plays similarly to 
	[em 
		"Pac-Man
	]em
	", but with one main difference. Instead of being chased by ghosts, you face off against another CPU-controlled player who's in another maze in a race to get as many dots as possible. Whoever gets 176 dots first wins the game.
