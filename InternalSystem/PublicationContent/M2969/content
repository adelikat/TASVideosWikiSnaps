	" (ロックマン9 野望の復活!!) is a video game made by Capcom and Inti Creates for the WiiWare download service, among others, in 2008. This game is notable in that despite being developed for modern consoles, it features 8-bit visuals and audio as a retro throwback to the NES entries of the series. It also features a plot twist early on in that Dr. Light's robots go on a rampage, with Dr. Wily not having any connection to the incident (or so he claims).
