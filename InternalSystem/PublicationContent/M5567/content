[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Mirror's Edge 2D
	]em
	" is a spin-off to the 
	[em 
		"Mirror's Edge
	]em
	" video game series developed by Brad Borne, the creator of 
	[em 
		"The Fancy Pants Adventure
	]em
	". It is a 2D side-scrolling platforming game that adapts the first-person view parkour gameplay of the original games to the Flash platform. As it is more of a promotional tool than a proper game, there is no story to be had here, but what's most notable in this version of 
	[em 
		"Mirror's Edge
	]em
	" is that Faith Connors appears to be much more superhumanly capable than in the original games.
