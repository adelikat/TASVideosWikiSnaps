	" is a vertically scrolling action game where one or two players fight their way through a variety of terrain, such as jungles, rivers, and ruins. The player has to negotiate the 4 long levels mainly on foot, but will also find tanks and helicopters along the way to make things a little more manageable in some sections. With its one-hit deaths, poor manoeuverability and no continues, this is a prime example of NES hardcore-gaming.
