	" doll line, the game has you play as a Cabbage Patch Kid walking through the park that's named "Babyland GeneralÂ®". In that park are lakes to jump across with a hanging vine or a lily pad, bees that attack you, pollen fuzzys that trigger your allergies, and lit campfires that shoot flames at you. Get to the end of the park and you win a stage.
