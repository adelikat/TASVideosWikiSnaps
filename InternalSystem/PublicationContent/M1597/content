	"It follows a rabbit-like creature called Yacopu on his quest to retrieve a flower and his kidnapped girlfriend so that peace will return to his world. Along the way he gains abilities including turning into a ball and a big, scary godzilla-like rabbit. This is an improvement of 48 seconds to the previous movie, mostly due to better speed management.
