	" is a simple homebrew skateboarding game for the Game Boy Color. It is an autoscroller with two modes that differ in their controls. Challenge mode has you jumping over obstacles and pits, and any crash will cause you to explode into a bloody mess. Freestyle mode gives you the freedom to perform a number of skateboarding tricks, and the only way to fail a level is to fall into a bottomless pit.
