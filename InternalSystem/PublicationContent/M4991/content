		"Ranma ½ II: Anything Goes Martial Arts
	]em
	" by DTMC, but DTMC went out of business. A direct translation would be "Super Skill Wild Dance Chapter", but it is commonly referred to as "Super Hard Battle". The story involves Ranma Saotome and his inner circle traveling around the world in a competition to find all twelve pieces of a magical Maneki Neko statue. Whoever can reassemble the statue first can have their wishes granted.
