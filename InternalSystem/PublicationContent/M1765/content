	"In this game, the player controls Juste Belmont, one of the later descendants of the Belmont clan.  The goal of the game, as usual for Castlevania games, is to defeat Dracula in his castle.  Along the way, some bosses are beaten, and some abilities and items are obtained.  Furthermore, to obtain the best ending, Juste is supposed to acquire all of Dracula's remains and Maxim's bracelet.
