	" features the return of the Rayman character in a 2D platformer. Many of the original Rayman game's characters and enemies make an appearance, like Livingstones, Electoons, Betilla and the Magician's hat. There are also various characters from Rayman 2 such as Globox, the Teensies and Lums. The game's atmosphere, however, is different from the original Rayman game and has a very "wacky" feel instead. The main objective of each level is to rescue as many Electoons as possible similarly to the original game.
