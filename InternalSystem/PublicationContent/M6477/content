		"Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge
	]em
	" is an isometric platformer released by Rare in 2003. It is an "interquel" to the original two N64 games, taking place while Gruntilda is trapped under the boulder in Spiral Mountain. Klungo creates a Mecha-Grunty suit for Grunty's soul to control, and she kidnaps Kazooie, travelling back in time 20 years (somehow) to keep Banjo and Kazooie from ever meeting! Mumbo sends Banjo back in time as well (somehow) to rescue his friend and destroy Mecha-Grunty, with the help of Bottles's ancestor, Bozzeye.
