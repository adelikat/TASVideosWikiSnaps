[div class=p

		"Kabuki Z

	" is an arcade sidescrolling hack n slash produced by Kaneko and licensed by Taito in 1988.  The game features a Samurai where you fight enemies like skeletons and the like, but then weirdly in the last round the character becomes a barbarian.  It is likely the game was released in an unfinished state as it not only has many visual and audio problems, but the lack of cohesiveness with the setting makes no sense.
