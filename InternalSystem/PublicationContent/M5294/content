	" is a top-down racing game that was initially released as an arcade game and was later ported to systems such as the NES, SNES, and Atari Lynx. With the endorsement of off-road racer Ivan "Ironman" Stewart himself, you race against other cars in various off-road tracks and collect items on the tracks that can improve your car such as extra turbo boosts. You can win a certain amount of money from each race, and with that money you can spend it on upgrades for your car.
