	"Each player has a set of pieces that consist of various military ranks. The objective is to either capture the opponent's flag or take out all of the opponent's pieces. Both players can only see their own pieces until their pieces directly make contact. Once that happens, the pieces that make contact are revealed to both players, and the one with the higher rank wins and takes out the piece. There are also mines and missiles, some with nuclear warheads, that can respectively affect all but one rank or affect multiple spaces at once.
