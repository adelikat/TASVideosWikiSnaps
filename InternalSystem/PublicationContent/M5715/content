	" is a 1989 beat 'em up game that was developed by Taito for the arcades. The game involves police officers Tony Gibson and Raymond Broady, who receive a call during their day off that a huge amount of prisoners have broken out of prison and committed a number of large crimes within a very short timespan. They have managed to occupy a shipping port, rob a bank, and kidnap the mayor, among other things. It's up to the two of them to solve the problem as police officers by doing a very '80s move, killing all of them.

	"This was the game used in TASVideos's Dream Team Contest 11, where groups of tool-assisted speedrunners compete to produce the fastest tool-assisted speedrun within a given deadline. This movie is the combined result of all those efforts. Here, you can witness Raymond Broady die and get shot multiple times in the speedrunners' quest to beat the game as fast as possible.
