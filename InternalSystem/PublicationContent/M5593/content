	" is a minigolf video game spinoff of the Disney cartoon

		"Phineas and Ferb
	]em
	". In this game, Phineas and Ferb have both created an elaborate mingolf course filled with whatever stuff they can find and somehow buy from the construction industry. The levels they made include attractions such as treadmills running on bicycle power, laser guns powered by air conditioners, UFOs with tractor beams, and even a perfect scale replica of the Eiffel Tower.
