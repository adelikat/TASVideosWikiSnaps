	[em 
		"Fatal Fury
	]em
	" and 
	[em 
		"Art of Fighting
	]em
	", and combines gameplay mechanics from both games and borrows some from 
	[em 
		"Samurai Shodown
	]em
	". It also features a couple original characters of its own and a flagship gameplay element, 3 vs. 3 matchups. A team of three characters are chosen, all with their own specialties, and the player gets to choose in which order they get to fight in.
