	" is a platforming game for the Nintendo Entertainment System and quite possibly the most influential game ever released for the console. Having been bundled with every brand new NES console, it is the game most people think of when it comes to the NES. Just about every platforming game in the '80s and '90s has taken inspiration from this game one way or another.

	" plays through the European version of the game which has a few differences to the NTSC versions.  For one, the flagpole glitch is much easier to pull off and can be done in basically any level.  There's also differences in acceleration as compared to the NTSC version, and a glitch that makes Mario fall through the floor more easily.
