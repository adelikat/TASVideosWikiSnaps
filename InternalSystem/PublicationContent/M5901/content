[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Re-Beep
	]em
	" is a video game adaptation of the electronic toy game 
	[em 
		"Simon
	]em
	" for the Commodore 64. It was published in the October 1983 issue of the 
	[em 
		"Compute's! Gazette
	]em
	". Like the original toy, 
	[em 
		"Re-Beep
	]em
	" is a memory game where you repeat patterns that the game gives you. Unlike the original toy, all four buttons are the same color and are instead differentiated by number labels, in addition to the different sounds they make.

	[em 
		"Re-Beep

	" until the game crashes due to integer overflow, reaching the maximum score of 127. This is done as quickly as possible with the help of a script to automate the inputs.
