	" is a homebrew puzzle game for the Game Boy Color. The objective of the game is to score points by arranging faces out of pieces given to you in one of four spots. More points are given for faces where all the pieces are of the same color and design. Lives are lost when either the time limit for placing a piece runs out or a piece is placed in a spot that that it cannot occupy. Extra lives are given by earning points. The game only ends when all lives are gone or the player quits.
