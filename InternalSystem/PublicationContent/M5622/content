	[em

	" ROM hack that was made for the 2023 Questionable Level Design Contest and placed in the Top 10 best submissions list. It was designed to resemble the 
	[em 
		"Mario
	]em
	" fangames that were made on the Flash platform in the early-to-mid-2000s, with all the questionable gameplay mechanics that came with them. You can find platforms that don't move Mario when they move, Switch Blocks that work half the time, and wonky jumps. You also get cheap-looking animations and transitions and random music from other video games, all in one package.
