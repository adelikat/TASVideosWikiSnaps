	[em 
		"Mega Man ZX
	]em
	" series. What's so different between the classic series and ZX Advent? First, you get to choose between a male (Grey) and a female (Ashe) character. Then, instead of stealing weapons from the bosses, the player steals the boss itself! Instead of switching between weapons, the player switches between forms using the Biometal Model A. Finally, the player has less freedom to pick the stages of his choice.
