	"Chelsea, the Clockwork Fairy Princess, wakes up the toys of the house every midnight with her voice.  One night, she is stolen away by an unknown force, which also hypnotizes some of the toys to become fierce minions and stand in the way of anyone who would try to rescue her.  It is up to toy soldier Sir Tongara de Pepperouchau III ("Pepper" for short) and his rival Ginger to save the princess.
