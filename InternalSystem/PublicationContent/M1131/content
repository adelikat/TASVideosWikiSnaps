	[em 
		"Adventures of Lolo
	]em
	" (1989) was the first game of the 
	[em 
		"Eggerland
	]em
	" series that received a Western release. The series itself is rather loosely related to Kirby series: both have been developed by the same company (
	[a class=extlink href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_Laboratory rel=nofollow 
		"HAL Laboratory
	]a
	"), and Eggerland protagonists Lolo and Lala make cameo appearances in Kirby games as Lololo and Lalala.

	"Lolo may seem simplistic, but it remains being a truly well-made puzzle. Finding optimal solutions to most of the rooms has proven to be a very nontrivial task, and every once in a while a new improvement is found.

	[em 
		"Defenders of the Crown
	]em
	", it will as well complete it in just 3 minutes and 38 seconds.
