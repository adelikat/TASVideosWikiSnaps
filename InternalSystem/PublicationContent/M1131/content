	[em 
		"Adventures of Lolo
	]em
	" (1989) was the first game of the 
	[em 
		"Eggerland
	]em
	" series that received a Western release. The series itself is rather loosely related to the 
	[em 
		"Kirby
	]em
	" series: both have been developed by the same company (
	[a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_Laboratory rel=noopener external nofollow 
		"HAL Laboratory
	]a
	"), and Eggerland protagonists Lolo and Lala make cameo appearances in Kirby games as Lololo and Lalala.
