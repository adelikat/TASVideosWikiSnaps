	" is a puzzle game that was originally developed for Amiga computers before being ported to numerous other computer systems and home consoles, one of them being the Sega Genesis. The objective of the game is to guide a large number of walking, mindless beings known as Lemmings away from danger and towards the exit. There are a limited number of tools that can be used to achieve this objective such as giving individual Lemmings the ability to climb, dig, or even build stairwells. Every level has a set number of Lemmings that have to reach the exit in order to complete it.
