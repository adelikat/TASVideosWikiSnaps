	[em 
		"Wait and See!
	]em
	" is a pirate game based off of 
	[em 
		"Nu, pogodi!
	]em
	" (
	[em 
		"Ну, погоди!
	]em
	"), a Russian cartoon about a wolf chasing a rabbit. In this game, the rabbit looks a lot like Bugs Bunny, and he collects carrots (which magically turn into mushrooms) as he runs to the end of each stage. Bad controls and jumping physics make this a hard game to beat in real-time.
