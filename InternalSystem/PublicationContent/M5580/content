	[em 
		"Spinmaster

	", known in Japan as 
	[em 
		"Miracle Adventure
	]em
	" (ミラクルアドベンチャー), is a beat 'em up game that was developed by Data East and published by SNK for the arcades. In this game, you play as Johnny and Tom, two treasure seekers that are out to save Johnny's girlfriend and gather map pieces in order to find the biggest treasure in the world. Along the way, they must fight through lots of quirky henchmen, large bosses, and more using a variety of weapons and superpowers they can pick up. All of this is accompanied by cartoony graphics and lots of stock settings you'd expect in an adventure game from the '90s.
