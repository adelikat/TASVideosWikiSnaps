[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Animal Match
	]em
	" is a matching pairs video game for the Commodore 64 that was published in the December 1987 issue of the 
	[em 
		"Compute's! Gazette
	]em
	". It has two modes: one where numbered spots are matched by the animals that are under them and another where the matched pairs have to also match the animal displayed on the screen by the game. While the first mode is simple enough, the second mode requires a little more memorization to complete.
