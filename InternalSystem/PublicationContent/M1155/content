		"Super Spy Hunter

	" (1992) was originally released in Japan under the name 
	[em 
		"Battle Formula
	]em
	" (バトルフォーミュラ). The game has "become" a sequel to Spy Hunter, the arcade classic from 1983, already after its initial release — when the developer purchased the license from 
	[a class=extlink href=http://www.midway.com/ rel=nofollow 
		"Midway

	"Since the main character drives a wheeled vehicle, this game shows to be the rare kind of a 
	[em 
		"variable scrolling speed
	]em
	" shooter, where you can slow the car down if you can't keep up with the action (which obviously never happens in a TAS). The core gameplay holds true to its spiritual predecessor, but this time it's spiced up with stage bosses and various sorts of powerups.
