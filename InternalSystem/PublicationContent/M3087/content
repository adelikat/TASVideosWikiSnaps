	" is the third game of the Tony Hawk series. This one introduced the revert and double tap tricks, which allowed for much longer and higher scoring combos. There are 8 main levels in the game along with a secret level unlocked after completing the final competition. Six of the levels have goals scattered across the level, with the remaining three being competitions.
