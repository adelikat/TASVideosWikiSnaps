	" (비씨 스토리) is a minigame-focused arcade game made by Korean game developer Semicom. From what can be gleamed from the gameplay and the opening scene, the game takes place in an anachronistic version of neolithic times. Here, a tribe upholds a tradition where an erupting volcano will chose for them their next leader. However, this time the volcano has chosen three people from their tribe, Sonlo, Ballo, and Milo. The three must now compete in various minigames and competitions so they can prove themselves which is the most worthy to lead the tribe.
