	[em 
		"Miracle(s) of Almana
	]em
	") is a Japan-only game by Konami with a protagonist that heavily resembles Indiana Jones. Unlike Dr. Jones, the unnamed hero does not wield a whip. Instead, he has an even more useful grappling hook that allows him to do tricks that Indiana Jones would envy and perform shortcuts that skip large portions of levels.
