	[em 
		"Escape From the Room With the Three Keys
	]em
	") is an escape room Flash game developed by Yomino Kagura and one of many escape room games made by them. This iteration puts emphasis on having to find three special keys. Keys are often used to unlock things in these kinds of games. Or maybe they aren't sometimes. Maybe the keys unlock things another way. You're gonna have to search for clues and use some more unconventional thinking if you're gonna get out of the room.
