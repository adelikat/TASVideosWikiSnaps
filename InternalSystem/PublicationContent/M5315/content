	" for the Game Boy Color. One night, as a young witch is getting ready to turn in for the day, Mona, the witch's pet cat, decides to stay up for a little longer and reach for the treats that the witch left behind. However, things go wrong in the process and the witch's hat lands on Mona's head, bringing everyone around her to life. It's now up to Mona to make things right with the magic granted by the witch's hat.
