	" is a Flash puzzle game that follows the tradition of games like

		"The Impossible Quiz
	]em
	" of not quite traditional puzzles. While this game is easier than a lot of its ilk, it still has deceptively simple questions and challenges that require non-conventional ways of thinking. It also differs by having a field to type in answers for some questions instead of solely being a point-and-click game.
