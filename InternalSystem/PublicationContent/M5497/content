[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Thy Dungeonman
	]em
	" is a text-based adventure game that originates from the 
	[em 
		"Homestar Runner
	]em
	" Flash cartoon. It is a parody of such adventure games and features a coarse butchery of Shakespearean English and lots of odd logic and surreal settings. Playing the game can be likened to a dream, familiar but very off.
