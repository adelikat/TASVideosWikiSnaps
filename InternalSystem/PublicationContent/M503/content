[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Deadly Towers
	]em
	" is an annoying enough game to play, let alone make a TAS of, but the author manages a final time almost 3.5 minutes faster than the previous version. This improvement is mainly from buying orange scrolls, which are used to teleport from the top of each tower back down to the Holy Flame. Check the author's comments for more detailed information.
