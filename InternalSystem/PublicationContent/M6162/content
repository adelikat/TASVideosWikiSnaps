		"Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story
	]em
	" is a licensed game that's very loosely based on the movie of the same name. While most versions of the game are proper fighting games, the Sega Master System and Game Gear versions are side-scrolling beat 'em ups. Play as Bruce Lee as he goes through various settings and fights various bad guys that don't exist in the movie, much less in Lee's real life experiences. Settings include a possible meat-packing factory, a logging facility filled with giant ice cubes, and a Japanese graveyard that's led by a samurai boss.
