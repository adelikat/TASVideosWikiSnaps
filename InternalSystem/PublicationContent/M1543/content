		"Gimmick!
	]em
	" (1992) is another gem from Sunsoft, the company that brought us

	]em
	" and 
	[em 
		[a class=intlink href=/2002M 
			"Journey to Silius
		]a
	]em
	". It was only released in Japan and Scandinavian countries, but eventually achieved something of a cult status thanks to its refined gameplay, as well as exceptional music and graphic design.

	"The plot follows a green toy on a quest to rescue a little girl from the clutch of other toys, who were rightfully upset at her forsaking them in favor of our protagonist. What these other toys can't do, however, is conjure stars to use them both as projectiles and very effective transportation devices!

	" by nearly a whole minute thanks to a lot of new and refined tricks and shortcuts. This run doesn't collect the special items required to access the 7th level, and thus gets a bad ending. However, we have another
