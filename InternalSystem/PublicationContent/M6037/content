			"Golf with Your Mario
		]a
	]em
	" is a ROM hack of 
	[em 
		"Super Mario 64
	]em
	" that was created by aglab2 as part of SimpleFlips's Slide Hack Competition 2024. It turns the platforming of the original game into a short game of minigolf with Mario himself as the ball. Like the game of minigolf itself, the goal is to launch Mario to the hole at the other side of the course in a few strokes as possible. Certain platforming mechanics from the original game such as walljumping have been retained for certain courses. The title is a pun on that of the similar game 
	[em 
		"Golf With Your Friends
	]em
	".
