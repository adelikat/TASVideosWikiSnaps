	[em 
		"Your Sinclair
	]em
	" magazine as an April Fools joke. At the start of the game, you are given the illusion of choice with six lawnmowers, five of which don't work. After that, you mow the lawn. After enough lawns have been mowed, you suddenly die due to the lawnmower hitting a rock and exploding, according to the magazine. You can continue mowing after that, however.
