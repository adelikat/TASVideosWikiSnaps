	" is a soccer simulation for the Commodore 64. Compared to most other sports video games made at the time, this game shows a surprising amount of depth. The ball can be kicked towards the goal in different ways, passes can be made to throw off opponents, and the goalkeeper can be tricked. The AI opponent is also relatively well-made, being able to utilize these gameplay elements.
