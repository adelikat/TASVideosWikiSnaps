[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Battle Kid: Fortress of Peril
	]em
	" may look old, but it's actually released in 2010! Mainly inspired by the PC game 
	[em 
		(__wikiLink|displaytext=I Wanna Be the Guy|href=/1492G)
	]em
	", this game is classic platforming action, where anything can kill the player in one single hit. While it's not unfair (as opposed to 
	[em 
		"I Wanna Be the Guy
	]em
	"), it's still really hard.

[div class=p 
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/Aglar 
		"Aglar
	]a
	" collects every item and key before going to the last area, and takes the right path to get to the best ending, all of this on the hardest difficulty possible and without taking any damage!
