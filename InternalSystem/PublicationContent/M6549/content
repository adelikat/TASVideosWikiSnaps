[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Decipede
	]em
	" is an arcade-like shooter for the Commodore 64 that was published in the January 1987 issue of the 
	[em 
		"Compute's! Gazette
	]em
	". It is an unofficial port of the arcade classic 
	[em 
		"Centipede
	]em
	" with the screen adjusted for the Commodore 64's monitor. The gameplay is just like the original: you control a gun to kill a centipede and other insects such as spiders, fleas, and scorpions. The centipede will separate into multiple pieces if its middle parts are shot off.
