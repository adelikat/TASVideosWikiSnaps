		"Pokémon: Yellow Version
	]em
	" is part of the first generation of games within its famous series, known for having a very large number of beneficial glitches. In fact, the games can be completed in less than one minute of in-game time by save data corruption as shown by 
	[a class=intlink href=/2687M 
		"this run
	]a
	", and completed in around 10 minutes using a more "conventional" glitch, as shown by 
	[a class=intlink href=/3655M 
		"this run
	]a
	". These runs break the game, and avoid much of the gameplay intended by the developers.

	"In contrast, this run by TiKevin83 refrains from using any memory corrupting glitches and beats the game in a little over an hour and half. The Pokédoll trick is used to skip a dungeon in the game, but that is considered a minor developer oversight and does not corrupt the memory.
