	"Skitchin' is a racing game released in 1994 by EA. It is the spiritual successor to the Road Rash series. The goal of the game is to rollerblade to the finish line, grabbing cars to boost your speed (the titular "skitching"), performing tricks, and knocking over other racers with various weapons.
