	[em 
		"Deadly Towers
	]em
	" is an infamous 'Nintendo Hard' game, where you control Prince Myer in his quest to destroy seven bells guarded by seven bosses and stop the evil wizard Rubas. The character is slow and takes a lot of damage very easily, making the game usually a great challenge. While there are powerups which boost your abilities, they are generally found in secret passages with no indication of their location.

	" (魔鐘) is used due to it containing an inventory glitch that, essentially, gives you unlimited bells after death-warping and defeating Cold Killer twice. New routes, sequence breaking, and movement optimizations are also involved in this updated run.
