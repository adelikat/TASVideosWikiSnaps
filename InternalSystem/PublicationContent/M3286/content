	"The game is based on the popular French comics series Ast√©rix. It is 50 B.C., and the entire Gaul (today's France) is conquered by the Romans. Only one village still remains independent, thanks to the incredible powers of its two great warriors, Asterix and Obelix. In the game, they must first of all liberate the village Orvio and rescue their friend Dogmatix.
