		"Clash at Demonhead
	]em
	" is a complex game to say the least. There are
	$LF
	"over 40 levels in the game, and they are all connected to each
	$LF
	"other. In the network of levels the player must find 6 medallions
	$LF
	"and then rescue the kidnapped professor. This is no simple task.
	$LF
	"To make things even harder for a (tool-assisted) speedrunner, there
	$LF
	"are items available that greatly increase the player's speed, but
	$LF
	"in return cost money. This means that the route and strategy must
	$LF
	"be carefully planned.

	"This movie certainly does not lack speed or complexity. The movie
	$LF
	"is especially entertaining if you have played the game and know
	$LF
	"how hard it is.
