	[em 
		"The Great Life-Ending Adventure
	]em
	", having been released over a decade after. In the time since the first game, many other incredibly hard games besides 
	[em 
		"I Wanna Be the Guy
	]em
	" have came out. One game in particular has caught the eye and attention of a large number of Japanese gamers, 
	[em 
		"Undertale
	]em
	". 
	[em 
		"The Big Adventure of Owata's Life 2

	" switches to the format of the fights in that game halfway through after some platforming reminiscent of 
	[em 
		"I Wanna Be the Guy
	]em
	".
