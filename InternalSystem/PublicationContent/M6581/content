	]em
	". You control a tank of your choice that fires slow-moving missiles, and your objective is to shoot down any tank that comes within your sights. If you miss, the tank will turn towards you and take a shot at you. The enemy tanks never miss so it's imperative that you don't miss as well or your tank will be destroyed.
