	[em

	" for the Famicom, of which the prequel (

	[em 
		"Les Chevaliers du Zodiaque: La Légende d'Or
	]em
	". It is a RPG/beat 'em up hybrid that adapts the Twelve Temples arc from the manga, where the Bronze Saints have to save Saori Kido from a fatal injury by finding the Pope, the only one that can heal her. To do this, the Bronze Saints must cross the Twelve Temples of the Zodiac, each one guarded by a Gold Saint. The sections where the player goes to the temple is shown as a side-scrolling beat 'em up and the fights with the Gold Saints are played like a turn-based RPG.
