		"Kaizo Mario

	[em

	[a class=extlink href=http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm3787152 rel=nofollow 
		"post the results on Nicovideo
	]a
	". By chance, this hack made its fame on Youtube when a team of Let's Play gamers obtained the hack and

		"the first part of ProtonJonSA's attempt of Special Stage 2 and his subsequent nervous breakdown

		"third installment
	]a
	" of the 
	[em 
		"Kaizo Mario

	" series. In addition to the video's popularity, the hack is well-done in comparison to the previous two.

	"Themes that are common to Kaizo hacks:
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" Extremely rigid windows of opportunity, with missed opportunities resulting in death.

	]li
	[li 
		" Set-ups that demand the highest caliber of Super Mario World physics abuse.

	]li
	[li 
		" Set-ups that require stunts that are tantamount to glitches.

		" Traps that cannot be foreseen without knowing that they exist, including but not limited to invisible blocks and being killed after apparently clearing a level.

	"In this run, 
	(__wikiLink|user:ISM)
	" and 
	(__wikiLink|user:Mister)
	" break the game completely with glitches, just as in the 
	[a href=/2307M 
		"96-exit TAS
	]a
	" of 
	[em 
		"Super Mario World
	]em
	". Said glitches involve making things appear out of nowhere, glitching through walls, and carrying Yoshi through to the next level, something not intended by the maker of this hack.
