	" is the sixth installment in Neversoft's 
	[em 
		"Tony Hawk's

	" series and is the sequel to 
	[em 
		"Underground
	]em
	". The gameplay in 
	[em 
		"Underground 2
	]em
	" is similar to that of previous 
	[em 
		"Tony Hawk
	]em
	" games: the player skates around in a 3D environment modeled after various cities and attempts to complete various goals. Most goals involve skating on or over various objects or performing combos. Scores are calculated by adding the sum of the point value of each trick strung together in a combo and then multiplying by the number of tricks in the combo.
