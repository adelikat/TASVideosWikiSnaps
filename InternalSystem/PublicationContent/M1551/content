		"Kid Kool
	]em
	", a game created by Vic Tokai, stars "Kool" as he gains 7 magical herbs to cure the king of a dreaded illness. He does this along with his helpful red partner "Wicky" who can kill enemies and help defeat bosses. If the player fails to complete the game in under three hours (in-game), then the king dies. So this is a frantic game where speed is key.
