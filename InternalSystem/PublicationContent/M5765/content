	[em 
		"SWAT: Special Weapons and Tactics
	]em
	" is a role-playing game for the Famicom that was published by Toei Animation's video game division and released only in Japan. It takes the typical terrorist hostage situation American SWAT teams are dealing with in pop culture and turns it into a turn-based RPG. Battles can done by either doing head-on gunfights or sneak attacks that supposedly deal extra damage. The building the hostages are held in becomes the overworld, where rooms can be explored for clues on how to proceed, special items, and traps that have to be disarmed. The game is also rather quite buggy, with mechanics like critical sneak attack hits not working like they should.
