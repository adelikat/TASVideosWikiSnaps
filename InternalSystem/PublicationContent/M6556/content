	"The game features multiple gameplay modes: Marathon mode, where a game is played until the the grid is totally filled with blocks; Challenge mode, where players compete against computer-controlled opponents; Time Zone mode, where the goal is to score as much as possible under a time limit; Line Clear mode, where the player must clear a certain number of lines to advance; Puzzle mode, where specific arrangements of blocks have to be cleared with only a limited number of moves; and Garbage mode, which is similar to Marathon mode only with garbage blocks constantly spawning.
