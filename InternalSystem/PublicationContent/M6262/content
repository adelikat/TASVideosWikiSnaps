		"Pokémon Gold Silver

	" (Pokemon 金銀) is an unlicensed platforming game that was developed for the SNES by an unknown East Asian team. It features music stolen from the SNES game

	[em 
		(__wikiLink|displaytext=Trials of Mana|href=/876G)
	]em
	". In this game, you choose from either "Chokorita" (Chikorita) or "Waninoko" (Totodile) and play through four levels of rather laggy platforming filled with misplaced Pokémon from the first two generations. All of this culminates in a final battle with Mewtwo that you can win with your unevolved starters, no matter how implausible that may be.
