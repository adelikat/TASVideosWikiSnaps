	[em 
		"Blades of Vengeance
	]em
	" is a platform game incorporating light RPG elements and character styling, reminiscent of 
	[em 
		"Gods
	]em
	" by The Bitmap Brothers. The Dark Lady has unleashed hordes of monsters whom the protagonist must slay. The player can choose from three main characters - the Huntress, Warrior and Sorcerer, all of which have different abilities. Throughout the game the player has the option to improve their powers by collecting armour and weapons (such as a mace and a crossbow) or by using spells. Each of the eight stages ends with a boss.
