		"Sid Meier's Railroad Tycoon
	]em
	" is a simulation game developed by MPS Labs and published by Microprose in 1990. The goal of this game is to normally rack up as much money as possible by expanding the railroad empire across the land, building stations, buying trains, creating industries and fending off the competition, with a starting capital of £1 million, in order to retire with the highest job rank.
