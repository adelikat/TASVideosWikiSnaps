	" (room6 プー太) is the sixth game in indie developer Ichima's Escape Room game series. For this game, you are stuck in what appears to some sort of daycare, with only you and an animate teddy bear in it. Now you could get something big and sturdy and break through the windows so you can escape, but the teddy bear is watching. You must work with the teddy bear and find items and codes so you can escape through the locked front door.
