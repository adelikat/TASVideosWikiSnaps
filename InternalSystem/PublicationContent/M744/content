Guide Nightshade through Metro City as he builds popularity and fights rats, gentlemen, female ninjas, and most importantly museum statues.

	"Unfortunately, the only escape from a deathtrap seen in this run is the deathtrap Nightshade finds himself in at the beginning; however, one of the highlights of this game which can also be enjoyed in this run is the hilarious dialogue, such as talk of being threatened by the legalization of wooden nickels.
