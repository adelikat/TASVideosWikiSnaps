	"Mega Man X2 makes a particularly interesting run as many of 
	$LF
	"the weapons can actually be used in mobility, such as a 
	$LF
	"grappling hook or even a weapon which can make 
	$LF
	"enemies into platforms.  The author takes special care to ensure 
	$LF
	"that when there is a situation in which a weapon would help him 
	$LF
	"progress quicker, he uses it.

	"In order to get the Shouryuken (flame uppercut) seen used towards the end of the movie, 
	$LF
	"the author must first collect 100% of items, such as Heart Tanks, Sub 
	$LF
	"Tanks, and Item Capsules.  However, because these powerups are not far 
	$LF
	"out of the way, and because the Shouryuken saves so much time later on, 
	$LF
	"it turns out that this movie may also prove to be as fast as possible.
