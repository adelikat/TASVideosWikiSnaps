	" is an action platformer for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn that is based off the movie of the same name. It ignores the plot of the movie in favor of following five characters and their journeys across Isla Sorna, one of InGen's private islands for creating artificial dinosaurs. Three of the characters are dinosaurs of different species and two of them are humans, an unnamed human hunter and scientist Sarah Harding. Each character has their own set of levels and objectives and own ways of surviving in them. For example, the dinosaurs can kill humans and other dinosaurs to increase their stats and the humans can collect health items and weapons.
