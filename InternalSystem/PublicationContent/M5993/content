	" is a platforming beat 'em up game developed by Radical Entertainment and starring Hong Kong action movie star Jackie Chan. It is notable for having most of its action animations based on motion capture by Jackie Chan and his personal stunt team. The story begins with Jackie Chan as a delivery boy receiving a mysterious package. Not long after, he finds his uncle being kidnapped by local crime boss Dante, who demands the package as ransom. It's up to Jackie to rescue his uncle by fighting Dante and his goons all over New York City, from top to bottom.
