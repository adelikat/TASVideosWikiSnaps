	"This video uses a password to go directly to the second, harder version of the game. Note that the password shown on screen is not the one actually accepted by the game - the password is entered so fast the graphic function glitches. Another (more useful) glitch is that you can stand on spikes and other sorts of materials which ultra-powerful gigantic mechadroids have a natural weakness against if you jump all the time.

It is not very effective against the sixth boss, so the author switches to a better projectile weapon before that. This switch entails that the rematches against the earlier bosses are slower, but the improvement on the sixth boss makes up for it.
