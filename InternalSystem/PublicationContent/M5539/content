For this game, Ichima decides to take a more enigmatic approach to the room design, with you trapped in a nice looking vintage house filled with fancy furniture and trinkets. Some of those trinkets are important, however, in escaping from the house. Unlike the previous escape rooms, this one will require more involved puzzle solving as there is more than just the room you initially see.
