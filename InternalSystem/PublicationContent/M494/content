	"The second published warpless Super Mario Bros. 2 movie, now over a minute faster than the previous movie by a different author. Time was gained mostly from some tactical changes as well as being more precise and using Toad more often. A trick involving a glitch with a certain boss also helped reduce the time greatly. Check the author's comments at the submission page for detailed information.
