	"This game is a mix between a shooter and a platformer: the player walks through the caves, jumps over obstacles and shoots everything in sight. Well, at least if he has a weapon: at the beginning he is unarmed and can only kick or punch. He has to find pyramids which were dropped by his dead colleagues (also sometimes from killed aliens), which grant an armor piece, more life energy and a weapon. When the player finds a pyramid, the weapon gets upgraded for a limited amount of time.
