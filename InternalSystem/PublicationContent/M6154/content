	" is a licensed sports game for the Sega Genesis by EA Sports. The gameplay is similar to many other sports games: you choose your team, choose your side of the court, and play a game of ice hockey where you have control of whichever teammate is closest to the puck. And as a bonus, the game has in-court fights that break out from time to time.
