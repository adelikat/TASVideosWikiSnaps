	[em 
		"Mega Man: The Sequel Wars
	]em
	" is a currently in-progress compilation of fan remakes of 
	[em 
		"Mega Man 4
	]em
	", 
	[em 
		"5
	]em
	", and 
	[em 
		"6
	]em
	" for the Sega Genesis and serves as an unofficial sequel to 
	[em 
		"Mega Man: The Wily Wars
	]em
	". It expands on what 
	[em 
		"The Wily Wars
	]em
	" offers by adding additional characters to play as (Proto Man and Roll), more graphical effects that can be turned off, and a couple of neat Easter eggs that are nods to glitches that can be done in the original NES games.
