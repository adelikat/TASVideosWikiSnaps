[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Space is Key Hell
	]em
	" is a Flash platforming game and a sequel in the 
	[em 
		"Space is Key
	]em
	" series. As with the other games in the series, it is an autoscroller where the only button available is "jump". The premise here is that you somehow found yourself in Hell, and you must now jump your way out and escape.
