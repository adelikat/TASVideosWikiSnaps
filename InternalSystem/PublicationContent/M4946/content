[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Battleship
	]em
	" is an NES adaptation of the board game of the same name. As with the board game, your goal is to sink your opponent's battleships by correctly guessing the locations of where they are and launching attacks at those locations. You don't know where your opponent's ships are from the start and neither does your opponent for your ships, but with proper guesswork, you can tell where they are soon enough. The NES version adds additional features such as special weapons that can hit more than once per turn.
