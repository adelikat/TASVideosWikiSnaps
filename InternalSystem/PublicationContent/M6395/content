		"Popeye
	]em
	" is an arcade game that was developed by Nintendo and designed by Shigeru Miyamoto. It is a licensed adaptation of the cartoon of the same name. The objective of the game is to have Popeye collect whatever Olive Oyl throws from the top of the screen, whether they are hearts, musical notes, or letters that spell out a word. If any of these objects land on the water at the bottom of the screen, Popeye has a limited amount of time to get them before they disappear and he loses a life. To make things more difficult, Bluto and other enemies of Popeye are out to stop him.
