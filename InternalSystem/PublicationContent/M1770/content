	"Several factors make this game quite difficult. For instance, after taking damage, Bugs cannot swing his hammer until the damage blinking stops. When an enemy is hit with the hammer but doesn't die, he is pushed back a little. These factors make it tricky to coordinate multiple hits on a boss in a row. Also, some of the later stages are quite mazelike with their network of warp entrances (similar to warp pipes in 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Super Mario Bros|href=/1715M)
	"). In addition, a TASer needs to manage heavy lag and avoid collecting too many bonus carrots (so that fewer time-wasting bonus games are played after the stages).
