	[em 
		"Tiger Jenny
	]em
	" is an unfinished NES homebrew game that serves as a prequel to 
	[em 
		"Ittle Dew
	]em
	". Taking place 1000 years before 
	[em 
		"Ittle Dew
	]em
	", you play as Jenny Tiger, a legendary warrior who unfortunately met her demise in a toothbrush incident. She must fight and defeat the Lichious Turnip, the leader of the Turnip race that threatens Jenny's race. Jenny initially starts out with a very short ball and chain for a weapon, but it can be upgraded to be longer, making it resemble the Vampire Killer from 
	[em 
		"Castlevania
	]em
	".
