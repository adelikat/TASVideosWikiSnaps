[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Kaboom!
	]em
	" is an arcade-style game that was developed by Activision for the Atari 2600. It borrows a few gameplay elements from the Atari arcade game 
	[em 
		"Avalanche
	]em
	", but focuses on having to catch items with only one paddle instead of a column of paddles. In 
	[em 
		"Kaboom!
	]em
	", a mad bomber is terrorizing the place by throwing bombs everywhere, and you have to foil his attempts by catching his bombs with a single bucket of water that will put out the fuses of each bomb when caught. If you miss too many bombs, the game is over.
