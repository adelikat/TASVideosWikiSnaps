	") is a Flash game from the escape room subgenre from Yomino Kagura. In this iteration, you are trapped with a room with a "strange ornament", which is an ordinary hourglass. This hourglass sits on a shelf that's suspiciously designed to look like a four-digit number. One of many clues needed to find the code to unlock the exit door? You're gonna have to find out.
