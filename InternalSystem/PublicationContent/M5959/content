[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Tekken Tag Tournament
	]em
	" is a fighting game that was initially released for the arcades in 1999 and is the fourth game in the 
	[em 
		"Tekken
	]em
	" series. Unique to this entry is a tag team system, where players can swap out the characters they're using mid-fight with other characters. This can be done to conserve heath, build combos, or utilize special tag team moves. Unlike other games that use tag teams such as the 
	[em 
		"Capcom Vs.
	]em
	" series, a player can win a round by having to deplete the health of only one of their opponent's characters.
