	[em 
		"Revenge of the Ninja
	]em
	", also known as 
	[em 
		"Ninja Hayate
	]em
	" (忍者ハヤテ), is a full-motion video adventure game that was made by Taito to capitalize on the FMV quick time event subgenre that 
	[em 
		"Dragon's Lair
	]em
	" pioneered. Like the game that inspired it, the gameplay has the player choose a path at critical moments in the game that will either kill the player, keep them alive, or go down towards a different path. These moments only give seconds to make a choice, and not making a choice in time invariably leads to the player dying. As for the plot, it is essentially 
	[em 
		"Dragon's Lair
	]em
	" but set in Feudal Japan and Singe the Dragon replaced by a ninja master. Hayate the ninja sets off to save his beloved princess from the ninja master, braving through numerous traps, enemy ninjas, and other weird enemies.
