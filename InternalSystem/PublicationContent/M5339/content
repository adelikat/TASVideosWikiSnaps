	" is the word game that took 2021 by storm and has received ports to more than just smartphones and tablet PCs. The rules are simple. You have six tries to guess a five-letter word. If you get the word wrong, the letters that are correct and in the right position are colored green and the letters that are in the word but are in the wrong position are colored yellow. You use those clues to guess the word until you get it right or you run out of tries.
