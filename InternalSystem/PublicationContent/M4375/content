	" is an arcade styled Genesis game in which a small blue bird (Flicky) tries to rescue some other bird's children. In doing so, he must travel through a series of houses, some being in Egypt, others in space. He must avoid the tigers and chameleons who just happen to be in the houses too, and occasionally he takes a break to look through the windows and see an undressed lady posing.
