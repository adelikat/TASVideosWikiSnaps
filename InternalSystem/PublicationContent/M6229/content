	") is an escape room-style Flash game by Yomino Kagura and the first sequel to 
	[em 
		"3-tsu no E no Heya Kara no Dasshutsu
	]em
	". This iteration of the setting tries add some variety with more interesting pictures in the portraits, with one of them being a photo of the moon. Aside from that, the objective is the same where you have to find the key needed to leave the room by finding clues and solving a series of puzzles.
