		"Metal Mech: Man & Machine
	]em
	" is a poorly-designed platformer. It has some similarities to Blaster Master: you play as a red-suited man who can pilot a larger vehicle in your quest to destroy aliens. In the first five levels, the mech is usually abandoned in favor of silly-looking bunny-hopping through the levels to get a key (the circular icon with a red K) and reach the end of the stage. The last level features a giant blue robot that flies through the level and fights the Alien Queen at the end.
