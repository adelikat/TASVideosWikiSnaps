	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" Very unforgiving. Intuition will not work. Mistakes are not allowed. Most paths are one-way.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" In order to complete the game, the player is required to collect some mushrooms, only to lose them soon thereafter.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" In order to complete the game, the player is required to abuse many of the glitches of the game (such as passing through walls in a multitude of different ways).
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Savestates are practically required for completing the game.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" You can jump any time you wish, even if you are in air. Genisto however avoids using this feature except when necessary.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" This movie involves a death. As the game starts with 0 extra lifes, the player must gain one 1UP to afford that death.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" In stage 3-2, Mario just sleepwalks through the stage. The player has no control there.

[p 
	"Anyone can make as psychedelic looking hack as this one is,
	$LF
	"but it is not as mindless as it first seems.
	$LF
	"It has been designed by someone who has firm knowledge of the
	$LF
	"game's quirks, and you need to have the same level of knowledge
	$LF
	"in order to complete the game.
	$LF

[p 
	"Gaining the 1UP is accomplished by collecting 100 coins. However, most of the coins
	$LF
	"are either hidden, or trapped so that they must be collected in a certain order.
	$LF
	"Some coins are traps in themselves, and must not be collected, because doing so
	$LF
	"the player would not be able to return to the right path.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The death, however, is not mandatory. As Bisqwit
	$LF
	[a class=intlink href=/Media/Pending/Smb1-air-end-no-death.fcm 
		"demonstrates
	]a
	",
	$LF
	"the game is also completable without death (and thus, without collecting
	$LF
	"those coins). (Note: The shooting at Koopa in the demonstration has nothing
	$LF
	"to do with this point. It only shows that the hit counter overflowed.)
	$LF
	"Bisqwit is unsure whether this manner of completion is what the creator
	$LF
	"of the hack had in mind. 
	$LF
	"Considering that dying leads to the lowerside tunnel, it is possible
	$LF
	"that the death was intended to be mandatory.
