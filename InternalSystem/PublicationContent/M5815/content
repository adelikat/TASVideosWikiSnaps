Taking place shortly after the movie, you are an InGen scientist that's tasked with going to the island Isla Nublar to collect eggs from the genetically modified dinosaurs on the island. However, the Biosyn Corporation is out to do the same thing and is sabotaging InGen's efforts, starting with bombing your transport helicopter. You must now get the dinosaur eggs in under 12 hours before Biosyn's hunters do and safely get off the island afterwards.
