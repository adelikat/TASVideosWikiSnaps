	]em
	" is a rather strange South Korean game that is based on the prank known as "Kanchou" (カンチョー) or "Ddongchim" (똥침). It utilizes a unique controller setup consisting of a plastic buttocks and a large white hand with its index finger sticking out. Using the plastic hand or your own hands, you either insert the hand's finger into the buttocks or slap the butt cheeks and the game then judges you based on how much pressure you put into the buttocks. If you applied the correct amount of pressure into the character, you win. If not, you are mocked by the character and given another chance. There are a number of colorful characters to perform kanchou on, some of them being quite unsavory.
