	" is a maze-like shooter that was created for the ZX Spectrum by Matthew Smith, who also created 
	[em 
		(__wikiLink|displaytext=Manic Miner|href=/3453G)
	]em
	". It's a very short game that's split into three sections: a maze filled with spiders, an underwater section filled with enemy fish, and a final dungeon filled with even more spiders and some hooded evil guy. With the ability to shoot laser beams, your goal is to kill the hooded evil guy.
