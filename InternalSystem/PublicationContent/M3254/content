		"Zelda II: The Adventure of Link
	]em
	" (1988), which introduced RPG elements and a side-scrolling view instead the traditional Zelda overhead view. An evil magician has cast a sleep spell on Princess Zelda. Link must place 6 crystals in palaces throughout Hyrule in order to release the binding force that protects the Triforce of Courage hidden in the Great Palace.

	"This movie avoids using the extremely gamebreaking hyperspeed and scroll-lock glitches seen in the 
	[a class=intlink href=/2652M 
		"warp glitch

	" branch. This movie also avoids all of the minorly gamebreaking wrong warps in order to significantly increase the technical skill required to create the movie; we also have 
	[a class=intlink href=/3256M 
		"a movie
	]a
	" which does use these "glitched warps," which allows a rather different route through the game.
