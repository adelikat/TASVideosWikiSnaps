		"Out to Lunch
	]em
	" is a little-known, very fast-paced platforming game where you play as a chef whose food has escaped and your goal is to recapture the food items from around the world. However, this is difficult due to strict time limits, a small amount of lives, and tough enemies that can either kill you or infect the food and turn it against you.
