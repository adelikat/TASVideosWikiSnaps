[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Mutant League Hockey

	" is the ice hockey spinoff to 
	[em 
		"Mutant League Football
	]em
	". It is a much more violent take on hockey, with players much more likely to die in various situations than in normal hockey. The puck can explode when picked up, land mines and big holes can litter the arena, and even the crowd can throw stuff into the arena that can be used to kill opponents more quickly. And if violence isn't enough, the referee can be bribed to give penalties to the opposing team.
