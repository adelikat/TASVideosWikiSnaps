		"Compute's! Gazette
	]em
	". It is a video game adaptation of the board game 
	[em 
		"Connect Four

	". Each player takes turns putting tokens into a vertical board, and whoever can make a line of four of their tokens vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game. In addition, another way to win in this game that you can't in original 
	[em 
		"Connect Four
	]em
	" is that whoever can get a token at the top row of the board first also wins the game.
