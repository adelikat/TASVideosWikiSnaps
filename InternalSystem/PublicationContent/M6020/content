	" is a platforming game for the SNES that was cancelled in 1994 due to its original publisher Ocean Software running into financial difficulties. It was later licensed and released in 2023 by the Retro Room, a small indie publisher. Taking place in the future of 2008, humanity has left a heavily polluted Earth in search of a more habitable planet, leaving behind the robots they built, who then quickly established their own society. A small group of military robots later took power and established a brutal totalitarian regime. Mr Tuff, a humble demolition robot, takes it upon himself to rebel against the regime and free all the robots enslaved by them.
