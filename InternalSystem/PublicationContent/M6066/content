[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Daymare Cat
	]em
	" is Flash platformer by Mateusz Skutnik. It is set in the same setting as 
	[em 
		"Daymare Town
	]em
	" and shares characters and has a similar art style. Unlike that game, 
	[em 
		"Daymare Cat
	]em
	" is a more upbeat game where you play as a little girl named Cat who has to escape Daymare Town by collecting a number of vinyl records and placing them on various gramophones across town, which will unlock the door out of Daymare Town. As each record is collected, a group of instruments can be heard playing from each one, and collecting all of them will recreate a complete song.
