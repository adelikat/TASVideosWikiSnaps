[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Balloon Blitz
	]em
	" is a arcade-style game for the Commodore 64 that was published in the August 1984 issue of the 
	[em 
		"Compute's! Gazette
	]em
	". It is a simple, if archaic, game. You control a hot-air balloon filled with a limited number bombs, and your objective is to use those bombs to destroy enemy tanks that are driving around below you. Don't assume the tanks will sit still and take the hit; they'll move out of the way if you aren't leading your shots.

	" with the tanks at their fastest speeds, not missing one tank with all 20 bombs, and does so in record time.
