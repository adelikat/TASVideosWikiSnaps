[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Simple Room
	]em
	" is the first escape room-style Flash game by Yomino Kagura. As the name implies, it's only a single simple room that you can only get out of by entering a code. To find this code, you must solve a number puzzle by finding clues around the room, which can require some pretty interesting logic.

[div class=p 
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/Spikestuff

	]a
	" here already knows the code and simply leaves the room as fast as possible.
