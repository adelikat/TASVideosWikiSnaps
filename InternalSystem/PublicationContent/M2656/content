	[em 
		"Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc
	]em
	" is the third major platform game installment in the 
	[em 
		"Rayman
	]em
	" series. It tells the story of how Rayman stops Andr√©, an evil black lum, from taking over the world with his army of sack-like "Hoodlum" soldiers. Unlike the game's predecessor, 
	[em 
		"Rayman 3
	]em
	" took a more light-hearted turn; it has sarcastic self-referential undertones and pokes fun at the platforming video game genre.
