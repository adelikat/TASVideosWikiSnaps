	"Rolan's Curse is like a simplified version of the 
	(__wikiLink|1685M|NES Legend of Zelda)
	" with slower gameplay and more restricted game world, resulting in a primitive hack-and-slash experience. Nevertheless, there exists an interesting storyline: The kingdom of Rolan has been invaded by the forces of some evil being called Barius. However, in this movie the final boss is never actually seen. Instead of meeting Barius face to face, the hero dies while defeating the first level boss. The game then decides to freak out and end right there, declaring the rest of the story unnecessary.
