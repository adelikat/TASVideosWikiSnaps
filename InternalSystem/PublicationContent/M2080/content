	"Unlike the previous movie of this category, this TAS was done using the Japanese version of the game. The reason for this is that the text is significantly faster than in the English version, which means that far less time is spent waiting for text boxes and cut scenes to end before getting back to the action. English subtitles were added to the encode for people interested in what is said.
