[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Hitstick 3: Deadly Breeze
	]em
	" is the sequel to 
	[em 
		"Hitstick 2: No Time For Diplomacy
	]em
	". As with that game, it appears to have been inspired by the 
	[em 
		"Hitman
	]em
	" series. You play as an assassin that's tasked to kill very unsavory targets, some of which plan to sell out company secrets to others and others that plan to commit war crimes with chemical weapons.
