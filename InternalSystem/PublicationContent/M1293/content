	" on Sega Genesis. Dracula rises from the dead yet again (cue groan), and it's up to Jonathan Morris, helped out by Charlotte Austin, a powerful mage student, to defeat him.

	"The use of glitchy warps is not new to Castlevania runs, but what is new is the creative use of switching between the main characters for basic character movement. We dare you to not have "Jonasan! Sharotto! Jonasan! Sharotto! Jonasan! Sharotto!" stuck in your head after watching the run.

	"In order to ensure that the weapon choice and route is optimal, the author created an alternate fully optimized test run with a new route. The run enters the final boss sooner with a weaker weapon, but spends more time fighting- so much so that 2/3ths of the movie is spent fighting Dracula! Despite using a newer version of the emulator to remove the lag issues of the published movie, the final time still comes to 47 seconds slower. The movie is different enough in execution to warrant a mention; see the
