	[em 
		"The Lost Levels
	]em
	" is a remake of the game released in Japan as 
	[em 
		(__wikiLink|displaytext=Super Mario Bros 2|href=/1882M)
	]em
	". It introduces a number of new obstacles into the standard 
	[em 
		"Super Mario Bros.
	]em
	" formula, including poisonous mushrooms, wind, reverse warp zones, and of course many tricky jumps. It's difficult enough that Nintendo of America decided to completely re-theme a different game and release that as 
	[em 
		(__wikiLink|displaytext=Super Mario Bros. 2|href=/1724M)
	]em
	" instead; 
	[em 
		"The Lost Levels
	]em
	" is the first time the Japanese sequel was released to the rest of the world.
