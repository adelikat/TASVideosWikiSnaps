	"Stuart Little, the clever, ever-cheerful mouse from the popular movie and classic children's book, is out to take on newfound enemies and domestic obstacles in order to get home safely. The game features plenty of platforms and hazards to run, jump, and flip through, and three difficulty settings. The levels are set in many of the movie's favorite locations, including the thrilling model boat race, a topsy-turvy miniature golf course, a toy cowboy town, and New York's Central Park.
