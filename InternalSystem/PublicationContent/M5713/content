	" is a tabletop board video game for the Commodore 64 that was published in the February 1985 issue of the 
	[em 
		"Compute's! Gazette
	]em
	". It is a logic-based guessing game based on 
	[em 
		"Master Mind
	]em
	" where the objective is to guess a set code within a specific number of turns. Which each guess, the game will provide feedback on which parts of the code are correct and which parts are incorrect. Extra points are given the fewer turns are used to guess the code.
