		"Final Zone II
	]em
	" is a top down shooter in which you control various soldiers throughout the game. The objective of the game is to fight an enemy army led by "ZOD", who is a mass murderer and killed some of your commando friends. There are several manga-style cutscenes in the game, all of which have been really cheesily dubbed to English. The game also features the "best" song to ever feature in a video game, that is, Momoco's theme (which you'll hear in Round 4).
