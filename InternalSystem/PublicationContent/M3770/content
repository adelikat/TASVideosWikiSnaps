Sho can learn nearly a dozen sword abilities (spinning slash, downward slash, sword shielding, etc.) by collecting powerups scattered throughout the stages. There are also the "Fire Dragon" powerups that act as single use ninja magic attacks that damage all enemies on-screen, which is the only ninja magic available to Sho.
