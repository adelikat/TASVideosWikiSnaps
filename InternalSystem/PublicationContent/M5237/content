[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Donkey Kong: Original Edition
	]em
	" is an attempt to take the Nintendo Entertainment System port of 
	[em 
		"Donkey Kong
	]em
	" and make it more like the arcade original. While still inferior to the original coin-op in terms of cutscenes, graphics, and sound, it has restored the 50M level (the pie factory level), which was absent on most home ports.
