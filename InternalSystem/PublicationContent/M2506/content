	[em 
		"Integral

	", the 1999 Japanese re-release of the original game, the VR Missions received a standalone release a year later in North America and Europe as an extra bonus to satisfy fans hungry for more tactical espionage action.

	"In the Metal Gear universe, VR serves as a substitute for combat experience, allowing trainees to learn how to use weapons and participate in advanced combat scenarios without having to actually be on the battlefield, similar to the training programs in 
	[em 
		"The Matrix
	]em
	". This concept of artificial or digital training serving as a poor manâ€™s replacement for combat experience (particularly where child soldiers are concerned) has been a running theme in the series.

	"The missions featured in this game include extended tutorials, obstacle courses, challenge maps, setpieces, and some unusual but interesting scenarios such as solving a murder mystery, knocking down guards like dominoes and destroying a UFO. As a reward for completing all the missions, you get a sneak peak at some concept art of Metal Gear RAY from the then-upcoming
