	" is the sequel to Scribblenauts, a puzzle game for the DS consisting of spawning any object from a database of thousands of possibilities (from "chair" to "God") to solve given situations. It is fundamentally the same game with two major novelties: the possibility to add adjectives (a color, a size, a state, etc.) to the objects we want to summon and the possibility to use the D-Pad to control Maxwell, the protagonist of both games, in addition to the touch screen, the only possible input method in the first installment.
