[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Myst: Masterpiece Edition
	]em
	" is an updated re-release of the epic puzzle game whose puzzles will take you hours to solve, featuring re-rendered graphics to be in 24-bit truecolour and enhanced audio. Unless, of course, you know the answer. Although you'll encounter many brainmelting puzzles when normally playing through Myst, all the game really requires you to do is flip the eight switches around the island, get the blank page and bring it to Atrus.
