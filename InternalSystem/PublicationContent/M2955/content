	[em 
		"Super Street Fighter II Turbo
	]em
	" first released on the arcades in 1996, then ported to several home consoles. The game works on a mechanic of normal blocks (which can group together into power gems), crash gems (which destroy gems of the same color), and counter gems sent over from opponents that count down until they turn into normal blocks.  Blocks fall in pairs and after the 25th pair a diamond gem appears which destroys all gems of the same color on the playfield.
