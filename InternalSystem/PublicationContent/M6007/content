	" (ロックマン3 キノコ王国の最期！？, 
	[em 
		"Rockman 3: The End of the Mushroom Kingdom!?

	") is a ROM hack of 
	[em 
		"Mega Man 3
	]em
	" that takes all the levels from 
	[em 
		"Super Mario Bros.
	]em
	" and combines them with 
	[em 
		"Mega Man 3
	]em
	"'s gameplay. Every block and warp was preserved from the original levels, and bosses and extra levels were added to make up for 
	[em 
		"Mega Man 3
	]em
	"'s romhacking limitations. And to ensure the levels aren't too difficult to complete, certain mechanics were changed such as having higher jump heights and maintained sliding momentum.
