[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Blob Land
	]em
	" is a simple homebrew NES platformer that was made for #1JAM Uno game jam. You play as a blob whose goal is to get to the portal on the other side. Enemies and colored blocks are in your way, but thankfully you can jump and consume potions that can allow you to pass through those colored blocks or even stand on top of them.
