	"A little-known game based on an old cartoon, in Bucky O'Hare you soon have access to 5 unique characters, each of which has a special ability ranging from flight to a powerful gunshot.  What's more, it is not necessary to access a menu in order to switch from character to character, allowing the player to use whomever they'd like without sacrificing any time.  A wide variation in levels is also seen, ranging from outerspace self-scrolling levels, to fast paced platform-based levels inside a large spaceship.
