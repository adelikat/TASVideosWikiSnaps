	" is a licensed video game by Imagineering — the same company that made

	]em
	" — that is loosely based off the movie of the same name. The game generally follows the plot of the movie, but everything seems to be out to get him, from spiders and animated brooms to crazy old ladies and people hiding in the bushes for some reason. Kevin McCallister must avoid all of those things and the Wet Bandits that are out to get him and find help so he can safely wait for his family to return. And the game also has the Screw Attack technique from
