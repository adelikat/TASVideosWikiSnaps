		"Bump 'n' Jump
	]em
	", also known in Japan as 
	[em 
		"Burnin' Rubber
	]em
	" (バーニンラバー), is a combat racing game that initially released for the arcades and was later ported to the Intellivision, Atari 2600, and NES. On a perilous road filled with cars and dump trucks out to ruin your day, your goal is to get to the finish line without losing all of your lives. Thankfully, to make things easier, you can bump cars to destroy them or to get a small speed boost, Trucks can't be bumped, sadly. The "Jump" part comes from having to jump rivers that have unfinished bridges.
