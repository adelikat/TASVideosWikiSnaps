	" is a side-scrolling run-and-gun game that was initially developed by Konami for the arcades. It later saw home releases for the SNES and Sega Genesis and a direct port of the arcade version for the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch. You play as one or several of four bounty hunters (Steve, Bob, Billy, and Cormano) and bravely set off for the incredibly dangerous Wild West to capture fugitives in exchange for monetary rewards and save the occasional damsel. But since this is a shooting game, this means killing all of the bandits and Indians, and you still get money for doing that.
