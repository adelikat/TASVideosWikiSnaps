	[em 
		"G-LOC: Air Battle
	]em
	" is a combat flight simulator game for the arcades and various Sega home consoles. It is a spinoff of Sega's 
	[em 
		"After Burner
	]em
	" and utilizes a special motion simulator for some of its arcade cabinets to simulate being in a fighter jet. Unlike 
	[em 
		"After Burner
	]em
	", the game is mostly played in a first-person view, only changing to a third-person view for the player to perform evasive maneuvers (the Sega Master System port version does not have this feature). As with 
	[em 
		"After Burner
	]em
	", you control an experimental fighter jet and destroy various other jets, ships, and enemy bases, eventually culminating in a dogfight with a fighter jet that's just as powerful as yours.
