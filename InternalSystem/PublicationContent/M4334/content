	" (鈴木爆発) is a bomb disposal game where the player must disassemble and disarm increasingly complicated and bizarre explosives. Given a set of tools – initially only a screwdriver and nipper; later also a wrench (spanner), allen wrench (hex key), and adhesive tape – the player must disarm each bomb within a specific time limit. The player can rotate and pan all around the object, looking for places to use different tools, but must always be mindful of the timer. If it runs out, the bomb explodes and it's game over. Additionally, there's no pausing once the timer starts, so quick thinking is critical!
