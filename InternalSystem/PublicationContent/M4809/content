		"Donkey Kong Country

	" is an SNES platforming game that has received ports to the Game Boy Color and the Game Boy Advance. While the Game Boy Advance version more or less plays the same and looks the same as the SNES version, the Game Boy Color version has a number of significant differences due to having to be ported to an 8-bit handheld console. The most noticeable difference is that Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong are much more balanced, with one not holding a significant advantage over the other.
