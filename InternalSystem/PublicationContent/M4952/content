[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Classic Concentration
	]em
	" is the NES adaptation of the game show 
	[em 
		"Concentration
	]em
	", which is based on the memory game known as 
	[em 
		"Concentration
	]em
	" or 
	[em 
		"Memory
	]em
	". The premise of the game is to make matching pairs by picking numbers on a board, which if guessed correctly will reveal parts of the board. The board will eventually reveal a puzzle, which then has to be solved for the round to end. The final round is a simple matching game that has to be fully solved under a time limit.
