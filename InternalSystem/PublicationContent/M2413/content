	"It is 16th century Japan, and you are one of two ninjas employed by Lord Gohda, a uniquely compassionate samurai lord. As either Rikimaru or Ayame, you must proceed through your assigned quests, at first dispatching the amoral and unsavory folk in your lord's domain. As the game progresses, you will come face to face with greater threats from tengu goblins and oni demons.

	" focuses on stealth and attacking unseen over straight action. Not being spotted leads to higher scores and better equipment. To aid in this, you can not only creep about and hug walls, but you can also use your grappling hook. The scenery is diverse, from Japanese castles to mountain retreats, each with their own soundtrack and types of opponents. Game engine cutscenes push the story forward, which vary slightly for the two ninjas.
