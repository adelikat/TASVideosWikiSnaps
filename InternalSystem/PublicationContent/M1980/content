			"Turrican

	]em
	" series, popular in the times of C64 and Amiga. It features Contra-like run'n'gun action crossbred with Metroid-esque exploration-driven level design and character abilities, while also being quite colorful and having remarkable soundtrack.

	"Despite having the same name as its 
	[a class=intlink href=/555M 
		"NES counterpart
	]a
	", it's not the same game. Curiously, while this version was made without Manfred Trenz (the original 
	[em 
		"Turrican
	]em
	" series designer/developer), the NES one was produced by him alone.
