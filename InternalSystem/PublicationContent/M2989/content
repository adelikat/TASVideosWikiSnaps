		"Valkyrie no Bouken: Toki no Kagi Densetsu

	" is an action-adventure game. Similar to its many contemporaries, the player roams top-down wilderness areas, fighting enemies and collecting gold and experience points, which will eventually cause the heroine to level up and become stronger. Unique to this game is the star sign system, where the player's initial choice of star sign and blood group for the heroine may affect the changes in her statistics when she levels up.
