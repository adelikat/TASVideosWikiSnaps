	[em 
		"Mega Man Network Transmission
	]em
	" is a game in the 
	[em 
		"Mega Man Battle Network
	]em
	" series, developed by Arika and published by Capcom for the Nintendo GameCube in 2003. It combines the battle chip system of the 
	[em 
		"Battle Network
	]em
	" games with the classic 
	[em 
		"Mega Man
	]em
	" level designs to create a unique game in the franchise. Battle chips can be for attacking, defending, utility purposes, or a combination of these, and can be sourced from viruses (enemies) mid-stage, bought from shops, or acquired from defeating bosses. You have a finite amount of each chip, and using them costs MP, which recovers over time.
