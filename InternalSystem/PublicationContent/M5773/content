	" that modifies Mario to be really fast. So fast that it's very hard to control Mario due to how fast he can go. He's faster than P-speed when running, and yet the P-meter isn't filled up instantly as the mechanics for that haven't been modified, only that he can go fast instantly and stop at a dime.
