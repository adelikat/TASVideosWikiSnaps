		"Mario Party Advance
	]em
	" follows a different format than the main games, since only a single person can play without connecting to another GBA. In this game, the player moves around the game board, visiting characters, running quests, and playing minigames. Many of the non-player characters are from classic Nintendo 64 games like 
	[em 
		[a class=intlink href=/Game/N64-super-mario-64 
			"Super Mario 64
		]a
	]em
	", 
	[em 
		[a class=intlink href=/Game/N64-mario-party 
			"Mario Party
		]a
	]em
	", and 
	[em 
		[a class=intlink href=/Game/N64-paper-mario 
			"Paper Mario
		]a
	]em
	".

	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/Nacho 
		"Nacho
	]a
	" manipulates luck to achieve favorable rolls. Careful Mushroom management also allows him to intentionally lose some minigames when it would be faster than beating them.
