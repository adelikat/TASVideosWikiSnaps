	"If there's one problem with 
	(__wikiLink|1588M|the SNES glitched run)
	" of this game, it's that it's over too quickly - there isn't enough time to enjoy the glitches.  If you agree, this run is for you - it completes the Palace of the Four Swords available only in this GBA port of the game in a very bizarre fashion so glitchy that not even the game's palette retains any sense of normalcy.
