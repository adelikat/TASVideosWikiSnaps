	[em 
		"SpongeBob SquarePants: Friend or Foe Trash Bash!
	]em
	" is an official Flash game adaptation of the 
	[em 
		"SpongeBob SquarePants
	]em
	" episode "Friend or Foe". The gameplay is similar to 
	[em 
		"Ice Climbers
	]em
	" in that it's a vertically-oriented platformer where the player has to climb the level and reach the top while avoiding rising poisonous sludge. It also has an additional mechanic where Mr. Krabs can throw Plankton to grab powerups, bonuses, or even pieces of the Krabby Patty secret formula at the end of the level.
