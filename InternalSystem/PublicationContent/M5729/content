	" is a top-down shooter roguelike developed by Vlambeer and released in 2016. Set in a post-apocalyptic world, the creatures, also referred to as mutants, set themselves on a journey to reach the titular throne. As a roguelike title, it features randomly generated stages, but it also features a leveling system, allowing the player to gain a mutation by collecting enough Rad (the game's equivalent to experience points) at the end of the stage.
