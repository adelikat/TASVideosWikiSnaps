	", Mario and Peach are taking a much-deserved vacation from the so often troublesome Mushroom Kingdom. Only, they quickly find out that there is trouble amuck at their island destination. A culprit has coated the world with goop and paint. Even worse, according to the locals he just happens to look like Mario. Mistaken for the true offender, Mario's would-be vacation instead turns out to be another day on the job as he is convicted of the villain's crimes and is ordered to clean up the world with a water-spewing device that straps to his back, which just happens to add a whole new layer of depth to the usual platforming action.
