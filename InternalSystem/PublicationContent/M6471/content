		"Mighty Bomb Jack
	]em
	" is a game where Jack goes to rescue his family from a pyramid. Along the way, he meets many enemies who start as mummies and change forms when they hit the ground. He also finds bomb-filled rooms at the end of each round, which work like warp rooms with a twist: you can warp ahead to the bomb room of the next round if the first lit bomb is the last bomb collected. Using this, the author warps past many rounds.
