	" is an escape room Flash game by Factory.1112. It is one of a few by the developer and was made with an easy difficulty in mind. The premise in this game is that you have decided to return and look after your parents' house for the week while they're away. As soon as you enter your old room, the door suddenly closes behind you and you discover that its doorknob appears to be missing. You know the doorknob must be somewhere in your room, but it's gonna take some searching.
