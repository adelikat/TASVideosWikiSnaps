[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Escape Game
	]em
	" is yet another game in the Flash escape room genre. The premise here is that you're an office worker that somehow forgot how to get out of your office, the exit which is locked by needlessly complicated puzzle. You must now figure out how to solve this puzzle using a number of clues that are scattered around your office.

[div class=p

	" knows exactly what to do and gets out of the nonsensically designed office as fast as possible, bypassing a couple of ultimately optional items in the process.
