	"Samus encounters a dangerous virus known as X, in which it can completely take over a living organism and mutate it. Samus after being infected has her power-suit surgically removed and is given a vaccine made from the cells from the baby Metroid she saved back on planet SR388. This makes her immune to the X virus, but something goes wrong at BSL station where parts of her powersuit were sent for examination. Samus, now with Metroid DNA, goes off to investigate the situation at BSL station.
