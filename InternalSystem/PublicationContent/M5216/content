	" is a driving/puzzle/destruction sandbox video game by Rare for the Nintendo 64. A wheeled carrier hauling a pair of defective nuclear missiles to a disposal site is locked on a straight-line course there, and the slightest jolt will cause them to detonate. Unfortunately, there are a LARGE number of obstacles in that straight-line path. The Blast Corps, a cleanup crew made up of former military personnel, have been called up to clear the way for the carrier, lest it hit something and the missiles detonate. To do this job, the Blast Corps team has access to a wide variety of vehicles to destroy the obstacles, including a rocket-launching motorbike, a somersaulting mecha robot, and a dump truck.

The trick of switching to truck/carrier view during the main levels — done in real-time speedruns to reduce lag — is not used for the sake of the viewers being able to see all of the destruction happening in the run.
