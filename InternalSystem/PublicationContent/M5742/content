	" is a platforming adventure game developed for the ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64. You play as a barbarian hero named Spartacus in a land overrun by the Evil Ones. There used to be scrolls that warded them away from the land, but they have been stolen by them and ripped to pieces. On top of that, they have kidnapped the princess and locked her away in their castle dungeon. It's up to you to find the pieces of the scroll, reassemble them, and rescue the princess before she dies in captivity.
