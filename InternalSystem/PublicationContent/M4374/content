		"The Legend of Zelda: Triforce of the Gods

	" (Mandarin: 
	[em

	") is an NES demake of 
	[em 
		(__wikiLink|displaytext=The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past|href=/191G)
	]em
	" by bootleg game developer Mars Production. The gameplay and layout of the game is very similar to 
	[em 
		"A Link to the Past
	]em
	", albeit constrained by the hardware it was developed for: some dungeons from the original game are entirely absent, the graphics are simplified, and the music consists of original tracks that include some Chinese folk songs and classical music. Another interesting difference in this demake is that Link collects coins instead of rupees.

	"A note about the Moldorm fight in this movie: the game crashes on a real console whenever Moldorm is hit by anything other than a dash attack, but curiously this does not happen when emulated. In the interest of console accuracy for the movie, the author chooses to complete the fight as it would need to be if it were being played on a console, rather than a possibly more optimal but emulator-only method.
