[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Dragon Warrior 3
	]em
	" is the last of the NES 
	[em 
		"Dragon Warrior
	]em
	" series to be TASed. This is primarily due to its unforgiving RNG. Unlike other entries in the series, you cannot manipulate critical hits and other unlikely events whenever you want. However, the author does a great job despite this obstacle. He uses many unorthodox antics (like wasting turns using useless items) in order to force a more favorable RNG. Heal spells are used in dungeons to reset the RNG in order to avoid encounters.
