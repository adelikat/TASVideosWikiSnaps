	"Dragon Warrior 3 is the last of the NES Dragon Warrior series to be TASed.  This is primarily due to its unforgiving RNG.  Unlike the others of the series, you can not manipulate critical hits, and other unlikely events whenever you want. However, the author does a great job despite this obstacle.  He uses many unorthadox antics (like wasting turns using useless items) in order to force a more favor RNG.  Heal spells are used in dungeons to reset the RNG in order to avoid encounters.
