[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Meong
	]em
	" is a puzzle game that is one of 52 games in 
	[em 
		"Action 52
	]em
	", an NES multicart infamous for its shoddy and monotonous games. The objective of the game is to get to the other end of the level while avoiding hidden mines. Those mines can reveal themselves after some time, but don't stand still for too long or you will blow up. And take note that some of the tiles may actually be walls you can't step on.
