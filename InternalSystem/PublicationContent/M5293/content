	" is an action RPG for the SNES with a great emphasis on puzzles and platforming. In addition to attacking with standard close-range weapons, you can also control Jades that can support you with long-ranged attacks and healing abilities. The story of the game follows a dragon warrior named Remeer, whose goal is to find out what happened to his long-lost father and finish what he started, finding the last of the dragons. As he goes on this journey, he will soon discover why the dragons disappeared and the nefarious force responsible.
