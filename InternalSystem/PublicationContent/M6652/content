		"All Hell Unleashed
	]em
	" is a homebrew action platformer that was developed by 8-Bit Slasher. It stars various horror movies villains ranging from slasher icons like Michael Myers from 
	[em 
		"Halloween
	]em
	" to cheesy camp villains like the Killer Klowns from Outer Space. All of them have been unleashed into the material world by an evil cult that wants to rain hell on Earth. It's up to you to stop them and restore order by finding a cursed amulet and using it to seal the dimensional rift that's letting these monsters rampage.
