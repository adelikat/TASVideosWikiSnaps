[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Pegs
	]em
	" is a board video game for the Commodore 64 that was published in the December 1986 issue of the 
	[em 
		"Compute's! Gazette
	]em
	". It is based on the board game "peg solitaire", where the objective is to eliminate pegs by choosing a peg and hopping over another one with it. The game ends when there's only one peg left on the board or the final board layout is such that no more peg-eliminating moves can be done.
