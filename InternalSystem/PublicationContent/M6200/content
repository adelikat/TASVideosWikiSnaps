[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Potholes
	]em
	" is an arcade-style game that was published for the Commodore 64 in the September 1983 issue of the 
	[em 
		"Compute's! Gazette
	]em
	". The gameplay here is akin to a simpler version of 
	[em 
		"Pac-Man
	]em
	". There are potholes all over the city, and your task is to fill up these potholes by driving over them with your car. However, there is another car that's out to stop you by crashing into you. Can you fill all the potholes before you run out of lives?
