	"The goal of the game is to collect all of the hearts in every stage and then get the ball from the chest to open the door to the next room. Though it may seem simplistic, it remains a truly well-made puzzle. Finding optimal solutions to most of the rooms has proven to be a very nontrivial task, and every once in a while a new improvement is found.
