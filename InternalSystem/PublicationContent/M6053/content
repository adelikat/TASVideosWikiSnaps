		"Rockman 2: ONN
	]em
	" is an extensive ROM hack of the 
	[em 
		"Mega Man 2
	]em
	" by Tatsu. Like many other extensive 
	[em 
		"Mega Man
	]em
	" romhacks, just about everything is modified, including the graphics, music, special weapons, and the boss AI. In addition to the usual robotic sci-fi aesthetic, it includes levels that appear to take place in more natural settings such as the sky or the jungle. As for the music, it includes arrangements of songs from other 
	[em 
		"Mega Man
	]em
	" games and games such as 
	[em 
		"Robopon
	]em
	", 
	[em 
		"Dragon Quest Monsters 2
	]em
	", and 
	[em 
		"GeGeGe no Kitarou
	]em
	". For a tracklist of all the songs featured in this romhack, you can check out
