	[em 
		"Segapede
	]em
	", also known as 
	[em 
		"Astropede
	]em
	", is an unreleased and incomplete Sega Genesis game that was conceptualized by Craig Stitt, a former Sega Technical Institute designer. It was pitched as a spinoff to 
	[em 
		"Sonic the Hedgehog
	]em
	", where the main character Zipp was meant to be a creation of Dr. Robotnik and a friend of Sonic that would be tasked with saving Robotnik's life. Sega greenlit the project, but only if it was an unconnected standalone game. The game would eventually be cancelled due to lack of manpower and STI working on too many projects that had higher priority. A prototype ROM was later donated by Stitt to the Hidden Palace website for preservation.
