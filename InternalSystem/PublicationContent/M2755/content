	[em 
		"Quattro Adventure
	]em
	" is a cart of 4 games released by Camerica in 1991. One of these 4 games is the platformer 
	[em 
		"Super Robin Hood
	]em
	" which is the subject of the current run. The game is unique in its use of hidden 'keys' that open various secret passages allowing the player access to faster routes. Combine this with a developer intended warp and major collision detection glitch and you get the current run of the game in under 5 minutes.
