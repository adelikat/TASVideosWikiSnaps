	"Eventually, the peace was broken when a ferocious fire-breathing dragon appeared out of nowhere and took over Wonder Land with an army of evil, monsterous henchmen, throwing Wonder Land immediately into utter chaos. The defenseless people were quickly taken over and the tranquil and serene kingdom was transformed into a land of demons and devils. Wonder Land was now a Monster Land. Tom-Tom, Wonder Land's last hope, is now summoned to set out on a journey, destroy this dragon, and restore peace once again.
