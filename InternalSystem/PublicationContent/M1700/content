[div class=p

	" is part of the first generation of games within its famous series, known for having a very large number of beneficial glitches.  In fact, the game can be completed in less than one minute of in-game time by save data corruption as evidenced in the 
	[a class=intlink href=/1860M 
		"run of the Yellow Version
	]a
	", but that is not used here in favour of activating a similar glitch through more conventional means - if systematic breaking of the game can be called conventional.
