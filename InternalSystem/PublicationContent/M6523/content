	]em
	", only with additional minor gimmicks such as anti-gravity tracks. Players collect powerups while racing to get speed boosts or to slow down other racers, and power slides can be done to maneuver turns better and to increase the turbo meter. As for the plot, Emperor Velo XXVII kidnaps Crash and Coco Bandicoot and forces them to participate in his galactic racing circuit or else he destroys their world.
