[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Star Evil
	]em
	" is one of too many space shooters that were bundled in the NES version of 
	[em 
		"Action 52
	]em
	". While the NES and Genesis versions of the game are virtually identical in gameplay, the manuals give both of them different stories. In the NES version, you are apparently flying through some some sort of blocky environment fighting what the manual describes as "fire creatures" that come out when the nearby star shines bright enough that there can be no night. Your objective is to kill all of these fire creatures, specifically the level bosses, so you can bring back the night.
