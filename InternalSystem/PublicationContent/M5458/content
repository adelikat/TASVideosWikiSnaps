[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Xanthiom
	]em
	" is an Atari 2600 homebrew game developed by Mathan Games in 2023. The player controls Lieutenant Grisham, on a mission to rid the threats to the galaxy on the planet Planet Coati 5. This homebrew is very much a take on what the original NES 
	[em 
		"Metroid
	]em
	" would be like on the Atari 2600 with the limitations therein.
