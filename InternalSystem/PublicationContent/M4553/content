	[em 
		"The Casebooks of Ace Harding
	]em
	" includes Game Boy ports of 
	[em 
		"Déjà Vu: A Nightmare Comes True!!
	]em
	" (previously released on Game Boy) and 
	[em 
		"Déjà Vu II: Lost in Las Vegas
	]em
	". 
	[em 
		"Déjà Vu
	]em
	" is a port of a 1987 game that had been made for various systems. It's a classic detective story, with you waking up to a dead body with total amnesia - you don't know who you are, or how you got there, and you don't know who the corpse is, either. In 
	[em 
		"Déjà Vu II
	]em
	", however, you *do* remember who you are, and you also remember that you owe some mobster a lot of money.
