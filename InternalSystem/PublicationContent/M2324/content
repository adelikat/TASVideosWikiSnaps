	" was an arcade game that was ported to the MSX by Sony in 1985. It features gameplay unusual for a shooter. You don't even need to gun down the enemy ships. Instead, you stay on one screen that loops continuously until all ground targets have been destroyed. Three screens of that and it's on to the next stage.
