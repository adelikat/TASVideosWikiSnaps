[div class=p

		"Escape from the Mindmaster
	]em
	" is a game developed for the Starpath Supercharger addon for the Atari 2600. It utilises a tape cassette through said addon to bypass the 2K limitation of available memory in the Atari 2600, providing it with an effective total of 6K for each game. A game consists of 6 levels total, with two levels per load, and thanks to the Supercharger, it also allows for better graphics and more complicated gameplay than the usual 2K cart. The goal is to escape from the maze, solving puzzles along the way.
