	[em 
		"Amy Rose in Sonic the Hedgehog
	]em
	" is a ROM hack of 
	[em 
		"Sonic the Hedgehog
	]em
	" that replaces Sonic with the character Amy Rose, using her pre-
	[em 
		"Sonic Adventure
	]em
	" design. As she was not a playable character in the classic 
	[em 
		"Sonic
	]em
	" games, this romhack gives her the abilities she had in 
	[em 
		"Sonic Advance
	]em
	". While she is slower than Sonic, she can use her Piko Piko Hammer to not only attack enemies but to also jump higher and bounce on enemies with it.
