[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Super Mario Flash
	]em
	" is a Flash game that appears to be based off of 
	[em 
		"Super Mario All-Stars
	]em
	", using the map feature from 
	[em 
		(__wikiLink|displaytext=Super Mario Bros. 3|href=/17G)
	]em
	" and the level designs from 
	[em 
		(__wikiLink|displaytext=Super Mario Bros.|href=/1G)
	]em
	" and 
	[em 
		(__wikiLink|displaytext=Super Mario World|href=/99G)
	]em
	". While it may not play exactly like the games it's based off of, the game served as a passable substitute for those in the mid-2000s who had Internet but didn't have the resources to play the original games.
