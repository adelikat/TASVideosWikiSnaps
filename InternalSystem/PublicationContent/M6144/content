[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Flagman
	]em
	" is a short Flash platforming game with a simple objective: grab the flag, place it where it belongs, and exit the level. Certain levels have some gimmicks to spice things up such as portals and spikes. In-between certain levels are boss battles where the flag only spawns when the boss is defeated.

	" in this run beats the game in record time by making good use of a glitch where the player can start a level already carrying the flag, cutting down large portions of levels.
