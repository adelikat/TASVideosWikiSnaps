[div class=p

		"Ice Palace
	]em
	" by developer K-tel Software (not to be confused with the one by Creative Sparks) is a rather obscure platforming game for the Commodore 64. A penguin wants to get to the love of his life, but she's at the top right of the screen and he's at the bottom left. Your goal is to guide that penguin using either various tricks and contraptions, or with just the penguin's plain jumping skills. The penguin also comes with the ability to create ice blocks out of thin air for select levels.
