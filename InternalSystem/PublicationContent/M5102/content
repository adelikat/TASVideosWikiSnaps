	" overseas, is an arcade platformer that later received a port to the PC Engine console. All of Buddhist Hell has run loose due to its king losing his senses, letting loose lots of monsters into the material world, and it's up to the a special Buddhist priest, whose name is Bonze Kackremboh in the international version, to go to this Hell and snap its king back to reality. With his special prayer beads and invincibility items that can let him rush through enemies unharmed, this priest will need all the help he can get facing these surreal horrors from Japanese mythology.
