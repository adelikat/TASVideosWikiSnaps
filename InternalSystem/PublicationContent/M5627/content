Unlike the Japanese version which has ten tracks, this version only has five tracks that are unique to it. To make up for that, this version repeats those tracks a second time but with the cost of the upgrades increased. Nevertheless, he once again defies the laws of gravity and manages to leave all of his opponents in the dust, finishing all the races in record time.
