	[em 
		"Ottos Ottifanten: Baby Brunos Alptraum
	]em
	" is a puzzle platformer developed by Bit Managers and published by Infogrames in 1998. Based on characters created by a German comedian, Otto Waalkes, its gameplay concept originated in 
	[em 
		(__wikiLink|displaytext=The Adventures of Pinocchio|href=/5217M)
	]em
	"; however, Infogrames shelved it, as it wasn't based on a known license. When the 
	[em 
		"Ottifanten
	]em
	" license was acquired, the developers reworked the original 
	[em 
		"Pinocchio
	]em
	" prototype in such a way that both play very differently.
