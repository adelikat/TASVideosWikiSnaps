		"New Super Mario Bros.

		"Super Mario Land 2
	]em
	" on the Game Boy, as a way to bring the franchise back to its roots. It features your typical side-scrolling plumber, but in this case he comes with enhanced abilities, like wall jumping and doing flips. It also includes new powerups such as the mega mushroom and the blue shell. The latter being what this TAS uses throughout the run.
