	" to the Game Boy Color, using sprites stolen from 
	[em 
		"The King of Fighters
	]em
	" games for the Neo Geo Pocket Color along with a few new sprites based on those games' art style for characters that aren't in those games. It is a surprisingly average fighting game for a bootleg, with responsive controls and an impactful fighting system.
