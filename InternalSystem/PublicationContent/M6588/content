	" series of Japanese budget video games. In this minigolf simulator, there are a number of courses to play on, half of them being normal courses and the other half having tricks and gimmicks on them such as ramps. You can also play by yourself, with one or more other players, or against a CPU player. The CPU player has a special difficulty mode called "Dog" where the CPU's skill wildly fluctuates from being pinpoint accurate to missing a lot.
