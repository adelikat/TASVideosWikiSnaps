[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Rockman 5: Metropolis
	]em
	" is a ROM hack of 
	[em 
		"Mega Man 5
	]em
	" by StalkerMaestro, who also created 
	[em 
		"Rockman 3: Winternight
	]em
	".  This time, the theme is "urban city", with stages having Mega Man go inside buildings, sewers, factories, and even castles. Like with 
	[em 
		"Winternight
	]em
	", 
	[em 
		"Metropolis
	]em
	" is a speed-focused romhack as Mega Man is much faster than in the original game, and the game has been modified to accomodate for that. Graphics and music have been taken from other games such as 
	[em 
		"Batman
	]em
	" for the NES, Street Fighter 2010, 
	[em 
		"Silver Surfer
	]em
	", and 
	[em 
		"Journey to Silius
	]em
	".
