[div class=p

	" is a romhack of the original 
	[em 
		"Super Mario Bros.
	]em
	" game which can only be described as chaotic experience. The game speed has been jacked up extremely high, as well as framerules being reduced to 1 frame rather than 21, transitions are instant, and yet the game is still somehow playable. Not that it matters in a TAS setting that is.
