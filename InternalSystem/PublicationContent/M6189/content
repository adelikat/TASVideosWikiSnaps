	[em 
		"Elf: The Movie
	]em
	" is a licensed video game that is loosely based on the 2003 movie 
	[em 
		"Elf
	]em
	". Like many other video game adaptations made at the time, this game doesn't have much to do with the movie, making almost no reference outside of the cutscenes to the movie's premise of one of Santa's little helpers being an actual human and leaving the North Pole to bond with his biological family. Instead, the game consists of levels where Buddy journeys from the North Pole to New York and does some lengthy minigames along the way.
