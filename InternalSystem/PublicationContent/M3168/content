		"Gimmick!

	" and 
	[em 
		[a class=intlink href=/2002M

	". It was only released in Japan and Scandinavian countries, but eventually achieved something of a cult status thanks to its refined gameplay, as well as exceptional music and graphic design.

	"The plot follows a green toy on a quest to rescue a little girl from the clutch of other toys, who were rightfully upset at her forsaking them in favor of our protagonist. What these other toys can't do, however, is conjure stars to use them both as projectiles and very effective transportation devices!
