	[em 
		"Action 52
	]em
	", one of the more well-known multicarts, and one of its more strange games. As far as what can be told, you are some triangular automaton navigating a very surreal cavern filled with strange creatures such as exploding eels, flying teeth, and flying eyeballs. In this cavern are pits lead to giant disembodied heads with sunglasses that kill you on impact. The objective of the game is to get to the end of the cavern.
