	[em 
		"Sonic the Hedgehog 2
	]em
	" that combines the original game and 
	[em 
		"Sonic the Hedgehog
	]em
	" and adds a lot of new features. The main showcase is the ability to choose up to three characters to play the game with and the ability to switch between characters during gameplay. A number of features from 
	[em 
		"Sonic 3 & Knuckles
	]em
	" have also been added such as each character having their own unique ability, elemental shields, and the ability to save your progress. Certain bugs that were in the original 
	[em 
		"Sonic 2
	]em
	" have been fixed and certain gameplay mechanics have been improved for a smoother playthrough.
