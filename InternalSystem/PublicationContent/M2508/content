	"This time, Link is not just satisfied with collecting the Triforce and saving the princess; he feels like getting through Hyrule with a lot of shiny artifacts and weapons, even if he never uses them after getting them. In this run, the player collects the best version of every object and status upgrade, including all the heart containers, every inventory item, the best sword, and both bomb upgrades. Link even buys the Bait an extra time more than required, so that the bait remains in his inventory at the end of the game. For more details about what constitutes a 100% run, see
