[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Quickchange

	" is an arcade-style game for the Commodore 64 that was published in the December 1985 issue of the 
	[em 
		"Compute's! Gazette
	]em
	". It has three modes, "Flip Flop", "Missing Pieces", and "No Turning Back". "Flip Flop" is the most basic mode of the game. On a grid filled with red blocks and a hazardous moving black blocks, the objective is to flip all the blocks over to a different color by moving over them. Stepping back onto the changed blocks changes them back to red. "Missing Pieces" plays like "Flip Flop", but with certain blocks replaced with pits that you can fall into. "No Turning Back" makes it so that moving off of a block turns it into a barrier block impenetrable by either you or the black blocks, making it easy to trap yourself away from other red blocks or with other black blocks.
