[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Alien Invaders - Plus!
	]em
	" is a game for the Magnavox Odyssey 2 that looks like a clone of 
	[em 
		"Space Invaders
	]em
	". The key differences are that you don't have to destroy everything to win a level, just the red aliens, and that you can take one more hit once your spaceship is destroyed and use that time to convert one of the shield blocks into a another spaceship.
