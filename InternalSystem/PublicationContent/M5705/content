	" that takes all the boss battles with Dr. Robotnik and puts them together into a boss rush game, with little to no platforming outside of the bosses. Each boss battle has its patterns changed from the original and get progressively harder the more damage you deal to Dr. Robotnik. It also has a number of features added such as a scoreboard that keeps track on how fast you've completed each battle and a Time Attack mode that gives you infinite lives.
