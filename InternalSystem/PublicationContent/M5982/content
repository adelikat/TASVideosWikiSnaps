[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Tekken Advance
	]em
	" is a spin-off fighting game in the 
	[em 
		"Tekken
	]em
	" series for the Game Boy Advance. While it is not considered canon to the 
	[em 
		"Tekken
	]em
	" storyline, it follows the events of 
	[em 
		"Tekken 3
	]em
	" and includes most of the characters. The overall gameplay has been simplified to accommodate for the console's limited number of buttons and lacks certain moves such as side and back throws. To make up for that, it features new stun mechanics.
