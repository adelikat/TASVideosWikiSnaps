	"Like 
	[em 
		(__wikiLink|displaytext=Kirby 64|href=/974G)
	]em
	", the game is a 2.5D platformer. Klonoa can only move in two dimensions, but everything is rendered in 3D, allowing the path to curve and objects outside the path to be interacted with. Klonoa can attack by throwing Huepow at enemies and having him return with the enemy. Klonoa will then hold the enemy over his head, which allows him either to throw it at another enemy or bounce off of it to jump into the air.
