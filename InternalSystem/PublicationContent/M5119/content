	" is a sports video game that is based on American football, but with a couple changes to make things a little more interesting. Instead of a standard downs system, the football is now an explosive that will eventually blow up if it's not defused by either crossing the 50 yard line, scoring a touchdown, fumbling, or having it intercepted. The robot players are also less durable than expected and will eventually explode if worn down enough, resulting in a fumble. Originally an arcade game, it later received ports to home systems such as the NES, Sega Genesis, and the Commodore 64.
