		"The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle
	]em
	" is a frustrating action puzzler. In it, you take control of Bugs as he collects carrots while avoiding enemies such as Sylvester the Cat, Daffy Duck, Yosemite Sam, and Wile E. Coyote. Equipped with nothing but an occasional boxing glove which he can throw and some invincibility potions, Bugs must eat his way through 60 levels without getting trapped by a mob of Looney Tunes.

	"In this run, the author, 
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/Brandon 
		"Brandon
	]a
	", exploits the game's AI, which is anything but intelligent. Only one of these enemies follows actual movement, while the others will track your input, even if the input changes nothing. As such, the author is able to often render the enemies useless, allowing him to take the most optimal path. When he can't do this, he tries to find the best possible workaround, often pausing for the exact amount of time to make it past a baddie. As a secondary goal, Brandon also attempts to maximize the score without losing time. For more details, as always, please see the
