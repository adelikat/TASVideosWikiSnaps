	" is a storybook-style Flash game by Awkward Silence Games released in December of 2010 to critical acclaim. The premise starts with a cure for cancer being found and released into the Earth's atmosphere in a gaseous form. However, this cure turns out to not only kill cancer cells, but any living cell it makes contact with. Dr. John Pilgrim, the player protagonist, now has 6 days to create an antidote before literally all life on the planet perishes. One unique characteristic of this game is that it can only be played once, and cannot be replayed again if it's completed in any way.

	" aims to get every possible ending in the game as fast as possible with the use of a modified Flash file that allows for replaying the title. The same thing can be done on the original Flash Player by disabling the Local Storage setting, but the version of Ruffle used for this run does not have that feature.
