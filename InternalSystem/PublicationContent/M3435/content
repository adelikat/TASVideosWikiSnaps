		"Karate Champ
	]em
	" is an arcade game released by Data East in 1984.  The game was developed for Data East by Technōs Japan.  Even in this early example, Technōs Japan's penchant and talent for designing "fighting" games is readily apparent.  While it was not the first fighting game (not even for Technōs Japan), it was the first to offer such a high degree of realism and sophistication, so much so that it has been identified as the defining game of the one-on-one fighting genre.  The game also features an early example of digitized speech.  The control scheme is atypical, featuring 2 4-way joysticks and no buttons.
