		"Blackjack
	]em
	" is an unlicensed card game made by American Video Entertainment. The rules are simple: the dealer gives you and themselves two cards each. You both then have to get a number of cards so that the sum of the cards' values is as close to 21 as possible without going over. Getting exactly 21 is known as a Blackjack, which gives you an automatic win. If you go over, you lose. Otherwise, whoever is closest to 21 wins the bet.
