	"The platform puzzle which first introduced Luigi to the world has both single and multiplayer action with two differing game types. Crabs, turtles and fighter flies must be cleared out by jumping underneath the platform they're on, then kicking them away. Each level is cleared when all of the enemies are defeated.
