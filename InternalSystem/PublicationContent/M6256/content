		"WarioWare: Touched!

	" is a microgame collection and the first installment of the series on the Nintendo DS.  In each level the player is thrown into several very quick microgames that have simple tasks but require decently fast movement.  It requires quick thinking and the acceptance of all the wacky antics that happen in every microgame.
