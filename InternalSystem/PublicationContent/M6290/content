	[em 
		"Wario Land 3
	]em
	" is a platforming game for the Game Boy Color and the third game in the 
	[em 
		"Wario Land
	]em
	" series. This entry borrows most of its mechanics from the previous game, 
	[em 
		"Wario Land II
	]em
	", including Wario being unable to die, various transformations to get through obstacles, and other abilities such as charging. In contrast, the level design is much less linear; levels are beaten and unlocked by finding keys and taking them to their designated treasure chests. However, a number of chests aren't accessible from the start and require finding treasures in later levels in order to able to backtrack and get to them.

	"The story of the game starts with Wario flying in his airplane and his airplane suddenly malfunctioning and crashing in the middle of the forest. He looks into the first cave he sees for help and finds a music box, which then warps him inside. Wario soon finds himself in another world inside a mysterious temple and meets a mysterious figure. This figure tells Wario that his power was stolen by an evil being and sealed away in five other music boxes. He tasks Wario in finding these boxes so he can get his powers back and help return Wario back to his original world. In addition, Wario can keep any additional treasure he finds in the process.
