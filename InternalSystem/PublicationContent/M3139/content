		"The Adventures of Bayou Billy
	]em
	" (1989) contains a trinity of genres: beat 'em up (like 
	[em 
		[a class=intlink href=/1064M 
			"Streets of Rage
		]a
	]em
	"), sniping (like part of 
	[em 
		[a class=intlink href=/2179M 
			"Golgo 13
		]a
	]em
	"), and car racing (like 
	[em 
		[a class=intlink href=/363M 
			"Rad Racer
		]a
	]em
	"). In the game, "Bayou" Billy West fights his way through Louisiana en route to New Orleans in order to save his kidnapped girlfriend, the luscious Annabelle Lane.
