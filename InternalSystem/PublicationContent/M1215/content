	"The kingdom of Zebulos is once again attacked, this time by the neighboring Gedol Empire, whose ruler King Gedol decides that he can kidnap Princess Cherry as Bowser can kidnap Princess Toadstool. The rescuing hero, Sparkster, thinks that espionage is boring. So instead of infiltrating the Gedol empire by stealth, he goes in sword swinging and jetpack blazing, cutting down swaths of whatever poor lizardmen decide to get in his way.
