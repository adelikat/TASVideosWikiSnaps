	[em 
		"Super Tetris 3
	]em
	" is a puzzle game for the Super Famicom that was released only in Japan and the sequel to 
	[em 
		"Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss
	]em
	". New to this game are a number of new modes: "Magicaliss", which adds color to the gameplay for extra complexity; "Sparkliss", which plays similarly to "Bombliss" from the previous games except the bombs explode and destroy blocks in cross patterns, and "Familiss", a four-player mode that requires a Super Multitap to play. These modes along with regular "Tetris Classic" mode also have hidden game modes for extra challenges.
