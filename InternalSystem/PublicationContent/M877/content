	"This Star Wars game here is quite versatile. It features a sort of an overworld, optional items and quests, a lot of ordinary platformer action, some 1st person spaceship shooting and you even get to blow up the Death Star, yay! You can't see all of these in this movie, but it's very entertaining nevertheless. The game's plot is based on the first Star Wars movie (Episode 4), and some of the movie's awesome music can be heard in this game.
