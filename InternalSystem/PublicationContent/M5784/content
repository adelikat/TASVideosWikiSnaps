		"Nova the Squirrel

	" is a homebrew platformer that acts as a throwback to the "radical animal mascot" craze of the 1990s. You play as Nova Storm, a green squirrel with an attitude, who suddenly finds herself in another world and the ability to copy other abilities from her enemies. Go through various lands with her, solving puzzles in weird places and beating surreal bosses with Nova's special powers.
