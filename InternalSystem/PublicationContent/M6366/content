	" franchise, except it's technically not. Instead, it's a reskin of a different game called 
	[em

	]em
	", and was released in North America as the sequel to the original 
	[em 
		"Super Mario Bros.
	]em
	", as Nintendo of America thought the actual sequel (which is known as 
	[em 
		"The Lost Levels
	]em
	" today) was too similar to its predecessor and too difficult for the American audience.
