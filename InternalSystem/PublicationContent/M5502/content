	" is a hack-and-slash platformer that was created by Capcom for the arcades and later ported by other companies to home computers such as the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. Three demonic dragons have risen from the mysterious darkness to conquer and control the kingdoms and the surrounding lands. You play as a nameless barbarian hero who sets out to defeat these dragons and wrest control of the kingdom back from them. As you defeat the dragons's minions, you can earn money that you can spend at shops for upgrades for your weapons and armor, antidotes, and single-use skeleton keys.
