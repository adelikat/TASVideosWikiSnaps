		"Mario Party 6

	" is a party game released for the Nintendo GameCube in 2004 (and 2005 in Europe and Australia). The game features two main game modes: Party Mode, where 4 players compete to get the highest amount of stars, and Solo Mode, in which one player must reach the end of the board to get a Rare Mini-Game. If the player goes further than that space, they'll lose all mini-games they've collected, amongst other events.
