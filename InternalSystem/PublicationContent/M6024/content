	[em 
		"Rockman 3: Winternight
	]em
	" is a ROM hack of 
	[em 
		"Mega Man 3
	]em
	" by StalkerMaestro. The name comes from the presence of snow in some of the levels. Like many other extensive romhacks of the game, the music, graphics, levels, and boss mechanics have been changed.  What makes this romhack stand out from the author's other romhacks is the choice of music, which even includes a song from Argentinian metal band Rata Blanca.
