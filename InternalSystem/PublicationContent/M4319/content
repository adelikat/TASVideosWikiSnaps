[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Confuzion
	]em
	" is a sliding-tile puzzle game in which players must explode all of the bombs in each level using a spark. The spark flows along a fuse, which is made up of a series of tiles. These tiles must be moved such that the fuse forms a path from the spark to each bomb, while also avoiding water droplets that can extinguish the spark.
