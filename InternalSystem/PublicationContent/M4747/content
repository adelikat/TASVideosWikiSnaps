[div class=p

		"Battle Kid: Fortress of Peril
	]em
	" may look old, but it's actually released in 2010! Mainly inspired by the PC game 
	[em 
		(__wikiLink|displaytext=I Wanna Be the Guy|href=/1492G)
	]em
	", this game is classic platforming action, where anything can kill the player in one single hit. While it's not unfair (as opposed to 
	[em 
		"I Wanna Be the Guy
	]em
	"), it's still really hard.
