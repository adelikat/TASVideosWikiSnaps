	" is a licensed NES game based on the game show of the same name. It is essentially a quiz-like version of tic-tac-toe. Each contestant gets a turn to pick a square, which contains a celebrity that will be asked a question. The celebrity will then give their answer and it is up to both contestants to figure out if the celebrity's answer is true or false. Guess correctly and you get the square. Fill in the right squares to win the game.
