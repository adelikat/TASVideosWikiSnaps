	"In 
	[em 
		"Discworld II
	]em
	", the player controls Rincewind the "wizzard", who has been burdened with the task of coercing Death out of his impromptu retirement and back into his regular duties. The game borrows from a number of 
	[em 
		"Discworld
	]em
	" books, but the plot is essentially a mesh of 
	[em 
		"Reaper Man
	]em
	" and 
	[em 
		"Moving Pictures
	]em
	".
