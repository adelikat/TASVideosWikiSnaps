	" is a Flash platforming game that serves as a throwback to the platformers of the early-mid '90s, when the SNES and Sega Genesis were the dominant video game consoles. Since it is a throwback, the plot is just as familiar. You play as a walking bear named Twee who is on a journey to rescue his girlfriend Tweeny after she gets kidnapped by a big, hairy ape. Travel through forests, deserts, and icy wastelands to complete his journey!
