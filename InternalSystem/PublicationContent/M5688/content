[div class=p 
	[em

	" is platforming and one of many in 
	[em 
		"Action 52
	]em
	", a very notorious multicart for the NES. According to the manual, this game is supposed to be a simple jigsaw puzzle game where you match pieces up to make a picture. The actual game is totally different. Here, you play as a handyman in his gigantic workshop, which is filled with walking handyman tools that want to kill you for some reason. The only tool that doesn't want to kill you is presumably your nailgun, which is used to destroy the enemy tools. As with many other platformers from 
	[em 
		"Action 52
	]em
	", the objective is to get to the end of each level without dying to the tools.
