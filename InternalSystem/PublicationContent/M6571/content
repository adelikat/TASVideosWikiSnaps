	" is a homebrew platformer for the ZX Spectrum and NES that was developed by RetroSouls. The key gameplay mechanic here is that our hero Plyuk has the ability to clone himself so he can reach high platforms. However, he can only make a certain number of clones at a time and those clones cannot move on their own, requiring him to absorb the clones so he can make them elsewhere. The goal of the game is collect all the purple orbs in each level so that Plyuk can open the exit and find his way back home.
