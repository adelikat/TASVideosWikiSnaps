[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Barbarian
	]em
	" is a game originally developed and published by Psygnosis in 1987. As a barbarian, the player is tasked to navigate through dungeons filled with enemies and traps. Gameplay is done via on-screen icons that can be selected with the mouse, joystick or the function keys, which, suffice to say, isn't the best control scheme for this genre. The Genesis version is a homebrew port made by z-team in 2019, with more traditional controls.
