	]em
	". It is harder than the original, and continues its bizarre science fiction plotline. You control Ecco the dolphin, navigating the waters, circumnavigating the time-stream, saving lost DNA nucleotide pairs, and finding key crystals, schools of fish and pockets of air deep down in submarine caves.
