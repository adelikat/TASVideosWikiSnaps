	"Tekken Force, a paramilitary organization protecting the Mishima karate fighters, is nearly obliterated by the mighty Ogre. Heihachi Mishima's only hope is his grandson Jin Kazama, who lives with his mother Jun, unaware of his legacy. When the Ogre attacks his home and presumably kills his mother, Jin seeks out his grandfather and learns the martial arts of the family. On his nineteenth birthday, Heihachi announces the King of the Iron Fist Tournament 3, hoping that Jin will use the opportunity take out the meddlesome Ogre.
