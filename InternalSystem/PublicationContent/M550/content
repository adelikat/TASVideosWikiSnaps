[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Quarth
	]em
	" might be best described as a mix of a shooter and 
	[em 
		"Tetris
	]em
	". You control a ship that moves horizontally at the bottom, and shoot incoming blocks or groups of blocks (adding tiles to them) to give them a rectangular shape and make them disappear. Each level scrolls at an increasing speed until you reach the end, and you lose if a block reaches the line floating above the ship.
