	[em 
		"Rhythm Tengoku

	" (リズム天国, 
	[em 
		"Rhythm Heaven
	]em
	") is a rhythm game for the Game Boy Advance and is notable for being the last game officially released by Nintendo for the console. Unlike the later games in the 
	[em 
		"Rhythm Heaven
	]em
	" franchise, this game was released only in Japan. Developed by the same team that made 
	[em 
		"WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgames!
	]em
	", 
	[em 
		"Rhythm Tengoku
	]em
	" takes the creative and rather wacky minigames from that game and puts a rhythm twist in it. Various songs are played over these minigames and the objective often is to tap to the beat of the songs. Some of these songs even include Japanese vocals that you can sing along to!
