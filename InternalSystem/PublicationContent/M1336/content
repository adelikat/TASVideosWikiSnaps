	[em 
		(__wikiLink|displaytext=Super Mario Bros|href=/1G)
	]em
	". It is noteworthy for being a complete "Metroidvania" game built around the original SMB engine, with very few changes to the engine itself. The five areas in the game are all interconnected (via pipes, naturally), and permanent upgrades have been added to give it a more 
	[em 
		"Metroid
	]em
	"-ish feel. (Did I mention the music from 
	[em

	]em
	"? Because there's music from 
	[em 
		"Super Metroid
	]em
	".)
