		"Master of Darkness

	", known in Japan as 
	[em 
		"In the Wake of Vampire
	]em
	" (イン ザ ウエイク オブ ヴァンパイア), is an action platformer that plays very similarly to the 
	[em 
		"Castlevania
	]em
	" series of games on the NES. It also has a similar plot, but with one major difference: instead of playing as a muscular barbarian or a noble warrior, you play as a more normal psychologist that has set out to defeat Dracula all by himself, suspecting him to be behind the murders in London that were attibuted to Jack the Ripper. However, there appears to be a supernatural conspiracy that involves more than just Dracula himself.
