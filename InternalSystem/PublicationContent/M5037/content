	]em
	" is an vertically-scrolling shoot 'em up that was released for the arcades in 1985 and was ported to the NES in the same year. You control an attack helicopter that's out to destroy stuff that wants to destroy you. Why they want to destroy you is unknown. It is one of the first shoot 'em ups to implement the usage of smart bombs, which in this game destroy everything around you within a large radius. There are also drone attack helicopters that you can pick up that can fight right beside you.
