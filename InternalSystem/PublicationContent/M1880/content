	"In this version, the scoring system works a bit differently, so instead of doing many combos in a chain as 
	(__wikiLink|1875M|the US version movie)
	" does, a few very large combos help reaching the goal about 30 seconds faster, achieving it at 0'25 by ingame time.

	"The author, 
	(__wikiLink|user:zvsp)
	", makes an improvement of 
	(frames|amount=491)
	" over the 
	(__wikiLink|936M|previous movie)
	". He does this by changing the character selected from 
	[em 
		"Thiana
	]em
	" to 
	[em 
		"Elias
	]em
	", combining combos at the same time to yield bigger combos, and performing a mysterious technique that renders the "STOP" sequence useless, allowing him to cut off the movie once the last combo is made.
