	" is a battlemech action game with platforming elements, similar to Cybernator in concept. The game's distinctive feature is the ability to pilot six different mechs, which vary considerably in gameplay style. Each of these mechs is equipped with its own melee weapons, firearms, and shields. The mechs also have different movement capabilities: for instance, one can roll as a ball, another can walk on walls and ceilings, and one is an agile flier.
