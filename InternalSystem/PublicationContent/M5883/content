	" and was released for the Super Nintendo, the Sega Genesis, and Amiga computers. One of the main differences from its predecessor is its aim for a more realistic simulation. The game keeps track on what parts of the car are damaged and how it will affect the car, a fuel gauge is added, and the handling is harder and less arcade-like. Other differences include an upgrade system where you can spend money earned from winning races and racetrack pickups that can either give you extra money or nitro boosts.
