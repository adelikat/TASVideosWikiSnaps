	"In this 3D shoot 'em up, you play Kurt Hectic, and your job is to save the world. Aliens have sent 8 giant fortresses to destroy earth. You run and jump through 6 missions of strange 3D worlds and kill the "Stream Riders" with your machine gun arm. Precise platform jumps are part of the challenge, and there are occasional puzzles where you destroy objects in sequence in order to proceed.

	"Kurt is equipped with a special battle suit with an included parachute and a sniper interface (allowing precise shooting) embedded in your helmet. Sniper ammo is maintained separately from regular ammo, and some challenges in the game require you to snipe targets. Some powerups are necessary to proceed, such as the World's Smallest Nuclear Explosion (to blast open special doors) and mortars (fired via the sniper system).
