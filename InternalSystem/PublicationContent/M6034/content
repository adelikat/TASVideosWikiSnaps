		"The Big Adventure of Owata's Life

	[em 
		"The Great Life-Ending Adventure

	") is a Flash game that's best known as the main inspiration for 
	[em 
		(__wikiLink|displaytext=I Wanna Be the Guy|href=/1492G)
	]em
	". It is based on a series of posts from the Japanese message board 2channel detailing the ASCII art adventures of a man running through Aokigahara forest and getting into increasingly ridiculous traps. Like the game it inspires, the difficulty is deliberately meant to be unfair, with death traps often coming out of nowhere, and invisible blocks and intangible walls with no hints as to where they could be.
