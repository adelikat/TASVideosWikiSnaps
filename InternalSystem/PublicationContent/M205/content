	"A very Japanese adventure game that is more complex than
	$LF
	"it seems. In addition to the parts with nonstop platformer
	$LF
	"action, there are a lot of towns in the game. Towns in which
	$LF
	"you can earn money, buy items and upgrade your weapons. The
	$LF
	"platformer parts also have a lot of variation, which makes this
	$LF
	"movie a pretty good watch.

	$LF
	"though, so maybe it's worth it.
