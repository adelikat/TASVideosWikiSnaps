		"Castelian
	]em
	" is a puzzle platformer in which the basic goal is to ascend towers from the base to the apex. Your frog-like character is tasked with demolishing these towers by planting a bomb at each tower's top (wouldn't bombs around the bottom be easier?) after finding the right route up the tower.
