	" is a vertically scrolling top-down action shooter that is one of 52 games that were bundled in the most infamous multicart 
	[em 
		"Action 52
	]em
	". You play as a guy in a sombrero in one end of town and your goal is to get to the other side of town. However, there are other guys in sombreros that are blocking your path, along with giant conch shells and moving cars. You must use your gun to mow them down so you can get through. Or you can just plow through them like a tank.
