	" is an indie game made by Bertil HÃ¶rberg and released on various platforms in 2014. Set in a western environment of the 19th century, the mayor's daughter has been kidnapped by bandits and it is up to the titular character to save her. The Game Boy version, however, only contains one single level and its development has been abandoned, leaving it as a demo.
