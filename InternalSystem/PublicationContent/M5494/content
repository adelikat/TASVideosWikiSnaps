	" is a short puzzle platformer that was created for the Ludum Dare 22 game jam. It retells the Greek myth of Midas, the king who was granted by the Greek god Dionysus the power to turn literally anything he touches into gold. Midas wants to make contact with his love interest, but every day he must step into the waters of the river Pactolus so that he can touch her without turning her into gold. This game shows us the angst he suffers because of this.
