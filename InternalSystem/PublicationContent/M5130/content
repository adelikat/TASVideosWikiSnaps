[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Space is Key
	]em
	" is a simple Flash platformer game where the only control is jumping. You control a block moving at a constant speed, and the goal is to get from one side of the screen to the other. Jumping is done with the Space key, but it is always at a constant height. As you progress, there will be walls and obstacles that you will have to jump over or dodge. Maybe a few surprises might hit you.
