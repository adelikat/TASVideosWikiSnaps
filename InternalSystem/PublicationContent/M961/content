	" (1987) strongly resembles the arcade game 
	[em

	]em
	$LF
	"(1976). In 
	[em 
		"Arkanoid
	]em
	", the paddle is actually a spaceship, and the
	$LF
	"bricks are space walls. The goal of the game is to break through the
	$LF
	"space walls and defeat the villainous Doh in order to escape from the
	$LF
	"space labyrinth.
