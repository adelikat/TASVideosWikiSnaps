	") is a short storybook-style Flash game by a Japanese developer known as Game Movie. All of the cutscenes are live-action, which harkens back to the brief period of full-motion video games during the 1990s, which had very similar games. You follow Nagano, a hapless man who finds himself harassed by bullies for no particular reason. It's up to you to make a choice on whether Nagano should fight back or run away.
