	[em 
		"Action 52
	]em
	", probably the most notorious NES multicart ever released. It stars Bubblegum Rosie, a girl who is looking for her bubblegum. Here, she braves through the candy lands in search for it, but there are other creatures that want gum, too, and are willing to kill her just to see if she has gum. There is also a top-down driving level for a change in gameplay, unusual for an

	]em
	" game.
