	]em
	" (ローゼンクロイツスティレッテ) is a platform game published by independent Japanese studio 
	[em 
		"[erka:es]
	]em
	".  Gameplay resembles a 
	[em 
		"Mega Man
	]em
	" clone, with Spiritia collecting various weapons from each boss defeated, and alternate protagonist Grolla playing more like Zero from the 
	[em 
		"Mega Man X
	]em
	" and 
	[em 
		"Mega Man Zero
	]em
	" series.

(Note that the reason why this run appears to be 3s slower than the old run by standard TAS timing parameters is because the published run ends input before the final boss fight whereas this one does not, since doing so is detrimental to in-game time).
