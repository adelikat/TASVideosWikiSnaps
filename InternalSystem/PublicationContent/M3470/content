		"Wizardry V: Heart of the Maelstrom
	]em
	" is an RPG from the well-known Wizardry series of games. Normally, these games are very long. However, in keeping with the TASVideos tradition of making long RPG runs short, this run reaches the ending in half a minute through extensive glitching of the save data. See
