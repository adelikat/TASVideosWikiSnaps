	" is an NES homebrew platformer that was developed for NesDev's 2016 homebrew competition. Your kitchen is a complete mess and swarming with insects, and it is up to you to clean it. Avoid areas of filth and dirty utentils and kill flies to score points. But be wary how bad the filth in your kitchen can be. It may have produced something really terrifying.
