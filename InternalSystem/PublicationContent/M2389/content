	" chooses exhibition mode and picks the worst boxer to battle against Bowe. Normally, it would be nearly impossible for him to win. Using tool-assisted precision, not only does he beat Bowe, but he does it while landing every hit and taking no damage. In the process, he toys around with the champion until the match is over.
