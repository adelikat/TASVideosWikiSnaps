		"Rockman Complete Works: Rockman 2
	]em
	" is a port of the Japanese version of 
	[em 
		(__wikiLink|1649M|Mega Man 2)
	]em
	" to the PS1. Notable changes include fast weapon switching (though one still has to go to the pause menu to select Item 1-3), bug fixes (notably no horizontal zipping) and a Navi Mode, which includes an updated HUD, hints for beginners and a partially re-arranged soundtrack (by inputting an input code when selecting Navi Mode).

	"While this TAS by paosidufygth seems slower than 
	(__wikiLink|2738M|his previous attempt)
	", it is in fact faster by about 12 seconds. This is because the emulator used, PSXjin, assumes a framerate of 60 FPS while the site assumes the PSX framerate to be the proper 59.292 FPS.
