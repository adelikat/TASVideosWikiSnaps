	[em 
		"Dragon's Lair
	]em
	" is much better known in its incarnations for other platforms as an FMV game with only slight amounts of control over the player's action.  The NES version is more of a traditional platformer, but very smooth animation for the era and funny-looking characters inspired by the cartoon graphics of the other versions - this includes the final boss, who isn't seen very much in this run thanks to abuse of the game mechanics.
