[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Paper Mario World
	]em
	" is a Flash platforming game and a fangame of the 
	[em 
		"Paper Mario
	]em
	" series. It is a short and simple take on 
	[em 
		"Super Paper Mario
	]em
	", but without any additional powerups, characters, or screen-scrolling. Mario has his hammer, but he can also jump on enemies to kill them as well. Mario also has a health bar that he can refill by collecting coins, but it can often be drained fast due to the lack of post-damage invincibility frames.
