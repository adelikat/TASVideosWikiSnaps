		"Finding Nemo

	" is a licensed game that is based on the animated Pixar movie of the same name. It generally follows the plot of the movie beat for beat with certain scenes turned into much longer levels for the sake of the game. Unlike the GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions of the game, you unfortunately do not get to play as Dory.

	" actually saves nearly 20 seconds of game time when taking the boot screen and emulation differences into account. This is thanks to the usage of new strategies that have been discovered by real-time speedrunners ever since the previous TAS was last published.
