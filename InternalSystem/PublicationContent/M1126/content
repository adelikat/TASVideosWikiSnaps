	"Super Mario Kart is the first in a popular series of games starring the Mario cast racing go-karts. This run aims to get record times in all tracks at 150cc difficulty.

Mushrooms are also used frequently due to their mysteriously friction-free propulsion powers. A high amount of wall-bouncing is required.
