[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Altered Space
	]em
	" is an isometric platformer similar to 
	[em 
		"Solstice
	]em
	" for the NES where you play as Humphrey, a brave astronaut. The goal is simply to escape the spaceship without running out of air, which is lost over time or if you get hit. There are items that can be used to stun enemies as well, but aren't seen in this run due to the time it takes to open the item menu.
