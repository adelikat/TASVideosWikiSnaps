	" is a simple bowling game for the Atari 2600. There are three modes to choose from: Games 1 and 2 can have the bowl curve once in a single direction depending on how which direction the joystick is moved, Games 3 and 4 give you full control of the ball until you let it straighten out, and Games 5 and 6 only have the bowling ball travel in a straight line.
