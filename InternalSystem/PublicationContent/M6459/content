[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Famicom Mini
	]em
	" is a series of classic Famicom games that were ported to the Game Boy Advance and the Japanese counterpart to the 
	[em 
		"Classic NES Series
	]em
	". A couple of them were only released in Japan and were not developed by Nintendo, 
	[em 
		"Mappy
	]em
	" being one of them. The main difference between the original Famicom port is that the 
	[em 
		"Famicom Mini
	]em
	" version runs with much less lag due to better hardware.
