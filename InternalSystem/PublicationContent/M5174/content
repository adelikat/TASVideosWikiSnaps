	[em

	") is a very short game for the Sega Genesis that's based on the anime 
	[em 
		"Osomatsu-kun
	]em
	". Play as Osomatsu-kun himself as he sets out to rescue his brothers from weird Asian and European things and monsters that are clearly shoved in there by the developers to get this licensed game out as fast as possible without any regard to sense or structure, less so than the anime itself. Along the way, you can purchase items from Totoko-chan to make your journey even shorter.
