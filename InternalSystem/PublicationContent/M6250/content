	" is a short homebrew platformer that is based on a submission the creator made for Skittle's GB Studio Jam Special #2. The game involves C-1, female android that was made for an unspecified purpose. She wants to escape the ALS Tech Facility and be free. However, the facility itself is filled with huge bugs and glitches that can kill her. She will need her trusty scythe and your help if she wants to experience freedom.
