	", released in 1989, introduces us to the anti-utopian world of Mota, now dominated by the Mother Brain computer. Rolf, a government agent, is assigned the task of finding out why Mother Brain is malfunctioning, and yet his role in the destiny of Algo is far, far greater than anyone could imagine. Anyone, save one lone Esper. As the genetic construct Nei, the soldier Rudo, and others join him, can he topple the tyranny of Mother Brain and free Algo from an unholy evil?
