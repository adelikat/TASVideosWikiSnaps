[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Dreamed Away
	]em
	" is an action-based role-playing game for various PC operating systems and home consoles that is, as of this writing, currently in development. It appears to take influence from old games such the 
	[em 
		"Earthbound
	]em
	" series and more recent games such as 
	[em 
		"Deltarune
	]em
	" and 
	[em 
		"Omori
	]em
	". You follow Théo, a young boy who one day decides to play with his sister Louise in the woods. However, something doesn't seem to be right, and Théo soon finds himself in a mysterious and surreal world filled with darkness, monsters, and other settings that look similar to the real world. Journey with Théo as he tries to figure out what's haunting him and messing with his mind.
