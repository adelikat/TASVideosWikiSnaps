	"Mega Man X2 makes a particularly interesting run as many of

	"the weapons can actually be used in mobility, such as a 
	$LF
	"grappling hook, a fast mid-air dash or even a weapon that can make 
	$LF

	$LF
	"Tanks, and Item Capsules, but not Zero Parts.  However, because these powerups are not far out of the way, and because the Shouryuken saves so much time later on, 
	$LF
	"it turns out that this movie may also prove to be as fast as possible.
