	]em
	" series. One of the Professor's inventions has inadvertently torn a large hole in the fabric of space and time, creating a portal between the Rhynoc Lands and the Dragon Realms. Naturally, Ripto takes full advantage of this by sending his armies of rhynocs through the portal to wreak havoc. Spyro must find somehow find a way to close the portal before Ripto succeeds in taking over the Dragon Realms.
