	" puts you in control of Elta, a wizard who has the task of retrieving eight books of wisdom from the clutches of Az Atorse, the god of destruction. By collecting certain powerups along the way, you can transform into different characters, including Rajin, Samurai, Waterman, Shinobi, Poseidon, and Dragon Warrior. Each transformation makes Elta more powerful and grants him new attacks.
