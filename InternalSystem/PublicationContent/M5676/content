[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Cell Runner
	]em
	" is an arcade-style game for the Commodore 64 that was published in the September 1986 issue of the 
	[em 
		"Compute's! Gazette
	]em
	". Taking place on a faraway, desolate planet, you play as an explorer who is just returning from the ruins of a former subterranean city. Unfortunately, the tunnel you used to get to the ruins has collapsed, and the only other way out is city's barely functioning mass transit system. You must climb up the remains of the transit system, but that is easier said than done as the cells that make up the system randomly open and close and you only have enough stamina to climb each level for 30 seconds.
