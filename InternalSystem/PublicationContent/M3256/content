	[em 
		"Zelda II: The Adventure of Link
	]em
	" is quite different from most of the early games in the 
	[em 
		"Legend of Zelda
	]em
	" series. It combines an overworld view with side-scrolling platform stages. In addition, the character can gain experience and levels, visit towns, and earn spells and items which are needed to proceed.
