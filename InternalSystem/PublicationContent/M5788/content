	" is an adventure platformer and the third main game in the 
	[em 
		"Dizzy

	" video game series. (The actual third game is 
	[em 
		"Fast Food

	", which is more of a 
	[em

	" clone.) It was later remade by the same developers for the NES as 
	[em 
		"Mystery World Dizzy
	]em
	". The plot of this game starts with Dizzy having a stroll with his girlfriend when suddenly trolls kidnapped Daisy and imprisoned her in Wizard Weird's Tallest Tower. Dizzy must now go on an adventure and find 30 special coins in order to free Daisy from her imprisonment.
