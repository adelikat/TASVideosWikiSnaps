		"Curse of the Shadow
	]em
	" is a prototype homebrew platforming game with role-playing elements. It was created as a demonstration for the ByteOff2020 game jam. The story involves a medieval village that's being terrorized by the undead due to being founded over an ancient cursed tomb. It's up to you to save the village by figuring out how to break the curse and defeating the ancient evil that lies within the tomb.
