	]em
	" was developed by Sonic Team and Dimps and published by Sega for the Nintendo DS in 2005. It notably introduces the tension gauge, which would in turn become the boost gauge in later entries of the 
	[em 
		"Sonic
	]em
	" series. With a high focus on speed and trick combos, it is one of the fastest-paced installments in the series. This game introduces Blaze the Cat, who was dragged from her native Sol Dimension into Sonic's world, with the dimension's counterpart to the Chaos Emeralds, the Sol Emeralds, being stolen by Dr. Eggman. Setting off on looking after the Sol Emeralds, in the meantime, Sonic is searching for the Chaos Emeralds, which have been stolen by Dr. Eggman Nega, Eggman's alternate counterpart from the Sol Dimension.
