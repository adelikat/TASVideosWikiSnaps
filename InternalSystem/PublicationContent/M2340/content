		"Driar
	]em
	" is a homebrew game created in 2012 by David Eriksson and Stefen Adolfsson. It is notable for being an homage to classic NES games with no modern influences whatsoever. No score, no save points, no passwords, no timers, no plot, no hub-world; just a series of single screen levels for you to carefully complete, in order, or until your 10 lives are used up.
