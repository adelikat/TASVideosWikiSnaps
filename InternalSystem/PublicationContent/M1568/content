[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Bubble Ghost
	]em
	", a game ported to many platforms, has the player, as a ghost, guide a bubble through a house by blowing at it; if the bubble hits anything at all it pops and the player loses a life.  If that sounds difficult, well, it is - but that doesn't stop this run from making it look easy.
