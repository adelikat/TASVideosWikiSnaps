	]em
	" is a licensed video game that is based off the first eight episodes of the TV show of the same name. Here, you reenact those episodes with six of the more police-based Power Rangers, all with their own special powers. For example, the Yellow Ranger can temporarily clone herself to deal extra damage while the Red Ranger can phase through walls. Inbetween the action platforming segments are Megazord fights and minigames like autoscrolling segments to add some variety.
