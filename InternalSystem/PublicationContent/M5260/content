	[em 
		"My Dinner With André
	]em
	" is a homebrew Game Boy game that is based off the brief gag in 
	[em 
		"The Simpsons
	]em
	" that parodies the 1981 comedic drama 
	[em 
		"My Dinner With André
	]em
	". This game is an extension of that gag that includes social commentary and meta-humor that's more topical to the 2020s than it is to the time periods that the original movie and 
	[em 
		"The Simpsons
	]em
	" gag were created in. With André Gregory and Wallace Shawn in their 
	[em 
		"The Simpsons
	]em
	" forms, explore their thoughts and feelings as you take various routes during their conversations.
