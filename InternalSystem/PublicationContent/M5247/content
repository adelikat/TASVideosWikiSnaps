	]em
	" is a video game adaptation of the classic carnival game Whac-A-Mole that was developed by HAL Laboratory for the VIC-20 and PC-8001. The goal of the game is score as many points as possible by whacking as many moles in the head you can find. More points are gained for whacking the moles as soon as they pop their heads out of their holes. Points are lost for whacking the moles on their butts.
