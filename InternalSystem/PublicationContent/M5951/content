[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Rockman 3: Speed Bound
	]em
	" is a ROM hack of 
	[em 
		"Mega Man 3
	]em
	" that combines the ROM hacks 
	[em 
		"Rockman 3: Burst Chaser
	]em
	" and 
	[em 
		"Rockman 3: Claw
	]em
	". It takes the sped-up movement from 
	[em 
		"Burst Chaser
	]em
	" and sliding mechanics and weapon changing features from 
	[em 
		"Claw
	]em
	" and adds in original level designs and music to create a unique experience. Like the romhacks it borrows from, graphics and AI behavior has been changed as well.
