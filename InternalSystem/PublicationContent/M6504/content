	]em
	", Link is back to being a lone boy without a fairy. One day, he is attacked by Skull Kid (wearing a strange mask) and his two fairies, Tatl and Tael, and they steal his ocarina. After pursuing Skull Kid, he is transformed into a Deku Scrub. Link continues pursuing Skull Kid all the way to the Clock Town (now with the help of Tatl the fairy, a more 'in yo face' version of Navi).  They then discover the Moon will crash into earth in 3 days, so they must use the power of time to stop that from happening.
