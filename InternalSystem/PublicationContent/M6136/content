	[em 
		"Rockman: Deux Ex Machina
	]em
	" is a pretty extensive ROM hack of 
	[em 
		"Mega Man 2
	]em
	", both graphics and gameplay-wise. While most of the bosses and enemies remain the same, the power-ups and level designs have significantly changed, with gameplay mechanics added or modified to make the game freshly challenging such as flickering rooms or more hostile scenery. It also includes music adapted from other 
	[em 
		"Mega Man
	]em
	" games and even games like 
	[em 
		"Metal Slug
	]em
	" and 
	[em 
		"Super Puzzle Fighter
	]em
	". You can read
