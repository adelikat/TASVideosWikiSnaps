The Game Boy Color version in particular is a port of the NES version, which is a platformer. Both versions have you play as Jonathan Harker, a lawyer who finds himself in imprisoned in Dracula's castle. He must escape from the castle and follow Dracula to London before he can turn everyone in the city into vampires.
