[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Taboo: The Sixth Sense
	]em
	" is a tarot card reading simulation for the NES that was probably sold at full price. You give the simulator your name, date of birth, and gender, and with that information it will generate a tarot card reading. After that, you give the simulator the state you live in, assuming you live in the United States, and it will generate lottery numbers for you.
