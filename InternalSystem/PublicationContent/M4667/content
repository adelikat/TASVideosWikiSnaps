	" is an indie game developed by Sam Hogan. The player controls a sticky goo ball that sticks to most surfaces, and needs to make its way to a wooden stick. However, the player is limited to jumping, and the arrow indicating the direction the goo ball jumps to moves automatically from left to right and back, making it a tricky endeavour.
