	[em 
		"Drag Race
	]em
	" is an arcade game released in 1977 by Kee Games (a subsidiary of Atari).  
	[em 
		"Drag Race
	]em
	" was designed by David Crane before the Great Exodus from Atari that would lead to the formation of Activision.  At Activision, David Crane would redesign 
	[em 
		"Drag Race
	]em
	" for the Atari 2600, released in 1980 as the more widely-known 
	[em 
		[a href=/3430M 
			"Dragster
		]a
	]em
	".  This unauthorized adaptation, among other litigation between Atari and Activision, would not be resolved until years later.  The cabinet for 
	[em 
		"Drag Race
	]em
	" features controls for 2 players, including a steering wheel, a 4-way gear shifter, and a gas pedal.  The cabinet even has functional analog tachometers to indicate when to shift!  The display is black and white with overlays for color and text.  Interestingly, the sound is in stereo, with each player hearing only the sound of their respective dragster in their speaker.  The game's mechanics are inventive and gameplay is fun and exciting--as it would later be for 
	[em 
		"Dragster
