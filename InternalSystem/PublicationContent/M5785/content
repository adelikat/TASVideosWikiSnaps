	[em 
		"Feng Shen Bang

	[em 
		"Investiture of the Gods
	]em
	") is an unlicensed Chinese role-playing game that was released in 1995 by C&E Inc for NES consoles. It is a loose adaptation of the 16th century Chinese epic novel of the same name. Large chunks of the plot were left out and the ones there were kept in were simplified to fit the constraints and style of a classic NES RPG. Set during the end of the Shang dynasty, instead of following the rise and fall of King Zhou, the last ruler of the dynasty, and the gods and spirits involved, the game focuses the adventures of a group of ordinary humans as they unite to take down the tyranny of King Zhou and the spirits let loose across China.
