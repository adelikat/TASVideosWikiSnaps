		" "HnF" has more enemies in every stage, and more obstacles along the way. For example, there are land mines in Area 7 and giant spiders in some neutral areas. Also, I believe the patterns of the enemy attack trucks is different, because I seemed to encounter them more often in this game despite using the same route as "BC."

		" All references to Nazis and all swastikas were removed from "BC." The evil leader of "the Badds" was re-named "Master-D." Graphically, however, he is undeniably Adolf Hitler in both versions. This resulted in quite a shock to me as a child!

		" "HnF" features a dramatic shortcut in Neutral Area 17, allowing the player to collect all items by beating a Nazi prisoner with the bionic arm. I will experiment with this shortcut in the near future, but for now I wanted to submit an improved time attack WITHOUT using it.
