	"In 
	[em

	", the player controls Captain Viridian, who is lost in an alternate dimension, in search of the missing members of the spaceship's crew. Instead of jumping, the player is able to control the direction of gravity, allowing Captain Viridian to flip between the floors and ceilings of the environment. The graphical style of the game is heavily influenced by the Commodore 64.

	"Additionally, this TAS is completed on the game's no-death mode, which removes all the cutscenes and dialogues, as well as allows collecting a specific Trinket without having to die. Dying once on this mode prompts an instant game over, making it an especially brutal challenge in unassisted conditions. As this naturally prohibits the skips and glitches that abuse forcible deaths, it allows the audience to see the game in its entirety and, indeed, enjoy its level design and excellent chiptune-style soundtrack.
