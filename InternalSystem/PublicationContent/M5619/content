[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Rockman 5: Air Sliding
	]em
	" is a ROM hack of 
	[em 
		"Mega Man 5
	]em
	" where the main gameplay gimmick is the ability to slide in midair. All the levels have been changed to account for this. In addition, all of the music has been replaced with songs from other video games such as 
	[em 
		"Kirby

	".
