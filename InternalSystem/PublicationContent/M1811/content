		"Ultraman Ball
	]em
	" is a platform game featuring the famous Japanese television character Ultraman. However, the game has little to nothing do with Ultraman, as oddly enough, his power in this game is to transform into a ball and bounce around a lot. Some say this game is based on the abandoned NES project, 
	[em 
		"Armadillo 2
	]em
	", and in fact the game is very similar to
