[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Avenger
	]em
	" is a shoot 'em up for the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore 64 that plays very much like 
	[em 
		"Space Invaders
	]em
	". Like with that game, the goal is to shoot down all the aliens on the screen. You have three barriers that can defend you from the aliens but they can be worn down over time by them.

	]em
	" at the hardest difficulty in record time.
