	" series. You play as Maxwell, who has a magical notepad that can summon almost anything he writes into it, from zombies to thunder clouds. This notepad is the key gameplay mechanic the game revolves around. Maxwell's goal is to collect Starites, which are found by solving various puzzles and helping people out with his magical notepad.
