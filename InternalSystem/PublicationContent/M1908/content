	"This movie sees the reinstatement of the in-game category, which was previously merged with the 
	[a class=intlink href=/1368M 
		"realtime
	]a
	" run. Despite being slightly slower in terms of real time, this speedrun is both extremely optimised and breaks previous records once thought to be the limit of the game. The completion time stands at 
	[b 
		"0:22:38
	]b
	", and is displayed at the end of the game as 0:22, considered the lowest minute breakpoint attainable without resorting to game-breaking exploits... at least until another run comes and smashes that expectation to bits, as they often have here at TASVideos.
