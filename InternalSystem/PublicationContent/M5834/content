	" RPG series of games that was released only in Japan. The simple premise involves monsters and giant robots suddenly appearing all over the world, and it's up to three warriors — sword-wielding ninja Tenchimaru, trident and gun-toting monk Kaiohmaru, and magical priestess Yukihime — to travel and take them all down.
