		"Nova the Squirrel
	]em
	" is a homebrew platformer that acts as a throwback to the "radical animal mascot" craze of the 1990s. You play as Nova Storm, a green squirrel with an attitude, who suddenly finds herself in another world and the ability to copy other abilities from her enemies. Go through various lands with her, solving puzzles in weird places and beating surreal bosses with Nova's special powers.

	" beats this game in record time by getting to and defeating the final boss as fast as possible, clipping through numerous walls in the process. The extra levels weren't played as they aren't necessary to beat the game.
