	"Like all of the Mortal Kombat games, MKII is about warriors fighting in a tournament for inspecific power and fame. Shang Tsung is chosen for his ability to transform into every other character (except the two non-playable characters), and a different fatality is used on every level (despite the extra time that it takes to do so). The run focuses more on entertainment than finding the fastest way to win.
