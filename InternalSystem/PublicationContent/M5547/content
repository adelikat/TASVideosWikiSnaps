	") is the fifteenth game in indie developer Ichima's Escape Room game series. As a change in pace, this is the first game in the series where Ichima decides to add background music to keep things lively. The start of the game has you trapped in a single room with four walls around you. There's a door out of there, but it only leads to the rest of the house itself. As with the rest of the series, the goal is to find the unlocking mechanism for the front door of the house by solving various puzzles.
