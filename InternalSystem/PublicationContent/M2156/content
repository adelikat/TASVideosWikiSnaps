		"Cheetahmen II

	" is the unfinished sequel to 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=game #52 of Action 52|href=/1584M)
	". The game contains 6 of the 10 levels originally proposed, in which the player takes control of Apollo, and Hercules, Aries, swiching off after every second level. Sadly, it's only possible to play 4 of the levels without altering the ROM image or experiencing a very rare glitch that starts the game with Aries.
