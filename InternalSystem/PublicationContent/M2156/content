[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Cheetahmen II
	]em
	" is the unfinished sequel to 
	[a class=intlink href=/1584M 
		"game #52 of Action 52
	]a
	". The game contains 6 of the 10 levels originally proposed, in which the player takes control of Apollo, and Hercules, Aries, swiching off after every second level. Sadly, it's only possible to play 4 of the levels without altering the ROM image or experiencing a very rare glitch that starts the game with Aries. 
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/was0x 
		"was0x
	]a
	" completes these four levels in 
	(frames|amount=8416)
	", but a run of the hacked game with all 6 levels may obsolete this one.
