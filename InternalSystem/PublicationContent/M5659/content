	" and

		"Joust

	", You play as a couple of special seagulls who are out protecting their eggs from the nefarious Dr. Beak of the Odious Villains Organization. He is looking for the secret to immortality and believes that those eggs may hold the key. It's up to the seagulls to stop Dr. Beak before he ruins any more lives and places.
