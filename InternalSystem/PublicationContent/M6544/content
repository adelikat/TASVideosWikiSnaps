During a peaceful picnic at the Hakurei Shrine, Remilia Scarlet and Yuyuko Saigyouji get into an argument on who has the better gardener, Hong Meiling or Youmu Konpaku. Eiki Shiki then suggests settling the matter with a duel, with Meiling using her hand-to-hand martial arts and Youmu with her swordplay. To make things more interesting, Youmu has to start at the top of a tall pillar and Meiling at the very bottom. Who will prevail?
