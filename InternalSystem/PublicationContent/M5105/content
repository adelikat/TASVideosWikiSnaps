	[em 
		"A Dinosaur's Tale
	]em
	" is a licensed game that is based on the animated movie 
	[em 
		"We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story
	]em
	". As with most licensed games at the time, it is loosely based on the movie and adds in a few elements that weren't in it for level design purposes. You either play as Louie and Cecilia and go through a variety of platforming levels and flight levels based on set pieces from the movie.
