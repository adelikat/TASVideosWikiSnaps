		"There are 3 purposes of this video: 1) To attempt to be 'perfect' in each event at least one time; 2) To show the major consequences of seemingly minor mistakes in play or strategy, e.g. jumping one half step too early (Long Jump), being off by a single degree (Javelin), or missing a bonus (Skeet Shooting); and 3) To show oddities in the game (Javelin, Triple Jump).
