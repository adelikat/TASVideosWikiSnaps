	" and 
	[em 
		"Sapphire
	]em
	" are the debut games of the third generation of 
	[em 
		"Pokémon
	]em
	" video games and the first ones to be released on the Game Boy Advance. With this generation comes a whole plethora of new features such as Pokémon species-specific abilities, double battles, Pokémon contests, and more. 
	[em 
		"Ruby
	]em
	" and 
	[em 
		"Sapphire
	]em
	" take place in the region of Hoenn, where trouble is stewing about due to two terrorist organizations that want to change the climate for highly questionable reasons. As with before, this gets in the way of your quest to be the best, and it will be up to you to resolve it.

To do this, lots of trading is done between the games along with tons and tons of RNG manipulation to make catching and evolving Pokémon as efficient as it can be.
