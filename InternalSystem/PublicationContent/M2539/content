	" to win their town back and rescue their girlfriends. Several bosses need to be found and beaten before you can enter River City High and beat up the final bad guys (including an obvious imitation of the

	"This run obsoletes the previous one by nearly a minute due to much more optimization of boss fights and some new tricks. Weapons are also used more, so expect to see some chains and trash cans!
