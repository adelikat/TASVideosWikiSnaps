		"Lunar Magic
	]a
	", contains a Star World which contains themed levels that connect to various locations on the map. Like the original Super Mario World, these levels can be used as a makeshift warp zone. This movie demonstrates this path - navigating the Star World to charge straight to Bowser, leaving much of the game untouched.
