	"Battletoads is a classic video game by Rare for the NES, but different versions of
	$LF
	"the game were also made for many other systems, such as the Genesis and the Game
	$LF
	"Boy.  All of these games are known for their comical animation style (such as
	$LF
	"gigantic fists and boots when the toads attack) and their high difficulty,
	$LF
	"essentially requiring the player to memorize the upcoming dangers to react fast
	$LF
	"enough to survive.

	"In this version, the player plays as the Battletoad Zitz on a quest to rescue the
	$LF
	"other two Toads, Rash and Pimple, from the Dark Queen.  This game has only 9 stages,
	$LF
	"as opposed to 12 in the NES version.  However, unlike the NES version of the game,
	$LF
	"there are no warps, and there is no two-player option.  There are also fewer
	$LF
	"time-saving glitches.  That doesn't stop Cardboard, though, from beating up tons of enemies and completing the game very quickly.
