	[em

	" is a ROM hack that effectively ports over 
	[em 
		"Super Mario Bros. Special
	]em
	" to the 
	[em 
		"Super Mario Bros.
	]em
	" engine on the NES. Every level has been recreated and various items and enemies such as the Hammer and Sidesteppers were added. The only things not recreated are the noticeably different jumping physics and the screen-by-screen scrolling that were present in the original game.
