[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Scorpion II
	]em
	" is one of the games that came with the disk of Issue 64 of Compute!'s Gazette, released in October 1988. A variant of Scorpion, itself related to Spider solitaire, the first three columms have their first three cards dealt face down, with the rest being dealt face up. A particularity of both the original 
	[em 
		"Scorpion
	]em
	" and 
	[em 
		"Scorpion II
	]em
	" is that every face up card is available for play, and if that particular card is moved below a card that is a rank higher, every card below moves as well. The game is won when 4 columns from king to ace are formed (or in this game's case, when all cards of their specific suit have been sorted from ace to king).
