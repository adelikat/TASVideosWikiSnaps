	]em
	" is a Mario Flash fangame and the sequel to 
	[em 
		"A Koopa's Revenge
	]em
	". It expands on concept of the villain's lackeys being the playable protagonists where it's not just Bowser and his minions getting revenge, but they're also fighting back against the forces of the evil Mario and his mustache twirling actions. This time, you can choose between three characters: a Koopa Troopa, a Shy Guy, and a Goomba, each having their own abilities. With that character, it's up to you to take down the comically evil Mario and his own minions.
