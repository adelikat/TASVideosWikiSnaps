	". But, unlike 
	[em 
		"Castlevania
	]em
	", this game is set in a post-apocalyptic future in which eight nuclear explosions almost destroyed Earth. The game features two characters—the human Orin and his falcon Cutrus—in either 1- or 2-player mode. Cutrus can attack enemies, hit switches, collect items, and generally do all sorts of useful things.
