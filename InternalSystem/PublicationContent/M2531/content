	"In 
	[em 
		"Keen Dreams
	]em
	", Commander Keen goes to sleep and finds himself in the land of Tuberia, where he discovers that Earth children are being trapped in their sleep to work as slaves for the evil King Boobus Tuber. Out of ammo and lacking his trusty pogo stick, Keen must resort to scavenging Flower Power and Boobus Bombs from the local flora in order to combat the tuberian threat.
