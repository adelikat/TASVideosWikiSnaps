	"Every one hundred years, the forces of evil mysteriously start to weaken. Though some of these evil creatures band together to counteract this weakness, many of them are still slaughtered by the forces of good. But one day, One, the most evil one, found a way to break this curse and grow only stronger and stronger. Sensing the presence of a cure within the blood of a young woman, he pulled her into the darkness...right before our hero's eyes! Filled with anger, he grabbed his mystical whip and followed One through the night until finding himself at the base of One's fearsome castle. What evil awaits him there? Will he save the girl in time?
