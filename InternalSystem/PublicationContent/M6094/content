		"Disney's Aladdin

	" is a 2004 GBA port of the SNES version of the Capcom developed Aladdin video game from 1993.  While it plays similarly to the SNES release, some notable differences include 5 extra stages in total and the music being slightly different (with the Genie stage having completely different music likely for copyright reasons).
