	[em 
		"Bombs Away
	]em
	" is an autoscrolling war game and one of 52 games that are in the Sega Genesis version of 
	[em 
		"Action 52
	]em
	". You play as a soldier in the middle of what appears to be some village in the jungle. The place is being bombarded by an air raid, and you certainly don't want to be one of the casualties. Your goal is to escape without getting hit by any of the dropped bombs that curiously don't explode unless they hit you directly.
