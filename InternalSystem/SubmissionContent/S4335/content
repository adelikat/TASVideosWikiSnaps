	"Often abbreviated as DDG it makes Abe invisible and can corrupt his sprite and eventually become invisible at some point allowing him to get past things that would kill him. Abe will die if he falls of a ledge or gets zapped. A video made by Sligfantry can show you how this glitch works:

[div class=p 
	"This glitch works by standing on the edge of the ledge and pressing the down button quickly and run towards a spot where you would like to hoist down. You will need to press either 'left/down' or 'right/down' depending on which direction Abe was facing.

	" Stop Turn and Backwards Jump
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"By timing this glitch perfectly you can make Abe stop and turn. To set it up, Abe needs to be standing near a ledge (pressing up whilst tunring arround) you will be able to make Abe do a backwards jump. Notice that when you press the opposite direction to where Abe is standing at the incorrect frame, Abe will just jump up and stand. But if you time it perfectly, Abe will jump backwards and possibly jump to another screen. This will allow you to jump backwards to areas and skip Zulags. In a 100% run it will allow you to get to secret areas quicker and it skips a section of StockYards Escape after finishing the secret area. Sligfantry's video can show you how this glitch works: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIo1TJUBGlo

[div class=p 
	"This is one of the biggest changes in this run. The bees in this area allows us to skip Paramonia and Scrabania completely! Also, you can set up an auto turn glitch using the bees which allows Abe to do a backwards jump so that Abe can avoid dropping down the ledge and killing himsself. There is also an 'auto turn' glitch setup to make the backwards jump work. Lastly, there was a small time saver done at the start of the stage where Abe does the diagonal fall a few frames earlier than the previous run. Since Shunpuk found the multiple backwards jump glitch, he found a place where we could use it here but running into the well seems faster than doing it so we couldn't use it here.

	"April 14th, 2011, the first attempt to skip Paramonia and Scrabania; talking to a Slig at the correct frame makes it walk straight forward. It works in a lot of places, but not in Monsaic Lines. December 1st, 2012, the Death Delay Glitch brought the possibility to skip them back to life. We then found a way to set up the DDG by bees. But a "dead" Abe can't survive a fall from high ledges,  also, you can't set up the Auto Turn Delay after the DDG there; not enough room to run. So, a way to set up the running DDG should solve our problem. March 25th, 2013, Paramonia's skip was found, and with it a new way to set up the DDG; running instead of jumping. June 6th, 2014, we finally figured how to set up the running DDG with bees. Sadly, the DDG cancels the Auto Turn Delay, what a bummer. A few hours latter a new trick was found; the Bee Auto Turn Delay, and with it, the last piece of the puzzle was added. Now we can finally skip Paramonia and Scrabania. June 13th 2014, another new glitch was found which enabled us to skip Zulag 2 and 3. Only one question remains; what's next?
