	": Not gonna lie, the branch name was much funnier when it was "Selects Wario but something goes wrong, the movie desyncs and wario dies instead. 0x left presses". There's something about the full stop and then the addition of 0x left presses that really just tickled the ol' funny bone, and now that's gone, and it can never come back. I don't think I can accept that. In fact, I won't! Get destroyed, Branch Changer!
