	"This glitch is used to transfer Konami Man, Vic Viper, Twin Bee, and 32 HP/MP Max Ups into Sisters mode from Johnathan mode.

	"There are two worth mentioning boss fights that involve special tricks, and they are the main technical improvement over the run on Nicovideo.

	"As you can see around 6:55, I started attacking Legion before the camera moves back to the sisters. This only works when you are using Stella.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Something similar happens around 19:30. If you are using Loretta while entering the boss room, you have a window of a few frames to press buttons. As you can see, I switched to Stella and touch the screen where Mummy Man would appear. The magical line just stays there and kills Mummy Man before he even appears thanks to data transferring glitch.
	$LF

[p 
	"I don't fully understand why these phenomenons happen. They probably have to do with the fact that HUD doesn't disappear when you enter the boss rooms of Legion and Mummy Man.

	"Luck Manipulation
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Luck manipulation is done by hitting candles. I did this in some places to make certain enemies move out of my way so I don't have to kill them in order to avoid unnecessary level ups.
	$LF

[p 
	"Dullahan and Creature require some manipulation as well. For Dullahan, I need to make sure he does not start with the jumping attack because that one produces tons of lags. As you can see around 17:35, I deleted MP in order to go downward faster. Because MP is really low at the beginning of the fight, I can't just fly over Creature while attacking him. I have to make sure he doesn't use machine gun while I'm on the ground to regenerate MP.

	"Corner Boost
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"While moving upward, going over the up-left or up-right corner of a platform can push you upward a little. Doing this saves around 3 frames each time. This is a minor technical improvement over the run on Nicovideo.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Horizontal Damage Boost
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Getting hit by an enemy or obstacle while going left or right can save around 5 frames each time. This type of damage boost is used as often as possible, but I have to make sure enough HP is conserved for the next type of damage boost.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Vertical Damage Boost
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Getting hit by an enemy or obstacle while MP is depleted makes you go downward at much faster speed. However, most of this type of damage boosts are done by touch platforming obstacles, which deals a lot of damage. Moreover, if there is a platform right below the obstacle, you are likely to get stuck on the platform and become immobile for some time. Therefore, vertical damage boost are usually used only when the obstacle is blocking the way.

	": Since this is an NG+ run, it is not eligible for Vault, and since it has received poor feedback, it can't be accepted to Moons. A run without the data transfer glitch might go slightly better, but I think the general consensus is that Sisters Mode is really not a fun watch by any stretch of the imagination. Rejecting.
