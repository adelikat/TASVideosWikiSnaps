However, most of this type of damage boosts are done by touch platforming obstacles, which deals a lot of damage. Moreover, if there is a platform right below the obstacle, you are likely to get stuck on the platform and become immobile for some time. Therefore, vertical damage boost are usually used only when the obstacle is blocking the way.
