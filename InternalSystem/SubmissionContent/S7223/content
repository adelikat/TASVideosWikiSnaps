	"This is a 100% TAS which improves upon Biospark's TAS. Biospark's TAS uses VBA, which is faster than Bizhawk by about 1 second for every minute. Therefore, this updated TAS is about 2 minutes and 10 seconds faster. The majority of this time save is an improved cleanup route which saves ~50 seconds, exiting through Sector 2 to the Reactor rather than going up the long Main Deck elevator. The rest of the time saves are from out-of-bounds tricks, small movement optimizations, and RTA strats. Just like the Any% TAS, RTA is prioritized and jumping through doors happens frequently to speed up transitions.

		"If Samus morphs, cancels the morph, and then jumps, she will get moved into an adjacent wall, provided there is a ceiling block above. While in a wall, you can move around while spring-balling (although only upward). This lets us zip around rooms much faster than usual as well as bypass walls. This is most easily done using a frozen enemy or a crumble block.

		"Room patterns depend on the frame at which you enter the room, so extra frames have to be added to obtain more favorable enemy positions, eyedoor randomness, etc. Because items are picked up so frequently in 100%, extra frames can be added during the item acquisition to subtly change eyedoor RNG and enemy patterns. Of course, this is not always possible, and therefore these extra frames are spread out across room movement as best as possible to not make it obvious.
