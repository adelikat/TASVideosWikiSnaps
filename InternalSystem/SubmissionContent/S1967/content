	"This game is a port of the original King's Quest, for the Sega Master System. Now, unlike the KQV port for the NES, the graphics in this port have actually been

	" from the original rather than downgraded. This game also plays much faster than the KQV port, and it's much shorter, so I think this one really made for a better TAS than KQV did.

		" The witch was home when I entered her house. The only real difference this made to the run, was that I had to position myself a little differently when stealing her cheese, which was about five frames or so slower than if she hadn't been home. I could have "luck manipulated" her away, but that would have cost more time than I would have gained from it.
