	"I'll use Truncated's description of this game - In this action/puzzle game you control three vikings lost in time and space, each with their own special abilities needed to solve the levels.
	$LF

[p 
	"The technique that saved the most amount of time was the "third player" element, which switches between characters so frequently, it looks almost as if there are three people playing. This is used constantly to keep motion between all three vikings.
	$LF

[p 
	"Another technique was the shield-riding trick. I used it only a few times in the first movie, and using this technique can save a multitude of time if you find the right places.

	"Glitches used:

[ul 
	[li 
		"Falling key glitch - This glitch is pretty simple. Using a key on a keyhole while falling will prevent one of the characters from taking damage. I use this frequently.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		"Falling multicolor key glitch - This one is almost identical to the one above, only this uses a key on a different colored keyhole while falling to avoid damage. This also doesn't use up the keyhole. I was able to use this only once in WKYY.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		"Slide in to wall - This glitch involves an elevator. When on one, standing on the very edge and sliding into a wall, then moving over and back again quickly will get a character lodged into the wall. I only was able to use this once in BTRY. This glitch is similar to the Rockman 2 wall-omission glitch (only I can't zoom through walls, which would be awesome).
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		"I can't think of a name of this glitch, so I'll describe it. In TRPD, there's a spot where pinchers are use to hold a block. When in the path of the pinchers, turning the direction opposite to the wall will get the character stuck in the wall, which happens to be on top of a door. Then, switching will cause the character stuck in the wall to fall to the ground and jumping will then cause him to get zoomed down reaching a button to skip a major part of said level.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		"Fall through horizontal door - This is only usable in one place - TRDR. This is, when falling, using a key on the door in the floor and falling through it. Giving it to another character enables that character to do the same.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		"Avoid damage by switching characters - This is when you're moving (falling or jumping), switch and switch back quickly and end up taking no damage. This used on enemie projectiles and temporary lasers.
		$LF
	]li

	[li 
		"This is more of a trick than a glitch, but you can sometimes walk over holes if able to find the right frame.
