[div class=p 
	"In alternative mode, you are expected to pick a card from your real Pictionary deck, then draw the word on your NES, and get your friends to guess it. This drawing section can be completely skipped, after which it asks you who won...to which you can always reply yourself. 
	[br

	$LF
	"In short, you keep telling it you won until it tells you you're the best. Even if you don't skip the drawing portion, what should you draw? Who would guess it? This mode has very little potential for entertainment or improvement.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Regular mode is a little different. Rather than draw words for your friends to guess, you are given minigames that help you guess various pre-drawn words (at least in singleplayer mode). Even if we skip these minigames, regular mode is still a more interesting run than alternative, because you have to type in the words. The input system is surprisingly 
	[del 
		"annoying
	]del
	" nuanced; you end up having to hit all the letters in a 2-frame window along the way, which looks impressive to anyone who's stumbled through this awkward input system themselves. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Another interesting aspect of this run is that the words are generated in a pre-determined sequence, which is chosen when you press start to enter your team name. This means that RNG is a little more complicated than always manipulating the fastest word ("NO"). DrD2K9 and I worked together to figure out which sequences are faster; I ended up writing a

[div class=p 
	"Watching this run, you may believe this particular minigame is about a paint bucket collecting green paint drops. This is not the case: those green drops are actually bullets.

	"The word sequence you get is determined as soon as you press start after choosing a team name. This means that any run--one that improves upon my minigames, one that does them way slower, or even one that skips them altogether--will have the same sequence of words. This effectively makes it an entirely separate problem to solve, independent of any specific run.

	"The text entry frame rule interacts interestingly with dice RNG. It turns out that you can wait several frames to type the final letter, still make the same frame rule, but somehow end up with different RNG. This makes a first frame 6 roll 
	[em 
		"always possible!
	]em
	$LF
	"Here's my theory on why this works: Pictionary probably has an RNG variable that updates every frame, except lag frames. Whatever arcane RNG math gets performed takes into account the current frame, as well as the previous value. After sitting through different numbers of lag frames, even though we make a roll on the same frame, the formula is looking at a different previous value in each situation, and so the results are completely different than before.

	"If you've ever played this game, you'll know that the text input system is very...unique. Rather than give you a standard alphabetic grid, or an arcade-style letter select (like at the beginning), they give you a pair of 
	[a href=https://www.amazon.com/Converse-Unisex-High-Sneakers-M9621/dp/B003V0R1K8 rel=noopener external nofollow

	[em 
		"run.
	]em
	" They are subject to acceleration and friction. At full speed, they travel at 1 letter per 4 frames, giving you a 2-frame window to type each one--very hard to pull off in real time, but pretty simple to do in a TAS. To keep things interesting, I type out different words and phrases, which I backspace along the way. My personal favorite is after the second paint game, where I'm able to type 4 out of the 5 English words that start with SWA-!
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Sometimes, it becomes necessary to turn around when entering a word. You'd think you could stop on the letter you need, then start accelerating in the other direction, but you can't. You can only stop on even letters (B, D, F...), so sometimes you have to overshoot. Usually you can overshoot to the next even letter, but sometimes you end up overshooting even further. In either case, it's always faster to overshoot and then accelerate backwards, than to stop early and inch forwards. This has the effect of making the input look a little bit sloppy, but I assure you that all my text input is optimal (aside from the RNG framerule thing).

For that, I'm not really seeing sufficient support accumulated from votes and comments, with the "gameplay", such as it is, not showing a lot of merit - particularly because the minigames are not actually played, just ended as quickly as possible (short of outright skipping them). In the end, there's just too little appeal for it to really be worth a Moon. As such, rejecting.
