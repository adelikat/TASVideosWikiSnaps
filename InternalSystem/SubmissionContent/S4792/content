	"Danan: The Jungle Fighter is a platformer game for Sega Master System. The protagonist is a Conan the Barbarian clone who has experience points and "animal powers". None of the animal powers are used in the run, because they are slow and weak. There is minor damage boosting and careful experience point management, but precise boss fights are what make this different from a real-time run. Nothing overly exciting for any TAS veteran, but it is a solid old-school TAS.

Boss fights were good, too, although the last few toward the end became repetitive (perhaps better AI cycles could be found, in the future?).  All in all, a nice effort put forth for an old-school SMS title.
