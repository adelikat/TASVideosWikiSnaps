	"In this game Lolo tries to save Lala. He's doing this by collecting every heartpiece in the room. After this a treasure chest opens with a pearl inside. If you collect this pearl a door will open and you advance to the next level. This game contains 50 of these levels, and in this movie I'm trying to complete them as fast as possible.
