	", tDTTF is a short concept game for the ByteOff! 2020 game jam in which Mikey McMike wakes up with a hangover on the day of his wedding. In his rush to the wedding, he is sucked through time and must travel through various time periods to reach the wedding. This TAS exploits an OoB-esque glitch to reach the ending in just 10 seconds.

	"This game isn't particularly well-polished and that leads to some pretty major bugs. The one being executed here involving jumping over an NPC in between level rooms which opens up a hole in the floor which McMike can jump into. This leads to falling into below screens and the same trick can be repeated until the hole to the ending screen in which a chiptune version of Never Gonna Give You plays. To end input as early as possible, I move as far right on the second to last screen as possible so that McMike is pretty much on the trigger to open up the floor so L has to be held for a minimal amount of time.

	"On an unrelated note, I did manage to find a way to softlock the game which is obviously of no use but fun nonetheless. If you hold either up or down and another direction then let go of that direction, McMike will continue to run in the previously held direction. In the first level, doing this while running into an enemy will stop the screen scrolling and he will be pushed of the screen and can't be brought back. Interesting but pointless, just like this TAS.
