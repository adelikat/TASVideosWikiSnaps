	"Various people have worked on individual levels without pressing B, such as Really_Tall, Sharkey91, SkicoNow, Josh65536, and Adeal. Eventually we eliminated all of the B presses required for an Any% run. This run has never been done before, and is the result of the work of all these people. Many strategies have been developed during the making of this TAS, to be as entertaining as possible.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"To beat the final stage, Bowser in the Sky, or BitS, without pressing B, we need to use Yoshi for his unique tongue ability. Reaching BitS as Yoshi is possible using a heaven portal (see below) with only 50 stars, but there is no known way to skip the 50 star door as Yoshi. Therefore we need to open the 50 star door, which can only be done as Mario. So the the basic route outline is: unlock Mario and collect 50 stars to open the 50 star door, then switch to Yoshi and go to BitS and beat the game.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Additionally, a certain version of the game is required, specifically for BitS. In the original North American release, U 1.0, the physics when bouncing on an enemy are slightly different compared to all other versions. They work more like the original SM64, in that the action before you touched the enemy is relevant: if you long jump onto an enemy, you will remain in the long jump animation while bouncing, and keep your speed. On later versions you are always set to a regular jumping state when you bounce on an enemy. This is important because the bounce after recovering from a slidekick goes higher on 1.0 than on any other version, which means you can reach the ledge after the first spinning platforms in BitS with a goomba bounce.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Beating the game as Yoshi also has an unusual caveat, since it was never intended. You die in the Rainbow Ride section of the credits and are kicked back to the castle grounds, so the credits sequence isn't completed. However, the game does not unlock anything when beaten, or even save, so not reaching The End shouldn't be grounds for rejection.

This is because, when landing, the game doesn't put you in the freefall state, so if we land on the edge of a floor, we can dive while not being on the platform. This small distance is enough to reach the platform with the pole. Then we manipulate the fly guy, and when we bounce on him, we get negative speed. When twirling after bouncing on a fly guy (or with a luigi backflip, tornado...) It's faster to go backwards. Going backwards allows us to have enough speed to reach the platform. Sadly, we have to wait for the swinging platform to come back before continuing this star.
