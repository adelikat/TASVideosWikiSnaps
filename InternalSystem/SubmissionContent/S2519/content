	"This run plays the "Flashing Columns" mode. In this way you will have to destroy a jewel flashing in the bottom of the screen juego.Tambi√©n there is a counter which records the fastest time. I decided to cancel my other 
	[a class=intlink href=/2517S 
		"movie
	]a
	" to improve it, and this time I did it with 2 players. For me it was difficult to control both with a person driving, but with practice will do better, in my case cost me a lot but never mind
