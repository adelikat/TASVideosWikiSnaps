		"well there is some time ago, when i was watching my Old Original TAS Run, I was like I know this can be improved. Still, I'm not sure where to start, so it took me a few weeks to prepare together, and some days I'm too lazy to just get on crazy taxi to find good customers like the hidden customer on Arcade mode where the grandma is. Still, now today i decided to  put that work into this tas, but now im glad i did so yeah that's how it happened.

	"The answer to that like i said, in my last submissions, is That Gena, have the best handling and steering throughout cast,  the other thing what's so special about Gena that Taxi Car is so small, which allows me to fit through traffic so easily in tight spaces like i did in my other Crazy Taxi runs or this Run where i fit the tight space at the beginning, at this point Gena is the best Character in the game.

I'm moving on trying to get other emulators set up on my machine, and I was never able to unlock the "import" feature to get the movie file loaded. Not sure why. At least I have an environment ready...I just have to continuing learning.
