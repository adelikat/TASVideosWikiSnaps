To draw a sketch you need to collect a page, each page gives you a set sketch. After using a sketch Woody will reduce its height. These sketches are not really used in the TAS since the time it takes to go out of your way to get a specific sketch, then selecting the sketch on the sketch menu, waiting out the animation, and then waiting the other animation after the sketch effect is done, negates all possible timesaves.

Also, when Woody is in the middle of getting in position to erase an enemy, if there's something in between Woody can stand on, the erasing animation will be cancelled, very fortunate.
