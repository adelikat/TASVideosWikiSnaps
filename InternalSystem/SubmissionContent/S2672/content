	"WarioWare Touched! Is a game where you have to think fast... Random games will be shown and you will only have around 5 seconds to complete them, however, the further you go, the faster the game goes, it will keep going faster and faster until you go crazy, just like the game. this game can be funny, wierd, especially random, and discusting... This is a fun game for people who likes to think fast. (see also WarioWare Inc, WarioWare: Twisted! and WarioWare: Smooth moves
