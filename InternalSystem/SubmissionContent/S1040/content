	"Each of the 8 levels is divided into a sidescroller and a maze/shooter level.  The sidescrollers are meant to allow you to build up your life and bombs by getting powerups, and you can die 3 times there before a game over.  Once inside the fortress you have to find the life core and kill it, then get to your escape ship before the place blows.  If you die once in here its game over.  This game has two quests.  I use a password to play the second one because it is identical to the first quest for the first four levels, and the last four levels use the same maze, but the tunnels go to different places.  Also there are much more enemies in the second quest.

	"Once in the fortress pushing up, left, or right, or firing a weapon takes energy.  Pushing down does nothing to speed up your fall.  Falling gives you back energy, as does riding an elevator or taking a pipe.  Elevators are like 2-way streets - you can go back and forth in them.  Pipes are like 1-way streets - if you go through a pipe you just came out of it might take you somewhere else.  This is why you see me going back in pipes I just came out of.

	"This game has a lot of lag, and firing the bombs can add a lot of lag.  That is why I don't use them unless I absolutely need to.  But then killing enemies can reduce lag as well, so I use the bombs if it is a favorable tradeoff.

	"The one glitch I use is to move through the screw things.  Just face away from them at a certain distance and fire, and you can pass through them.  Also, I found that when pressing up against the wall if your back is to the wall you are closer than your front.  Also in one room in level 5 I have to move down, then up, because otherwise the screen does not scroll properly (see the thread for this game in the forum for an exp.).
