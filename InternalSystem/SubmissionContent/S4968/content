	"I chose the first card deck since it was the fastest. I'm not sure if choosing others would be faster due to different combo animations, so that needs to be checked. The giant rat fight was a pain; I wasn't able to manipulate the 3rd and 4th hits to be a critical instead. That would've allowed me to kill the 2 smaller rats first for shorter enemy turns. There's that crash glitch I didn't use here since I wasn't able to get anything useful out of it, so that may be worth investigating for anyone who knows how.

I had thought of using the spiders encountered tonight to hijack their turns and kill me, but then Daniel Griffith/psirockin123 showed that it only works for enemies faster than you, which is rather difficult barring bosses at level 78. gand988 informed me that real time runners get by this by save, reseting, then using a card afterwards to die, but because there's a chicken fight later, I wasn't sure it's worth doing it here.

Poisoning without petrify softlocks the game. Finally, unlike the previous battle, I had to petrify to skip it's turn.

	"Note: Even in combat, it depends on if the dialogue was still ongoing before a transition. If the dialogue hasn't stopped, dying in combat crashes the game. If the dialogue went through, or there was none, it may or may not crash/softlock; often it simply deathwarps you to whatever the last location is, but doesn't proceed with the story. Also if the dialogue was triggered at the win screen, it softlocks. Triggering the dialogue during combat, but winning will potentially warp you to 0,0 assuming dialogue hasn't finished. Finally, in the case if the dialogue was triggered mid combat, and the during a brief moment when there's no text the battle proceeded to the win screen, there's a chance it may either softlock, or restart the dialogue.
