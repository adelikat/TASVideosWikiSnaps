	"Hello, TASvideos. My name is NDS_Emil and this is my second submission. Street Fighter 2 was very popular, but it was so f*cking slow ( excuse me for the swering.), so Capcom made Street Fighter 2 Turbo and it really worked and soon Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo was relesed. Many years later a GBA remake was relesed and it's was called Super Street Fighter II Turbo - Revival and that's my first complete speed run ever on TASvideos.
