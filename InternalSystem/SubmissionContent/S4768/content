		"The Quest of Ki
	]em
	" (カイの冒険) is a video game developed by Namco in 1988. It is part of the 
	[em 
		"Tower of Druaga
	]em
	" series (in fact, it serves as a prequel to the series). The player controls Ki, a priestess sent by Ishtar in order to retrieve the Blue Crystal Rod, which was stolen by Druaga.

	"In this run, warps were used. The warps route is as follows: 1 -> 6 -> 11 -> 19 -> 28 -> 37 -> 44 -> 51 -> 58 -> 59 -> 60. Note that there are special floors after floor 60 (floors 61-100); however, after talking to senior judge 
	(__wikiLink|user:Mothrayas)
	", I decided to not include them. However, I do think they should be included in a warpless run, should one ever be made.

	"There's not much to talk about the floors, except that it takes about 4-5 seconds between grabbing the chest containing a warp and the warp actually taking effect. By the way, you can still die in that time period and have to re-do the entire floor again. I decided to at least make something interesting out of these periods.

	"I first heard of this game by watching a Japanese show called 
	[em 
		"GameCenter CX
	]em
	" (ゲームセンターＣＸ), where a middle-aged comedian called Arino Shinya attempts to beat a retro game, while being supported by various ADs (Assistent Directors). Check out 
	[a class=extlink href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameCenter_CX rel=nofollow 
		"this Wikipedia article
	]a
	" for more details. It's a pretty fun show to watch, actually (if you don't understand Japanese, check out SA-GCCX, a fansubbing group (link below)
