	"Ok so let me address the movie format.  This TAS was made using libTAS running MAME.  This allows me to use an input editor similar to the ones in FCEUX and TAStudio.  Since the TASing tools in MAME-rr are not exactly ideal and because FBA-rr is very outdated and has emulation problems, I wanted to wait until there was a more practical way to TAS arcade games.  MAMEHawk is still a bit of a ways away, so I started looking into libTAS using MAME since it's been hinted at for a long time:
