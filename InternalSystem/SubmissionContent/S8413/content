	" is a 1992 SNES/Genesis game based on the Barbie franchise of dolls. You play as - that's right, Barbie, to move her past obstacles as she drives, rollerskates, walks and cycles her way through 4 levels.

	"After watching a ~5 second cutscene of Barbie daydreaming about whatever mode of transport she wants to use, the level ironically starts. All you have to do is hold Y and move up or down to avoid tripping over anything, from things that make sense like people and water, to things that absolutely don't like birds and... SAND?! How the hell do you trip over SAND?!

	": This submission appears to actually be 1 frame slower than this 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=previously rejected submission|href=/6027S)
	". The older submission has blank frames at the end, which trimming those results in a time 1 frame less than this submission. The older movie also syncs on BizHawk 2.8, and thus eliminating emulation differences here. The older submission was rejected under the old triviality rules, but since those don't apply anymore, it should be unrejected and judged under the newer rules. This itself means this movie would be rejected, as it fails to beat this older submission.

[div class=p 
	"There is another issue here. This submission gets a "bad ending" which seems more analogous to a "game over," simply displaying a "Try again" screen. Obtaining 5000 points is required in order to get the "good ending," which this "good ending" also features credits (indicating that it is a proper ending), unlike the "bad ending" this submission obtains. The older submission also suffers from this issue, and thus it would need to be re-judged with this consideration.
