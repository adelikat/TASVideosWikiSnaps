You can't go any lower than level 3 or 300 ex. which is needed for level 3 - because right off the bat, Bogarda gave you 700 ex. after defeating him back at Dew village.  Once you get this 700 experience, there is no turning back!!!  Due to slower and more sluggish sword control (although inflicting three hits per swing), and very limited HP where Willow was able to die from one Muzh needle, those are the reasons why I gave up a large number of frames.  But at the same time, I would call this entertainment because of the positioning and movement that TheAxeMan once demonstrated.  I took this into heart, no doubt.

This perfectly explains why there is a big difference between both towers, because the West tower (as you notice) takes longer to climb.  Luck manipulation is the key not only to avoid enemy encounters, but also to better manage Willow's MP condition to say the least.  Make sure he has 40 MP minimum before he gets the Red Crystal - so he can Fleet out of the West tower and later safely warp back to the Bar.  Otherwise, yes, problems.  More faster movement, but still tough.

I didn't take a significant loss of movie frames as a failure, like 1236 for example.  I took it as a way toward a greater accomplishment.

	"I discovered a positioning method where I was able to use the Thunder spell nine times before hand-fighting the red ghosts again.  But the problem was that I had to see exactly which coordinates I was positioned.  So that was when I went back and ran TheAxeMan's simple LUA script where it will display Willow's coordinates!  I strongly recommend you use this as you will be taught exactly how this is supposed to be done.

After you came out of the first stairway, you'll want to go two screens East and that is where my hot spot was for level-grinding.  You also want to always start off at Y-coordinate 130.  Start traveling to the right, but without leaving the screen.

I wanted to poke the sword where the red ghost(s) that took a hit was one or two pixels in front of me.  Being that close allowed me to push seven, possibly eight ghosts back.  Grouping them together in a pile was also the key.

	"[12]  You may need to manipulate the appearance of those green magic balls (don't worry about the first 10 MP you already got) - where you're able to get them all in one sword poke so that the game will start counting up MP.  If your sword-poke timing is done right, you might have six magic balls and one more red ghost in front of you.  One more sword-poke will kill the last red ghost on that screen and grab the 6 magic balls.  For this benefit, what I would do is wait a frame or two for that last red ghost.  I want that last red ghost to come as close to me as possible so I won't have to go too far to get the magic ball out of THAT one as I grab the other six, all at the same time.

	"After that, start moving screen to screen, manipulating red ghosts' appearance and using Thunder to kill them right on the spot.  And that's the best way for me to explain how I used that positioning and movement method to my advantage.  If it wasn't for TheAxeMan's simple coordinate LUA script, it would've been tough for me to even guess which coordinates I should've been at.  As many times as you will see this technique in this movie, believe me when I say that it works everytime!

	"[P0RTAL 0F RAIN]:  My decision is to cancel this run and put this game to rest for good.  Even on a ton of anonymous Yes votes combined with mixed visual feedback, it's pretty easy to read the minds of an average judge.  To me, it's better to cancel submissions rather than having a judge reject it anyway.  This is the second game that I consider "wasted" since Scheherazade.  If I want to find a better game to TAS regardless of any form of entertainment in general, I'm sure there can be plenty out there.  BUT for majority, they're already occupied and the times that are posted are either unbeatable, flawless, or even inaccurate (since FCEU changed to FCEUX and its frame rate changed from 60.0 to 60.1).  It will take countless hours to discover anything (including significant glitches) that would shatter 1'05:41.  It could possibly take a different ROM with a bad dump to see if anything would turn out, but everything I listed here is only the information that others will learn if they would want to be in my shoes when taking another shot in this game.  Today, I consider Willow buried.  R.I.P.
