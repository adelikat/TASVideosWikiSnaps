	"The World's Hardest Game 2 is the second installment of the The World's Hardest Game series released in 2008. In the game, the player is a red square who must reach the end of 50 levels. The player must also avoid enemy circles that can hit the red square and reset progress in the level. This TAS movie attempts to complete the game as fast as possible without using any major glitches.

				" In order for a death to register under normal Flash Player conditions, one of the square's enemy collision contact points have to contact an enemy's current bounding box as well as  one of the enemy's rendered pixels from the previous frame. Due to this, moving enemy hitboxes on the Flash Player act as if they were smaller. This could be considered as a major glitch since you are able to phase through faster enemies and save large amounts of time. (

					"Pausing:
				]b
				" Pressing the menu or pause buttons cause enemy collision checks on the frame before to be essentially ignored. This can be abused by spamming pauses to move right through enemies. Another glitch that occurs with pausing happens if you pause before an intermission ends and a new level starts. You can play the game normally with the pause screen visible, and you are able to ignore one enemy hit before you have to unpause to hide the menu. Pausing is not used because repeatedly doing so creates rapidly flashing visuals, which may be unenjoyable to watch.
