	"That being said, after holding off on improving this game for a number of years, I figured I might as well try Bizhawk out and see if it had any new tools compared to my old run on FCEUX. Well, not really, but there was a single frame saved simply due to emulator differences, so take that into account when comparing runs.

	"What really saved time was me realizing that I was wrong in that multiple jumps were better than one long jump (so, thommy3 was right all along). I don't know where I got the idea that I gain a pixel from another jump, as looking at the memory address for the speed, it fluctuated the same regardless, so maximizing air time was the key here.

	"However, this did make the platforming a little trickier, as I was basically freefalling through most of the levels and couldn't take things in bite sized chunks. This turned the headache inducing sewer levels into absolute migraines.

	"Overall, was able to lower the time due to simple optimization. Wouldn't surprise me if you could shave some frames here and there, but we'll see what the future holds.

	": As a connoisseur of bears, anti-drug sentiments, unlicensed NES games, and the Oxford comma, this was a nice and unexpected improvement! Glad to see that even relatively simplistic games can still be optimized even further. While some would say "any less of this game is an improvement", I'm just happy to see Wallace Bear continue to realize his potential for speed (not the drug). Accepting as an improvement to
