Besides the combo, we get to see the Spike Ceiling used but not abused because of a flaw in Shang Tsung's character; You can't do his Pit/Ceiling Fatality as Shang Tsung nor can a morphed-into character do anything after the corpse hits the ceiling (such as a Friendship or Babality).

Besides that, her combos can be diverse other than some other characters.  There's really no chance for Jax, it looks as though he wasn't ready for round two.  He thinks he has a chance when he's going a projectile frenzy but to no avail.  At one point Johnny Cage appears and dodges Jax's moves where he sneaks in a sucker punch which Shao Kahn thought was so hilarious.  This fight has quite a 'comical but no flop' fatality where Jax's bones are apparent but his body's intact doing some sort of balance-inducing dance, after being smacked with one rock-solid bone, which ultimately failed.

Johnny Cage can be difficult to manipulate but that's okay, it makes it more fun and entertaining when he meets his maker.  One thing to note in the fight is how 'unlearned' Johnny Cage appears to be.  Glitched fatality is Jax popping off Cage's extra set of arms while severely burning his body and making a tree spew blood, yeah right.

One thing being the signature 2 right-handed, invisible punches (like last time).  At the point of Johnny Cage appearing in this fight, I'd like to apologize for all the jumping but it's the fastest form of backwards traveling.  You'll see a confused Kitana, not knowing where Johnny Cage (even though he's pushing her) is until it's too late, Bam!: Shadowkick followed up with the signature derisive laugh and point of Johnny Cage.  Now we get to see Reptile do his thing where his head comes off and jumps around the room before settling on the wall, his body deep and unleashed tongue that eats Kitana's head with no clue as if it went into his body or just plain disappeared, and Kitana's floating, headless body with a pool of blood being careful by not mocking 'relative and metaphoric' physics.

In this fight we get to see the rare and uncertain Red Shadowkick and by uncertain I mean what else does it do besides sound and look different?  Johnny Cage seems a little insecure and really wants Liu Kang to back off.  Kitana makes her appearance to throw a fan that Liu Kang is damned to duck under until his demise.  After missing hitting him over and over again she cuts the BS and sweeps him good.  And now Kung Lao comes on into the fight to decapitate Liu Kang but fails to do so and begins to let just let 'em have it before plunging his body onto the hard, hard ground.  Sorry it's not as redeeming as before but the screen scrolled and I found myself with less time to do things to him.

One way is by using a projectile by either Liu Kang, Reptile, Sub-Zero, Shang Tsung, Kitana, Mileena, Baraka, Scorpion, and Rayden.

	"There's a couple of things you can do to manipulate your opponent.  You can jump away from them at a certain distance and they'll jump toward you.  As long as you don't impose a threat, they'll comply.  Another thing you can do is at a certain distance if you jump toward your opponent they'll continuously back up and as long as you keep up with them, don't threaten them, and aren't too far away from them.

	"There's also something you can do with the Glitched Fatality starter.  If you throw a projectile, after you start the glitch, you may have a chance of getting them to stay stuck, ducking, anticipating the projectile but it never comes.  As long as you don't touch them, they'll stay that way forever.

	"If you throw a fan at someone from far away, while you're in mid air, close to the ground, and then as soon as possible do the fan lift, they'll start backing up uncontrollably for a while.  You can continuously do this.  Thanks to Dark Fulgore for this one.

	" Quick Punch Animation

]h4
[p 
	"I found out somewhere near the 3/4 mark in the making of this run that if you do either High Punch or Low Punch and then follow up about a frame or two later with anything like a Low Kick or High Kick then your punch will be much quicker.  It's really useful if you're going to do an air combo because you'll be able to leave the ground sooner.

	[li 
		"Early on, even on Very Hard mode, your opponent's AI is much dumber than, say, when you fight Shang Tsung; They'll walk into a lot of your moves and don't fall victim to usual manipulation like the later on opponents do.  I guess this is much like the Arcade where the game gets ridiculously hard as you progress.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"You can only seem to get your opponent to back away from you indefinitely when you are in control of the player 2 slot.  It seems that way because I couldn't get them to do it from the first player slot.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Your opponent can do some unfair things like Sub-Zero being able to do his freeze while the ground is frozen while you can't.  Also, Kitana can do her fan throw over and over again even before it gets off screen.  They can also do uppercuts without even ducking and can always seem to throw you unless they are in the middle of an animation whether it be from a move or from being tripped.  They also have annoying reaction time where, let's say, you trip them and then try to jump over them but you'll find that it's no good because they'll be in the air, kicking you before they even get up.
		$LF

		"If you do a fatality on the last possible frame before it says who won, the screen may lose some text and some interesting effects may occur like reanimation.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"If you jump in the corner toward your opponent while it says finish him, input your buttons for the fatality on the first possible frame you hit the ground on, you may end up having your character turned around doing the fatality.
