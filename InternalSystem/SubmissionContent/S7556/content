	"When starting the game, the game menu first shows up. This is where I need to quickly configure the difficulty, as well as the text speed to VERY FAST. This helps with unskippable cutscenes with a lot of dialogues.

	"I skipped most of the early areas, entered an unskippable cutscene, and jump straight to the Armstrong Thruway, to enter the Merlin's Secret. This shop contains a rare item, called the Lotto Tix, which allows the player to get a lottery to see what prize they would get. The easiest prizes to get while being worth its value is the 4th prize, which nets you $100.00, and you can obtain this prize relatively common, compared to other prizes. I had to buy multiple Lotto Tix in order to get enough money to buy a lot of important stats-boosting items and special techniques.

[div class=p 
	"The next boss is ROCKO. Entering the factory is where I begin fighting the gang in that area. Luckily, it's the Frat Boys, so their HP is pretty low and they are all easy to deal with. When ROCKO enters, I had to guide the enemy towards the left-most side of the factory, and then initiate the glitch to make ROCKO fall through the ground by re-aligning his position. If I don't do this, the battle will take even longer to finish.

	"When it comes to shop inventory, so I had to quickly enter the settings menu, toggle the inventory refresh frequency to "Every", which means, it will refresh the shop inventory every time I enter the shop.

[div class=p 
	"After BLADE is dealt with, the next boss is TURK. But I know this boss is harder than BLADE. What I did here is I skip ahead to Flatiron Mall and go buy 12 Army Boots and some special techniques, to get max PUNCH and KICK stats. Then I go back to where TURK is and defeat the gang, which by the way, made a HUGE difference in terms of quickly overpowering them. Once all the gang members are defeated, and TURK arrives, I make another quick work and moved on to MOJO, which like TURK, makes for a quick and easy fight.

	"After defeating THOR, I ran straight towards River City High, and aimed for IVAN. This time, IVAN has much higher stats than the Zombies, so he is able to recover and tank my hits pretty well. I just have to time my kicks so that each time he is airborne, I can easily get a double-digits damage on him. After defeating IVAN, I go ahead and enter River City High School.

	"Heading upstairs towards the roof of River City High, the next battle is the DRAGON TWIN, ANDY and RANDY. This time, I opt to try juggling them with my kicks, so I can concentrate on my attacks on both of them at the same time. Grouping them together helps to save time fighting them.
