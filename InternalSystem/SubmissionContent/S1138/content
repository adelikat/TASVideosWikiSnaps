	"For my first run I did choose a rather unknown game: " BS Kaizou Tyoujin Shubibinman Zero " (strange name isn't it?!) this game has very nice graphics (similar to Megaman 7), music resembling rockman X games, and  has a quite entertaining Co-operative mode... This game has a very simple history... a lot similar to the famous TV series " Power Rangers " (or any other anything)... an evil boss wants conquer the world and you need to stop him... hah!

	"A: If you touch in the fire you are pushed to the side of which you came. There's no way to be pushed through the fire in this place. But in the 5th part of the 6th stage there was an enemy that can attack you so you can pass through the fire without waiting, so i used it there.
