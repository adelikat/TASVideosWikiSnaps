	"For my first run I did choose a rather unknown game: " BS Kaizou Tyoujin Shubibinman Zero " (strange name isn't it?!) this game has very nice graphics (similar to Megaman 7), music resembling rockman X games, and  has a quite entertaining Co-operative mode... This game has a very simple history... a lot similar to the famous TV series " Power Rangers " (or any other anything)... an evil boss wants conquer the world and you need to stop him... hah!

	"Q: Why do you only play with the girl and not with the boy, or 2 players mode?
	[b

		"A: The girl has an air raid with the sword that thrusts her forward, which the boy doesn't have. So he would just slow down the whole thing.

		"Q: Why in the 3rd part of the 6th stage do you wait the fire instead of taking damage?
	]b
	$LF
	"A: If you touch in the fire you are pushed to the side of which you came. There's no way to be pushed through the fire in this place. But in the 5th part of the 6th stage there was an enemy that can attack you so you can pass through the fire without waiting, so i used it there.
