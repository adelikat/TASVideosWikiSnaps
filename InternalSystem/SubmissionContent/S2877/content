	"This technique debuted in the 
	[a href=/2802S 
		"newgame+
	]a
	" run, but there it was done by luck instead of by design. But once HHS explained the principles behind it, I was able to perform it at will. The basic idea is to manipulate the next free object slot(s) so that a specific object loads into it. In most cases this won't accomplish anything useful; but in a few specific cases, this object may either be forcibly overwritten by another object (see Hydrocity 1 comments) or be mistaken for another object (see Angel Island and Carnival Night 2 comments).

	"Once Tails' "despawns", you can press (or hold) any jump button in order to force him to re-spawn. This can save a considerable amount of time (up to 63 frames in the worst-case scenario), and it can be used even if you can't control Sonic. This can be done whenever RAM address 0xFFF708 (Tails CPU routine) is set to 2. This also applies to Sonic 2.

[p 
	"This consists of using a flame dash into the ground to get stuck in it. It requires horizontal speed to get far enough in (and quickly enough) and sloped terrain of the type found only on Sandopolis. Sadly, despite being in several places in Sandopolis 1, none of them lead to useful shortcuts. Once stuck in the ground, Sonic will slide along the slope and zip once at the bottom, entering the slope. He will also most likely end up with an horizontal ground lock in place for a few frames, meaning left and right directions will only work on the air.

This trade off happened in Launch Base 2, where skipping the Knuckles cutscene and the mid-boss cause the full post-Launch Base 2 cutscene to run (albeit in glitched form) for its normal full length. The cutscene skip results in a

This trick was stumbled upon by mike89 when doing an unassisted 2-player speed-run; HHS figured out how it works and I implemented it without losing any time. It works as follows: when Tails brakes before the boss, the braking pattern is chosen so that the dust kicked up fills the first few object slots, preventing boss-area objects from using them. When Knuckles and the switch are loaded after the score tally, they will be loaded into these slots. The switch is loaded, in fact, in the exact same slot that Knuckles used at the start of the level -- this causes the switch to mistake itself for Knuckles and fire as soon as it is loaded, returning control to Sonic.

	"Those damn balloons forced me to replay this entire level twice over. But thanks to the forced Tails respawn, I get him to arrive right in the nick of time to grab Sonic at the Knuckles cut-scene. By the way: were it not for the fact that I skipped Knuckles earlier in the level, it would be possible to trick the switch into thinking it is Knuckles in said cut-scene, with similar results as from the Angel Island trick.

This is where the major speed for entertainment trade-off comes: the falling death egg cut-scene runs its full length (whereas it is glitched and faster in the previous version of the run), but the Knuckles cut-scene is about 4 times longer than this increase.

Better use of Tails also gives quite an improvement at the end of the level, particularly at the boss: Robotnik's invincibility timer from the last hit I land before the Egg Golem closes up for the first time is still going when the Egg Golem opens up again. But on opening, it forces the hit box back on, and stops the timer at the current value, from where it will resume after the next hit.
