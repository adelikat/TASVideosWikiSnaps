	"Not only it is an hard game at full speed but it is also hard to timeattack due to a lot of randomness. Probably the reason it is a hard game at regular speed. With Friday the 13th and The Goonies, Adv. of Bayou Billy is another one with complicated randomness. After stage 1, I got 5035 undo count for 2:09 of gameplay.
