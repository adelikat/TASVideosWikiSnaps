	"The King of Fighters '96 (KOF '96) is a fighting game released by SNK for the Neo Geo arcade and home consoles in 1996. It is the third game in The King of Fighters series, following The King of Fighters '95. Like its predecessor, the game was ported to the Neo-Geo CD, as well as the PlayStation and Sega Saturn. 
	$LF
	"The game made a few changes to gameplay such as new techniques, various changes of some teams, with a few of them introducing new characters. The plot follows a new King of Fighters tournament created by Chizuru Kagura, the heir of Yata Clan who wants to find and recruit Kyo Kusanagi, who defeated the previous host, Rugal Bernstein, to ask him and his bitter rival, Iori Yagami, to help her in the sealing of the Orochi demon. The new boss is one of the servants from Orochi, Goenitz, who appears after Chizuru is defeated.

	"If a word should describe the reason behind picking KOF '96 probably would be: Challenge.
	$LF
	"Tha was a big challenge for me that time, I made this run years ago after so much working on both researching and asking for feedback from KOF community friends, the reason why it was a big challenge is because we are talking about The King of Fighters, a franchise stuffed with unique interactions, speed and glitches amoung the entire series were the community keep discovering new combo and glitch stuff every year, having that in mind it's one of the hardest fighting games to work on even knowing everything behind trick, combos & glitch stuff. I made a route based on doing multiple 2 players matches at start while CPU fights should end the run seemed the way to go.
	$LF
	"With that being said let's understand how crazy a KOF game can be even a old hat one like '96.
