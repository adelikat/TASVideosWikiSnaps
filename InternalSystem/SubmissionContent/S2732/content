	"Digger is a platforming game released in 1990 by Milton Bradley (developed by Rare). It is considered to be one of the hardest games on the NES library, but it is a fairly obscure game, and thus many people haven’t 
	$LF
	"played it yet. There are 8 levels, but the first 3 can be basically skipped using a warp.
