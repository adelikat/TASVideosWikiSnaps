	"First of all, this is my first time submitting a movie. Until then, my friend had always been my substitute for me. My English is very poor, and if there are any sentences that are not smooth to read, please forgive me. It has been more than half a year since I first submitted and produced the movie. Besides work, In my spare time, I am also working hard to learn some techniques. Furthermore, I am very grateful to Mr. Shinryuu for his guidance and skills. This has allowed me to observe these subtle operations more carefully. To further challenge myself, I am reminded of this HACK produced by Mr. woabclf. This TAS has been around for 13 years now. I want to further improve this game, This is a very difficult challenge for me, but I still have to try to challenge it. Another reason is that I think this hack is really good. I chose the Japanese version with normal difficulty. Compared to the difficult mode, this is more user-friendly as it can use more game faults to complete the game faster. A total of 15 delayed scrolling attempts were used throughout the entire process. There may be some imperfections, but I tried my best.In addition, I used the menu malfunction discovered by Mr. WarmCabin  here. It's really amazing
