[p 
	"Super Turrican is a somewhat popular series of games, and this is the NES version.  It was created by one guy--the programming is quite good but the game design is not.  The levels are huge, but tend to be linear.  There are quite a few weapons, and a number of interesting maneuvers.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Your gun can get quite a few powerups throughout the game, although a speed run doesn't make much use of them.  You also have a flamethrower, which activates after holding the fire button for a while.  You have a limited-use weapon that shoots fireballs in many directions.  I call this weapon the "Special."  It does the most damage of any weapon, and proved to be extremely useful for killing bosses.  However, the Special attack can't be fired until all the fireballs from the previous Special have disappeared.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Your most potent weapon, however, is changing forms.  I call it ball form, but really you look like a sawblade.  While in ball form, you're immune to most types of damage, and you damage any enemy you go through.  It's also the fastest form of travel.  The downside is, you can't jump in ball form.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There are 4 difficulty settings.  However they only affect enemy HP and don't change the run at all, other than making boss fights a little longer.  So I elected to use the default difficulty of 2, as the Famtasia run did.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If you enjoy the process of frame-optimization, you'll love this game.  There are many ways to perform every jump, and it's rarely obvious what will be fastest.  Sometimes a 1-pixel difference in position will translate into a couple frames saved or lost.

	"PAL vs NTSC
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"I decided on NTSC because:  that's what the Famtasia run used; the game runs fine; and it doesn't even output any more scanlines while in PAL than in NTSC.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Older versions of FCEU (I used the 98.16 I released a couple months ago) don't properly detect PAL/NTSC settings from the movie.  If the movie doesn't sync in your FCEU, it's because it's trying to run in PAL mode.  Try deleting the "(E)" from the ROM name and it should work.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"I couldn't find any interesting glitches in this game, but there's a lot of subtle tricks to save frames.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The most obvious trick, probably intentional, is that you can jump after leaving ball form, even if you're not on the ground.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"While in ball form, you bounce after dropping to the ground.  But you can prevent that by switching out of ball form for 1 frame.  I use this "bounce-canceling" frequently.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Conversely, you can often force yourself to bounce while in ball form.  By going over an edge and then coming back, you'll bounce.  This is not present in the Famtasia movie and saved me quite a bit of time.  You can clear small gaps without leaving ball form, and you can do an extra high jump by bouncing, and then jumping at the peak of your bounce.
	$LF

[p 
	"Damage boosting:  When you take damage, you are instantly propelled about 8 pixels horizontally.

The result is a slightly faster route.  I also save some time by bouncing off of some bad guys' heads.  I had to manage my health carefully because there are many spots where you either have to kill an enemy or take damage.

The actual boss is slow to kill because he has a very small hitbox.  I can only hit him with a small fraction of my Special attack, but using the Special still gives the most damage per second.  Once I run out of Specials, I kill him with my flamethrower in a very unexciting manner.
