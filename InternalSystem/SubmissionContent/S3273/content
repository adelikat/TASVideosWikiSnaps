	"Kaizo Mario World is a well-known Super Mario World Hack, specifically for the reason that it was one of the hardest hacks of its time, and it even spawned a category of Super Mario World hacks known as Kaizo hacks. This run is of its sequel, Kaizo Mario World 2, and aims to complete the game as fast as possible.

	"The level design in this game is absolutely horrid. The levels themselves are not cohesive or aesthetically pleasing. Enemies which don't really go with the terrain are present, sometimes with graphical glitches. Enemies are seemingly floating in the air, or packed into absurd places, all in the name of difficulty. Nothing about the game itself bears any kind of professional polish.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Putting visuals and enemy placement absurdities aside, the levels aren't that great either. A bunch of levels are designed with very little room to maneuver. Notwithstanding a few exploitable situations, a run of these levels will generally look the same every time. "Impossible" segments were long, frequent, and placed together, instead of littered throughout a large game. The auto-scrolling segments for the most part were also boring.

	"In terms of how well this hack shows off the Super Mario World engine, I'd perhaps give it a 15% rating. There's so many great things SMW has, various items, levels with multiple exits, levels with varied routes, and so on. This game barely touches on what can be done. Many SMW hacks are also known for adding cool things onto the SMW engine, instead of using the minimum Nintendo gave us.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"There are tons of great SMW hacks out there which have greatly altered the game, giving us a fresh look, and sometimes even varied mechanics from other Mario games, or something completely fresh. They have tons of amazing memorable levels which would make for a great TAS. Some of them have extremely hard segments throughout their levels, but not as concentrated as this one. I'd accept any of those despite being hacks.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The precedence till now for an adequate run with a mediocre hack has been to accept the best of a similar set of hacks. However, we also have a precedence with Super Metroid hacks that even a completely unrelated hack can obsolete one which has little to offer. If I were to accept this, I would have to allow it to be obsoleted by some other SMW hack, which I find rather arbitrary, as there are so many acceptable ones to choose from. The arbitrary nature of such a decision messes up obsoletion chains, which I'd rather not get into. I'd also have to consider if perhaps a publication of this run should be immediately obsoleted by one of our Super Demo World runs.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"The run itself while looking amazing in reality doesn't benefit all that much from TASing, compared to how an average run of the game would look. This is because the vast majority of people playing this game will be using save states and other emulator features anyway. As above, too much of the game pigeonholes you into one possible route for a given segment.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"So contrasting this run with our existing runs of SDW, or some WIPs I've seen of other SMW hacks, I don't see this run offering anything special that we can't get better elsewhere, or already have to an extent. Coupled with our strict guidelines for what makes a TAS special, and what basic requirements a hack needs to meet in order to be accepted, I have no choice but to reject this.
