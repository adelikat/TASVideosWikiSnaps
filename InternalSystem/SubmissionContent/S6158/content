	"Axiom Verge is a metroidvania game created by Thomas Happ and released in 2015. This TAS completes the game as fast as possible in the speedrun mode. This mode shows an in-game timer, disables all cutscenes, and uses a fixed seed for the random number generator. This TAS starts at a slow pace, but once the drone-swap ability is acquired, movement changes radically.

	"Like many modern games, Axiom Verge has framerate-independent physics, and an in-game option to deactivate vsync. Unassisted speedrunners have witnessed that having the game running at a high framerate makes the Laser Drill, the Address Disruptor (glitch gun) and the Red Coat damage more efficient, thus top speedruns are currently done with vsync off. I could confirm this behavior, and interpreted it as followed:
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Taking the Drill as an example, it is considered as a weapon that hits continuously (every frame). But targets (enemies, blocks, etc.) have an invulnerability period after each hit of the Drill. When the Drill hits, the target has a variable that is initialized to the invulnerability time, 1 second for example. Then every subsequent frame, this variable is decremented by 1/fps. When it reaches zero, the invulnerability period ends. As a result, the effective invulnerability period for this target took 1 second 
	[b 
		"+ 1 frame
	]b
	"! This extra frame might seem small, but when invulnerability periods are short, it makes a significant difference. The actual invulnerability time (without the extra frame) of the Drill is 0.167 s, so the effective invulnerability period becomes 0.184 s at 60 fps and 0.168 at 1000 fps.

This formula did match with measures from the game, except at the discontinuity points where real measure could take either the low value, the high value or a value in between. This formula converges to 3 blocks per second, which should be the intended value. If we remove the extra frame from the effective invulnerability period, we obtain

	"For this TAS, I decided to take advantage of it. The default value of 60 fps gives a bad outcome (2.5 blocks per second in the above example). However, I didn't want to take very high value because it would significantly slow down the process of TASing. As a consequence, I decided to make this TAS at 120 fps. It is a common framerate value, it provides a good outcome (2.86 blocks per second in the above example) which is close to the maximum value while still being a low framerate. I realize that this is an arbitrary decision, but I find legitimate to save time by tweaking the framerate because from what I understand, we are getting closer to the intended game behavior by having high framerates. Also, I didn't have TASVideos rules or guidelines to provide some grounds at that time.
