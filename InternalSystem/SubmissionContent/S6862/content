	"Marking the category as "first day" implies that there is an in-game mechanic for separate days. There isn't. It's real time in the same way that Animal Crossing is, depending on the DS's clock for each day. A day in this game is literally 3 minutes or less of simple tasks, and then... I dunno, you can play with your dog for a bit if you're a kid and your grandma accidentally got you this instead of Nintendogs, but this is a TAS, not a child. That was one of the weirder things I've typed for a judgement that wasn't explicitly a joke.

	"The main issue here is content. Given that the game is infinite, the most suitable endpoint is when there is no new content. I tested four subsequent days in this game and found that all three of those days past the first have new daily tasks. To the best of my knowledge, the 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=DS's system time in DeSmuME can't be changed in the middle of a TAS|href=/Forum/Posts/424362)
	". It can be set prior to a run, so in theory you could set the system time to 11:58 PM, cross over into the next day, and allow for two immediate days of content, but the problem is that there is a third and fourth day of new content. Without the time being able to be changed midrun, this pretty much guarantees that an "acceptable" TAS is going to be 48 hours long at minimum, since you'd have to keep the game running until the day ticks over and then reset. Every new task past the fourth day is going to add another 24 hours onto the run.

	"This is bad enough by itself, but there's also an in-game shop. Buying all the items from the shop could be considered an objective end to the game. The problem is that each new day adds new items to the shop, and you only earn 10 coins a day. By the 4th day, you need at least 70 coins to be able to purchase everything in the shop, bringing the minimum time of the run up to 144 hours (accounting for the first two days being done back to back with a preset system time). There's definitely more shop items, too, but I feel my soul slowly dying the more time I spend investigating this game, and I can't find any information about this game online other than "don't play it".
