	"Something similar happens around 19:30. If you are using Loretta while entering the boss room, you have a window of a few frames to press buttons. As you can see, I switched to Stella and touch the screen where Mummy Man would appear. The magical line just stays there and kills Mummy Man before I would regain control normally.

	"This entire movie just seems to be made up of arbitrary decisions. The use of the data transfer glitch while also using Hard Lv. 1 means that the entire point of Hard Lv. 1 is ultimately moot. I wouldn't consider it to be the "hardest difficulty" when you're intentionally making the game easier for yourself through glitch exploitation.

	"The "speed/entertainment tradeoff" doesn't make sense either for several reasons. One: It doesn't actually add any entertainment that you wouldn't have been able to add without it, and two:

	"These choices make the run ultimately trivial to watch. Every choice you make seems to conflict with another choice, and it makes the run just... flat, boring, and void of any tension, and the (very vocal) posts I've seen so far in the thread very much agree with my assessment.
