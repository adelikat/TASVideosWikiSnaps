[div class=p 
	"The hardest aspect of making this run is the spread gun.  Normaly, it shoots a spread of 5 bullets out in different directions.  However there is a 10 bullet limit on the screen (per player).  By strategically angling the spread you can cause 1 bullet to leave the screen before the others.  If you fire at this moment, you get a single bullet.  If you repeat this process you get a single line of bullets firing at a particular direction.  This is especially exploited in the base levels.  This single line technique was used by Genisto.

]h4
[div class=p 
	"In the base levels, Genisto shoots enemies in order to achieve the single spread.  Once you have this single spread, you must continue to fire in order to maintain it.  This gives you seemingly little control over when bullets hit their targets.  However, with a lot of planning you can slowly alter the formation of the bullets.  You do this by firing 1 less than the number of "rows" you have.  (If you have a spread of 5 rows, shoot 4).  Then wait some frames to fire the final row.  This will pull one of the rows back.  Repeat the process for each row, and over the course of many spreads, you can change the position of each bullet.  By planning ahead at the beginning of each room, I was able to get each bullet to be 1 frame apart and hit the targets at the first possible opportunity.  This saved a good deal of time in each base level.

By moving left or right while jumping you can cause the player to jump a few pixels higher or LOWER by manipulating the vertical scroll.  This can be used to reach platforms normally unattainable.  Also, with this run I used it to lower all other jumps, resulting in 1-2 frames saved for each jump.

	"Bosses can only lose 1 hp per frame.  If you hit him point blank with a spread gun, it will do 5 damage over the course of 5 frames.  The trick then, is to do a steady amount of damage rather than blast him with two spread guns.  Bosses can be overloaded with incoming damage that some bullets will pass right through them (you will see this happen occasionaly in the run.  It can't always be avoided since you must shoot a certain amount of bullets with the spread gun).  The fastest possible boss fight would then be to begin damage on the first frame that its hp is loaded into memory, and do 1 damage until it is destroyed.  Most/all boss fights were done within a few frames of this theoretical fastest completion.
