	": What to say about this run? It's excellent for starters. Not only is it fast, it has great entertaining antics throughout. Nice attention to detail. Quic... er Turbo Man is killed the quickest. This is what TASing is all about. I'd say I'm accepting this run, but that language isn't strong enough.
