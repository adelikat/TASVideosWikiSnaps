	" provide a good enough reason to avoid the highest difficulty is absurd. Most, if not all, harder difficulty levels in gaming are so because of either stronger enemies or weaker attacks. It is true that we may allow a run to be played on a lower difficulty level under certain circumstances, but such a circumstance would be where the resulting boss battles are so long as to be severely detrimental to the entertainment value (for examples see 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=here|href=/2427S)
	" and 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=there|href=/2556S)
	" ). The effect upon entertainment is the most important point that has been missed here. The first boss, for example, has 25HP in normal mode and 35HP in hard mode and considering that the pterodactyl's fire breath does 5HP damage (as does a fully charged club hit for that matter) this can hardly be said to be a difference worthy of an exception. This game should be run on hard mode and for this reason I am rejecting this submission.

	"On a side note, this run was made using the Japanese ROM and the author's reason for doing so was rather ambiguous. From what I could gather the argument was that the Japanese ROM contained timing differences that were beneficial to the TASer. I would class this as within the 'gray area' as outlined in the movie rules. In other words, it is not a good reason to switch ROMs, and so the USA version of this game is preferred.
