	"Xanthiom is an Atari 2600 homebrew game developed by Mathan Games in 2023. The player controls Lieutenant Grisham, on a mission to rid the threats to the galaxy on the planet Planet Coati 5. This homebrew is very much a take on what the original NES Metroid would be like on the Atari 2600 with the limitations therein. I found this to be a pretty fun game and it's short enough that the lack of saving or continuing isn't that big of an issue.

	"The goal of this TAS is to collect every upgrade in the game before beating the game. The game's page on itch.io has full game maps for the two areas of the game, although one of the rooms with an upgrade is missing in the first map for whatever reason. I forgot about that one when working on this and had to add inputs to grab it. Thankfully this game seems entirely sync safe including boss behavior.

Missiles are normally only needed for exactly one door in the entire game so in a normal any% run they're kind of useless. However, the wave beam upgrade makes the beam sometimes miss an otherwise successful hit so missiles are incredibly useful on the second, more mobile boss.
