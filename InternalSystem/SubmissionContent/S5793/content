	"Digimon Battle Spirit is a fighting game for the Game Boy Advance,all fights are timed except for the final boss.You may also skip a fight by  beating Impmon,which is done in the run,.Since the run is mostly waiting,I play around until necessary.The timed fights are beaten by collecting more points than the opponent.

	"I pick Guilmon,over Agumon(the second possible choice),because i managed to do as much hits with Guilmon as Agumon with the aerial attack but also using the faster air fireball from Guilmon when the boss isn't close to optimize more of the final battle.I also lowered the time for the timed battles and put the difficulty setting in Hard Mode,which makes AI more agressive and gives more health to the final boss.The final boss is always in the air,so you can only pick characters with good air moves.I also collected the lowest ammount of points in case i had to minimize the score tally,but i couldn't notice significant difference.

	"Some of the bigger-headed characters can be combo-ed infinitely by Guilmon,the character I chose.Other characters have better infinite combos but they're not relevant at all,as the final boss is what decides how fast the run is and these combos won't work against him.

	"Guilmon and other air fireball characters have an incentive to throw the fireball really close to the ground,this stops momentum from the jump making the character go back to the ground and recover from the fireball as soon as it touches the ground,this is heavily abused.

	"Pressing the taunt button(L or R) cancels running,and taunts can be canceled into anything,so you can turn from a run instantly with the LR buttons.

	"Digivolutions are the coolest thing in the game,but they're skipped in the final battle because he dies extremely early.I tried to showcase the digivolutions from other characters and mine as well by doing dodges and manipulating movement.Agumon's digivolution is surprisingly bad despite looking cool,so i skipped it,even running stops the character to a halt after the first initial dash.

	"Beating Impmon skips the digimon he replaced,in this case,Sukamon.Sukamon is literally a poop digimon that throws poop,so not much of a loss, right?

	"There are other characters in the game but they're really finicky to hit the finall boss with their air moves.The only one who has a chance of competing with Guilmon is Agumon because his air attack is easier to hit,does the same number of hits but his air fireball is slower and recoils even more.

	"Objectives:
	$LF
	"Game's simple and i'm aiming for Vault.I checked the RTA records and they were not very optimized, i could beat their final battle consistently,a lot of times without the digivolution,probably because they don't go ham in the higher platforms and don't do air fireballs next to the ground. I'll post my RTA findings eventually too separately.

	" by Spikestuff in the submission thread, about 14 seconds overall could be saved by optimizing the judgment screen after 5 fights. This is a major flaw since there is little room for saving time in this game. Rejecting for suboptimality.

	"As a side note, the inputs look rushed, and the rerecord count also suggests this. It would just need a second pass in order to make it acceptable.
