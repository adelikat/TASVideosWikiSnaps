	"The first reason is that it is 
	[a href=/forum/p/452105#452105 
		"slower than the unassisted record
	]a
	". The movie rule about 
	[a href=/MovieRules#SpeedOrientedMovieMustBeatAllExistingRecords 
		"beating all existing records
	]a
	" explicitly says: 
	[em 
		""If your tool-assisted movie is slower than the non-tool-assisted world record for the same game, aiming for the same goals, your movie will be rejected."
	]em

[p 
	"Secondly, the rule about 
	[a href=/MovieRules#MovieMustBeComplete 
		"movies that should be complete
	]a
	" addresses this game's never-ending nature: 
	[em 
		""If a game never ends, then it may be considered complete once there is no new content introduced, and the difficulty no longer increases."
	]em
	" In this case, the run should end after the last unique level is shown, which is stage 35, Volcano Valley.

[p 
	"That said, the goal choice here, while looking odd for a layperson, is in fact perfectly fine for a speedrun of this game, mostly because it is supposed to max out your stats in order to speed you up eventually, so you could reach (and beat) level 35 sooner. This run just happens to be doing all this sub-optimally.
