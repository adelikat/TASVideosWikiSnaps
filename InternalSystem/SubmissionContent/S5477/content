	"That said, the goal choice here, while looking odd for a layperson, is in fact perfectly fine for a speedrun of this game, mostly because it is supposed to max out your stats in order to speed you up eventually, so you could reach (and beat) level 35 sooner. This run just happens to be doing all this sub-optimally.
