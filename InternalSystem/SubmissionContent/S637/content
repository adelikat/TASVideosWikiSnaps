	"In this game Link's must save Princes Zelda and the rest of Hyrule from Ganon once again. In his quest he collects many items such as, bow and arrows, hookshot, master sword, etc. He solves puzzles and defeats foes throughout 13 dungeons before meeting Ganon for the final time. Link does all this in 80 minutes!

	"Making this moving was very interesting but very time consuming as well. This may have been too long of a game to tackle for a first time attack, but I am happy with the result. There are a couple of techniques used in this run that are not viable on the console. Levitation glitch (pressing dash every other frame to prevent falling in pits) is used frequently but usually isn't a major factor in route, most of the time you could bomb jump over stuff or go around. The other is up+down, this mainly to wobble which makes Link walk 2 pixels each frame when moving left and up, as opposed to 1,2 every other (33% faster walking up/left). Besides just these there are lots of little tricks and glitches that add up to lots of time saved. If you haven't played this game you probably will think many of the glitches used are normal though.
