	" Poka-Poka Island
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This is the first level I had to visit. I enabled the Light Switch for later backtracking, when I get the Ice Sword. Then I headed to the chest with the Silver Sword, it is needed to bypass the rock and it also saves time fighting the boss. After I beat the boss, I got the the Light Stone and I headed upwards to the next stage.

	" Hiya-Hiya Island
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Before entering Hiya-Hiya Island, I got to fight an enemy who holds the Sun Stone. I bought the Shove technique from a lonely guy, which it I can move large blocks. And then I got the Ice Bell, which is needed to enter Hiya-Hiya Island. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Beeing in Hiya-Hiya Island, I first got the Fire Sword. I manipulated the rabbit to damage boost off it. Then I first had to deactivate the Star Switch, then I was able to move this huge ice block, which makes the path to the boss open.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Boa-Boa Island
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"And again I had to do some stuff before I entered Boa-Boa Island. I got the magic wand and the Sun Ring.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In Boa-Boa Island I first run to the Sun Switch, which opens the paths to some swithes. It also opens the path to the Ice Sword in Poka-Poka Island, therefore I first got the Ice Sword, which saves time when fighting the boss. Back to Boa-Boa Island, I needed to open the way down to the boss, which means I had to activated all of the switches. I also got my second magic bottle here with a little trick to skip the down stab technique. Then I fought the boss and got the Aqua Stone and continued.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Puka-Puka Island
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"I first went to the north to get the Power Fan and the Shovel. Before entering the actual level of Puka-Puka Island, I made a short stop at the casino, where I got 60000 coins playing a minigame. The minigame was done by a bot. Then I bought the Light Sword, which is the strongest weapon in this game.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Anyway I finally entered Puka-Puka Island, which is actually very confusing if you don't know where to go. The first thing I did was lowering the water with activating a switch. This opened the way to the Aqua Switch, which opens the way to the boss room. I also got my third magic bottle on this island.

[h4 
	" Sala-Sala Island
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"There's nothing to do before entering this stage, so I headed right into it. I needed to activate the Moon Switch to be able to go deeper into this island. The boss gave me the Elven Flute, which is used to get the spells from the islands. And there's nothing more to say.

[p 
	"So before I was able to enter Fuwa-Fuwa Island, I needed to collect all the spells from the island. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The first spell I headed was the one from Puka-Puka Island. I went to it with a shortcut from Sala-Sala Island, which is still faster, than going to Puka-Puka Island on the overworld. Important note, it is not possible to reach the platform in Sala-Sala Island using the chain which hangs on the ceiling, therefore I had to use the block. I also got my last magic bottle in Puka-Puka Island. Then I got the Aqua Spell and died to get to the beginning of the island.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"And then I warped back to Sala-Sala Island and got the Moon Spell.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The next destination was Hiya-Hiya Island. I also got here with a shortcut from Sala-Sala Island. And I abused the rabbit to die, oh it's just a harmless little bunny, isn't it. With having the Star Spell I went to the next stage.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Which is Boa-Boa Island. And again I got the spell and did some death abuse.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The last spell is at Poka-Poka Island. I needed to fill at least one magic bottle to warp to the beginning of the island. So I have all five spells and finally the path to Fuwa-Fuwa Island is open.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Fuwa-Fuwa Island is the last stage in this game. There's nothing special to do in this level, expect getting the Power Sword, which is only used once to get rid of the block at the top of the island. Then I fought the boss, but it wasn't the only boss. After a cutscene, I warped back to Fuwa-Fuwa Island and fought the very last boss and finished the game.
