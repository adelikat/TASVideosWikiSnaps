Since I had no problem with longer goals (because I am TASing), I chose instead to TAS all those 64 variations, getting all upgrades along the way. There is nothing else about this game, so this can be considered full completion.

I do believe you have made the right choice though, as this is another submission with amazing results! Congratulations!
