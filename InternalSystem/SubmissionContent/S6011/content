	"The 5 frame improvement here needs a little explanation. The original run intentionally paused here which has the effect of manipulating the Rockies in 9-4. This makes the levels irritatingly not independent. Fortunately I was able to find an equally fast manipulation in 9-4 to save the stop in 9-2.

	"I'm glad I was able to find some additional improvements here. It is interesting to me how different people see things differently when looking at these puzzles. The improvement in 8-1 for example is something I would consider pretty obvious, but for many of the other levels it was only through repeated trial and error that I realized how clever and optimal some of hanzou/Nitrodon's original solutions already were. Also I don't like leaving things half finished, so I'm glad all the improvements are now in one place.
