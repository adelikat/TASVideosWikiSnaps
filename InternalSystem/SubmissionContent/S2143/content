	"With not many Nintendo 64 game having published runs, I thought t would be interesting to try out this game. Chameleon twist has a total of 6 levels, which only 4 are needed to be played through in order to reach the end.

	"The only two really key things in this stage were the two rooms with the spinning walls and the boss fight. The rooms with the spinning walls were strange and they would stop depending of frame numbers and input. The boss was a lot easier to manipulate into positions as to where she could easily be defeated.

	"This stage was interesting. In several areas I had to grab the pole in a weird, curved way to avoid eating the enemies, which would loose time. Also, I took damage on the spikes on purpose to show that you could just walk between them if you took damage. This was faster than using the Chameleon's tongue to make the spikes go down but was slower than walking along the end of the spikes, which I show later. Regardless, this didn't loose any time since I had to wait for a few moving platforms anyway. Also, when I got to the sand that you couldn't walk in, but had pole to swing on, I found that if you angle them right, they let you keep a good amount of speed in a certain direction for a bit. This helped a lot on the second one of these because there were no good places I could really swing from.
