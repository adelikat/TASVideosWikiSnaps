	"Disney's Extreme Skate Adventure is a skateboarding game released in 2003, using the same engine as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4. The game allows you to skate as characters from Toy Story, Tarzan, and The Lion King. The gameplay is similar to that of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, but containing simplified controls and limited tricks. There are three main modes of the game, Adventure Mode, Free Skate, and Versus. Unlike regular Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games, there is no actual story mode to complete. Instead, there are goals scattered across every level.

	"For each Disney universe, there are three levels to play, with a hub world being available for the Human skaters, allowing them to traverse between worlds. The main goal of any% runs of the game are to unlock every level, and unlock every playable skater. Each level can be unlocked by completing 4 goals (so 4 goals unlocks one level, and another 4 unlocks the other). Unlocking skaters requires specific goals to be completed, with some of these goals requiring a specific character.

	": This is a bit of an unusual case for an any% run. Since the game has no ending, we can't force a TAS of it to reach one. Instead, the RTA community for this game decided that any% means unlocking all characters and levels. This does make sense, as it provides clear goals for game completion (where otherwise there would be none).
