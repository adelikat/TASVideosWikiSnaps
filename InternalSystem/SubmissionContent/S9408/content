In the beginning, photons can only be 4 colors (gray, red, green and blue), but starting in level 13, you can combine these colors, leading to 4 more colors (yellow, magenta, cyan and white). Also, I know these photons don't adhere to actual real-life physics, but I think making a game where photons adhere to real-life physics is actually impossible.

														" Oh boy, it's time to talk about this stage. For starters, I'm gonna talk about how walls work. Firstly, walls usually have outlines, which makes the collision for photons more robust. However, for some inconceivable reason, this is the only stage where some of those outlines are missing, which breaks this stage. Not only do photons not lose their collision counter, but, most importantly, it allows the photons to clip through the walls, which saves a decent amount of time. If you're wondering, my route was just killing the zombies based on how long they took to be killed (slowest to fastest). There's something else that I have to say, which is that this stage has an extra glitch that I couldn't  recreate in this TAS. Essentially, instead of clipping the photons through the wall, I would clip them through the floor, which could've saved a minute amount of time. I was able to replicate this on Adobe Flash Player, but I couldn't do it on Ruffle (I had like 500 rerecords for a 10 frame long scene, so I think I tried hard enough.
