I knew about the Plokontinue glitch and while aspects of the published run by partyboy1a were impressive, various segments looked kinda awkward to me, similar to Ninja Five-O. We ended up ironing out pretty much all of these segments.

	"Sliding: builds up speed over time, how much speed you get per frame is related to the steepness of the slope. Speed is best maintained by either holding down and jumping or by doing a legless hop, the latter of which it isn’t necessary to hold down. Due to the fact that the latter is higher, it is sometimes better to intentionally lose legs. However, if you need to walk along the ground or need to perform a somersault shortly after, you need to keep legs. Somersaulting quickly kills your speed, and holding down will not impact that rate.

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"So the queen works on a set of frame rules where after the last flea is killed, she will drop at the end of the framerule. In order to pull off the trick, you need to hit her very early into a framerule otherwise she will rise to the top before you get a chance to hit her a second time. As such sometimes delaying killing a flea was necessary in order to reach the start of a new framerule. This saved 44 seconds over our previous fight and was deemed worth resubmitting for.
