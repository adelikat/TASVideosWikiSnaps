	"I have been a Jaws speedrunner for almost two years, and have been TASing the game since then. The goal of TASing has always been to quickly experiment with different RNG manipulations for the purposes of finding better routes for humans to run. It was never about making an optimal TAS. But this morning I decided to try to see what was possible when I stopped worrying about people being able to run the route.

When you die, you don't "complete" the encounter that you were in. That way the next encounter you get into will still be the same encounter. This will allow us to get 13 shells (enough for lvl 3) without having to go through the lengthy bonus scene.

	": Well, this is a lovely thing to see on the workbench, isn't it? It's the perfect example of my absolute favorite thing to judge: Someone new to the community (welcome, by the way!) coming in with a hot new TAS of a game with a long, long history on the site. I've seen it happen for games like 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Kid Icarus|href=/4291M)
	" and 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Ghosts with a generous helping of Goblins|href=/4469M)
	" and I hope to keep seeing it in the years to come. The incredible thing here is shaving off 30 entire seconds of a game that's already well below 5 minutes to begin with, optimizing this game further and further and further with new routing and strategies over several years of work and several different TASers and RTA runners putting in the effort to understand it. This is what I love about TASing, about speedrunning as a whole: Jaws isn't exactly the most popular game out there, it's no Super Mario, or Super Mario, or even Super Mario. Heck, it isn't even Super Mario. Despite that, though, it's been disassembled, dissected, and analyzed in the exact same way. It's almost like art to me, strange yet ethereally beautiful. Put that quote on the box for the repro cart.
