	"This game is a standard type of RPG with a real-time battle system.
	$LF
	"During the battle, we can control a player character by arrow keys, shoot bullets by pushing the button, and if the character comes closer to enemies, we can do near-term attacks by weapons. Enemies are also moving in real-time.
	$LF
	"In a normal play, hit rate for both shootings and near-term attacks is very low, so players need to shoot so many bullets to beat enemies, and to receive damages so much when the near-term attacks don't hit.
	$LF
	"At the beginning, the ranged attack is very effective as enemies are weak, however, after they become stronger, bullets attack will not be effective as the damage is very low, and we need to leverage near-term attacks, and, at the last stage, even near-term attacks by the player will not be effective as enemies will have very high defense, so it is important to leverage companions' attacks, by adjusting variables to improve hit rate and damages.

		$LF

	"By adjusting a variable, this TAS got 3 of them, and earned 45,000 Gold, to buy maximum amount of the 1st/2nd/3rd bullets.

	"At middle, in order to save the time, skipped some companions. I didn't have Gino / Teruna who should join the party in normal plays. The strongest bullet is very effective at this stage, however, it is very expensive. In the castle of Raban, the player can get 8,000 Golds from a treasure box at B1F repeatedly as when the player leaves that floor and comes back, the treasure box is shown again. By this, the player got 300,000 Golds to buy the strongest bullet, smoke bomb (15000 Golds / 5 shots, 300000 Golds / 100 shots)

	"At the end, especially for bosses, as I mentioned above the player's attack will not be effective, we can put only very small damages, so we need to guide 2 companions in front of enemies, and maximize their damage. They player's attack can't make any damages but it will be helpful to change variables, so I shot the weakest bullet in the best frames (with frame by frame trial) to find out which case can make maximum damage for enemies with minimum ones for the player and the companions.

So if we can combine all of these 'using medicines' actions with others which need to open the window e.g. equip the weapon, it can save more time. Probably around 150-200 frames.

So I don't need to get these treasures. It will impact around 120 frames.

	": I'm afraid that this movie has a major issue: it makes use of an in-game cheat. Using cheats is usually not allowed, unless it's necessary for unlocking secret characters, harder difficulty modes, or additional game modes/level sets. And even in that case, it needs to feature differing contents from a run that makes no use of any cheat available. For what concerns this submission, it was used a cheat that allows for faster player movement and avoiding random enemy encounters, which is unacceptable in any case, as it merely makes the game easier, without introducing any additional content or otherwise making the play more interesting. For this reason alone, this submission is rejected.
