	"The four color theorem is kind of like a game. You have an area divided into discrete regions--say, a map of the world, or a picture of a dinosaur--and you have to color all the regions in. There's only one rule: 
	[del 
		"never, ever let it cool
	]del
	" two adjacent regions cannot be the same color. You could trivially color any dinosaur by this rule if you picked a different color for every single region, but that's no fun! Therefore, the goal of this game is to get a low score: what's the fewest number of colors you can use? The four-color theorem states that, for any given dinosaur, you will never need more than four colors.
