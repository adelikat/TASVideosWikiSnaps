For shame.  I also found some cool sunshaded flowers.  They looked sick, so I helped them enjoy the sunshine.  They didn't seem happy about that.  :(  After that, I decided to go over the river to grandmother's house.  I cooked up some fish along the way for her to eat, but much to my surprise, the BIG BAD WOLF was there!  He tried to eat me for breakfast.  SCARRRRRY WOLF!
