	"Sonic the Hedgehog CD (commonly called Sonic CD) was a game released in 1993 for the Mega CD/Sega CD addon for the Sega Genesis. This game is infamous for its unforgiving level design, however it is also known for its amazing music. There are two versions of the OST: one was used for the Japanese and European releases of the game, but for the American release they changed most of the soundtrack (the Past songs remain unchanged) to be "more rich and complex."

	"Sonic CD may be infamous for having some poor level design choices, however it also introduced several new characters and mechanics:
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		" Sonic CD introduced two new characters: a clingy pink hedgehog named Amy Rose, and the robotic antagonist known as Metal Sonic.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Sonic CD removed the ground speed cap (however the speed cap in the air still exists) and also introduced a new ability for Sonic called the Super Peel-out. It also added the Spindash, although it does not work the same way we are used to. They are both very slow to charge, and since the peelout is actually faster to charge than the spindash, the peelout is used more often in the run.

[div class=p 
	"The Moving Peelout (abbreviated to MPO) is a glitch where Sonic is able to move while charging a peelout. This can be accomplished by charging a peelout and pressing up, down, and a horizontal direction on the same frame. There is also an RTA-friendly method which can be done by pausing during a charge, letting go of up, holding down and forward and unpausing, pausing again and switching to up, and unpausing yet again. This causes Sonic to slide along the ground at the speed of the charged peelout. If that sounds confusing, then think of it as this: The longer you charge the peelout before you start an MPO, the faster you will slide on the ground. Not only does the MPO allow you to get a headstart when charging a peelout, it also allows you to go right through walls! When you are charging a peelout, the game is not checking for collision since you're not supposed to move when you're charging a peelout, but by performing an MPO you can perform a zip pretty much anywhere you want! This is happily abused throughout the run in various ways, whether it's to skip an entire level or just to save a couple of seconds.

	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"Zips occur when your character gets stuck inside of a wall and you press any horizontal direction. Depending on which direction you press, you will be sent the opposite direction. For example, you get in a wall and you want to go right. You don't want to press right to try to go right, because you will get sent left instead and end up escaping the wall. So if you press left, you'll go right and you'll get to your destination. When performing a zip going left, if you hit the left boundary of the level, you can perform what is called a "horizontal underflow," or a level wrap. Wrapping in certain levels can save time, but in some levels it's either a loss of time or doesn't allow you to finish the level, whether by being too high to reach the goal post or by just killing you.

However, the risk for crashing the game is VERY high when doing this fast zip, so unless you know what you're doing and have a consistent setup, I would not recommend this.

	" where instead of going below the moving blocks to continue the level, you instead jump on top of the leftmost block while it's coming out of the wall, and perform an MPO into the wall to fall down to another part of the wall. You have to wait for the water level to go down otherwise the trick won't work. You also have to tinker with subpixels here as well, since you have to get a full zip (not a half zip), AND you have to clip through TWO WALLS. Once you get through and wrap, this trick saves 10"88 IGT seconds! The reason we have to do the wrap in this specific way is if we just fall down to the part of the leftmost wall where we can zip, we end up being stuck in the ceiling above the signpost, and we're too high to be able to activate it, softlocking us.

In CC1, we need good subpixels to get the fast zip, AND also get the jump that marzojr used in his previous run to reach the zipping point faster than normal. And in TT2, you can zip and clip into the leftmost wall, but you cannot wrap through it due to the water level being too high. If you can get enough speed and good subpixels to clip through both walls without waiting for the water level, you can easily save a few seconds.
