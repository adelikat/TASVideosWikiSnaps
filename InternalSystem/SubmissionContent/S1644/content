	"This is a demonstration run of Baseball Simulator 1.000. This is not a normal baseball game. This game plays in the "Ultra" league, which allows special techniques. For example, a hit that blows up when a defender tries to catch it. This run simply shows each special hit, a strikeout with all-special pitches and 2 special defensive moves.

	"This run was recorded a while ago, while I was trying to learn the idiosyncrasies of controlling 2 players in FCEU. It is, however, quite precise (I hate to have even test-runs unoptimized), so I recently decided it was submission-worthy, so this is the result.
