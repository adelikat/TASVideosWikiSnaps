	"If it is discovered how to manipulate bowser into the same position that Phil had on his movie then you could retain the afforementioned 21 frames and save a total of 210 frames.  Because I could not manipulate him and I couldn't save those frames, I went ahead and tricked the game into leaving the axe sitting there.  This same problem arose on 8-4 with the first bowser, but because I didn't need to kill him I just ducked under him and lost 2 pixels.  However, this did not affect the final frame count.
