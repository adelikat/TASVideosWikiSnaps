	"However, I lost 21 frames on 4-4 because of the spawning position of Bowser and to the best of all my abilities I could not manipulate him by any means that i had thought of.

	"If it is discovered how to manipulate bowser into the same position that Phil had on his movie then you could retain the afforementioned 21 frames and save a total of 210 frames.  Because I could not manipulate him and I couldn't save those frames, I went ahead and tricked the game into leaving the axe sitting there.  This same problem arose on 8-4 with the first bowser, but because I didn't need to kill him I just ducked under him and lost 2 pixels.  However, this did not affect the final frame count.
