	"As the description says, DKC2 Unveiled is a romhack of DKC2 made by emptysys which completely changes every level in the game with the general exception of one aspect, most commonly the tileset or theme, but the game's engine and physics is unchanged, so expertise on such from vanilla DKC2 can and was applied here. This romhack is widely considered to be the best romhack of any DKC game, and is the only one with submitted runs on speedrun.com. This, along with the facts that it was so recently released and that I've been a big fan of both watching and making TASes was my motivation for creating this TAS.

Those who have ran either this or the original game might see the potential to roll off the ledge, turn back immediately once leaving the ground, then hit the goal from underneath (this is known as crotch goal), but unfortunately the goal is just barely too far from the ledge to be implemented here.

The catch here, though, is that only Diddy can jump enough to reach the platform above like this. The RTA strat here is doing a big boi as Dixie, using a kremling to the right of the red bee at the start to get enough height to reach the above platform, but that loses quite a bit more time than the previous level's goal swap and the swap in the middle of this level. Team up jumping is also used in the main part of the level when possible since one keeps more vertical speed than simply teaming up then jumping.
