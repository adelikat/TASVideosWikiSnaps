	"The first bit of luck manipulation was to force the game to pick the shortest family name for my opponent. "Hall" is the shortest name, which means less time was used during the name-typing process.

	"The fact that they appear as the most dumbfounded and shocked family when you beat them is an unintentional and hilarious side-effect.

	"Each round, luck was manipulated to ensure there were as many answers as possible, to abuse word recognition as often as possible.
	$LF
	"Round 1 has twelve answers, round 2 and 3 each have six.

	"While answers were carefully chosen to be as ridiculous and elaborate as possible and still count as correct, all other factors were chosen with speed in mind. The bullseye round is skipped and all answers are typed as fast as possible.
