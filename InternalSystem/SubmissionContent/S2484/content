	"Pizza pop! is a rather unknown japanese platformer about a pizza delivery boy who has to deliver pizza to different customers. The game is very simple, but it's short and has pretty nice music and graphics.

	"The reason I aim for highest score on the bonus games is because if I were to aim for fastest time no matter what, I have to miss every pizza to avoid the score count down at the end of the bonus level. I think this would make the run look less entertaining, so I chose to play these bonus levels, and get the highest score possible.

	"The rerecord count is slightly wrong because I did some editing with TAS movie editor. It should be around 7000, I think. The game is easy to TAS, and lua scripting and memory watching made things even easier for me.

		"The reason why I deplete my health before the end of a level (except for level 1: it's slower to do that on this level) is because each heart gives you an additional 500 score at the end of the level, and 500 score takes 30 frames to count down at the end of the level. I deplete my health on bosses, because here it usually doesn't waste any time.

		"When I pick up the key in the ghost level, there is an invisible platform below it that I jump on. It doesn't save any time, but I think it looks nice.

		"Bumping into the wall, like I do on the last level, doesn't set your speed to 0 like in most games. So as as soon as you start moving again after having pushed against the wall, you will move at top speed.
