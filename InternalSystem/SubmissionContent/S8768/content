Different ROM versions have loading time differences, so if you want to make an encode on different version you can adjust "G" by inserting or removing blank frames. The original Spanish version is called La Pulga.

	": Interesting...most of the movie is loading and trying to get past the title screen. Obviously, I tested to see if any inputs would get past some of the slow start up stuff...and nothing. As for the game play, I think it speaks volumes that 757 re-records were made to get this right, over the 10 seconds that this run last. I can't see a way to make this better, since it already looks amazing.
