	"I stay well above the screen for a while during some segments so that I can skip the rats that you otherwise have to kill (i.e. I pass their spawn points before they spawn). Killing enemies in this game typically wastes ~1 frame (yes, it even freezes the scrolling of the level). Obviously, the end-of-level flag won't spawn until the screen gets close to it, so I have to wait for it to appear.

		"Kaos Karnage
	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The new strategy here is EXTREMELY hard to pull off, as the game doesn't really want you to stay up there. The Kongs will either bounce far to the left, or far to the right, never straight up (unless you're pretty much inside the head, which I do utilize once to bounce sort of straight up). So although the first few hits could be closer together, it's necessary to space them out due to Kaos' movements and the Kong's bouncing. Also, the first (and only) time his blades come out, they don't appear on the correct side (like they do in Sami's run). I tried switching sides (and also confusing Kaos), but in my run he only lets them out on the side opposite me. Even entering the level at different times didn't help, so I don't know what the deal is. I just went with it.

	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Questionable team switch at the beginning? Well, having Kiddie in the lead is necessary to utilize both barrel skipping tricks in this level, which save a considerable amount of time. This means that I initially lose ~60 frames in this level. Sami was forced to hit a DK barrel (~60 frames) in Fireball Frenzy in his run, which I am able to skip because of the route change. So in the long run, the frames wasted by the team switch are evened out, and I still manage to save something like 25 frames AFTER the team switch (making the net loss -37)

		"Tracker Barrel
	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Here's where things get tricky with the whole route change thing: Sami entered K3 with Dixie in the lead, which is necessary to do Krevice Kreepers as fast as possible. In order for me to do that, I would have to switch to Dixie at some point before entering K3. The fastest way to do that was in this level. Grabbing the DK barrel and busting it open on the Krumple takes up a lot of time, but the barrel skip trick (where I get hit at frame 69807) saves a ton of time too. It's still 13 frames slower to beat the level this way, but 13 frames to switch Kongs isn't too bad, considering the amount of time it takes to do it normally.

[p 
	"This level is stupid. Even if you are in the air over a slope, the game will slow you down as if you are actually on the slope. Sort of hard to optimize, considering it barely lets you. Jumping over the downward slopes is faster than riding down them, because I guess this is Elmer's glue, not snow.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I thought this level would be tough, but it wasn't too bad. Squitter has a frame rule of sorts on his web platforms. You must wait a certain amount of frames before you are able to make a new one (I think it's something like 45 or 50 frames). Oddly, the game made a VERY large exception during frames ~97800 - ~98000. The frame rule just didn't exist for this segment, and let me madly shoot web platforms any time I wanted without reserve or a sense of decency. I don't know why this was possible, and it would be nice if I could break this frame rule at will.

[p 
	"This level was a huge challenge to optimize, but in the end, fun. A lot of the odd movements are mostly manipulation of the Kopters. I have to get close enough to make them spawn, but stay far away enough so that I can zip past them as fast as possible when my opportunity arrives. There's a lot of opportunities to plow through enemies in this level, saving time. I tested all of these opportunities and chose the fastest ones (even though that means I have to wait a few times for the stupid Kopters).

After I beat Floodlit Fish, I press B to enter the level again. However, since I'm moving still, the Kongs climb up onto the road towards Pothole Panic, and by the time the screen is done fading, I'm close enough to Pothole where the game thinks that it's where I wanted to be.
