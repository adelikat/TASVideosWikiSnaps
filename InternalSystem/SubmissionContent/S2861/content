	"Lost age is the sequel to the first Golden sun. It's a pretty typical RPG which takes inspiration from mythical things like Atlantis, alchemy and magic. It's got some pretty good music too.

	"I made this ridiculously long TAS a couple of years ago. I didn't use the "Retreat glitch" which allows you to pretty much skip all dungeons. It would probably save a couple of HOURS of time since the dungeons are so long. The ingame time of this run is 6:01.

	"The vbm movie file has some desync issues. It worked nice when I had made the TAS, but later when I accidentally screwed up my computer and had to format my harddrive, the TAS was lost, and when I recovered it, I guess it got messed up somehow. But at least one user (badpotato) got it to work, and he made a mkv of it which you can download on the topic: http://tasvideos.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8159&start=60
