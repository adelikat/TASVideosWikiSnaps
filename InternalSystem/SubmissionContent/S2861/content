	"The vbm movie file has some desync issues. It worked nice when I had made the TAS, but later when I accidentally screwed up my computer and had to format my harddrive, the TAS was lost, and when I recovered it, I guess it got messed up somehow. But at least one user (badpotato) got it to work, and he made a mkv of it which you can download on the topic: http://tasvideos.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8159&start=60
