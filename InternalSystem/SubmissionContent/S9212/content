	"Mega Man III, known as Rockman World 3 (ロックマンワールド３) in Japan, is the third Mega Man game for Game Boy, released in December 1992. The game continues the quest of the protagonist, Mega Man, in a never-ending struggle with his long-time nemesis, Dr. Wily. As with previous Game Boy releases, the game incorporates gameplay elements and bosses from two sequential Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) games: Mega Man 3 and Mega Man 4.
