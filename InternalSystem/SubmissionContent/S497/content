	"I submit this run as a prime example of a game that's not fit to power play.  This game, being more of a programmer's exercise in tedium than actual entertainment, is by it's very nature unfit for power playing.  In spite of it's war zone setting, it's very dull.  There is no music outside the initial drum roll: 90% of the time all you'll be listening to is your little soldier's footsteps, beeping across the battle field.

	"No, your eyes are not decieving you: this run only uses 42 reloads.  It wasn't hard to make at all: some frame advance stuff at the very beginning and end, some very easy luck manipulation, and you're ready to go.  This literally took me no more than five minutes to make, ten if you include the time it took me to find the ROM.  Heck, outside the frame advancing, I played at 100% speed!  As such, someone playing on a console could easily pull this run off by no slower than half a second if they are lucky enough.
