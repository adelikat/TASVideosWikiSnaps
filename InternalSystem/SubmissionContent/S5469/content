	": This submission is a slower and worse version of the 
	[a href=/2677S 
		"NES Chessmaster submission
	]a
	". There is nothing interesting about a chess TAS that shows superhuman skills in video games. The least one can do is fully analyze the AI of the game and find loopholes (maybe on the hardest difficulty). Problem with that is the fact that the computer takes a lot of time to calculate a move. Because of this, a chess replay (and especially this submission) can't get into Moons. Check.
