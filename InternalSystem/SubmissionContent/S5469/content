	": This submission is a slower and worse version of the 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=NES Chessmaster submission|href=/2677S)
	". There is nothing interesting about a chess TAS that shows superhuman skills in video games. The least one can do is fully analyze the AI of the game and find loopholes (maybe on the hardest difficulty). Problem with that is the fact that the computer takes a lot of time to calculate a move. Because of this, a chess replay (and especially this submission) can't get into Moons. Check.

	": So while triviality rule has been removed this submission has some other issues.  First is that there is already a post in the discussion detailing Scholar's Mate which is much faster than this along with other game options that could make things faster as noted in the previous judge notes.  Secondly the goal is very obscure and does not fit into any category.  The first point against this is the most important however and shows a lack of optimization.  Changing rejection reason to Optimization.
