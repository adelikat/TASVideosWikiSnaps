	"This vid is also known as "Let's affect the randomness!" thanks to the 
	$LF
	"random effects of many game events. Notably doorways putting you at a random 
	$LF
	"spot on the map, falling down a level putting you at a random spot on the 
	$LF
	"map below (I use un-falls to get back up), the obvious random presents with 
	$LF
	"question marks on them, and the Randomizer, which changes all of your 
	$LF
	"presents.

	"You know what this game needs? A boss. Something for me to fling tomatoes at 
	$LF
	"and actually need to do it for a speed run. That'd be more interesting than 
	$LF
	"just opening a door and, woo, there's the elevator twenty times. I did want 
	$LF
	"to show off a few different presents, too, like the Boombox, the tomato 
	$LF
	"rain, and the Icarus Wings.

[p 
	"Level transitions take 23 seconds, by my count. Since there's 24 of them, 
	$LF
	"that's over nine minutes worth of the vid listening to that awful elevator 
	$LF
	"music. (almost half the vid!) I wish I could to a good 2-player run, as 
	$LF
	"there'd be humorous commentary while in the elevator.

	"There's a vague RPG element, in that you gain levels and your hp goes up as 
	$LF
	"you do so (every 3 levels you get an extra life). Unlike most RPG's, though, 
	$LF
	"you don't get exp for killing stuff. You gain points by uncovering more of 
	$LF
	"the map and opening presents. Since the entire point of a speedrun is to 
	$LF
	"know exactly where you're going and what you're doing (and since I bypass 
	$LF
	"large sections of the map with teleports) I don't gain many levels.

	"I play the "fixed" world, for two reasons. First, it's easier to compete on. 
	$LF
	"Second, a "random" world is really just one of a half-dozen different fixed 
	$LF
	"worlds selected at random, instead of a generated world. I play as Toejam, 
	$LF
	"for the obvious reason that he's a tiny bit faster than Earl (who has more 
	$LF
	"hp).

[p 
	"Level by level analysis:
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"First, the good stuff: All my teleports are at most a screen away from my 
	$LF
	"destination. Except for part of one level (18) I use either hi-tops or 
	$LF
	"something faster (rocket skates, doorways) and I know exactly where I'm 
	$LF
	"going. For random presents I always get what I want. My personal favorite 
	$LF
	"levels are levels 3 (jumping sequence, killing an innocent bystander) and 19 
	$LF
	"(Rocket skates).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Bad stuff, and there's quite a bit of it:
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"All levels: After I teleport (or a few other random instances), in almost 
	$LF
	"all cases I waste a little time reacting to it. All time wasted *before* 
	$LF
	"setting off random things (doorways in particular) are intentional, to 
	$LF
	"affect what I get. Menus tend to be slow, and I tend to sneak for a few 
	$LF
	"frames after losing a set of hi-tops. Pathwise, I discovered unfalls are not 
	$LF
	"as useful as I thought they would be, considering you have to spend quite a 
	$LF
	"few seconds bouncing on the ground. Also, I should have used the randomizer 
	$LF
	"earlier (level 18, maybe?) and spent more time for better results.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Level 1: I pick up some Tomatoes (the present on the right) though I don't 
	$LF
	"absolutely need them. They get fed to the randomizer later, though, and it 
	$LF
	"doesn't waste very many frames.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Level 2: I don't need the Icarus Wings, either, and set off the hidden path 
	$LF
	"getting them. Stopping to buy the un-fall could be a bit faster, too, as I 
	$LF
	"spend a couple frames running into it. The small box is the randomizer, 
	$LF
	"which doesn't get used until the second-to-last level.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Level 3: I go out of my way to pick up a set of hi-tops. Killing the hamster 
	$LF
	"(only death in the vid) was a complete accident but doesn't waste any time. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"A good level, I think.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Level 4: Setting up the first doorway goes a little slower than it should. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Same for getting into the elevator.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Level 5: Awful use of the rocket skates. I should at least go out of my way 
	$LF
	"to pick up something so it doesn't look like I'm wasting my time. Shouldn't 
	$LF
	"have set off the hidden path, either. Bad level.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Level 6: Menus could be faster here especially.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Level 7: The second jump into the abyss was actually an accident (It ideally 
	$LF
	"should be one jump) until I realized it put me right next to the ship piece, 
	$LF
	"so I left it in. I jump when I don't need to (right before the elevator), 
	$LF
	"wasting a few frames.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Level 8: Maybe could have handled the elevator a little better, rather than 
	$LF
	"going so far below it and coming back up. I'm not sure if horizontal 
	$LF
	"movement changes when going diagonally
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Level 9: Short and sweet. Running could be a bit smoother.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Level 10: Erratic running keeps me on the grass. A simply awful approach to 
	$LF
	"the elevator.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Level 11: Stupid moles. Also, should have put on the hi-tops on this level 
	$LF
	"instead of later.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Level 12: Could have started moving diagonally a little earlier. The brown 
	$LF
	"box is a school book, to be fed to the randomizer, though I don't need it, 
	$LF
	"really.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Level 13: I was worried I was going to waste some time getting the extra 
	$LF
	"life hitting Poindexter (normally you stop and do a little pose), but I was 
	$LF
	"glad I was in the elevator when it happened. I kinda like escaping into the 
	$LF
	"elevator to avoid the mob of chickens, though.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Level 14: The "walk around in a circle" thing is the sort of thing I'm 
	$LF
	"talking about when I say I have to screw with the randomness. Later (like, 
	$LF
	"near last levels later) I do it more efficiently.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Level 15: A random present is effectively a "get what you want" in 
	$LF
	"speedruns.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Level 16: The worst part of the run: I take a hit from a boogieman when I 
	$LF
	"unfall.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Level 17: I think I managed this teleport on the first or second try. Maybe 
	$LF
	"that was later. I pick up an unfall for later, but for some strange reason 
	$LF
	"walk to the elevator.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Level 18: Should have used hitops between losing them and getting the 
	$LF
	"skates. The last pair I use doesn't see much use. Rocket skates see decent 
	$LF
	"use. Oh, and if I exited the elevator immediately the bees would pin me 
	$LF
	"against the elevator and kill me. I kinda like the way I avoid the 
	$LF
	"boogieman, though.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Level 19: Best rocket skate level ever. I pick up two doorways and don't 
	$LF
	"waste any time at the elevator. Unfortunately, there's an unexplained 
	$LF
	"side-trip I take at the very beginning: I think I hit a boogieman so it 
	$LF
	"forced me off to the side.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Level 20: Setting off the hidden path where I do forces the game to show me 
	$LF
	"as it makes the right part of it, which wastes a few frames.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Level 21: Pretty good level, I think.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Level 22: I have two unfalls at this point, so I use 'em both at the same 
	$LF
	"time. But getting to the ship piece on level 20 was a real pain.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Level 23: I'm simply awful getting the doorway out, but get pretty much as 
	$LF
	"close as I can to the ship piece. The second doorway used the more efficient 
	$LF
	"way of checking most of the frames for a good teleport.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Level 24: Rather than try for two doorways, I settle for a doorway and a 
	$LF
	"randomizer. The hula girl catches me for a couple frames, as opposed to a 
	$LF
	"couple seconds, something I find excessively odd. Maybe it's the shoes.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Level 25: Randomizer, doorway, ship piece, outta here.
	$LF
	"Funkotron: Rather than end the movie getting the final ship piece, I decide 
	$LF
	"to end it on the "The End" screen, which shows once Mr. Toejam says his 
	$LF
	"little piece. I actually end it a little bit afterwards so Earl can say his 
	$LF
	""what took you so long?" bit, which is unessential but I find it funny. I do 
	$LF
	"wish I could keep the hi-tops, though.
