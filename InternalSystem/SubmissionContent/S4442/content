	"I firstly want to thank Dooty for showing off some of the optimizations. I did make a bit of a change in the strats since I need to make a detour for boost energy for later in the run. I make this detour because grabbing the big energy blob in the first stage makes it so I can skip one in Maintenance Tunnel 2. (This saves about 1.97 seconds overall).

	"The optimizations here are mostly around cleaner platforming. I need to make sure Colossus can get all of the energy he's going to need for his upcoming boss fights, so I have him grab one orb at the end of the stage, and give the other one to Wolverine. Thankfully, the mooks' RNG was nice so they weren't shooting at Colossus while doing this, so everything went relatively smooth in this stage.

I do a downward punch one of the times since it does a tiny bit more damage, and at that time wouldn't put me in a position to get hit. Overall, even with the extra needed punches, it's still faster than using Colossus during the stage.

	"This is where the new boost energy path comes into play. I can skip two different pickups and save a large chunk of time. A lot of my new knowledge on how the enemies work was used in this stage. You might have noticed that there are a couple times when I stop to attack enemies and run through them. This is because often when you attack an enemy while his back is toward you, he'll either fall down, or turn around and shoot at where you were (after you'd already ran past him). This was used once to allow Colossus to smash a wall without getting shot in the process, and once towards the end to not only get an enemy to shoot in the other direction, but also to set up the following two enemies.

	"This is the first time (besides the unavoidable time in the gas room) when I take damage in the run. I need to take damage in order to activate this glitch. To repeat what I said in my old submission, the basic line of action to trigger this glitch is as follows:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- Get the sentinel to fire his laser (which he does after a short time)
	$LF
	"- Attack the sentinel in boost mode after the laser is done
	$LF
	"- Take damage from one of the spawning drones
	$LF
	"- Knock said drone into the other (which will fly into the sentinel)
	$LF
	"- Run up and quickly attack the sentinel's torso and head in boost mode
	$LF
	"- Attempt to run to the left
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The window for getting this trick depends on how fast you attack the drone, how quickly you attack the sentinel afterward and when you start to run back to the left. You don't have enough time to stop to put Wolverine in an idle state (3 frames) switch to Colossus (another 3 frames) and switch back and run to the left (about 5 frames) in order to preserve boost energy. So sadly I just have to let the boost energy run out a bit once the glitch is activated and try to gain it back in the next stage.

	"This took a lot of time to make and a lot of time examining how the RNG works for drops.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Which drop you get tends to change every 10-14 frames. It isn't always consistent, but it varies within that frame window. The smaller drops aren't necessarily a big deal, but they do add up a bit. The big focus is on the green mooks, since they're the only ones that drop big energy blobs. Keep in mind that I only need Colossus to have energy for one more boss fight until Comm Room 2. Wolverine on the other hand needs enough energy for four fights. Even if I gave all of the energy to Wolverine he wouldn't have enough, but grabbing as much as possible saves a lot of detours in other places.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The drops for the green guys tends to cycle as: nothing > health > energy > nothing > big health > big energy > X-token (a useless trinket since I won't be dying in this run). Like I said this changes every 10-14 frames, but by attacking them and camping out in their hit box I can wait and attack them in the frame window that will give me a big energy drop. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"As a small note, due to the amount of sprites a lot of the time, the energy orb doesn't always show up graphically, but it's there as you'll notice by Wolverine's meter jumping up instantly. Sometimes I do have to take a hit (which is kinda ugly if I'm honest) but a lot of the time it was fairly unavoidable since moving out of the way would make it so I'd miss the frame window for the desired drop.
	$LF

	"This is where I can start using the teleport glitch. If you don't know, the regular animation for Nightcrawler's teleport is kind of slow (at least compared to running). You can glitch out the teleport animation, though, so that you teleport instantly - or at least after only 4-5 frames.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"You can do this by jumping and teleporting on the same frame as you're meant to hit the floor. After you've done it once, you can start chaining it in mid-air and continue doing so until either the stage ends, or you teleport vertically. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"You can get the glitch to happen during upward teleports as well by jumping and attacking, and then waiting two extra frames before hitting jump again to do the teleport. Sometimes it's not optimal since it requires not only an awkward jump, but also a couple extra frames to perform. It also cancels out the original teleport glitch, so you can't chain it in mid-air afterwards unless you jump and activate it on the ground first.

The most optimal thing is for her to turn into an enemy that can be killed in one-hit (the dog). Thankfully, I didn't need to do any RNG manipulation to make this happen. Simply completing the second Comm. Room the way I did and skipping the cutscene on the first available frame happened to line up this pattern.

	"As far as the Master Mold fight is concerned, I use Nightcrawler to get an early hit in and leave the rest to Colossus. There's a damage glitch with this fight.
