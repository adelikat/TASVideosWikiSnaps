	"As I say, each time you land on the ground, you should lose any extra speed you got previously. However, the game only check if your speed is greater than 6008, and not if it is lower than -6008. So as long as your speed is negative, you will only lose around 1000 of speed each 2 frames. This means that with TAS precision, you can turn yourself right before you land, jump immediately and turn yourself again so that you only have a negative speed during the 2 frames when you are on the ground and you only lose 1000 of speed. This is the main reason why I never used Fargus in this TAS (as Nikki can stay in the air more longer with her double jump).

In the normal way, when you hit the boss, you are throw far enough to don't be able to hit him again in a row. However, his animation last long enough so that if he starts it right before you hit the ground, you have enough time to double jump to his head, and for some reasons it leads to multiple hits in a row (I never got more than 3 hits though). So by manipulating his animation, you can beat him in 2 attacks instead of 5.
