This is done by finding an item called the psycho stick which lets you change characters from the pause menu. The earliest time to get the psycho stick is from an egg early in the first level. Once the tiger character is chosen the next goal is to reach a point in Level 1 where a secret warp room can be accessed by hitting a specific part of the sky. This warp room can take you to round 7. Then levels 7-1, 7-2 and 7-3 are completed normally to finish the game.

[div class=p 
	"It’s possible to reduce loading times by abusing non-maskable interrupts (NMIs) that are generated in the SMS when the 'pause' button is hit. It might seem counter-intuitive that pressing the pause button would make a game go faster, but it does turn out to be the case if pressed at the right time.

	"What happens when you press pause, is that an NMI occurs in those ~50000 cycles where nothing is happening. The NMI itslef doesn't do anything important except for Return to where the code would be executing after a normal interrupt, so basically it's doing two frames in one. EX:

	"The first thing I do is break the first egg to get the bird fly. While this is not strictly necessary it saves a lot of time over the run. The egg is broken by punching it twice, but after each punch you lose all speed. Since you do 2 punches you lose the speed twice, so if the punches are closer together this saves time. If the egg is punched on the first possible frame the arm takes a long time to reach the egg, then the second punch also takes a long time to hit the egg, which means the punches have to be spread out, so the punches must be left until later to avoid this.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The next technical part is entering the warp room. The entrance must be hit 3 times. So I hit it the first 2 times with the bird fly and the last time with the punch. If you punch too early you hit the warp room open and lose all speed so it takes you longer to enter the warp room. So the punch must be left until you are much closer to the entrance.

	"7-1, 7-2 and 7-3 have a lot of slopes. These slow you down even if you jump off frame perfectly, but the internal speed value doesn’t decrease. If you run up the slope, when you reach the top you will do a little jump automatically. If you are still on a lower speed after hitting the slope then doing this auto jump off the top causes you to speed up quicker. This saves 2 frames at the end of 7-1.

	"There are also moving stairs in 7-1, 7-2 and 7-3. These speed you up by 6.67% if you’re at full speed. Once again the internal speed value is not affected. I try to spend as much time as possible on these when the route allows it.
