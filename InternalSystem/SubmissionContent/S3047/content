To tell the truth I've made this game's TAS once a half year ago, so I've made this game's TAS twice. However, I've never seen a case that the stair appears in the room where Chocobo comes first.

All floors which appeared with event before had not trap which can go down. So, I had to take the long way to the stair. But now, there is a pitfall in this floor.

Normally, it is used for equipment. But, if it is used for the enemy, its ATB gauge is reset. The enemy's attack is stopped before gauge fills.
