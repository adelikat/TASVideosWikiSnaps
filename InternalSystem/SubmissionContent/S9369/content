	"Boktai has the distinction of being the only game series to use real UV technology. The GBA cartridges feature a physical solar sensor, which is a semiconductor photon diode that detects Ultraviolet, or UV radiation. UV is typically divided into three ranges based on the wavelength; UV-A, which is 315-400 nanometers, UV-B, which is 280-315 nm, and UV-C, which is 100-280 nm. UV-B/C exposure can be particularly dangerous to humans, with UV-C in particular seeing industrial uses as a germicide. The specific sensor used in the cartridge is the Hamamatsu Photonics G5842, which senses the range of 260-400nm, centred around 370nm. This means that it responds best to UV-A radiation, the upper bound of natural sunlight, and what is typically used in commercial blacklight LEDs.

	"None of this information poses any relevance to the movie, as the solar sensor function is emulated within mGBA and BizHawk. The game's native sensor range is represented as an integer between 0-255, with 255 representing total darkness and 0 representing maximum brightness. This is an ambiguous value as the maximum recognised ingame is clamped after initial system calibration and may otherwise be throttled below what the hardware is electronically capable of recognising, which may be as high as, to quote GBAtek, "Close to a tactical nuclear bomb dropped on your city". In emulation this expressed range is inverted, so for all intents and purposes, henceforth 0 will represent total darkness and 255 will represent maximum brightness. The specific ranges used to achieve a given value on the Sun gauge ingame can be seen on

	"Boktai 2 is an action-RPG that can be described as "Metal Gear Solid-meets-Castlevania". The first game in the series was developed by Hideo Kojima and has a high emphasis on stealth mechanics. These mechanics still exist in Boktai 2 (Henceforth referred to as Zoktai) but there are very few rooms which force the player to avoid discovery. Zoktai instead plays more like a traditional RPG, with emphasis on gaining EXP to level up and improve stats, upgrading your gear such as weapons and armour, etc. Progression is entirely linear; no known methods exist to skip or otherwise play dungeons out of sequence, so we follow the natural order of Cathedral > Remains > Dark City > Aqueduct > Spiral Tower > Undead Zone.

	"Combat features the use of three different weapon types; Swords, Spears and Hammers. Technically speaking, you can also use Unarmed at any point, and Gun towards the end of the game, but Unarmed is terrible and is only used once during the tutorial, while Gun is even more terrible and isn't even used in the movie. Sword is the weapon type used for combat whenever possible owing to its combination of having the highest attack speed of the weapon types, whilst still hitting relatively hard. Spears and Hammers are situationally used to solve puzzles where required, as Spears have a longer reach in order to hit levers that are normally out of range, and Hammers can break wooden blocks or operate rusted levers. Damage is further modified by a series of factors, and the full details of damage calculation can be viewed on

	"Zoktai uses an isometric-style camera view, though the movement engine does not behave as it does in similar games that use strictly isometric movement, such as Megaman Battle Network. The four primary D-pad directions plus diagonals can be used, providing 8-way movement. Due to the isometric camera view, "North" is what the player sees as "up-right", with the other directions corresponding to the other respective diagonals. Room exits universally face north, east, south or west. Movement speed in Zoktai is dynamic, where your walking speed is a product of Django's AGIL stat, minus the Weight value of whatever armour is currently equipped. For instance, when gaining control in the movie, Django has an AGIL of 12 and a Weight of 5, resulting in a final value of 7. This value then falls into a Speed Category, which can be checked against the following table:

The highest reached in this movie is Category 2, as each new Category reached brings slightly diminishing returns, and the increase in speed from Category 2 to Category 1 does not outweigh the opportunity cost of investing the required stat points elsewhere.

Dash causes Django to run forwards based on the current Sun level for 16 frames, ignoring normal speed rules. At the maximum Sun value of 10, this dashing speed is approximately 50% faster than running at Category 1. The frame data for how long a dash lasts can vary depending on Sun level, but 10 is taken as the standard unless there is a specific reason to use something else.

RNG2 is set to 833 on game boot, and progresses by variable amounts whenever sprites are drawn onscreen. This index caps at 1023 before overflowing to 0, creating 1024 distinct RNG addresses for random drops. (See

		") The important thing to note is that all enemies have a Common drop table, and a Rare drop table. Based on the number of eligible RNG indexes, these have a 10.8% and a 1.2% from enemies respectively, and these values are not evenly distributed across the 1024 range, creating clusters that are more favourable to target for manips, as well as clusters that simply don't allow for a timely drop to be manipulated. Rare drops in particular very often require an extended manip carried across multiple rooms.

	"As noted above, RetroEdit was instrumental in helping to identify and report an issue with the emulation of the solar sensor function itself. In basic terms, rewinding within TAStudio would commonly cause desyncs with the reported sunlight level ingame, which to my understanding is an issue in how savestates are handled. The practical consequences of this are variable, up to and including full desyncs due to differing numbers of lag frames occurring, or RNG advancing differently than intended. These differences would not become apparent until replaying the movie from an earlier point, which presumably caused the "correct" savestate to be used from the point of divergence. Please note that while I took great efforts to ensure that this movie was optimised where possible, this emulation issue made optimising a few sections as tightly as I would have liked extremely impractical. Occasional compromises were made such as spending an extra couple of frames on Energy management in order to eliminate the possibility of a desync causing me to run out of Energy before a planned recharge. The final fight in particular is likely not fully optimised as these sensor desync issues may occur at any point during the fight owing to its unique mechanics. The vast majority of this movie is "well-optimised" in my opinion, but I ask for viewers to understand that I did the best that I could in these more difficult moments with the complications that the emulation presented.

These are the two primary stats, and both items are used in the run, making this by far the most optimal choice for initial password. The combination of characters actually used does not match the password given to the player in Boktai 1, as the 24-character combination is very slow to enter. Instead, a random mish-mash of kanji that still outputs a correct answer for the Dark Boy title is used. I'm not fluent in Japanese, but to my understanding this password is the equivalent of just entering something like "aaaaaaaeeeeeeeooooaaaaa" for an English password.

After dealing two back-hits, running past the front of the Skeleton with a specific position/timing during its turning animation causes it to fail to see Django, then two more back-hits followed by a standard frontal hit are used to defeat it.

A precisely-placed thrust in the center of the torch's hitbox will light all four quadrants at once. This is also used in RTA play, but the position is very unforgiving. Much of this fight's mechanics are skipped by maintaining a stunlock by immediately re-lighting the torch after it gets extinguished after each cycle; Duneyrr automatically recoils after enough damage is dealt and begins flying again, but by re-lighting the torch she's never able to leave her central position. This prevents her from spawning adds periodically, which normally restrict your options as they harass you as well as causing huge amounts of lag. I use a combination of weapon/element types per cycle in order to maximise damage output per cycle and reduce the number of times I need to keep her locked down. Finding positions that allowed me to avoid taking damage on the pollen balls being spawned whilst still inflicting damage on the first frame possible each cycle was quite challenging, but I'm fairly sure that the attack strings in this fight are optimised. Room for improvement in this fight will be in the form of lag optimisation. The direction that the killing blow is delivered does actually make a substantial difference to the length of her death animation, and I choose down as it was consistently the fastest option.

The vast majority of the movie's RNG manipulation is centred around this dungeon, and getting everything to work sequentially was a nightmare. The first RNG manip begins before the dungeon even loads; I mentioned above that I stopped the sunlight during the purification in order to manipulate an RNG call. When the Remains dungeon is loaded, the positions of three key items are also generated in the upcoming Remains Desert; three Stone Tablets that are required to open Remains B. These tablets correspond to memory addresses 0x203db6a, 0x203db6b and 0x203db6c, and thanks to a script developed by Raphi I was able to check on dungeon load which screens these tablets would spawn on. The desert is shaped like a grid, and these tablets will spawn in fixed positions on any of the eight sectors surrounding the central point. I managed to identify that having RNG2 at 782 after Remains loaded would give me an optimal spread for the tablets. An alternative combination of rooms can be used which is only a couple of seconds slower, but this is made less ideal by the fact that a second manipulation will take place during these desert screens, which would require me to take a longer movement path if that sub-optimal spread were used. This problem was one of the reasons I suspended progress on this movie until I better understood what the rest of the route would need to look like, and it's no exaggeration to say that runners like Raphi, Shenef and DrHell providing scripts and tools in this fashion reduced the timeframe for this movie by months. I initially didn't think I would have this movie completed until at least 2025, but scripts like these streamlined the process beyond what I dared imagine, as the alternative would have been needing to play through the entire dungeon before being able to see what the results were.

This trap is also notable for showing the game's first major damage spike; Vampire Bats deal 52 damage to Django with no armour equipped, killing him from full Life in two hits.

This is the primary reason that a full moon date is selected for gameplay; if playing on the date of a full moon and it is Night time ingame, attempting to charge energy when the sun isn't active will instead summon lunar bugs that can be used to refill Life. These can be summoned infinitely as long as the correct date/time is being used, and since I am waiting in this position for the Yellow Slime to drop an item, this is the most productive opportunity to do this refill. Thirdly, the combination of Energy and Life refilling advances RNG2 to 917, which then causes one of the Yellow Slimes to drop its common drop; a Power Nut.

Worst-case scenario, the golems can kill each other and prevent you from gaining any EXP. Even if the player is able to get all the kills, it's still possible for the golems to collide with each other in such a way that they bounce apart too far to be hit at the same time, forcing a further timeloss. In the movie, this is obviously not an issue, and I was able to get a very optimal set of enemy collisions that allowed me to start damage as soon as possible, and cleave both sets of golems down together. However, I was not able to manipulate any random drops during this trap. Clay Golems drop Hammer-type weapons, and I need three Maces from this dungeon, which is the Clay Golems' rare drop, a 1.2% chance.

If the central hole in the panel layout was filled, it may be possible to use subpixel positioning to cross over the corner-point of two adjoining panels without actually stepping on them.

	"I was expecting this fight to require heavy lag management, but surprisingly not. The two cycles of this fight can't really be sped up, as I need to wait for Sabata to generate black holes in the centre of the arena, all I can do is ensure that the Vampire is in range of the black hole when it becomes active so that I don't need to waste time pushing him in. Once he's trapped in the black hole, Sol enchant hits are used to deal heavy damage, and by starting damage as soon as possible I have time to deliver a sixth hit during the first cycle before he breaks out automatically. I CANNOT deal over 50% of his Life in the first cycle, or it will trigger a very slow attack in which he splits into a swarm of bats, wasting close to a minute. Thus I turn the Sol enchant off for the sixth hit, leaving him barely above 50%. The second cycle is similar to the first in that I can only ensure that he's inside the black hole once it becomes active, but during the active damage phase I must this time ensure that I DO deal six full hits of damage after starting at the earliest opportunity. The fight does not end during this second cycle without this sixth hit, and you do not normally have enough time to deal six hits per cycle during RTA play. Handling the fight in this manner allowed me to avoid using enchanted hits for minor damage throughout the rest of the fight, which is normally used to manage the boss's Life value and ensure the cycles occur correctly, but avoiding using the enchanted hits during this movie saved a lot of Energy to use in the following section instead, which is much more efficient. Defeating the Vampire raises Django to LVL12.

This is never a risk even in RTA play as long as Django is forced back into the coffin at early opportunities, and of course I ensure to do this on the first possible frame during this movie. The shots used appear to be late, but Django's hitbox activates relatively late after escaping the coffin, and I'm quite sure that all three hits are done first-frame.

Starting from the LVL17 Sword, the Zweihander, weapons are treated as being Rank 2 or higher. Starting from Rank 2, all weapon forges have a chance to morph into a Rare weapon, which the game defines as "R-rank".

	"Obtaining this weapon is not simple, however. As the above guide details, the resulting weapon from a forge is dependent on the materials used. Same-type weapons will always result in the same type, whilst different-type weapons will always result in the remaining type.

	"Let us assume that I'm using a Short Sword + Broadsword for the weapon forge. This is Sword + Sword, so a Sword will be created by this forge. Weapon A is the Short Sword, which is LVL5, and Weapon B is the Broadsword, which is LVL9. Using the above calculation, this creates a total of 14, which is then halved to create a value of 7. A final value of "r" is then added to this number, where "r" is +6 for a same-weapon-type forge, or will randomly be between -6 to +6 for a differing-weapon-type craft. Thus in the above calculation, "r" is 6 which is added to 7, for a final value of 13. The resulting weapon will be a Sword which does not exceed LVL13, which we can verify on the sheet will result in a Long Sword.

[div class=p 
	"In practice, this is much more complex in the movie since I do not have a chain of Swords to link into higher and higher levels. What I have is a bunch of Maces from the Clay Golems in the Remains dungeon. So what exactly is my route here? The Katana must be obtained with two forges; firstly, I use the Short Sword that I just unequipped, plus one of the two remaining Maces. A LVL5 Sword + a LVL9 Hammer will equal a Spear that cannot exceed LVL13. However! This is a differing-weapon-type craft, so it is subject to the random "r" value, which is anything from -6 to +6. ONLY a result of +6 will allow me to forge a LVL13 weapon here, which is effectively a 1-in-13 chance. Before entering the forge house, I activate the sun at a low brightness, which causes Black Django to take a couple of ticks of damage; as a vampire, he is now susceptible to the sunlight. These damage ticks advance RNG2 to 435 on room entry. From here, I select the weapons to use for the forge, and I un-select + re-select the second weapon. This advances RNG2 by 1, aligning me with receiving a +6 "r" value from this forge, resulting in a Lance, the LVL13 Spear.

	"The first forge itself is almost totally uneventful, because actively playing the forging minigame almost invariably causes lag to occur every time a strike is delivered. I was able to use a novel solution for this first forge in which I only delivered 1 hit, on the last possible frame before the metal cooled too much and needed to be re-heated. This caused a pseudo-hit in which the game registered that a hit is delivered, but no animation actually plays. This prevented RNG2 from progressing, and also prevents the forge from being failed; if 0 hits are performed in a forge, you automatically receive a trash weapon. Since 1 hit is delivered, I instead receive the "correct" weapon, the Lance. Albeit, it's an abysmal Lance with an overall quality of -10 to its attack power due to 1 hit during the forge resulting in a very low score. Fortunately, the actual QUALITY of this weapon is irrelevant as it will immediately be used as material for a second forge, to get the Katana.

	"Before starting the second forge, I use an enchanted Spear thrust to advance RNG2. My materials for this second forge are my final remaining Mace, plus the Lance I just forged. A LVL 9 Hammer + a LVL13 Spear will equal a Sword that cannot exceed LVL17. This is the lowest possible level for a Rank 2 Sword, which has a chance to morph into the Rare-2 Sword, the Katana! Once again, this is a differing-weapon-type forge, so the random "r" value can be anywhere from -6 to +6, which is why the Spear thrust before the second forge is required.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"However!! There is now an entirely new variable to worry about. I mentioned that the Rare-weapon forge is subject to another random check, this time a framecounter. The check for a Rare-weapon forge is largely dependent on Django's Weapon Skill level, but in the movie this is irrelevant as his Sword Weapon Skill is 7, which results in a bonus of 0%. All I have is the base chance for a Rare-craft, which is a flat 1%, expressed as a 4-frame window every 400 frames. As the "chance" for the Rare-craft increases, this frame window gets wider. Thankfully, this 4-frame window naturally aligned with me entering the second forge and selecting my material as soon as possible. Had I missed this window, I would have been forced to wait another 400~ frames before starting the forge, and equally I would not have been able to "save time" before this point unless I could reach this forge at least 400 frames sooner.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"This only confirms the ELIGIBILITY for the Rare-2 forge, the weapon I will actually get from the forge is still dependent on how the minigame is performed, and I now have ANOTHER variable to worry about during the forge; gaining the Katana's "SP" effect. Depending on how accurate your strikes are, all weapons of Rank 2 or higher have a chance to obtain an additional effect. This chance is equal to the # of "GREAT!" hits during the forge, multiplied by 3. Each of these "GREAT!" hits are a maximum 3-frame window based on the speed of the cursor, but due to using maximum sunlight for the forge these are all 2-frame windows. I'm forced to use maximum sunlight here in order to have time to deliver the # of hits required; since the SP calculation is # of "GREAT!" hits * 3, I can guarantee the SP effect by exceeding 33. By allowing the cursor's offset to slightly exceed the target point each round, I'm able to deliver an immediate hit and end each cycle sooner, gaining enough time for an extra cycle of hits. The Katana's SP effect is to increase the ATCK stat by 1 for every 8 AGIL, which in this case is 3 extra ATCK from my 25 AGIL stat. This is a very appreciable increase, as 1 ATCK is equal to 2 STRG, meaning the Katana's SP effect is like having an effective +6 STRG, hitting as though I'm two levels higher than I actually am. In addition, SP weapons don't suffer durability loss that forged weapons are typically subject to; they will gradually break over time, reducing in power and causing lag when these breakages occur. This never occurs for SP weapons, so it retains its full power across the whole movie.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"With all of that accounted for, there's only one more thing to worry about; the weapon that I get from the forge is also influenced by the RNG2 index when the forge ends. I would have loved to reduce the # of hits delivered during the second forge as each hit tends to generate lag, but without using this many hits I simply do not receive the Katana, even after hitting the correct 4-frame window. From the testing that I did here, I was only able to receive a Katana if all of the previously mentioned conditions were satisfied, AND the RNG2 value was 212 on finishing the second forge. There is VERY little that I can do once the forge has begun to alter the rate that RNG2 advances, the only change I was able to make was how quickly each cycle of hits is delivered; using two hits close together causes the spark animations to overlap, interrupting the RNG advancement. By getting the time for the extra cycle and finding a specific combination of these early-hits enabled me to finish on the correct RNG2 value and obtain the Katana SP, the weapon that will carry me for the rest of the movie.

For this section I simply copy/pasted the same input string after being fairly sure I found the most optimal way to kill the Dark Roots directly in my path; these enemies respawn infinitely on screen reload, as long as both sets of roots haven't been cleared from the screen. They're worth 40 EXP each, so each visit to the screen is worth 80 EXP, and I was able to kill both roots with a single slash, which is far more precise than it looks, as their animation changes to attack Django when he crosses onto an adjacent tile, and this tends to make them very difficult to hit.

I mentioned that Hammers are not ideal for combat due to their slower rate of attacking, but Black Django both attacks faster than Red Django, and deals extra knockback that prevents most enemies from being hit as quickly as the attack animations will allow. This creates a unique opportunity during this dungeon for the Mace to be an effective combat weapon, as the Gladius that I otherwise have is terrible, and I cannot yet equip the Katana.

The exact value of taking these kills is somewhat dubious, but I do believe it at least matches the rate of EXP gained from taking a longer Dark Root grind in San Miguel, especially considering these enemies cost no Energy to kill and thus this EXP doesn't require stopping for a refill once extended long enough, as with the Dark Roots.

The bulb spreads a dense pattern of thorns after a few seconds, but ten hits from the Katana imbued with Element Dark end the phase before she can use any attacks. Destroying Dark Roots during this phase does grant the standard 40 EXP per kill, but my route did not require this EXP and killing extra enemies would cause additional lag as well as costing Energy I can't spare, so I avoided this. Phase two sees five flower bulbs spawn in random locations, with Durathror being inside one of them. If left alone for long enough, all flower bulbs will release area-of-effect attacks and spawn adds, before disappearing and respawning in new locations. In order to find the real bulb, the player can either attack all of them until they find Durathror which is not exactly preferable, wait for one of the bulbs to vibrate indicating that it contains Durathror, or use Transform: Bat in order to reveal Durathror's position through echolocation. Alternatively, Django can just pre-cognitively know which is the correct bulb every time through the use of savestates, which I opt for. Phase three sees Durathror reveal herself entirely and alternate between summoning giant thorned roots that follow Django, and causing spiked balls to fall from the ceiling. Each cycle during this phase automatically ends after dealing enough damage to Durathror, so I use a combination of enchanted and unenchanted hits per cycle in order to maximise damage and end the fight in fewer cycles. Some camera scrolling is used to minimise lag throughout the fight, and some playaround movement is done during downtime, but not as much as I could have done; this particular section of the movie was one that I needed to rework a few times due to a combination of making minor changes due to the amount of Energy required later, and sensor emulation desyncs.

It will smoke and disappear, which is a fail-safe intended for the coffin somehow ending up out-of-bounds, and typically results in it teleporting to the previous room. Instead, since this room's puzzle flag has been set to "solved" by pushing the stone block, the coffin teleports to the NEXT room, preventing Django from needing to drag it from the floor panel. This used to be used in RTA runs to save about 1 second, but as of beige's discovery of assigning stat points early to raise coffin-drag speed, this no longer saves time and I drag the coffin normally instead. It's a shame since this is about as close as the movie would get to showing something that looks "glitchy", but it just isn't faster.

The soft-reset function for this game is Start + Select + L + R, which I'm able to hold through the game creating a save file as the soft reset command won't actually be performed until the save file has been written to.

Any progression of date on soft-reset would cause the coffin to return to town, but using a future full moon date allows me to continue summoning moonbugs for Life refills when needed. Advancing the date by a month has the simultaneous effect of increasing my money balance; for every day that passes, a fixed percentage will be added to the balance. This percentage can vary randomly, but on new file creation is hard-coded to be 1.7% until the calendar day rolls over, and will be applied for up to 10 days in a row, compounding each time.

The first room features a Black Slime on a corner tile that I Dash straight past, but this thing can and does end RTA runs on the spot, as running past it on the corner is not actually consistent due to the game's movement system effectively making it pseudo-random whether Django will move by 1 or 2 pixels on the frame he rounds the corner. Contacting the Black Slime twice is death, or once if Dash is active whilst taking damage, as this forces Django to take automatic critical hits. Fortunately this is not a problem in a TAS, and I Dash past it trivially. Once getting outdoors, Django can either manually slide along the narrow passage, or transform into Black Django and then use Transform: Mouse to run along the narrow passage. I'm very sure that using Red Django here is faster since the alternative requires extra menuing, animation time and Energy usage.

	"On gaining control of Sabata, I open the menu and use a Speed Nut. Sabata's running speed is significantly slower than Django's owing to his heavy armour, and his personal movement magic, the Zero Shift, behaves very differently to Django's Dash. Zero Shift costs Energy for Sabata to use, and causes him to teleport forward a fixed distance. This distance is unaffected by the current sunlight level as Sabata is the Lunar Child, the only thing I care about regarding sun level is that at least 1 bar is displayed whilst Sabata is indoors, so that he can passively regenerate Energy. This is actually the thing I am least mechanically certain about both in this movie, and in Zoktai in general; as recently as this week a few of us observed that the conditions for Sabata to be able to refill Energy both indoors and outdoors do not appear to follow consistent rules. We're not certain if this is due to using the Japanese 1.0 release and something was patched in later revisions, but different runs have shown Sabata clearly requiring sunlight to be active whilst indoors VS not requiring sunlight indoors, to requiring no sunlight active whilst outdoors VS refilling Energy outdoors being impossible. Research is ongoing to determine why there are differences here, but the takeaway for the movie is that I followed the currently-understood strategy of having some sunlight enabled whilst indoors, and as far as I'm aware this cannot lose time if it turns out to not be required. I first noted that strange behaviour was happening here when I notified the others in a voice call that I was able to save time in this dungeon by charging Energy as Sabata whilst waiting for the outdoor elevators to move whilst sunlight was disabled, and was met with variations of "What?? How??" At the very least, I don't think any permutation of this behaviour caused me to lose time in this movie, as I was passively regaining Energy whilst indoors, and manually recharging Energy whilst outdoors which is the best-case scenario in both settings.

	"The brothers finally confront the last of the Immortals: The Shadow Immortal, Black Dainn. This functions like a repeat of the Vampire fight in Remains, down to Sabata generating black holes in the centre of the room with Django distracting the boss until the black hole is fully formed. Dainn's attacks are far more threatening than Ringo's, the orbs of darkness that he spawns in particular will kill Django in one hit, no questions asked. Just like the first fight, there's not a lot that can be done to speed this fight up. Or so was believed for a long time. I realised some time ago that a very heavy hit can be dealt in the opening of this fight by using Rising Sun, since Dainn is weak to Sol and therefore takes damage from the sunlight explosion. At 10 sunlight, this hits him for over 1,500 damage, which in practice saves a cycle in the fight. This is nonetheless a pretty unintuitive action to take, as using Rising Sun costs an entire Energy bar, and running out of Energy in this fight is not a tempting prospect. However, with consumables to regain Energy this saves an appreciable amount of time, and is now regularly used in RTA runs. After using Rising Sun, I open the menu to replace Rising Sun with Cloud, then use two Solar Nuts to regain Energy. The rest of the first phase of the fight is playaround movement, and defending Sabata from the oncoming darkness orbs. After Dainn's second lunge he gets trapped in the black hole, and after three hits he knocks out Sabata and phase two begins.

	"Phase two sees Dainn separate from Ringo's body and move into a fixed position to launch his strongest attack; a storm of darkness orbs that fires towards wherever Django is currently standing. There is no way to survive getting hit by this attack in an RTA run, and getting hit is a significant risk as saving a further cycle in this fight is possible by getting as close as possible to Dainn whilst this attack is being used, which causes the orbs to miss completely whilst Django is able to stand and attack Dainn freely. The positioning for this is very precise however, and the player doesn't really get a chance to adjust after making a mistake, instead generally just dying on the spot if misjudging the spot. I actually had additional trouble with this spot in this movie, as I wanted to find a position that would allow me to start damage earlier and attack for longer, but these positions were consistently putting me

	" close to Dainn, and causing his hitbox to contact Django on taking damage and vibrating. I eventually found a spot I'm relatively happy with, as I was able to scroll the darkness orbs almost entirely offscreen to eliminate lag, with minimal re-positioning needed after Dainn moves following this attack. Dainn's next attack is summoning three large darkness orbs as in the first phase before disappearing underground to periodically attack from below. Once this attack triggers, the player has no option but to wait for 10~ seconds for Dainn to re-appear, and risking the close-range death in this phase is for the sake of ending the fight before this underground attack begins. During routing I was worried about being able to get this quick kill due to entering this fight two levels lower than normal, but I managed to catch this cycle comfortably enough and end the fight at the planned point. Defeating Dainn raises Django to LVL26, two levels at once.

Cloud is used for the purification as I don't necessarily need to use Sol here, and I will need Cloud in the next area. Fun fact, yesterday I was on RTA WR pace and decided "Yeah, I did that in the TAS so I'm gonna do it here because it's faster", then very quickly got reminded of why I just take the small timeloss and use Sol for this purification in RTA since you can actually kill the darkness orbs easily.

The Tower causes damage to all onscreen characters equal to Django's level * 8. The Sand Worm is comprised of multiple segments, and The Tower hits all of these for full damage! However, Django also takes damage from The Tower, and it's more than enough to kill him from full Life. The only way to mitigate this is by using a Bearnut, which prevents all damage for 15 seconds. I Dash into position to hit the Sand Worm with Cloud twice as soon as possible, then open the menu to use a Bearnut, then once again to use The Tower, instantly killing the Sand Worm. This is a very dangerous fight in RTA runs as once the Sand Worm burrows underground it moves randomly, and can just decide to move straight onto Django's position and fire a rock, instantly killing him. Even if this doesn't happen, the time it spends underground is random, so timeloss regularly occurs here just from waiting for it to do something. The timesave provided by The Tower can't be understated and I really wish there was a way to consistently get a copy in RTA, but that requires a soft-reset cycle which outweighs the time saved from shortening this fight.

The RTA method is to use Dynamite on the first torch, as the time limit for lighting all torches is actually very strict and using Dynamite typically removes this pressure.

Thankfully the fight goes by extremely quickly in this movie, where I'm able to manipulate a favourable movement pattern from the Lich that allows me to maintain very high uptime on attacking from behind, as well as killing the Skeleton Fencer before it even becomes active. I am forced to use two Solar Nuts mid-fight to regain Energy, this is simply a by-product of how much health the Lich has and how low my level is, and cannot be avoided.

We're not completely certain why this occurs, but it seems to be tied to attacks that cause noise, as using Transform: Mouse and pressing A to squeak achieves the same thing. Whatever the reason, this behaviour is very consistent and very helpful, as it skips an attack that invariably wastes a lot of time due to the downtime and lag generated. Once the Serpent is airborne, I open the menu to use a Bearnut + The Tower, and the Serpent is chunked for most of its remaining Life. As it lands close to Django's position, I use one Flame attack on its tail, the designated weak point, to finish it off.

Due to savestates incorrectly being cached when working in TAStudio and the gamestate constantly snapping to the sunlight incorrectly being off, Jormungandr kept becoming invulnerable and ignoring what was supposed to be happening.

It will either appear close or far away, with close being preferred as it allows me to start damage sooner and gives a more favourable position for the second set of attacks. This is what I got without requiring any manipulation, which I was very happy about. Django must start damage by attacking one of Jormungandr's eyes, which will prompt it to immediately lunge at Django and devour him, ending the fight instantly. I'm able to time two attacks to prevent this lunge, instead allowing the lunge animation to begin before delivering a third hit. Three hits are required on an eye to cause Jormungandr's head to become stunned, so I time this third hit for when Jormungandr's head rears back next to its body, then stun it. Getting close to Jormungandr's body causes a tail to appear that rapidly swipes across the arena, which will instantly kill Django here. However, whilst Jormungandr is stunned, this tail does not appear, allowing me to close the distance and cleave the opposite eye and the main body at the same time. Once the opposite eye is also hit three times, Jormungandr's weak spot will appear; the tongue. The primary manipulation this fight required was ensuring that each time this weak point appeared, the head was positioned close enough to the body to allow me to cleave the tongue and body at the same time. Jormungandr's head moves randomly every time the opposite eye is hit, and getting such a position is very uncommon. I never rely on this occurring during RTA runs and consider myself very lucky if it happens once in a fight, instead it's more likely for Jormungandr's head to decide to drift into Django, which here would be an instant death.

I take this opportunity to take some distance so that the tail-swipe doesn't occur, and momentarily raise the sunlight to 10 bars in order to charge as much Energy as possible during downtime. This costs a significant portion of Django's remaining Life and puts me on an even shorter timer to finish the rest of the fight. Once the black breath attack begins, Django is able to ignore it and once again attack one of Jormungandr's eyes three times to start the second stun. This is one of the main perks of using Black Django for the fight; this black breath attack quickly kills Red Django, but Black Django is totally immune to it. I move into position to once again cleave the opposite eye with the main body, once again manipulating the hits so that Jormungandr's head both fails to connect with Django, and drifts close enough to the body so that when the tongue emerges, I can cleave both together.

I use this opportunity to immediately hit and eye three times and begin the third stun cycle, then move to the opposite side and repeat the process of cleaving the eye and body, then once again manipulating the head's behaviour to avoid Django and remain close enough to the body that the tongue can be cleaved with it when it re-emerges. This third cycle doesn't quite finish off Jormungandr, but the body remains vulnerable after the cycle finishes, so one final hit is delivered to finish it off, and I celebrate defeating the final boss by rapidly switching the sunlight on and off, to change the colour palette and ironically put Jormungandr back into its "immortal" state.

	": Well, this certainly was a long submission. From all this, I did pick up the details that I needed to know with your effort. As I expected, heavy RNG is key with RPG games. Watching your TAS, along side your WR, showed the expected "pulling-ahead" of your optimization.  I figured it would have been a lot more, but this game didn't have elements that I see in other RPGs that really slow down a human run. So I think this is a good thing. Well, great job on this and I congratulate you on this effort.
