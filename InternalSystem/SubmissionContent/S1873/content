	"This game has very strange screen scrolling and inventory menu behavior. They seem to follow no logic. Seemingly random lag is also part of the mechanics of the game. Everyone who tries to record something precise with this game will learn that nothing seems to make sense in a frame-by-frame level. In other words, this game is improvable until somebody understands how everything really works. (Well, maybe that's the usual case anyway?)
