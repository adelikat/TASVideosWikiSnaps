	"For the Purple Tentacle glitch to work, I still needed to wait for Ed to get back to his room before he'd respond to the doorbell again. This time while I was waiting, however, I did a little more to show why I was waiting. I wish that I could find a way to avoid this wait (still thinking about the possibilities).

Either switch kids or have a cutscene occur before being captured. After switching back to the first kid, the unfriendly person/tentacle will be frozen. (An exception is the green tentacle at the stairs.) The 'New Kid' command is disabled in the lab entry precisely because of this glitch, but the programmers seemingly forgot that cutscenes also make the glitch work.
