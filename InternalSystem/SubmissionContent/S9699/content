	"Many of the stages have RNG elements that can make them faster or slower, and there are two ways of manipulating RNG (without wasting time), those being: Changing the initial system time and toggling the sound. I only use the sound method because it's more convenient and versatile. My guess is that toggling the sound triggers an RNG event where a random music track is chosen, changing RNG.

Theoretically, you don't even have to move a single ball in order to destroy the glass, however, that has a 1 in 178,920 chance, so it's pretty much out of the question. Achieving a 1 move win is significantly more likely, but it's still an unreliable, 1 in 759 chance. All in all, I had to settle for the 2 move win, which is pretty achievable (still, it's only about a 2% chance of happening). Fortunately, most of the balls ended up close to each other, which made their movement trajectories shorter and consequently faster.
