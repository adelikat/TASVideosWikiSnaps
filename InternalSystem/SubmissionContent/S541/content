		"How it works:
	]b
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"- B button heats the engine, A button heats it 50% only.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"- B button accelerates to max speed faster than A.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"- When at max speed on the ground, its best to hold A, so the engine doesn't heat.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"- When lower or higher than max speed on the ground, hold B.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"- When in the air, hold right only.(let go the accelerators)
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"- Just before landing, press left for 1 frame, hold B when the bike lands.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"- The "H" type ramps are the ones that give extra speed. They are those small ones and there are 3 of them for each lap on the first track.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"- Changing lanes while in the air (not while going up a ramp) changes the length of the jump: If you change lanes down, you will land further. If you change lanes up, you will land earlier. Landing further is used on almost every ramp and bumps possible, unless its desireable to land earlier (in order to get ramps for example, or to not crash).
