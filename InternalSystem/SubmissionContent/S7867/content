	"Letters must be shot in the correct order to spell the word. You must also finish the word by shooting the "freebie" (happy alien thing) which you can also use in place of any letter beforehand. However, if you do this, you have to shoot down 5 asteroids to get another freebie to finish the word. This wasn't worth it.

	"Word seeds are obviously important in a game like this. The first word was DUST, which lets us shoot the entire word in the first pass since the letters are (mostly) alphabetical. The first word is dictated on the start frame, and luckily enough it's right at the beginning after we menu to game 17. Other words are dictated by inputs spammed after the first round ends.
