	"I was about to search additional TAS projects and I saw this mentioning at the 
	(__wikiLink|href=/ListOfIdeas|implicitdisplaytext=ListOfIdeas)
	" page. After some minutes of testing it looked like the game is too boring for a full TAS even with the use of warps and multiball explosions. I also tested that desyncing the intro won't let me to start there (IIRC Baxter or maybe Bisqwit did this in another game).

	"The "final" boss has 20*3 HP (left arm, body, right arm). Notice that dying on the stage will refill both parts to 20 HP. After every 6th hit, he rotates the screen which also reverts the control of the pads. When he rotates, he won't get hit.

	"Both the pads and ball has such a weird physic (in technical terms), sometimes the subpixels keeps increasing even at the end of the game (after the movie ends). That's why I couldn't finish the game earlier, also the final combo for the right arm was a very tedious attempt to get there. It looks clumsy, however I challenge you to shorten that part or more better: beat my TAS!

	"The reason to accept/publish this TAS is mainly that how easily you can fool the boss. Also it's short and fast. Nuff said. However I would gladly like to ask everyone to tell what do you think not just vote, because if you think you would watch a full run, I could do it just for you =).

When you want to make such a movie it is a good idea to discuss this on the forum first, or ask a judge about it. Furthermore, the (U) version of the game is the preferred version by default, a shorter title screen is specifically
