	"This glitch was discovered by Bruno Visnadi. It was already used in the Super Demo World any% TAS, and it was actually already known before the submission of the current published SMW warps TAS. The glitch consists in stunning a fish or a para-bomb. When stunned, these sprites will spawn a Reznor. If Reznor spawns into slot 7, the level can be finished: the following RAM memory addresses values - $7E:1520, $7E:1521, $7E:1522 and $7E:1523 - must sum up to 4. Each sprite use these addresses in a different way, many of them for 'vertical directions'. The 4 cited addresses are used by sprites between slots 4 and 7.

	"Here happens the biggest improvement in the whole run. Firstly, due to factors as performing a better corner clip, having the opposite real frame parity and ditching Yoshi further to the right, we could do the first duplication 5 frames sooner. The way turn blocks work in this game is: When a turn block is hit by the first time in a level, it starts spinning and a block sprite, which takes slot 3, is set to it. If you hit more turn blocks before the first stops spinning, they will spin as well and their block sprites will take slot 2, then 1, then 0. When none of the 4 slots is slots available, and you hit a new turn block, the block that is on slot 3 will stop spinning, and the block you just hit will start spinning, taking slot 3. If you keep doing this, then slot 2 will be taken, then 1, then 0, then 3 again. So, it is impossible to 5 blocks to spin at the same time.
	$LF
	"What was done in the previous run was to, after duplicating each block, double hit (hitting with Mario and with a item at the same time) 2 blocks quickly, so that 4 sprite blocks are spawned and the block you duplicated stops spinning, so that you can duplicate it again. We did something completely different: we duplicated some blocks upwards in an specific position and order, and then we threw the red shell on them. So, while Mario was hitting blocks around the duplications, the shell was contributing hitting blocks much faster than Mario could do by himself. After many attempts, we could find a sequence of duplications in which Mario almost never needs to wait to duplicate a new block, which saved a lot of time. We also save about 10 frames by going under the wings block instead of going above it after collecting the dragon coin, which allows us to reach Yoshi sooner, and consequently, he can interact with the wings earlier. We also save a frame by releasing the mushroom from the item box, which changes the slot the wings is spawned in and improves Yoshi's interaction with it. Overall, 104 frames are saved.

	"Here, we perform stun glitch to spawn a Reznor and finish the level!
	$LF
	"Initially we manipulated Mario's relative position to the screen by turning left at the right frame, intending to minimize the duration of a screen scroll. So we used the scroll to spawn a floating spike ball, and used it, a fish, and the p-switch to perform the stun glitch. In order to freeze the screen and do the double tongue glitch, we had to take damage, immediately mounting Yoshi again (which is only possible if Mario is big, so that's why we release the mushroom before and collect it immediately). Yoshi's tongue can set to 3 the value of the address $7E:1522, and that's enough to 'kill' Reznor and finish the level. Yoshi is 'vaporized', but since we didn't dismount him, he is back in the next level. The usage of this glich in this level was attempted many times in the past, but it was never useful because it was necessary to save significantly more than 135 frames, because of overworld and YI1 troubles. Since we saved 184 frames, we could apply it to the TAS.

This would save one frame, since it allows us to activate the keyhole a bit further to the right. However, it was better to delay in one frame the keyhole entrance and save this way 2 frames of lag, due to the better Mario position.

The new strat in YI3 was brilliant, something that almost seems obvious in retrospect but still requires a lot of thinking outside the box, and it's just hilarious to realize that every single stage in Yoshi's Island comes to an abrupt end... all in different ways. I love this game.
