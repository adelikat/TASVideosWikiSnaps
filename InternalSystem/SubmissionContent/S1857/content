	"10 monthes earlier, I have submitted a run that improves most of the times. I did have the feeling  it wasn't perfect as there was one thing that was annoying me. I have submitted it because there was a discussion about Super Punch-Out on IRC and I told adelikat about my improvements. He was interested and I've decided to submit it so he could watch it and maybe improve it. The other reason is that I was fully busy with Legend of Zelda, Castlevania and SMB2 (Which was never finished but maybe someday...) and seriously, I didn't really care about that game when I think Zelda and Castlevania movies are great TASes.

	"Adelikat's choice is the best. If we do an uppercut, the animation lasts long. So it costs many in-game time if the fighter's energy doesn't go down to 0. Finishing him with an uppercut is payful as the timer stops several in-game milliseconds before the animation is over. I think the animation is cut-off by a little too. That may explain why adelikat gains some frames over my version when theoritically, it should have been equal.

It would have saved some time. But he starts with a different pattern that is really unfavorable. I think that pattern is affected by either you  start punching at his face or his body during the first part of the fight. If it's the case and I am 98% sure it is, I doubt a new strategy could be find for him.
