	"Finally, after many WIPs and restarts, the long-awaited any% run is finished :D. After all of this time I've spent TASing and trick-hunting Ocarina of Time, I'm extremely glad I was able to be the one to TAS this. This run uses the Door of Time skip and Reverse Bottle Adventure (a memory manipulation glitch) to complete the game quickly without needing to enter any dungeon or temple. Some awesome sequence breaks have been discovered recently including the DoT skip, scarecrow skip/tektite hover, and the gerudo bridge superflip, which allow us to go straight to the Door of Time after obtaining the bottle as a child and skip the scarecrow/magic bean and hookshot as an adult. Also, many speed tricks have been found this year, inlcuding various forms of the Infinite Superslide, Z-slide, analogue slide, and forward backwalking. As these speed tricks all have their various qualities, they can be implemented in interesting ways to speed up each area and make the run much more entertaining. After lots of waiting around for sequence breaks to be deemed possible, many redone WIPs, tons of testing/backtracking, and overall, an unmeasureable amount of time spent towards the making of this run, I couldn't be happier with the way it has turned out.

This slide works by using constant Z presses to maintain Link's recoils speed from when your shield reflects damage. What makes this trick especially useful is that you can turn during it, although for a cost of -2 speed per turn.

This is a very convenient slide because you can get a -10-speed ISS out of it like a regular superslide, but you can also turn into a Z-slide from it forward or backward. Also, you can change angles with it once (going into a Z-slide) without losing speed, but each angle change after that costs the regular -2 speed. You can take out items during this slide as well.

What made it even more difficult this time around is that taking damage from it was necessary so that there was only one heart remaining upon reaching  the Temple of Time. Taking damage from it any time sooner than I did would have made the peahat recoil too far away from the bushes to superslide, so there's a short waiting period there.

For some unknown reason, Link's slide would get cancelled while trying to switch from one side of the river to the other; this cost many days of waiting around and testing. I was just about to give up and go with the jumpslash method until I happened to get it to work. I'm still not 100% sure how it works because it is seemingly very random, but it involves very strange analogue and Z presses on the few frames that Link is entering/exiting the water.

After the first couple of cuccos, the positions of the remaining cuccos revolves around luck, although you can manipulate the directions of certain ones by slashing them appropriately.

It's unfortunate that I wasn't able to fully coauthor it with him and AKA like we had originally intended, but things kept getting in the way. I did do a lot of hex editing for him and shared a lot of ideas with him, as well as critiquing the WIPs that he sent me almost every day. It was really amazing closely following the progress of a run we've all been waiting for for years now. It still bugs (lol, get it?) me a little that the route is so... bland nowadays, but I guess the point of a speedrun is to complete the game as quickly as possible no matter what. I'll just think of this as OoT's "0 star" run - awesome in theory, but not nearly as good as the runs that came before it. I don't really have much more to say that hasn't already been said by AKA in his comments, but I will say that I'm glad that that terrible Japanese run is finally being replaced by a run that actually deserves to be on the site. It's so amazingly optimal and entertaining that it kept me interested the whole way through, even though the route isn't really one of my favourites.

To anyone whose had any involvement within the community it should be glaringly obvious why. I could have submitted my MQ run 2.5 years ago, which would have been faster than OoT. Due to more favorable dungeon setup and less lag, but that vision was shattered on 24th of March 2008 when I discovered how to skip the Door of Time, which for years was regarded as "impossibLe" to bypass. When I initially discovered it, it wasn't met with any great deal of excitement. It rendered my MQ run "poIntess". I had a so called crisis talk with SL over the issue.

As we slowly worked on the child sectIon, redoing several times whenever improvements were discovered. Not to mention the sheer difficulty and frustrations caused in the training area; bridge clip in lost woods; peehat slide and especially from my point of view cucco collecting. Cucco's are dumb and dumb creatures do random things which more intelligent beings find hard to predict/control. Quite simply, you could collect the cucco's with incredible optimization, but if the positions are terrible. Your run will sucK compared to a run which has greAT positions done to test run standards. The main problem I found given that OoT is a 3D game. Is that you can't see how the cuccos's are behaving off screen. In effect you're just hoping/praying to get lucky, especially later on.

		"Windows vs Linux thread

	", to which I still believe Windows suck but is still much better than Linux, and the only people who use Linux are elitist cheapskates. Long after I won that discussion, we decided to give up all hope of having a soft reset. During that time many improvements and discoveries were found, which would cause us to start from scratch for about the 6th time. The difficulty with restarting again was the potential possibility to skip the hookshot. It was nearly possible get into the fishing pond by hovering off the tektite and getting across the bridge in Gerudo Valley with a superflip, but we couldn't be certain if it was impossible which caused the project again to stall for many months. After a lengthy perseverance both were proved possible. However, we didn't begin working on the run immediately, because of issues out with TASing. Instead, we agreed we'd work on the run during the summer which was approximately 6 months away. This undoubtedly caused impatience within the community, causing an unnecessary publication of a run that was badly made and planned. Towards the end of the child section SL dropped the run and me and Bloob decided to continue. A third of the way into the adult section my enthusiasm for OoT and TASing hit a brick wall. I haven't put as much effort into the later sections as I should have. Most of efforts have revolved around finding the Z-coordinate address, which makes hovering easier.
