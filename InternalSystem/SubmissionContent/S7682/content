The player can take cover on both sides of an object, with the game subtly teleporting Reaper to the appropriate position.

While it’s doable by a human player on larger objects, like cars, long sofas, and tables, smaller objects provide almost no benefit or may actually be detrimental to the run.

We begin by dispatching a Bouncer with a single shot, and closing the door behind us - that last bit’s very important. After bouncing our knife from a Shambler head directly into a Bully and clearing the room, we immediately put the Revenant to use by destroying all the remaining Shamblers and Punks with accurate wall-piercing headshots. The ragdoll positioning here is crucial, as the game’s hit registration can cause even a single limb to just absorb all 5 “pierces”, so it took a while to find a setup where no shots are blocked by bodies.

[div class=p 
	"The next important trick in our arsenal is backup skipping. Killing the backup that arrives via cars is a separate, mandatory objective. When enemies spawn in, they’re given Reaper’s coordinates to path towards - however, “player” and “player in vent” are considered to be two separate entities by the game, and the backup objective doesn’t account for the latter. The player doesn’t exist, the enemies have no variables to work with, and due to what I can only assume is a safeguard to prevent the game from crashing, the objective is skipped entirely, allowing us to move on.

There is a single Grunt hidden in the shipping container, but we’re gonna intentionally save him for later, similarly to what we did on Forced Conversion with the totem. Completing the objectives - namely, reading the note and killing all undead - spawns more enemies. By leaving that first Grunt until the very end, we can complete the latter objective after we're past all the spawn points, bypassing them entirely.

We run a bit further before spraying down three enemies that are now in our line of sight, in order to minimise the frames wasted on shooting. All that’s left is to inspect the note in the container, grab a rifle and head back to our car. By stopping a bit mid-air, we land on a nearby ledge and avoid the landing animation.

[div class=p 
	"Similarly to The Bogeyman’s silenced pistol, the grenade launcher we were given earlier overrides whichever weapon we had, and defaults to the .32 Revolver afterwards, so we need to get our trusty Revenant back into our hands.

If you stand still, Vall just fires at that spot; if you’re on the move, Vall will predict the exact point where her bullet will collide with your skull if you don’t stop moving.

While the elevator’s on its way, we head back down, kill everyone else, and start heading up. Don’t forget to switch to the Revenant so it’s not lost to the level transition!

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"There’s no RNG involved here - Vall always spawns in the same spot. However, I did encounter an interesting quirk when trying to make a shot within the first frame of this screen being loaded. The sniper scope doesn’t inherit the reticle’s coordinates, instead defaulting to somewhere in top centre and then trying to sync up with the reticle position as fast as possible. As such, it took a lot of fiddling with the coordinates and essentially firing blindly, hoping that somewhere along the way the bullet would land somewhere between those two spots, and right on Vall. Ultimately, the perfect first frame shot was not achieved, so there’s a place for future TASes to improve on!

We first dispose of the Patriarch right next to us. Instead of skipping the cutscene, we use its camera and present enemies to our advantage. Killing the Patriarch in the rightmost corner of the room causes the Technicians to start placing landmines before they despawn, and baits anyone who’s seen the body to the roof of the building. Don’t ask why, because I have absolutely no idea. A couple bullets were also spent on the lights above the teleporter, just in case, but it ultimately wasn’t necessary.
