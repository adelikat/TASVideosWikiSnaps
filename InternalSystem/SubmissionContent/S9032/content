	"Unknown she has quite a bit of extended health meaning a single move won't actually cut it. So it lands on the second fastest move that Yoshimitsu has being Sword Impale as it too can deal the most damage in the short amount time and not have any issue to it say a Burning Death Fist (Paul) has in which throws Unknown to the other side of the map. Instead using Yoshi's Impale does a fair bit more work without the issues of BDF.

	"This does raise a question of why didn't I use Gun Jack for Dark Greeting (66 frames) or Anna/Nina for Hunting Swan (71 frames) as they're both faster moves compared to Sword Impale (87 frames). The issue more or less goes to how the AI will deal with the three characters in that second to dodge, or to do a low attack. Yoshimitsu has the safety compared to the other two which also has the unreliability due to having distance from Unknown.
