	"The glitch is pretty weird, if you ask me. It is basically a hidden level select option. Unsure how exactly to have it activated but this is the fastest i could manage to do it. Once it's active, it allows to perform 2 amazing tricks. First is what you see in this movie (lvl select) and second is basically "god mode". God mode let's you fly, hover, go through walls, floor and ceilings and most of this can be done with every characters.

	"As for improvements, i am pretty sure that the glitch can be activated faster but how? After hours of trying, this is as fast as i could pull it off. I think it has to do with the screen camera but i could be totally wrong. Maybe it has something to do with character movement. I'm convinced it's a simple thing but, for now, it's a mystery. IF, by any chance, someone figures out how to activate it, a whole 10 seconds could be shaved. That's around 40% of the run.
