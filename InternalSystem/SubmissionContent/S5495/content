	"Here is a Gameboy version of Arcade's Revenge. It shows off many glitches that do not appear on the other consoles. The main trick here is a type of level select glitch, that basically skips the whole game.

	"The glitch is pretty weird, if you ask me. It is basically a hidden level select option. Unsure how exactly to have it activated but this is the fastest i could manage to do it. Once it's active, it allows to perform 2 amazing tricks. First is what you see in this movie (lvl select) and second is basically "god mode". God mode let's you fly, hover, go through walls, floor and ceilings and most of this can be done with every characters.

	"After running this, it is pretty obvious that Ill attempt the glitched version. This game is a douche and deserves to be destroyed in every possible branch and on every console out there. I shall avenge every last kid who's childhood got gang banged by this disaster.

	"As for improvements, i am pretty sure that the glitch can be activated faster but how? After hours of trying, this is as fast as i could pull it off. I think it has to do with the screen camera but i could be totally wrong. Maybe it has something to do with character movement. I'm convinced it's a simple thing but, for now, it's a mystery. IF, by any chance, someone figures out how to activate it, a whole 10 seconds could be shaved. That's around 40% of the run.

	"Dark Fulgore who posted the video, demonstrating the wall clip glitch, on Genesis . This is what pushed me to give the Gameboy version a chance, since my Gen TAS is on hold, due to softlock issues.
