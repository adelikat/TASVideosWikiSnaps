	"I began to run this game a while ago, then the idea of making a TAS came into my mind as I could discover new glitches and it would probably be a fun TAS to watch.

	"This is a sequel to the classic Castle of Illusion game. Though not as famous as its predecessor or the Genesis one, this game has many improvements and new mechanics from the series, such as several abilities, star collectibles and creative puzzles. This is a fairly long game for SMS or even 8-bit standards, as it doesn't repeat levels. Worth pointing that the graphics are in the edge of the best of the best SMS can make.

	"The tricky part of this level is the RNG of the jumping fireballs, It's also hard to manipulate. I've managed to defeat the boss of this stage in one cycle with frame perfect block throws.

	"The autoscroller is a pain, it has a lot of lag so killing enemies reduce some of it, I had to figure a way of not losing frames while killing enemies and throwing the key at the button, turns out some lag can't be avoided. After this boss I get the shrinking potion, this allows me a trick to go enter doors quickly. I can reset mickey's acceleration to 0 using the shrinking ability and go through doors faster.

	"This level has a lot of neat tricks, also, Using a frame perfect throw, I can avoid the key to not be destroyed at doors, allowing the double use, in this case for pressing a button. Shrinking on ledges makes mickey drop a little faster. The boss on this level has RNG as the number of seconds he stays on each cycle, so I had manipulate it to get the fastest pattern.

	"On this level I get a damage boost to avoid grabbing the jar on the second screen. On the end of the level I stand a while waiting to drop down. I do this to get the glitched first cycle on the boss, it may not seem so, but it saves quite some time.

	"This is little glitch I've found while running the game. By some reason, placing the spring over the key (or through it) and jumping over it while small, makes you go through the platform and skip the entire level. This isn't just a frame glitch, but you have to keep jumping in a certain interval to get it right, jumping too fast (using turbo) doesn't work.

	"The boss on this level has a lot of RNG, and it was one of the places that took me most time on the TAS, as I had to keep rerecording the fight til I get the perfect pattern.
