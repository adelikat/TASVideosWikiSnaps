	"Hi, I have done this Zone, Act 2 in this game because this is my first TAS video and i would like to see how I did. Also, this zone, the Flying battery Zone is one of my favorite zones and I would like to show it to you how I did it. I didn't use glitches, only one, because glitches are boring and you can't know what is the fastest way defeating the level. I hope you enjoy it!
