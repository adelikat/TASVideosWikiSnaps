	"Kid Icarus Of Myth and Monsters is the direct sequel to the original Kid Icarus on NEs, releasing in 1991 in America and 1992 in Europe. It did not make its way to japan until 2012 with the 3ds virtual console release. I noticed this game did not have a TAS, so I decided to learn how to TAS with this game. This run saves around 3 minutes over the RTA WR by zorlax7.

	"I found 2 interesting TAS only techniques while making this run. The first is ladder jumping, where Pit has 1 frame of standing animation when exiting a ladder from the top of the screen, therefore you can then jump. Usually this wastes time because if you start the screen at the top odds are your next destination is below you, but I found a few uses for ladder jumping: optimal movement or avoiding enemies. The other tech I found was jumping past the screen scroll and above the screen. I could not make use of this tech because I did not know how to go about routing a level where I cannot see Pit or the level itself, but this is easily possible in 1-3, 3-1, and 3-2. You can tell where this is possible when I do mini jumps to scroll the screen more upwards in said levels, but optimal play would utilize this glitch to save frames.

	"Most my time save is from optimal movement and boss fights, with a 2 cycle Orcos phase 2 and 2 cycle minotaur. Most the time save off of this run would come from better platform manipulation, as I wasted a lot of time waiting, in 1-2 and 3-3 specifically and better health management in the earlygame. But overall I am happy with the run, and think it turn out quite well.

	"I spent a number of days reviewing areas, where optimization was in question. Basically, I've determined that the questionable strategies are more necessary than I originally thought. For example: various places where farming occurred, and HP replenishing in the health pools. Even though I've played this game and was very fond of it, I am still not familiar...in terms of speed running it. After comparing it with the WR run... I see that run has a edge over human effort. The end result is roughly 2 minutes and 50 seconds faster (give or take a few seconds).
