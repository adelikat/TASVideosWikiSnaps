	": The quite low rerecord count relative to the movie's length and the comment that the movie was played in 25% slowdown indicate that TAS tools were not used effectively enough (most notably with 
	[a href=/TASHowTo.html#FrameAdvance 
		"frame advance
	]a
	" not being used). As a result, the movie has visible rooms for improvement in many places.

[p 
	"On top of that, voter response appears to be mixed, and the low entertainment rating of the 
	[a href=/1289M 
		"published movie
	]a
	" indicates that the relatively long runs of this game do not seem to hold enough entertainment value for the 
	(__wikiLink|Moons)
	" tier. I did not see much in this movie to warrant a higher tier, either. Therefore, unless a future run of this category does significantly better in entertainment value than both this movie and the previous one, it would not be publishable anyway for failing to meet 
	(__wikiLink|Vault)
	" goal choice requirements.

	"Rejecting due to lack of optimization, and due to being a non-Vaultable category with mediocre audience response.
