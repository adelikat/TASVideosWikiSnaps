	"i managed to resync this MAX SCORE SHIN AKUMA TAS that plays survival mode to get the ultimate high score, i do a lot of combos and parries to achieve that.

	"if the goal was only to beat survival mode only for speed, it could be much faster with some other chars and ex groove disregarding such lengthy combos, maybe haohmaru would be the char for that goal.
	$LF
	"if the goal was to get max score on survival mode only, it's the first TAS to get max high score but i believe it could be faster with both shin akuma itself or maybe some other character with infinites.

	"my suggestion is to evaluate this as the only max score survival mode so far, and if someone comes along and wants to obsolete this for bein faster, go ahead. 
	$LF
	"The fact is I tried to make this more entertaining than just using the same 40hits combo all the time.
