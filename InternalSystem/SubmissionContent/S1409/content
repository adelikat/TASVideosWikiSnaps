	"This is a 11 seconds and 43 frames improvement over my previous submission. The improvement comes from an extra "III" that I've found, and a little better cards manipulation. The run is exactly the same until the circus stage, and it's my final submission for this game. I've tried doing a non-pacifist run, but I couldn't manipulate the cards any better in the first stage, so I decided to go with the pacifist rule, which is really impressive in this game (it separates a TAS from a speedrun even more than the manipulation, I think). Pulling a pacifist run in this game in real time would be damn hard. On the other side, the game is too easy on a normal play through.The pacifist difficulty gets especially apparent at the outside factory stage at the a part where there's a really difficult jump over a green worm box that requires the use of the preserved momentum glitch. There was only one possible way to pass through that point. A simple 1 frame or pixel wrong would've meant certain death.

[p 
	"The warps were only usefull when they were used to skip pizza contests. It was surprisingly faster to just finish the level if it had no pizza contest at it's end. So, the run uses 2 warps only, the one at the circus and the one at the haunted mansion (both with wack'a mole stages). 
	$LF
	"On the whack'a mole stages, I hit the moles too because they deduct 2 seconds from the time count, ending the level sooner :)

	"The bug I exploit is to keep the extra horizontal speed of either the invincibility (capcom symbol!) or the black outfit powerups after they wear off. This is acomplished by not standing on the ground for longer than 1 frame (keep jumping, rabbit!).

	[li 
		"The enemy shows an animation of the hand passing through all his cards once, and then he starts the real card picking at the top row, first chosen column (1st or 2nd, depending on the 32 frame rule). This is a slow animation, so picking the top row cards is much faster. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"When the enemy says "the area champion goes first" you have to press "A" to continue. This is how we can control which exact card he will get, by delaying the A button. Every 2 frames delay, he will pick the next card, and so on, untill repeating in 16 frames. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"The only way to make him pick the card that is not in the chosen columns, is by making him pick a card that has already been picked in the chosen column. This way he will skip to the directly next card on the next column.

	"This produces some weird waits during levels, but it's for the greater good, believe me. With a pacifist run being over 4 minutes faster than previous submissions on a game that is mostly "walking to the right" anyone will notice that the secret is in the pizza battles.
