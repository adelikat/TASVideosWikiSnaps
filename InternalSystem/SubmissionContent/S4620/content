	"To get Lv.0 glitch to work, you need to get Maxim at least level 2 and not max hp 31. Then heal max hp and press left on music option in config screen. Save game, reset, load game - this way Lv.0 glitch is activated.

	"Next; to actually access limited event triggers in memory, you need to glitch Maxim again by healing him with 8 potion (or 7 potion, 1 charred newt - I'm not really sure 100% myself) then press left on music option in config screen again. This way whenever Maxim's name brings up, you can access 127 lines. Few of choices in dialog glitch is useful to sequence break to skip several parts of game, but most of them will be garbage, locks up game, or reset to title screen or load screen. So there are some place that Maxim's name comes up, and it works differently with different amount of characters you have, and different NPC triggers different event. Some you need to open menu, or open character status first to try some more event triggers in glitched dialog. This run attempts fastest known possible route to reach to credit roll.
