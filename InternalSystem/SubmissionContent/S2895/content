	"Motivated by Vampier's good ending run, I decided to make a bad ending run for fun. It turned out to be very difficult and not much fun at all.

	"If Rambo doesn't kill an enemy correctly, the next screen could be swarming with enemies. If he kills it correctly, it could have none at all. This only works in a couple of rooms.

	" Getting enemies to move in a certain direction
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"When Rambo is moving to the right, enemies will try to get in his way. By turning the opposite direction for one frame, the enemy will be tricked into thinking Rambo is going that way, and will move out of Rambo's way.
