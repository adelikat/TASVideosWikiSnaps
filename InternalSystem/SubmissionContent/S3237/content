	"New Super Mario Bros. was released in 2006 for the Nintendo DS. The story has been the same every time for the past 25 years: rescue some princess who can't defend for herself. So you're playing as this fat plumber, right? Because everybody else is too lazy to save her, it's up to this guy. Once again, he's gotta move through eight themed worlds to fight the evil king Bowser and save the princess. He really doesn't care about her, though - he's only in it for some cake afterward. (No point in doing it for fame anymore, anyway.)
	$LF
	"So he effortlessly skips almost every world and gets there without the need of some huge fungi, apparently exclusive to this story. Rushing through micro-sized, beating up some Bowser minions without a thought or care, and boosting around with a cool shell he found lying around, he does so without fail... well, almost.

After making some progress, we posted a WIP on TASVideos, and soon enough, we were all working to create this TAS. Regarding the level of optimization here, I'd say it's fairly nice, but I think it just needs that "push" to make it a run that will be very hard to beat.

In the room with the giant Thwomp, we tried a different strategy by revealing the switch from above and performing a wall jump after flipping the room (by storing a wall jump off of the wall right before it flips). The wall jump off of nothing looked cool; too bad it was slower.

[p 
	"In World 1-2, if we had more knowledge on catching walls and vertical wall jumping, a frame could probably be saved at the corner catch near the beginning by not holding back as much.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In World 5-3, 2 frames can be saved by using the Blue Shell trick for the first half of the level to stay higher than maximum running speed. This was found too late, however, and we were unable to edit the improvement in without also fixing the manipulation.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In World 5-Ghost House, we found other routes through the first room that were always ruined by the movement of the Broozers. They seem to be affected by how close you are to them. It is likely that we're missing certain paths through them to make them move in the desired way.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In World 8-Castle 1 and on, we are not sure if map manipulation is the fastest. We often counted how long timing takes by how many "flap" sounds the red ? block makes. However, when off-screen, no sounds are made. We thought this meant perfect manipulation, but we came across a few occurrences where we somehow saved more frames (even though there was no sound difference) that doubts this. (The transition in World 8-Tower 2 (after dying), however, is more likely a place we can save time, since there's a flap sound that plays there.)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"(?) There are a few extra lag frames throughout the run. We have no idea how to prevent these without simply waiting. From testing, gaining them seems to depend on the frame you enter levels. For example, in World 1-2, if we entered a frame later, we wouldn't get that extra lag frame. Changing luck would not eliminate it. So, if we were to save another frame earlier in the run, we may be able to avoid this lag frame.
