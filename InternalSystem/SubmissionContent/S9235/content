It comes with a graphical interface and the possibility to connect to Bizhawk via a Lua script. Then emulator states can be loaded into KuruBot, and conversely the input sequences found by KuruBot can be sent to the emulator in order to be played back. Since KuruBot was already introduced in the

In a no damage completion the level layout must be followed and is generally closer to a linear path than an open area. So a flooding-based heuristic which follows the level layout works well as a base cost map.
	$LF

Indeed the overwhelming size of the search space calls for clever ways to reduce the number of explored states with minimal impact on optimality. In other words depending on the level one must find the right balance between precision and time complexity. This process takes place in two stages.

Such a level decomposition typically revolves around the safe zones and the bottlenecks (i.e. the narrow portions where a waiting time is most likely inevitable). Ideally a segment should end right after a bottleneck in order to ensure the continuity with the following segment. And whenever possible it should begin right before a safe zone or a set of springs in order to explore the many rotation alternatives offered by these regions.

	[a href=https://github.com/E-Sh4rk/KururinTAS/releases rel=noopener external nofollow

[div class=p 
	"A bot config sets the base values of the main parameters like the reduction rates, the properties of the flooding-based cost map and whether you are allowed to take damage. I mainly used the “config_damageless_precise.ini” default file, sometimes with some adjustments on the additional reduction applied far from walls.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"A bot modifier can alter specific parameters without having to reload a bot config. For example by default KuruBot only considers inputs with the fastest speed, i.e. with both A and B pressed. So you can load the “allow_minimal_speed.ini” to also consider slower speeds, at the expense of increased running time and space. The files of the form “decrease_cost_map_k.ini” for some k were notably useful in levels filled with springs like Cave 2 and Star Land 3. Their role is to mitigate the impact of the flooding-based heuristic on the cost map. This results in a more width-oriented search, which is more prone to find the speed boosts coming from multiple spring interactions that KuruBot was not primarily designed around. However this had a significant impact on both the running time and RAM usage, so I recommend using these files sparingly.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Finally a gameplay config can set parameters outside the A* algorithm and its cost map like changing the Helirin size between Easy and Normal difficulty or enabling moving objects. From my experience the latter slows down the search by quite a lot, so it should only be used when necessary.

If no good parametrization can be found for some segment (i.e. either the proposed input sequence is too slow or the running time is too high for every parametrization) then the level segmenting must be reimagined. For example the concerned segment can be made smaller, notably with one less bottleneck, at the expense of another segment or the addition of a new one. Conversely if a solution was quickly found then some level segments can be merged with other ones, notably those with a safe zone in it, in the hope of finding faster transitions from one bottleneck to the next one. This process was particularly challenging in the Machine Land, Ghost Castle and Last Land levels.

	"In all seriousness there might be some lying dormant frames here and there, notably in levels filled with springs like Cave 2 or Star Land 3. But I do not expect any level to be improvable by more than a handful of frames. Several levels might look close to saving an extra frame. But most of the strategies used in this TAS are at least tight at a local level. So any frame gain is expected to require a significant overhaul in the level input sequence. Still this game has had a history of being deceptive in terms of optimization. We will see if future events will correct my guess.

	"Well, this TAS could have been made five years ago but it is finally here! The TAS itself took about one month to make and optimize, so around 150+ hours of work if I had to estimate. Of course this does not count my seven years of experience speedrunning this game, which included phases when I ran this exact category. With all this extra knowledge, I believe that taking this long to resume this 100% TAS project was actually beneficial.

	"I feel that this game is the perfect fit for a beginner TASer like me. It is short with very simple gameplay and zero RNG. It also runs very consistently, which allows me to consider each level independently from the others. Yet it still has a decent amount of depth in optimization. My next project TAS will be an IGT-focused “All levels” run and I expect to be surprised several more times by this game along the way.

This submission also beats all known real time records, sometimes by quite a bit, so I can say that optimization is on point. Nice work!
