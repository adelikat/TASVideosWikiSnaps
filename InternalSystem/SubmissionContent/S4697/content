	"This beats the last TAS by about 1:22 using a new route and a better rng manipulation to get to level 2. By the way a huge thanks to Ventuz and his TAS work. He had the last record using a slower route I made. I helped him with it so it's all cool, but this time I decided to learn how to do it myself heheh.

	"Depending of the current hp (not max) of the last member of the party, it will glitch his name and turn his level to 0. By itself it doesn't do much, but if you save then reload after a reset, your glitched character will have "random" stats. For my run, I need it to get high enough hp for the next glitch. By the way, the order the game considers the last position is in this order, depending of how many characters you have: 1-top left; 2-top right; 3-bottom left and 4-bottom right.

	"How to trigger it: First, your second byte of hp has to be between 128 and 255. Therefore any value between 128-255, 384-511, 640-767, etc. Then you need to do the level 0 glitch again, but only the config part. No need to save or reset this time. The really confusing part though, is that the config glitch doesn't work with every possible hp, which is why we need to get to level 2 in the first part, because it doesn't work from 0 to 20. In this run, I do it with 240 hp. I know 216 and 242 work too and many other that are hard to get with potions and charred newts.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"What it does: If I understand it correctly, it inserts the second byte of your hp value in your name. Since the game can only read ASCII from 0-127, anything higher will heavily corrupt it.

	"This is the part where it gets really complicated. To tell you the truth, I'm not even sure myself how it works. The only things I know are that whenever someone says your corrupted name, you are offered 128 triggers. They are not random and are dependent to which map you are in and how far you are in the game. It also changes if you open the menu or someone's status. Other than that, no matter what items or characters I have, it's always the same triggers.
