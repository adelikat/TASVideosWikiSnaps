	"The main improvement is a better strategy, and a better understanding on how the game works to make the blocks move fast. This movies goal isn't as novel as the other two NES Tetris movies, and clearing lines takes quite long. The pieces however spawn a lot faster than at the NES version, which makes the stacking of the blocks a lot faster than at the NES version. A lot faster too than the previous movie of this game by nico. The game keeps track of what time it played, and this actually seems the goal of this mode (completing it as fast as possible. The previous movie had an ingame time of '34', this movie has an ingame time of '28'.
