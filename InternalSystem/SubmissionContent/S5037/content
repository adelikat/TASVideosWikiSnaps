	"Mario Party Advance is a spin-off from the main series that follows quite a different format. There is one board that can only be played in single-player, and the goal is to complete 50 quests by visiting NPCs and doing what they ask. These quests include fetching items, answering questions, and playing mini-games. There's also a compulsory mini-game every 3 turns that rewards you with the most important item in this game: Mushrooms. Every turn costs you 1 Mushroom to move, and you start with 5 (reaching 0 results in a game over).

	"There are 5 kinds of spaces on the board, although only 2 are used in this run:

		" Yellow spaces are normal spaces. Landing on them ends your turn with no side effects.

	]li
	[li 
		" Red spaces end your turn and subtract 1 Mushroom from your total.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Blue spaces force a mini-game, allowing you to earn 2 extra Mushrooms.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Green spaces are the first good kind, as they let you roll again without using a Mushroom.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" And finally, location spaces are where you find NPCs and quests.

	"Mini-games show up every 3 turns, and can also be a quest objective. The ones that appear on the board every 3 turns work the same as they do in the main series: a roulette appears and randomly selects one from the list. Fortunately, this can manipulated through delaying text. I do this heavily throughout the run by waiting on confirmation boxes or releasing L to prevent text from advancing. Quest mini-games are set and will always be the same game.

	"A mechanic that is never shown in this run is the only board event. While moving between spaces, Koopa Kid can show up to "cause trouble". The more quests you have completed, the more likely he will appear. Koopa Kid has two super sweet pranks he can play:

[ul

		" Rochambeau (or rock-paper-scissors) is exactly what it sounds like - you select rock, paper, or scissors and he does the same. If you win, he leaves and you end up with a bunch of wasted time. If you lose, Bowser drops a big ol' rock on Koopa Kid, blocking you from continuing on in that direction.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Warp Time is also exactly what it sounds like - Koopa Kid will call on Bowser, and Bowser will call on a lava geyser to shoot you into the air, causing you to fly to a random space anywhere on the board. I spent a lot of time trying to manipulate this, but in the few places I could get an advantageous space it was still slower than regular movement.

	"The final 9 quests of the game all belong to Bowser, and they all require beating a mini-game along with some other, easier request. 6 of these mini-games pit you against a number of Koopa Kids between 1 and 99. At least, they do in free play mode. The story versions of these mini-games set the bounds at 30 and 50, presumably to set a challenge without making it ridiculous. A roulette appears to decide how many you will face, and it is easily manipulated. 30 appears early enough in each situation that it is the best option every time.

However, the run did start to get stale as it went on from an entertainment point of view. The audience seems to have mixed opinions on the run, but I felt it was entertaining for the type of game it is. With that in mind, I'm accepting this to Vault. Good job Nacho!
