	"Alright, so the issue here turned out to be surprisingly simple. The movie as originally submitted would sync in its expected framerate (estimated by feos to be 100fps) with the same framecount and inputs. However, since both the original environment and the emulator used for it technically work under arbitrarily high clockspeeds, the movie was submitted with the highest possible framerate the emulator would support.

	"This poses an interesting question for us: for as much as this is the game running on an unintended setup, it also is not abusing any "errors". The game works exactly like it would, just in a much faster way. Is this acceptable?

	"We as judges understand that we know less about any given game than whoever is submitting those games to us. This is natural: when one makes a movie, they obtain a familiarity with the game that not all judges will have. As such, we expect you as the author to be able to justify any creative choices made in the production of your movie. And while we can agree or at least concede most decisions, this is one where a line is drawn. If a movie file with identical frames and inputs would sync at the most natural framerate instead of the submitted one, and the high framerate is providing no unique gameplay advantage, it will not be accepted as a valid reason to bump up the framerate.
