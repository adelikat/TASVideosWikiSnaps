There is some strategy required here in figuring out how to complete the game as fast as possible, since you can't just throw strikes the whole time, and the input for throwing a strike is not always the same. Getting a maximum score coincides with fastest completion, since getting a blackjack lets you throw only 2 balls per frame instead of 3. Accepting!
