The effect of tilting the nose of the podracer down is that the podracer loses some handling (turning), but gains a bit of acceleration and charges the boost meter. Holding nose up causes the podracer to slow down while on the ground, and to reduce falling rate while in the air.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Tilting left and right has a more immediately obvious effect since the podracer physically flips onto a side. Tilting left or right also reduces the podracer's turning radius, but also reduces the effect of slopes on the podracer's speed, and increases the amount of "launch" a podracer gets from a ramp. It also physically reduces the width of the podracer, which allows for cutting corners more closely and fitting through narrow passageways.

[div class=p 
	[em

	" handles differently from most other racing games when it comes to "racing lines," or the general lines you want to follow to traverse a course most optimally. Podracers do not lose their ability to turn as they gain speed, and they do not lose speed as they are turning. This means that traditional concerns like turn apices and large turn radii to maintain speed are not necessary in 
	[em 
		"Racer
	]em
	". That is not to say that it isn't useful to sometimes take a turn wide in this game (this is still necessary when you can not turn fast enough to safely take a turn while boosting, for instance), but viewers with a knowledge of racing lines might find the pathing in this TAS strange.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Given that turning and speed are disconnected in this game, racing lines in this game simply take the form of the shortest path between points. A way to visualize this is to imagine a red thread that is running through the course and pulled taught. The thread will form a straight line between corners, and wrap around the inner curve of turns. For a theoretical podracer with perfect handling, following this thread exactly would always be optimal. Another consequence of this disconnect is that braking is extremely rarely used in speedruns of the game except in cases where speed is so great that podracers can not turn quickly enough to take a turn safely.

	[em 
		"Racer
	]em
	"'s slide mechanic does not work quite the same though. In this game, holding the slide button causes the podracer's traction value to be cut in half. The practical effect this has on the handling of the podracer is that it allows the player to start "pre-turning" for a turn that is coming up, sooner than would otherwise be possible. Since traction is significantly reduced, the podracer starts to turn in a direction, but the podracer does not actually adjust to the turning as strongly as it would otherwise.
	$LF

[div class=p

	"After reaching a certain threshold speed, a green dot will light up on the speedometer. The player can then hold nose-down, and a meter will fill up on the speedometer over 1 second. When the meter fills, the dot changes to yellow, and by releasing the accelerator button and holding it again, the player will activate boost. During boost, the player will gain an enormous amount of speed, quickly at first, and more slowly the longer the player holds the boost. While this is happening, the player's engines will start to heat up. When the engines get hot enough, a warning beeping will start playing, and if the player continues holding the boost, an engine will catch fire.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"One of the most important facets of speedrunning this game is avoiding "underheating" or allowing your engines to completely cool off and not boosting. Podracers' engines all heat up and cool off at different rates, but the maximum amount of "heat" each podracer can store at a given time is 100. If heat is sitting at 100, then the player is wasting this resource since it can not increase further. Every attempt needs to be made to always be boosting enough that engine heat never reaches 100.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Another aspect of boosting very important to speedrunning is to try to keep boosts as long as possible.

The shop works like you might expect - a variety of upgrades with tiers appropriate to your progress through tournament mode are available at 100% health/quality for a set price. Watto's junkyard is a luck-based shop however. In Watto's junkyard, one upgrade of each type with a random health/quality value between 40% and 90% is strewn about. There are no restrictions on the tiers of upgrades that can show up here, so you can see the highest tier upgrades appear at the very start of the game. Pit droids play a part here - after you buy a very damaged part from Watto and win a race with it, your Pit Droids will repair it to maximum health (if you drove well!), meaning you can then trade it in to Watto at full price, which can yield a

By combining these two sources of entropy for the RNG, we can make insanely unlikely parts show up in the junkyard that allow us to get way, WAY ahead of the upgrade curve.

	"The game was originally released on the PC and the N64 in 1999, and ported to the Mac and Dreamcast a year later. There was even a Podracer arcade game that featured actual podracer controls like Anakin had in the movie! Recently, the game was re-released on Switch, XBox One, and PS4. The two most popular versions of the game are the original PC and N64 versions, with the PC version being the most popular in the speedrunning community. The N64 version is limited in comparison to the PC version in many aesthetic ways but also in a few important ways that affect the timing of this TAS:
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		" Space restrictions of the N64's cartridge format means that the following features are missing:
		$LF

			]li
			[li 
				" No pre-course pre-rendered cutscenes that introduce the planet/environment.

				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				" No pre-race taunts/banter.

		$LF
		[ul

				" Longer load times

			[li 
				" The game runs at 24fps, which affects the physics of the game significantly.
				$LF
			]li
		]ul
	]li
]ul
[div class=p 
	"This game's physics are tied directly to the framerate that the game is running at, and the PC version can run at 60fps. The effects of the lower framerate of the N64 are lower gravity, lower traction, reduced wall-climbing ability, and other effects. See 
	[a href=https://www.speedrun.com/swe1r/guide/3mfsv rel=noopener external nofollow 
		"https://www.speedrun.com/swe1r/guide/3mfsv
	]a
	" for more details on all of the differences. A lower framerate means the N64 version has lower traction across all racers, which isn't necessarily a negative since lower traction makes sliding more powerful. However, lower traction and lower gravity combined also means that it's much harder to keep a boost going since small bumps often give you enough of a bounce to damage you when you land.

Given that Elan Mak's pod has these stats, it might be surprising to find out that the track he was chosen for, Grabvine Gateway (GVG), is largely considered the hardest track in the game for speed demon podracers, with some of the most sinuous and punishing switchbacks/hairpins the game has to offer.

Second, though GVG punishes Elan Mak's pod's handling quite severely in some sections, other sections of the course reward it in equal measure. The long downhill spiral section of this map allows Elan to boost for almost the entirety of his tank, which gets us to over 1000 speed during that section.

On the left is a hill that you are not supposed to be climbing, but by doing so, you can clip yourself out of the course and get lined up to land directly in the canyon switchback section further into the course.

By then lining up so that you hit the outside of the catwalk section you can bounce your podracer along the outside of the track, skipping the entire catwalk section.

Another enclosed catwalk section leads to the final jumps of each lap, but you can launch off of a tunnel exit leading up to that enclosed section and instead land on top of it. The edges of the enclosure act as fast terrain, so I ride the edges as long as possible. By approaching and hitting the edges of the roof of the enclosure just right, you can also bounce off of the path and cut the corners as a shortcut. The extents to which I did this in the TAS are extreme and consist of cutting an entire segment of this section out of the course rather than just clipping the corners. The last lap is especially egregious in this regard since I am now free to spend all of my boost before the finish line, and I use it to bounce especially hard on the catwalk and fly all the way to the end of it in a single go.

Launching out of the course at this point lines you up naturally for a straight shot to the end of a long, twisting canyon section, and saves an enormous amount of time. Actually re-entering the canyon is very dangerous and you can explode while doing so very easily.

There is a trick that RTA runners use involving cutting boost at a strategic time to trick the Raiders into placing their shots much further ahead than they would normally, thus eliminating the hazard for the player.
