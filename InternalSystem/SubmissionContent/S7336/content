	"Hello there! This is my fourth tas submission and my third GBA submission. This is a very short tas but I figured it was interesting enough to do. With the the major trick in the run, you can do a credits warp. I'm not exactly sure why this happens or how to explain it but see for yourself. The rules of this run are that the timer starts when you select "New Game" on the menu and ends when the final text box appears before the credits. I also have the language set to Norsk because it is the shortest text out of the twelve languages you can choose from. To make it a little easier for you to know where to start and end the timer, the timer begins when I press "Nytt spill" on the menu (I guess that's Norsk for "New game") and the timer ends when the text box that says, "...til det gikk opp for dem at 60 poeng ikke var nok til a gi dem ladelsen. Husokalen ville likvel ga til Smygard." I put it in google translate and it says, "... until they realized that 60 points was not enough to give them the charge. Husokalen would like to go to Slytherin." It's obviously not exactly what it means, but it's not that important anyway. My recording goes through the credits.
