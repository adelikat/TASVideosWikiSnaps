	"For the first part, I use the charged fire weapon against him, which spreads out five projectiles in a fan pattern. I manage to hit the boss twice with each charged attack. (A charged weapon hit does 3 damage, and the final boss' first phase has 30 HP total). This way, I deplete his health quite quickly. When the boss is down to 3 health, I switch to the ice weapon in order to set up a trick for the final boss' second phase. I fire a charged ice weapon at him, defeating the first form.

	"Right after the first form is defeated, I release a charged ice weapon (which is basically charged Frost Shield from Mega Man X3) and end input. I abuse a glitch here, where on the first frame of the final boss' second form, he can be hit, although his hitpoints and hitbox position aren't reinitialized yet. So on this first frame, the ice weapon hits him at his hitbox (which is exactly where the first phase died) and instantly kills him. Then
