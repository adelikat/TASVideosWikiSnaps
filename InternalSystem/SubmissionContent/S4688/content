	"Resident Evil 2 story takes place two months after the events of the first game, Resident Evil. It is set in Raccoon City, an American community whose residents have been transformed into zombies by the T-virus, a biological weapon developed by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella. In their escape from the city, the two protagonists, Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield, encounter other survivors, and are confronted by William Birkin, the mutated creator of the even more powerful G-virus.

	", which also aims to clear that category ("Leon A") as fast as possible. Due to how the game works, however, doing different actions in the A scenario results in different things happening in the B scenario, which means that for an optimized B run certain actions are required in the A run, such as getting the Cord and using it on the east side of the police station, which the Leon A run doesn't do. As such, this run is suboptimal for this category. A save file/verification movie for the B run should be a separate A run that focuses on being optimized for the B run, and not be a speedrun in itself. Other improvements have also been listed in the submission discussion. Rejecting due to suboptimality.

	"Regarding categories: since real-time records have separate runs for Leon A, Leon B, Claire A and Claire B, it makes sense to run these individually as TASes as well (with optimized SRAM for the B scenarios). A run that combines an A and B scenario may also be acceptable, but would have to be submitted as a single run and is likely not preferred.
