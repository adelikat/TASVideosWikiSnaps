At this point Phalanx (the antagonist) sees an opportunity and decides to jump Firebrand and steal all his Crests. Phalanx Dumps Firebrands battered body in a Colosseum with a zombie dragon and heads off to cackle about how awesome he is and to unleash ultimate evil power using the Crests.

	"This run has been some 4 years in the making. I originally started circa 2011, when SNES 9x 1.43 rr was still accepted. At the time I produced a ~1,500 frame  improvement to the currently published run. Due  to extenuating circumstance I never got around to submitting the run. Fast Forward . . to ~january 2015: I'm casually watching Speed Runs/TAS movies and I stumble upon an RTA World  Record of Demon's Crest by BroedgeMan and he's  doing some cool tricks to save time. I'm immediately inspired and decide to get back to the grind So I head over to TAS vids. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"To my dismay,  SNES 9x 1.43 is deprecated and all the work I'd already done was basically worthless. Around this time the new MMX 100% run was published and seeing it was completed on BizHawk I decide to check out the new emulator. My computer is seemingly unable to operate BizHawk above ~20 fps. At this time I get on IRC and Chat with Adelikat and a few others about my options. MasterJun scolds me into shape and I resolve to start from scratch using Bizhawk.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I immediately wip up a rough draft of stage 1 and get the boss to synch up perfectly. I went back to polish up the first segment and I was able to save 5 frames. Unfortunately, the Boss fell out of synch and now created 20 frames of lag. I tried tons of things to make the boss behave better but eventually (2 weeks later) I learned  something: "Frame Perfect is not always optimal"
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"With a new mantra I head to stage II, where I have a similarly time consuming perfectionist bout against the eye ball boss. Fast forward to .. . .~2 weeks ago.I've given up trying to improve this boss and proceed to churn out the next 100,000 frames. in about as much time as the first 28,000.

Unfortunately, I could not crack the code and decided to move forward like this. However, I am able to take  down The big eye himself in 6 hits vs. the currently published 7 so not all was lost.
