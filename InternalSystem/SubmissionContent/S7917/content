	"The game features snowmobiles (referred to as sleds), stunts and fourteen snow-covered courses consisting of slippery slopes, inclement weather and treacherous cliffs. Six racers were selectable from the outset and two more were unlockable, each of which had different snowmobile handling attributes.

	"The game has purchasable upgrades for the riders' snowmobiles which can improve handling, acceleration, and more. A trick feature may be performed by using two shoulder buttons in combination with the direction pad. The combination of buttons used determines what trick is performed. It is also possible to multi-combo on higher jumps to gain an even higher score. After completing the Open Mountain Championship, the player can unlock the Storm Sled, which is a thin, quick and agile sled capable of outracing even the fastest standard sleds.

After checking out the Speedrun Leaderboard for Sled Storm, i saw Gawrit's name and to my surprise, he did a lot of work finding Glitches, Skips, Tricks and whatnot. I was in shock when he showed me what was possible.

I was also wondering what it would possibly look like, as there are endless possibilities to make the game look great. This was before i had actual knowledge of TASing and how to make a TAS entertaining.
	$LF
	"I TAS'ed every Open Mountain Level so me and Gawrit were able to see how much time you could possibly shave off.

	"Lap 2: I crash off to the right side which teleports me further into the track. I turn around and get to the slope before jumping down again. If you were to jump down earlier Nadia will instantly faint because of the death zone. I come down and go for a submarine to go below the checkpoint and have the lap count. My initial plan was to crash off to the left side and respawn before the finish line, so this submarine was a nice find.

	"Lap 3: Instead of going into the cave shortcut i go to the right to perform another very hard trick, the Leap of Faith. Very well deserving of its name, this trick can be done RTA but with just a 50% success rate. Lost Peak is the last track in the speedrun and having to perform Leap of Faith 3 times in a row sure gets your heart pumping, and Gawrit will agree on that.

	"With the poor acceleration of the Cheat Sled i had to somehow make it across the ravine. After what felt like 5000 Rerecords i decided to give up as Nadia barely makes it across and still falls down into the ravine. So i just teleported to the other side with the skip but it still felt wrong to do it this way and after some time i decided to go back to it and try again.

[div class=p 
	"I found a way to make it across, this involved me going a little further in the Backup, as i needed more room and time to accelerate. By slowly jumping off of the slope before the Backup, i snake/submarine a little into the slope just enough to boost me across, i was more than happy that i made it. It was the most frustrating part of the TAS.

	"Making a TAS of this game has been a big goal of mine, i want everyone to see how awesome this game really is with this Demonstration. Im also glad to have worked with Gawrit, what you see here is a work of only one person, and that is Gawrit. He helped by finding basically everything in this TAS.

	"The TAS also made me think with how i could possibly improve it, the answer to that does not exist. It is up to you the TAS'er to decide how much effort you put into your TAS'es. The amount of effort i put into this TAS was enough to me, there may be some parts i want to look different, but this is just how it is sometimes. I made sure to not repeat movement too many times and i made sure i gave every track a unique Trick or Glitch. I also managed to put every trick in the game.

[div class=p 
	"Again, all the credit goes to Gawrit, without him this TAS would not exist and i really am happy it turned out the way it did. There were a lot of fun moments like the possession of Jay or the signboosts which are just crazy to me. There may be a time where i would like to do another TAS of this but with very different movement, or more twists. The game is just that crazy.

	": And now for the a run that has it all: Ridiculous speed tricks, amazing glitches, and even a dancing bear. This is one of the most outstanding examples of a playaround I've seen in quite a long time, every track feels as fresh as the snow covering it. What really amazes me is just how much mileage each glitch gives over the course of the run: The submarines and wall rides in particular always seem to lead to more incredible things every time they're used, so they never feel stale or overused. On top of all that, there isn't a single moment of downtime over the course of the run whatsoever. Even the stuff that relies on the CPU riders doesn't require any waiting, it almost feels as though they're collaborating with the playaround by showing up precisely when needed and giving a lot more variety to a run already full of it to begin with.
