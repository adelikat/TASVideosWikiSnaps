	"Warning: don't try to TAS this game, it's was stressful getting a lot of desyncs around the run and this game was a desync machine. So it's my tip go to Hyper Street Fighter II if you want TASing this one. Well you was already warned.

	"It took about 4 months working against desyncs, just look at the top from this submission and the records too (82k).
	$LF
	"Maybe someone ask "If this game has a lot of desyncs which will broken your minds why this game choice?". Well my idea was start a run from Hyper Street Fighter II a similar game with little differences as the fighters choices, Hyper Street Fighter II is an Anniversary Collection game which allow you to choose the fighters from the old series. But the point is: most of glitches and some tricks just work on this game Super Street Fighter 2 X so the game call us to fight against him.
	$LF
	"This game and emulators have a lot of desyncs troubles by many things: character choice, CPU fighters and maybe your computer configurations, so basically you probably can't TAS this game without 1 desync per round.
	$LF
	"The glitches, combination tricks and combos was easy since me and SDR was already working on this game sometime and the combos from Hyper Street Fighter II to SSF2X don't change, maybe the most difficult part was at the start discovering new things while comboing whith Guile showing your sonic boom combos which I will talk more below.

		"3/4 Sonic Booms in a row
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"Well this trick was really easy when you discover how he works also discovered by sonichurricane members, you will see a lot of Sonic booms combos with Guile and sometimes you will saw some 3/4 sonic booms, to do this you need to do accuracy charge time, in other words you need to unload the charge (sonic boom) most fast possible to start charging another sonic boom, get the message? You just need to unload the charge to shoot another, unloading more fast will allow to get more charge so it's possible to do 4 sonic booms also needs a perfect frame control.

		"Zangief Head Stun
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"It's a cool dizzy trick to do while you are TAS'ing and probably essential in a real match, if you do up+mp or hp while the enemy was trying to hit you in air you can use this method to protect from the attack, if you do it as first attack the character will be confused instantly.
	$LF

[ul 
	[li 
		"Zangief Magic FAB
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"I can define this glitch with two words: Wrong Throw. Basically this glitch consists in a wrong hitbox which Zangief perform your backwards without need grab the enemy, maybe Zangief are one of the most OP characters from this game, the effect was just amazing and it works with all characters, you can hit Zangief during the effect but we choose to see the full effect until knocked down.

		"Zangief TAPs
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"A exclusive combo according to SDR, can be done in all Street Fighter Series (Alpha/Zero included), if you throw your enemy with Zangief you can perform some Tap combos you just need to hit the buttons medium, low and heavy punches constantly while throw to Zangief start getting more damage, sadly you can't do more than 80% but still a great stuff.

		"Ken Reversal Kicks
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"Another cool trick which allow Ken pass through the opponent hitting in the right frame making a zig-zag combo. To do it just need to stay down and wait for Ken crazy kick: foward, down medium kick+ mk again.

		"Ken/Sagat Special Reversal
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"If you look at 2nd round against Chun-li you will saw in some part of the run Ken doing some reversal kicks until Chun-li fall, this glitch is called Special Reversal can be done by Ken, Sagat and Dhalsim, has no secret to do, just do a reversal attack by Ken Shouryuu Reppa (forward, down, foward+down 3 punches), Ken will perform an bizarre air hurricane kick. Now doing Tiger Genocide (same sequence of Shouryuu Reppa) Sagat will spam your tigger shots and a strange effect occour when Ken take a hit, Sagat will continue spamming and the projectiles will pass through the Ken a strange effect.

		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"Well I don't need to describe anything about this part, your initial idea was set up to bring 1 round against CPU but this game didn't allow this, the only exclusive thing about Akuma/Gouki is that he can't do more than 9 hits on any character, if you try that the character will dizzy instantly, 10 hits are allowed only for Sagat, why? we don't know occouyet.

	": Finally, so nice to see a proper Super Street Fighter 2 series playaround TAS which did not disappoint, Sheng Long would be so proud! I find the use of reset in the middle to undo fights somewhat questionable, but as a playaround, I'll allow it. Audience feedback was mostly positive. I also find this game to be similar enough to the original Super Street Fighter 2, despite the new secret player and other minor improvements to the game play. I am very
