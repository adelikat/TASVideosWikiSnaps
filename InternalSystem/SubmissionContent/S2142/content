	"This is a speed run of Golden Axe Warrior on the Sega Master System in 46 minuits and 06 seconds. I took no damage anywhere in the game, and also abused a programing error to allow me to defeat a couple of the bosses quicker. For those unfamiliar with the game, it was Sega's attempt at an Action RPG and they heavily plagiarized the original Zelda game from the NES. Although it's a knock off Zelda game it is still very enjoyable to play and watch :)

	"<I avoided many of the overworld tasks that were not necessary to complete the game, such as magic, the only magic aquired was the earth magic as it is needed in a few dungeons. I also avoided upgrading Armour, weapons and shields as this was a waste of time, the only weapons I aquired were the Battle Axe and the Golden Axe and both of these are dungeon treasures. When it came to the enemys I avoided them all on the overworld and only fought those that were needed to be defeated in order to open a door or create a bridge in dungeon rooms. On a few of the bosses I abused a programing error to defeat them faster, when you enter a boss room in the dungeons and you are still in the doorway unless you move forward you cannot take damage but you can still attack from this spot, this allows you to take no damage at some bosses and defeat them much faster.>

	"<The first few bosses could be done a bit neater, I didnt quite grasp how to fully manipulate luck in the first two dungeons. Also I had some thoughts on how to achive a faster time, you can do a lot of overworld trecking
	$LF
	"away from the main route of the game to aquire thunder magic, with thunder magic you can aquire the flame sword which is more powerfull than the battle axe so would help you kill enemy's quicker, I came to the conclusion though
	$LF
	"that the time spent trecking to aquire the more powerfull weapon would actually slow down the speed of the run so I kept my Battle Bxe untill the Golden Axe was aquired. If anyone attempts to improove this run it may be
	$LF
	"worth checking out the other weapons.>
