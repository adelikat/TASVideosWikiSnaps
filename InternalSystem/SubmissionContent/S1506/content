	$LF
	"This movie makes extensive use of programming glitches to regain control faster than is normally possible, and help maintain full speed as much as possible. This movie manipulates luck to prevent bosses from using their longer attacks. This movie takes damage to save time, and ignores bonus-stages. This movie takes a small amount of time in several places to perform additional tricks, most notably, getting the maximum height bonus at the end of every round. This costs some time, but makes for a much more entertaining run.

	$LF
	"The only relevant difference between hard mode and super mode is that in Super Mode, it is impossible to have more than one hit point. As a result, the only difference for playing on Super Mode would be a few added periods of standing around, waiting.

	"This movie contains speed/entertainment tradeoffs. In many places, I took a more entertaining approach even when it was a few frames slower. For instance, the first miniboss can be defeated 12 frames sooner if I land inbetween the first and second hits and most levels can be completed several seconds faster by completely ignoring the poles at the end, or using them for a quick horizontal speed boost.
