	"This is the GBA version of the SNES version of the game. 1 stage was added to each level, which makes the run a little more lengthy than the SNES TAS. In addition, lag is reduced to a minimum and when it comes to physics, level design, or boss fights, everything remained the same. Most levels are faster here than in the SNES run, due to the fact that more ammunition (apples) were grabbed along the way.

	"As for the run, this looks really good. From the very start, you are slowly getting ahead of the WR holder, this run 
	(youtube|v=E1-q5qt2gv4)
	".  From what I understand of all the speed-running techniques, everything is being utilized here and makes for a very fast TAS. Congratulations!
