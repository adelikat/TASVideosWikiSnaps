	"Omicron is a game which creates a universe full of hostile aliens. To play and win, you must survive 16 waves of 15 enemies each. This is anything but an easy task-you'll be facing some of the deadliest and fastest creatures ever to visit the screen of your computer.

	"Its my continuation of TASing games from my all-time favorite magazine, Compute's Gazette. This makes my 7th TAS from this series. Additionally, this game has some hard physics to overcome. It was one of my top favorites, as I even play this game still today! As usual, I want to see quick work of this game. In fact, I never knew that this game had an end. I think my best effort was making it to about round 12 or 13.

As with all the games I've TASed, there is always an increase of knowledge on the physics and strategies as you progress through. So, my normal practice is to re-TAS the game a 2nd time...trying to beat every level.
