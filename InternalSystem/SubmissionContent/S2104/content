	"Freeon-Leeon and Gil battles were probably hardest to optimize because the ball needs to be thrown from right position so you can get it again fast and keep it close to boss so you can hit him as fast as possible you can pick ball again after 48 frames has passed from the throw.
	$LF
	"You may notice the boss wont blink all the time which i think is impossible to do there is always one or two thorws where you need to sacrifice few frames, if i just try throw always fast as possible the ball will go too far and it will lose even more frames.

	"Second phase is pretty annoying because you need to wait him to come back down before you can hit him only last hit needs to be done fast if the boss would blink 5-10 frames less it would be possible to do this faster.
