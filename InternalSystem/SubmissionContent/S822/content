	"This movie is 6m and 42s slower than Walker Boh's movie because it plays every level of the game. I do a lot of tricks that Walker Boh did in his movie, but I use a lot of new tricks too that saved some time. I collect 6 cards on every world to get to the secret world 7 called "Ronald's Puzzleworld".

	"It's almost impossible to make a fast 100% run of this game, collecting under 100 archs. If you collect 100 archs, you go to a bonus stage. I have to go to a bonus stage on level 5 in world 3. On level 4 in world 5 I have to collect one extra heart because I need that in the later levels.
