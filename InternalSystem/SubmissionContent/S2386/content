	"On the other hand, these weapons consume ammo fast. There are powerups which refill ammo and raise max capacity, but they cost some time to get, so they had to be minimized. Weapons recharge on their own only after they haven't been selected for a while. A depleted weapon fires a pathetic fizzle known as zero force, which is one of the few ways to damage the final boss.

	"Life saver #2 is the "zero teleport", which is more of a dash than a teleport. It is several times as fast as the maximum scroll speed. Epsilon is invulnerable and can pick up items, but has no control of how far it goes or when it stops. If at full health, it does a phoenix attack which does massive damage and destroys bullets. However, it burns off 50 HP so it must be used carefully. Most boss strategies rely on this move, but it's avoided during the stages because it causes slow-motion whenever it hits anything.

	"We want to keep the number of teleports (no damage) down. For this reason, boomerang/rocket fists are good. They keep the boss occupied for a long while so we can pepper her with lances. Since the boomerang, knees, shoulder guards and some other junk block lances turning around is used to adjust the trajectory of the lances.
	$LF

[h4 
	" Medusa Force
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Has no weak point, and everything does 30% damage. To make up for is you are given plenty of refills for phoenix. There is also an ammo upgrade which is very helpful. You can kill the boss slightly faster by not ending with full life, but that slows down the next form.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There are some weird rules for when this boss starts to be vulnerable. From the start, it does slow backwards turns until it reaches the right end of the screen, when the fight starts.
	$LF

[h4 
	" Sylpheed Force
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This boss usually blocks all your shots with her arms, unless she is in the middle of an attack. Fortunately she has pretty long arms. 
	$LF

	" Artemis Force
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Unlike all the other forces, the weak point is not the center ball, but the tail.

	" Sirene Force
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This boss is also known as Washing machine force. The current of the water moves you in a circle.
	$LF
	"It is possible to get refills from the bombs, but since we're underwater the phoenix cannot be used... so it's just lancer all the way. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"We end this battle with 2 (two) lancer ammo. How is that for planning? 
	$LF

[h3 
	"21 - Destroyer Prototype
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"We had some pretty crappy luck with the asteroids, but finally one of them gave a big health for the boss.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The boss moves around erratically and twirls its arms, which block lancer shots. The attack where the boss goes crazy and starts spewing debris in all directions is the only one which you can refill health on, so it is naturally the one we choose.
	$LF

[h3 
	"22 - Shield Viper
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Strategy courtesy of Mysterious Japanese Player. The stage does not end until all the parts have exited the screen.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"23 - Wolfgunblood Garopa
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This is a strategy taken from Mr Monkey Man, except that he uses the lancer instead of the flame in the start of the battle.  The flame is only marginally faster. As you can see, the hit detection is very interesting.
	$LF

[h3 
	"24 - Missiray
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"There is a safe spot where the lasers and missiles cannot hit you, but it is better to go as close to the boss as possible, even if it means some extra trouble.
	$LF

	"25 - Z-Leo
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The final boss cannot be hurt by your standard weapons, you have to volley his own projectiles back at him. Phoenix also works, and curiously Counter Force and Zero Force.

[p 
	"I started this project in *gulp* end of 2005. It has been on hold several times, and restarted once when Dammit joined and found the lancer switch trick. It feels very nice that it is finally done.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Dammit recorded most of the movie. Most of the playing around is his. Also he is very good at reducing lag. He is more or less the reason that this finally got done. My part in this has mostly been supplying strategies, and chop off a few frames here and there when I could.
	$LF

[h3 
	" Dammit:
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"I forget why I decided to TAS this, but I didn't hesitate to consult Truncated, who served as my eagle eye. He knew about all the existing work and strategies, which freed me to concentrate on the task of recording. He also found numerous corrections and improvements. Thanks to the 9 hour time difference and the fact that we think rather too alike, two heads were somewhat slower than one. However, the quality is worth it.
