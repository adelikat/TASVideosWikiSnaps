	"This movie is highly improvable.  Currently Baxter is working on a warped run.  In the comparable levels, there is over 30 seconds of improvements made so far compared to this run.

	"Also, most have expressed a preference for a warped run and find this full run much more boring without showing off any additional features of the game.

	"The fact that it is improvable and a poor goal choice leads me to reject this movie.
