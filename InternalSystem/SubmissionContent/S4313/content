	"All the bosses have their level, when fight to him, a high level will give them more HP. Boss’s level depends on each character’s rank and how many hours passed. When you play in each stage, no matter death or not, if you don’t continue or finish a stage, time will pass an hour. After finishing a stage, your character will get a rank. Only 8 bosses have their additional chips, and are equal or greater than 8 levels, if you defeat such a boss, you can obtain not only a life up or energy up item, but also an additional chip.

	"In the first half of this chapter, Angerfist & Atma played so good that we nearly can’t make better, but they made mistake in the gate of the first chapter. Break the gate; finish your action, only to finish this to case we can go to the next chapter. Angerfist & Atma didn’t notice that so they waste some frames. In the second chapter, we used the way of Bernka’s PSX Mega Man X5 "max item collection" in 54:33.68 to pass the lava place by armor. In such a situation, we saved 54 frames and 16 frames in boss fight.

So we can save 18 frames in the stages and save 1 frame in boss fight. By the way, we had to waste some frames when get off the track because we think only in special place can detonate by contact the ram. It made us angry.

But, we tried our best to improve its pleasing to eves.

	"Although it’s really a hard stage, but Bernka is so powerful that this stage seem too easy in his hands. He finished the bike part in a high speed without taking any bullet. Then, in the normal part, we used bug to save time and bruised many times to lower the rank so that make the next boss HP down. So we save 117 frames in the stages. In the boss fight, we control the boss’ way of move and we saved 59 frames in boss fight.

If we had equipped Z-Saber Plus before the stage, we should equip Z-Saber Extend after this stage. So we will waste more frames. In the situation, we decided to fight Dynamo without Z-Saber Plus. For the long term, we had to waste 29 frames than Angerfist & Atma in this stage.

We control the eye in the below of the ball, instead of the foot because we had equipped the Z-Saber Extend. In this way we can beat it in first time. So we can have 38 frames better then Angerfist & Atma.

Just like we said, more time we use, more level the boss are, the more HP will have, plus the boss are always move, so we decided to fight this boss early to save more time. After we finished this stage, the data proved that we are correct. Only in the boss fight we already saved 85 frames. Fortunately, we had also saved 22 frames before boss fight.

But we also found two places (in the first and second elevator) that can be saved 67 frames. In the boss stage, Angerfist & Atma used C-Flasher as the final hit but it waste so much frames. Because this, they help us earned 30 frames.

It’s really a nightmare. Although it had been finished now, every time I look back upon the process I also feel pain of my big toe. Because we equipped the Z-Saber Extend, we can better to control the distance. We also spent much time to manipulate, so we won 476 frames in the boss rush.

		"Shuy_: The process of making this movie is really hard for me. But it’s not the most important. As a freshman of TAS, I don’t have much experience. So Bernka helped me in many places. I do really thank him very much. During the cooperation with Bernka, I learnt a lot. I think this movie is wonderful, but it doesn’t mean the best. I really want to know more TASer of Mega Man X Ver. I hope someone will break our record.

Also I am very happy to work with Shuy_, as a newbie he never gives up, sometime was lose than the current run but he will redo that until ahead. Some new tricks that I never expect are found by him, which is what I am surprised about him. I hope we can work together again.
