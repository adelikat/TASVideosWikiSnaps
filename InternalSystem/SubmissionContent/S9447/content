	"This achieves max score in survival mode 9999, I redid the start to do a lot of unscaled damage combos and at the end i made up for the points by doing longer combos and doing shun goku satsu right after for extra 30 hits. This should please your highness judges. We only get the high score at the very end.

	"Chain combos from EX groove delay stun so they're used to avoid stunning earlier, yuo cannot stun twice in the same combo, so i save it for later so i can use 33hits super more often. For speed, the best super is Misogi, the heavens palm strike. Weaker chars get stunned earlier and the health points are also varied between chars which contributes to the different combo choice in each match.

	"EX groove was with C meter for ease of meter building and flexibility with level 1 2 and 3 supers, so i can do more super finishers and build points faster

	"surprinsingly, because of the different bodies characters have, more combos were used so we could control stun gauge and damage for longer, so it wasn't taht repetitive.
