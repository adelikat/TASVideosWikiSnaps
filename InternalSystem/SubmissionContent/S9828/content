		"Platform clip : When jumping up into a platform, Alice can clips upwards into the platform, gaining some height, sometimes even making the jump into taht platform even possible. When this happens, Alice doesn't land in the platform, so depending on the situation it may be better to avoid this to start a jump chain earlier.

		"Jump glitch : It's possible to chain multiple one-frame jumps midair, 4 jumps max. This works on chains of 4, if you do a 1 frame jump, then the next jump chain can only be of 3 jumps max, so if you need a 4 jump chain its neccesary to do some extra jumps before.
