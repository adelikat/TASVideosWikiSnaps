	"For the BLJ into BitDW, we used the JRB stairs instead of the BoB stairs, because we discovered a new technique that can bounce off walls from backwards momentum, and if you press A and B together on one frame, you jump kick backwards in a certain direction.

	"In BitDW, instead of waiting for the elevator we land on at first to get to the top, we just ran to the very edge and BLJed off right away, and then BLJed on an earlier elevator, saving a lot of time. In the movement, we used a new strategy, utilizing the new technique to bounce off the wall. We didn't have to jump kick this time, because when you fall off an edge after bouncing, you gain control again. We then dove like normal onto the next platform, and then dove on the pyramid shaped platform, but not to roll; we slid along the edge until we got close to the wall and jumped to cancel the speed very close to the wall. This saves some time as well. We then finished with the slope jump dives, followed by a new strat for getting to the pipe.

	"In BitFS, BLJing is way faster. This allowed us to save quite a number of frames. It resulted in worse positions for all moving things at the third tier, but we still got through it quickly enough.

[p 
	"At the end of BitS, we used a different way to get past the elevators, and a different strat before the pipe. The slope jump dives are also improved.

	"The final Bowser battle is also improved, due to optimisation and a different third throw.

	"Johannes: The submission file does not truncate the ending of the movie. It's a bug in Mupen 64, which causes garbage input when M64 playback ends. I worked around the bug by jumping into the star, which hits the star earlier, making the garbage input happen too late to make a difference.
