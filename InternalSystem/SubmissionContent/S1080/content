The second was 39872 frames, and after refining that, I ended up with this. It's 39781 frames (11:03), making it 168 frames (2.8 seconds) faster than Slotermeyer's published run. The rerecord count in the submitted file is incorrect. Actual rerecords were 5345.

This, predictably, results in the timer reaching zero sooner, which means that the cinema screen starts three frames sooner. This happened for the Kelbeross (level 4), Masked Devil and Jaquio battles in my previous versions but I wasn't so lucky in this final version.
