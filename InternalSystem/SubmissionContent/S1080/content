	"What you see here is my third attempt at a Ninja Gaiden TAS (or twenty-sixth, depending on how you count) The first was 39886 frames. The second was 39872 frames, and after refining that, I ended up with this. It's 39781 frames (11:03), making it 168 frames (2.8 seconds) faster than Slotermeyer's published run. The rerecord count in the submitted file is incorrect. Actual rerecords were 5345.
