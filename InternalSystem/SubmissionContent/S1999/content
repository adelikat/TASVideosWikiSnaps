	"atman Begins is a platformer style game based on the movie.  It was released in 2005, making this possibly the youngest game to receive a TAS submission.
	$LF

	"TASing a game so new was quite an intriguing experience.  There was no prior body of knowledge, no previous speed run record, or anything from which to research.  This means I was exploring new ground the whole way.  It was quit fun and rewarding :)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I chose this game because of the rich variety of moves, weapons, and attacks at Batman's disposal.  So many possibilities should result in a great number of possible strategies in a TAS, making route planning very difficult, varied, and more interesting.  It is also a nice combination of platformer action, beat em up style gameplay, and stealth.  Along the way I also found a few nice glitches to greatly speed up the completion of the game.

		"Jump punch - another attack with useful movement benefits.  If at full running speed, jump punching will retain full speed (716), it also can extend a jump further.

		"Duck Roll - useful for going under enemies or objects

		"Cartwheel - intended as a horizontal movement but can be taken advantage of when descending vertically because it quickly maxes out downward speed. (Laws of physics be damned!)

	"Cops and (and Ninjas in the stealth part of level 2) cannot be harmed.  If they see you, you die (well, get caught and have to restart).  If they hear you, they also catch you.  They hear footsteps when at running speed.  However, if you press jump at the same frame as you begin to run, you can get in the air without making a footstep.  This can be used to fly past many cops while still at max speeed, saving tons of time.

		" Shuriken/bat star glitch - after you throw a shuriken/bat star while in the air, batman returns to standing position for 1 frame before the game registers him as falling.  In this one frame window of opportunity, you can make another jump!  This can be done as often as needed for infinite jumping!  This has numerous applications throughout the run.
		$LF

[ul 
	[li 
		" Going through walls - This is an extension of the shuriken glitch.  With infinite jumping, you can get vertically into places the game programmers had decided could not be reached.  It turns out any wall that extends past the top of the screen has no "ceiling".  If you get over the edge of the wall, the game treats it as if you are in normal open space.   This allows you free travel in the wall!  This can only be done rarely however, since most areas have a ceiling.  It can only be done "outdoors" where there is no roof connecting to the wall.  This is done twice in this TAS to save a good chunk of time.
