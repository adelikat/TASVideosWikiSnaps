	"At first, I had no clue what was going on. I thought it was the regular de-sync again, but it wasn't. After I noticed the strategy being used, I quickly realized why the author chose this direction. You did the right thing by saving your effort for the beginning of the 3rd period, which gives you the most available opportunity to end input early. The game-play doesn't seem all that exciting, except for the scoring....but you certainly did the right thing here. Yeah...this game is really bad, if the AI can't take you down. I can imagine that it is not fun at all to play.
