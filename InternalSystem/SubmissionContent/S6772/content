It also allows to adjusting either the X speed or Y speed while keeping the other one the same. The biggest example of this is that for a X speed of -75, the Y speed can be anything from 12 to -13.

]div
[div class=p 
	"- Here we get our second (and last) M16 ammo pickup. This is why it's faster to get the M16 instead of the grenade launcher, because the first M16 pickup is absolutely needed for the knifethrower in dragon's lair. we either take this one M16 ammo pickup in The Deck to also deal with the dragon, or get 4-5 grenade launcher pickups in Tibet for the dragon alone. Ofc, M16 is faster.

[div class=p 
	"- The skidoo runs at 150 speed when holding action (90 without holding action. So Lara had to do so almost every frame she was on the skidoo), that's double Lara's running jumps' speed!
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- Riding the skidoo at the edge of geometry gives *huge* speed boosts (best I've seen was ~400, but the average is 250).

[div class=p 
	"- After getting the key and going back, Lara abuses the skidoo's jump physicis when hitting geometry to continue to the hut without leaving it.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- After opening the hut and pulling the lever, Lara is able to get on the skidoo through the wall here. pure magic. (on a more serious note, The skidoo's hitbox goes through the wall, and when Lara gets on it, the skidoo "takes over" in terms of coordinates and room number.)
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- Manipulating the two skidoo gunmen at the end was absolute hell. They *really* like going on circles around Lara, shooting at her (50 damage each shot, rapid drain) and occasionally running her over (100 damage a frame! almost instant death!). Not to mention they love the push the skidoo around when Lara is on it, parking it in the spot to get the glitch was also "fun".
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- For whatever reason if the skidoo is above the moveable block, it can go through the wall directly above it. Saves some time.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- at the end, instead of crashing the skidoo in the water and swimming up, Lara crashes the skidoo in a very specific spot to avoid getting wet. (very similar to the stumble cancel in the deck with the pool).

]div
[div class=p 
	"- A bit background talk about the inventory/puzzles system: when pressing action in front of a keyhole, game checks for one thing: "does Lara have anything in the puzzles ring"- if yes, go to puzzles ring. if no, say no.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- Now in the puzzles inventory, when choosing a key/puzzle, game checks for one thing: "is this the correct puzzle/key" by looking into the object data of said puzzle/key, and seeing if it matches the receptacle- if yes, do puzzle/key animation and do triggers/meshswaps. if no, say no.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- Dupe glitch: When using one prayer wheel normally on one receptacle, then going through the inventory normally (NOT automatically go to the puzzles ring with the action key), the data of the prayer wheel used transfers to the Seraph. So the game accepts the Seraph instead of the prayer wheels!

[div class=p
