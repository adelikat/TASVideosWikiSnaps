	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"After my previous Publication I immediately discovered movement optimizations in stage II that resulted in a ~100 frame improvement. I spent the next few months Brainstorming improvements, serially viewing my TAS almost nightly. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When I returned to the TAS in September I decided to take a new tact by picking up the Stage II Urn on the first visit and this was responsible for the major improvements I achieve in this run. I also decided to try and improve the skull bash mini-game. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I spent a lot of time deliberating the possibilities, routes, and road blocks I might run into by attempting this new strategy. The RTA player Broedgeman was very helpful in determining the most optimal route - as he is possibly the only other person in the world who knows as much about the game as I do.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I submitted a 980 frame improvement to the published run at the beginning of Novemeber as a W.i.p. and since then I have gone on to save a total of 1,049 frames over the published run. I was able to achieve the majority of my goals and I  feel that another significant improvement will be hard to find Without better knowledge of how lag is generated (and how it can be avoided), as well as better boss RNG manipulation, I believe this is the most potential to improve this TAS now.

	[li 
		"Hitting Bosses Early: In some stages, When the screen transition to a boss fight completes, you have control of firebrand for 1 frame. This is used to hit some bosses early. There  are some fights where this is possible but the bosses are either invulnerable or off screen and others where this is not possible at all.

	[li 
		"Mercury Cancel: Mercury and Sulfur are the two potions I buy on the return trip to stage II. Normally, when defeating a boss and collecting their  reward, you go through some text and are transported to the world map. Using the Mercury potion, I am able to collect the item and have a 2 frame window to execute the "Mercury Cancel", skipping any text and the world map transition via the effect of the potion: transporting firebrand backward one screen. This is used vs. Belth in stage IIb and vs. Crawler in stage V. The Sulfur  Potion does  not require any timing, it simply transports  me  to the world map, allowing me to avoid long and pointless hikes to the end  of stages Ib and IIb.
