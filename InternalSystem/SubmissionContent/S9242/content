Regardless of how I would have felt back then, I can say that I'm more excited about this game (in terms of TASing) than back then.

	"This was one of the most exciting TASes I've created. Why? Because this is the first time that I have created a TRUE Brute Force solving program...where the possibilities could be enormous for a human. Here, my brute forcing was done externally against the emulator. The game doesn't have any AI or RNG responses, so the given puzzle stands to be solved in a purely logical way. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"My approach was to write a C# application to accomplish this. It took me about 1 1/2 hours, which afterwards...the results were shockingly fast and delivered the most minimal moves possible. The only thing, outside of these brute forced solutions, were to apply them against the 5 different solving patterns. Doing so in the right order optimized my efforts an additional 179 frames. So I am extremely happy about the outcome here.
