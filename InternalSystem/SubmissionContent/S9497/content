	"This is an improvement over the current warpless run by implementing a star kill on the world 3 mouser via a series of glitches. I had put up a WIP implementing this a few years ago, but nothing ever happened with it so I figured I would try to get to the end of the game so the published run could be up to date.

	"Despite being an improvement overall, this run does lose ~40 frames in the resyncing process. This run relies heavily on subpixel tricks, and the game itself reuses memory from previous levels without clearing it (the game is like one big interconnected level,) and the combination of these things results in desyncs. I tried my best to make sure the rest of the run beyond the star kill is as close to the original as possible, but I slowly bled frames over time. As an example, killing the mouser with the star instead of a bomb changes the height he eventually despawns at ($416 in ram) and this is reused in 4-2 for the height of one of the water spouts from the whales. If you don't adjust input you will hit the water spout. Likewise, subpixels are carried between levels by performing some math operations on them with the counter at $3C, so this has to be fixed after the star kill as well. There are other variables effecting movement that I didn't figure out, like falling speed. Not being Aglar / andrewg, this is the best I could do.

	"Overall though I'm still happy with a ~7 second improvement that has current knowledge in it. Also, the temp encode is a console verification video.

I'm just surprised to see that it was a game like this, which has been beaten to death by other authors. All i can say is great work on this and congratulations on your 2024 award!
