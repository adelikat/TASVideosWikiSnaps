	"This is the sequel to Air, by U1, the author of the original. It's almost exactly the same as its predecessor, but with one major change: no infinite jumps. There's a few level changes to accomodate this change and all invisible coin blocks are marked, but the vast majority of the game is exactly the same.

	"This differs from my last version by almost always staying in-bounds, and by taking a little more time out to show off. I go out of bounds very shortly at the end of 1-2, because I couldn't find any way to grab the flagpole while my invincibility was still in effect. I also skip the last bit before Bowser because I didn't really need a fire flower, and there wasn't much to show there anyway. Also of note: in 4-3 right before Bowser, I wait for a moment and scroll the screen over to manipulate his "starting" position.

	":  I am accepting this movie and having it obsolete the published air movie.  Some people clearly oppose this and I apologize.  It seems the majority prefer air 2 over air (though slightly).  Also, I think this submission fills the quirky, impossibly difficult smb hack niche a bit better.
