	"This will be the tenth Adventures of Lolo submission, which will hopefully lead to the eighth published version. The first few versions all had reasonably big improvements, but the latest few versions all had rather small improvements, made mainly to include some small improvement that had been overlooked previously. I might have said that those versions weren't particularly worth watching if you've seen the previous version... but not this time!

	"Eleven of the fifty levels are improved in this version, and not by small amounts! It totalled up to an improvement of over 10 seconds, which is a lot... especially considering quite a few people have looked at it for quite a few times. Not only are there many improvements... the improvement themselves are very inventive, and they might surprise you if you were familiar with the previous solution or the game in general.

	"As you might have noticed, nearly all of these great improvement were found by Zugzwang. He kept surprising me as well as quite a few other people with what seemed like a limitless amount of improvements for a TAS that could never have been expected to be this improvable. Without him, this version wouldn't be there... and if there were to be a tenth version, it wouldn't have been remotely as awesome as this one. Many thanks Zugzwang!

Honestly, I couldn't be happier with the results. The most satisfying aspect has to be finding two communities that share a passion for these classic games that are so deserving. For that, THANK YOU.

	"[/Forum/Topics/6882&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=20|here]
	". The reason why I post the way I do is to have a chronological reference to mark the time and effort it took. Rather than discuss each level here, if you are intrigued for further detail I've modified those original posts. The four pages of posts, by mostly Baxter and I, are a pretty entertaining read. In hindsight, I enjoy the doubt that I found an improvement at all, turn into disbelief that I found another one. :)

	"It's been a huge learning experience as well. Up until my 8-5 improvement I played entirely in real-time on my NES. The last 8-5 solution I hadn't figured out how to reduce speed but did use save states. The last four levels I found would have been impossible to find in real-time. It amazes me that I had no idea how to make an fcm or compare frame counts when reading my second post. I guess we all start somewhere!

	"These times are no exaggeration. When I would come home I would spend 2-3 hours an evening (early morning) testing variations. I easily worked more than a 10 to 15 individual days on 8-5. The next most time consuming was 10-3, two weeks. Which leads to my parting thought, however intelligent I am or how I think logic should prevail in finding a new solution, it is dwarfed by my intuition and instinct. How else can you explain spending two solid weeks on a solution you don't KNOW is there? Considering so much emphasis is always placed on planning and knowledge the idea is sobering.
