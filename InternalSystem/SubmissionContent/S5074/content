	"Happy April 1st, here's some more Donkey action for ya. This run is 189 frames faster than Karaagekaraage's (?)

	" and 1175 frames faster than my 
	[a href=/2365M 
		"previous run
	]a
	". Mostly thanks to a new glitch as well as some additional optimisations. As this run was done on Bizhawk instead of SNES9X, some frames are because of lag differences.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This is a combination of two glitches: Super Jump and Jump Roll. A Super Jump is done by first having Diddy/Donkey get hit and run into a vertical wall. This will have Diddy/Donkey jump straight up in the air. Break a DK Barrel, take damage again and hold B. The next time you'll land on an enemy, as long as you never make a jump or release B, you'll fly upwards. While Superjumps have been known for quite some time, it wasn't until recently that RainbowSprinklez thought of combining it with a Jumproll. A jumproll is done by landing on an enemy the same frame as you start a new roll, causing Diddy/Donkey to roll in midair "without falling".
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"When you combine these two, you'll roll into enemies to build up speed, while at the same time moving upwards. Resulting in flying through a stage until you release B to drop.

	"I saved some time at the second Mankey Kong. Just when he throws the barrel, the hitbox for the barrel will be removed rather far away, making it possible to land between Mankey and the barrel to start a roll instead of jumping over him. Different method of getting onto Expresso with the barrel saved some more time. However, these improvements caused me to lose some time later when I needed to get the right value for the invisble barrel, in order to open the bonus room. All in all, a lot of time saved!

	"The Super Jump Roll done in the following level requires me to start with two Kongs. I therefore jump off Expresso to grab a DK barrel. It was slightly faster to use the second-to-last DK barrel instead of the last one in the levle, as it lets me roll into the Gnawties to increase my rolling speed, which goes above the speed of Expresso.

	"First use of the Super Jump Roll and the biggest timesaver for the run! I get hit by the second Slippa for Diddy to run into the wall and store the superjump. Get Diddy back, get hit and hold B. This part is actually a bit tricky, not to activate the SJR itself, but to get the full speed of it. Each enemy, up to 4, will increase the rolling speed. I want to hit the second Slippa as early as possible and instantly move towards the right. By releasing Y before hitting an enemy, I can choose to later activate the roll and its speed gain, this is called an Extended Roll. I need to do this for the second Slippa and time it to hit both the third as well as the fourth snakes. The rest of the level is history...

	"Another SJR was done in this stage. Here it doesn't save much time at all, in comparision. Main reason is that you can't normally roll into Klap Traps, this makes it impossible to start a SJR using only them as enemies. I instead have to wait until the midway point, where there are two Kritters, and use those. As I only hit two enemies, the speed isn't as great as in Misty Mine, but it still saved around two seconds compared to my previous TAS.
