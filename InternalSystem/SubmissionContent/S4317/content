	"Pokemon Adventure is a pirated game made in China on the Game Boy by Yong Yong. This was originaly called Sonic 3D Blast 5 and then released as Sonic Adventure 7, and the graphics are really inspired from the Sonic the Hedgehog games. The physics in them were HORRIBLE, and the music was even worse. Now this version,  which this time is inspired by Pok√©mon and stars Pikachu, goes through 5 levels with a little upgrade in graphics and sound, but the game's terrible gameplay and bugs are still present.

Holding the B button (yes B and not A, which is ridiculous BTW) you control the height of Pikachu while jumping... and again, is VERY hard to do.
