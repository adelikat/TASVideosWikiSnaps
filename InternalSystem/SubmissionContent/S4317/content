	"Pokemon Adventure is a pirated game made in China on the Game Boy by Yong Yong. This was originaly called Sonic 3D Blast 5 and then released as Sonic Adventure 7, and the graphics are really inspired from the Sonic the Hedgehog games. The physics in them were HORRIBLE, and the music was even worse. Now this version,  which this time is inspired by Pok√©mon and stars Pikachu, goes through 5 levels with a little upgrade in graphics and sound, but the game's terrible gameplay and bugs are still present.

	"The use of the spin dash was more used in here than the rest of the stages. This is because the stage got more straight routes than the others.

	"The stages also includes those annoying fireflies (which looks like an enemy from Megaman) and those fuckers are hard to avoid.

	"Koopas and those cute Megaman guys are introduced now, and a maze like stage too. I got to get the physics of Pikachu's jumps to continue through this one for those very very accurate jumps. Holding the B button (yes B and not A, which is ridiculous BTW) you control the height of Pikachu while jumping... and again, is VERY hard to do.

	"You would want to see a terrible game beaten in 5 minutes? Well this TAS is just for you... Regularly, this game can be beaten in 40 minutes due to the horrible gameplay, or even you'll never beat it because of your raging and breaking your Game Boy.

	"This movie could be improved if someone could find a game breaking glitch or something. Someone could also find a better route for the spindash, which I still haven't found yet.
