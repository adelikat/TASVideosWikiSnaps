	"Castlevania III is the final game of the NES trilogy and introduces different characters you can play as and a stage select screen that gives you a choice which path to take. This run aims to complete the Grant path as quickly as possible, saving roughly 19 seconds over the previous run.

	"Most of the time savings come from a couple of different strategies, more optimization, better heart management and a couple of new tricks. Grant is an absolute beast when used properly, and I try to show that off as good as I can.

	"There are multiple ways to skip the attack animation of thrown weapons, allowing the player to keep moving and throw weapons at a considerably higher rate. All of these need to be frame-precise. It works by pressing the attack button...

[p 
	"Another one that only works with Grant. If you jump into a ceiling, 32 subpixels are added to your position, regardless of whether you are touching a wall or not. By repeatedly jumping in the proper spot, you can add enough subpixels to your position to roll over, adding a full pixel. This in turn allows you to enter the wall. You have to align your subpixels carefully while approaching the wall to minimize the amount of jumps it will take.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"What you can do while in the wall depends on your exact position and the blocks around you. You can either begin climbing the walls as usual, or, if you're in deep enough, jumping immediately zips you upward a block.

	"I'd like to thank samhain-grim for his great Castlevania 3 runs that I used as a base, and Bablo for an unfinished WIP, which helped me a lot while making the run. Also, I'd like to thank everyone on #tasvideos for putting up with my constant rambling about the run. I may elaborate on the submission comments later, but, for right now, I hope you enjoy the run.
