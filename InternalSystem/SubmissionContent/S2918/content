	"This is the epitome of RRfJ. You have to collect each key to open the door. The 2nd and 3rd key, I use the damage trick to run by the enemies. The Skeleton's hit-boxes allow for you to stand between the head and the sword, so I was able to beat him without moving.

[div class=p 
	"I don't think this game is worthy of a TAS without the climbing levels. They allow for some creativity, as you have to coordinate jumps with enemy motion. The boss has two attacks, the first shooting out projectiles, and the 2nd being a flame. The game was programmed poorly, as the flame doesn't actually do damage, thus, I stand there, get burned, and attack like mad, boss goes down in a single round.

	"I pick up gold orbs and shields in this level. Also, the bridge falls apart, so I jump to save time. Also, in the tight hallway, the door won't open fast enough to avoid the tongue enemy, thus, I step back, let the barrier deal damage, and walk through the enemy. The boss is only vulnerable  when his mouth is open, but still goes down fairly quick.

	"The dungeon is by far my favorite level, due to the three opening tricks of positioning enemies to bounce off. The second bounce is especially fun, as the enemy is hit back into midair, and then I bounce off him to reach the door. The boss is vulnerable once he steps forward. Sadly, firing fast is the best way to beat him.
