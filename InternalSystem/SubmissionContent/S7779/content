		" Super Mitch Bros. is a ROM Hack created by Chipius with 20 levels. Being on the hard side of kaizo SMB3 hacks, this mod requires a vast knowledge of Mario 3, using tons of emerging mechanics, and exploiting the items in ways that weren’t needed to clear the original game. The levels are also filled with constantly changing trolls (you will see Kaizo blocks in level 5) and will test your mind among the different puzzles you’ll need to figure out to progress.
