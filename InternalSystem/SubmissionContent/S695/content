	"was fun. its a fun game that ive done several times over now. the rerecord count being so high is what i attribute that to. i think people will like this movie because the LDR glitch is kinda neat and because of how i deal with things. the majorly tedious parts are the boss battles (Fireman, Monster, Faryan forms) but ive optimized them all quite well. Faryan is unfortunately a snore (as Truncated would put it :))

	"part 2, i run into the Giant Head again... and the only reason for using the Howl here is because i have health just above. you also see the LDR glitch... basically, you walk through the first part of the wall and then jump or face the other way to get out. now, if the area you get stuck in only has 2 "objects" (werewolf's width), it may be possible to walk through; however, if you cant, you have to jump, which sends you plummeting below... and if you're on the ground level, chances are you will die.

	"Monster is a PAIN... but ive found something nifty... the Howls workout oddly: in succession (can only do 2 at once because you will die otherwords) they do 2 the first time and 3 the next... so perhaps the damage dealt is 2.5 and it doesn't register? that would explain why almost every OTHER hit seems to take off a life bar as opposed to making him flash. also, the heart is something i didnt know about... so yes, i went back and checked all other places too... and Fireman is littered with damaging W's

	"also, when he dies, he SLOWLY falls to the bottom until he dies... thats why i wait for him to touch the bottom (it is faster than initially hitting him)

	"Kinji is unique in that the first time i fought him i had a fluke. theres a frame or 2 where you can jump and that sets off the events to come of either him continuously jumping and you beating him or him standing still for a moment.

	"Faryan's werewolf form takes 4 damage while his darklord persona takes 2. and while Giant Head takes 8 damage (the battle before Faryan), its faster to kill him with punches and save it for Faryan. so its better to use it here. also, you cant hit him when hes leaping to and from spots. and yes, that long wait where i playaround is unavoidable.
