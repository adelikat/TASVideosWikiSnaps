	"Hey guys! After some newly discovered glitches and tricks, I decided to start another Super Demo World run. Primarily, the discovery of the stun glitch gave the biggest improvement in the entire run. It's a very simple, yet powerful glitch. It even allows you to spawn Koopa Kids, which can end a level the same way after defeating a boss. Demonstrations of this glitch can be viewed

	" Pokey Stun Glitch
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This is a very powerful glitch, which lets you spawn sprites from a stunned one. In order to execute this glitch, you need Yoshi and a damage source (such as an enemy, a thrown shell, etc.). You start off by voiding a sprite in Yoshi's tongue, which is achieved by eating it when you already have another sprite in Yoshi's mouth, which I demonstrate in the run by using the "stick out Yoshi's tongue at the same time you hit a power-up" glitch. Then you have to get hit and fall off Yoshi before you eat the 2nd sprite. After this, you need to spit out the sprite you have in Yoshi's tongue. However, since you have a Pokey in my mouth, it's 3 blocks high, so you need to stand on a ledge so it doesn't fall through the floor (it's a Pokey, just without the graphics or movement). Then you eat the pokey to spawn the goal tape. The goal tape actually isn't the real goal tape, but a graphic of it. In order to hit the real one, you need to go to where Y=0 and X<11.00, which is the top right of the screen.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There is a lot more to this glitch than is described above, and there are other ways to void the 2nd sprite, but in the case of this movie, this is all you need to know.
	$LF

[p 
	"I know my description of this glitch is poorly written, as it is a hard glitch to describe. I will update this with a better description if I come upon one.
