	"There's some talk in the thread about how publishable the run really is, and after mulling it over for a bit this is probably the closest the game can get to 100%. Even then, the run's received very good feedback, and as such it is still publishable in its own right. Deathless is a good modifier to prevent looping stages for extra points, it makes the run feel more fluid and more superhuman as a result.

	"Due to the great audience feedback, I'm accepting this to Moons as a new category. Looking forward to a potential any% improvement as well!
