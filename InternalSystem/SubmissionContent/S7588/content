	"This is a homebrew game that I imagine was made more as a coding exercise than a proper game but it's stated on the game's Itch page that it is indeed a 'full' game with just two levels and acts as a sort of tutorial.

	"After the ninth time the screen is resest, the game will crash. This can happen from both dying and travelling between levels. I'd also like to point out how bad the enemy hitboxes are and how bad the floor collision is allowing the player to easily clip inside of it (which this TAS does).
