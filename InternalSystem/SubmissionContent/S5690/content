	"It contains a bad emulation bug at the boss that I wanted to fix. Two blocks are destroyed instead of just one in the middle of the ship.
	$LF
	"But, my numerous and frustrating attempts to reach the boss while maintaining the timing in the original run have all ended in failure.
	$LF
	"Until now!
	$LF
	"I finally managed to recreate the speed and patterns in the original while saving time on the last boss.

	"Another very annoying emulation bug in a TAS squashed.
