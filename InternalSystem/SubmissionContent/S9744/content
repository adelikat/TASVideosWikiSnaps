	"Well, this is a nearly 4 hour long Resident Evil 4 glitchfest. Given the amount of glitches that were made in this TAS, I think I can call it a glitchfest, but playaround is also fine.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"This TAS was made in new game plus (because obviously, starting with all weapons greatly increases the possibility of glitches), from a new round save and here we get into a small problem (or a big one, maybe). I wasn't aware that for TASes that start on a SRAM save, a verification movie was required (my mistake here, there's no excuse and I didn't look at the rules for that). Because of that, I ended up doing the entire TAS on top of a save I downloaded from the internet lol. I just wanted a save with everything unlocked to start TAS. So, as you noticed, I don't have a verification movie of the save that was used.

[div class=p 
	"Okay, but why am I submitting this TAS here, even though I don't have a save verification movie? For two reasons:
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		"This TAS is a glitchfest. So, in my opinion, a verification movie wouldn't be that necessary, since I'm not competing for time with anyone. The save that was used doesn't matter that much, since TAS is 100% based on messing around and doing as many glitches as possible.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"A save verification movie for a game like Resident Evil 4 would be extremely tedious and insanely long, since unlocking everything involves beating the game several times (to unlock the extras and then to leave a "new round" save with the weapons I wanted), beating Separate Ways (to unlock Chicago) and still getting 5 stars in all the Mercenaries scenarios, with all the characters (to unlock Handcannon). We're talking about a movie of more than 15 hours, maybe.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[div class=p 
	"So, these are the reasons that made me submit this TAS here, even though I don't have a verification movie. But of course, if these reasons are not valid, so be it. I just won't miss the opportunity to submit a TAS that, in my opinion, would be nice to have on the site.

	"What I can say is that, surprisingly enough, this TAS doesn't even come close to fixing all the glitches in the game. I discovered, after finishing TAS, that I could have done a lot more, but it was too late. However, maybe TAS would be a lot longer than it is if I included all the glitches I discovered... so it wasn't so bad.

	"And in case you have any doubts, the save does not interfere in any way with the TAS. Of course, if you notice, Leon starts the game with a few hundred million pesetas, but, as already said, this has no influence whatsoever, since this TAS is a glitchfest. All glitches made are possible in the normal game, regardless of the save that was loaded.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Another pertinent question: Why wasn't this TAS done in a professional mode? Well, since it's a glitchfest, I guess the difficulty level doesn't matter. But I didn't really do it on pro mode because I would have to start a new game on pro, then beat it a few more times until I got the weapons I wanted. It would take too long and be kind of tedious. Because of that, I ended up using a save on normal mode.

However, at some points in the game, if you're in a specific position and jump, Leon ends up landing inside an object or even inside the ground. This causes him to lose collision with the ground and walls and allows you to exit the map. This glitch occurs in several parts of the game, in several different ways, but the way it works is the same. See examples

As a result, if you aim the Striker and before the crosshair appears, you enter the briefcase and equip another weapon, Leon will accelerate, almost twice as fast. This is a very famous glitch called "Ditman Glitch", used a lot in speedruns and also a lot in this TAS because it causes other glitches.

However, if you stand up, aim, enter the briefcase and equip another weapon, Leon will exit the crouching animation, but the game will understand that he is still crouched. By doing this, you can crouch anywhere, just by pressing the aim button. This happens at 13:45 and can only be done on GameCube (as far as I remember). See
