	": It is with an heavy heart and sorry thoughts that I cancel this run. The reason is sync issues. The first level of this run was started on DeSmuME 0.9.11, before switching to DeSmuME 0.9.9 (thanks to arandomgameTASer), where it 'magically' synced. I never looked back, and this is the mistake that bites me in the back; so to speak. This run is close to unsavable and due to the ridiculous lag of this game, any form of anesthesy is in vain.

	": An edit: the TAS does somewhat sync by starting the movie with Bus-Timing off, savestating at frame 76302, enabling Bus-Timing, restarting the ROM, and load the state again. This brings up the question of legitimity; however, the TAS still desyncs 177k frames in this way.
