	"Tower of Doom was originally set to be the third AD&D title on the Intellivision with the working title "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Tower of Mystery". The game was only half complete when Mattel Electronics folded in 1984. INTV Corp resumed work on the game in 1986. Not wanting to pay for a renewed D&D license, the game was released under the new name, "Tower of Doom". Even if Tower of Doom is outside the Dungeons & Dragons license, it has more D&D elements than its two predecessors.

	"This adventure happens to have a lot of these potions strewn about the levels. However, after careful and meticulous routing, I found that it was optimal to collect and use three Potion Bottles of Blindness and one Potion Bottle of Haste (the brown one which normally grants 2x speed), for a total of four uses—more than any other TAS thus far. They were used on Levels 3, 7, 12, and 20.

	"You cannot simply throw weapons all the time though, as there is a random chance the weapon will downgrade to a lower color. If the weapon downgrades enough times, you will lose it.

	"In this run, I only downgraded the brown bow a single time into an orange bow. After this, two downgrades are left before the weapon breaks—blue then gray—but I did not find any places where risking additional weapon downgrades would save a significant amount of time. An improvement may be found if you go back to Level 16 
	[em 
		"at the latest
	]em
	" and incorporate a couple extra weapon throws, allowing for downgrades to occur, and potentially advance RNG faster. However, even that is a lot of work for what might save 6 frames at best, or lose frames at worst; so I will not be doing that.

	"Using the Friar to potentially expand the number of 2x speed potions used is a brand-new concept introduced in this run. Using this character would appear to be slower for the published "Novice" and "The Fortress" runs. But for any adventure with randomized dungeon layouts, including the published "Grail Quest" run, I would imagine the Friar is actually the fastest character to use, as long as you can find a seed that has a lot of potions which can be used for 2x speed.

In addition, you do complete all the levels this adventure has to offer, which I see is necessary. In regards to the game, I can't argue with your game-play. It parallels similar strategies from the other categories. If this game's RNG/AI was manipulated in the same fashion as "Venture", then I certainly can see the effort in getting these results. Heck, the re-record count really shows that!
