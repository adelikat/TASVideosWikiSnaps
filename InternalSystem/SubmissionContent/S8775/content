	"if you can manipulate all enemies to walk forward it might be improvable, a lot of combos and string were tested but the tornado special move that removes scaling from combos is the fastest theoretical way of killing enemies as traps consume a lot of time in Endurance mode. The strings are also the most damaging single hit moves in one sequence. I used to speedrun this game and now learned how to make wii savefile for TAS.

	"Kreate-a-Fighter is strongest character in the game, but only if you have enough koins to upgrade it to that level, for which you need to play the game first to collect those koins. Other characters won't benefit from koins or prior completion, and KAF won't make sense to use without upgrading it in advance. So KAF and save anchor only make sense together.

	"The tricky part is whether to put NewGame+ into the branch label. Without upgrades, KAF would not be able to compete with other chars, so it would not be optimal by default. And we don't currently allow multiple branches, one per char, in Standard, so the char picked would have to be optimal to belong to a fresh save goal. So there would not be a KOF goal without save file, but we agreed to highlight NG+ always to make the difference apparent. However since in this case there would be no difference in what is published, I think we can drop NG+ from the branch as something that's implied by the KAF goal.

	"Still this would be a standard goal since there's nothing inherently arbitrary here: the char is made to be the strongest, to beat the Endurance mode the fastest.
