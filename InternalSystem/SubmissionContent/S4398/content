	"This run is for all cat and dog lovers out there. Especially if you like when they fart, burp and do stuff, this is for you. I started working on this game a while ago and stopped because of desync problems then tried again, last year on BizHawk, with success. The run posted by HyperZoot might have been a little bit slower but it contained at least one major improvement...

	"1-1 is probably the most entertaining stage of the game. It is full of objects you can throw but also has fans, phones and clocks that makes you go faster. The clock will push you forward on the screen until you end up back on the other side. When almost off screen, weird things starts to happen.It will allow you to walk through some objects and walls that block your path and also creates floor out of nowhere. Entering Stimpy's mouth was simple enough. Slap a beaver here and there, nothing to it. Oh yeah! Dirty socks gives you super speed. The boss's routine refrained me from giving him three straight slap in the face but thanks to Stimpy's loose tooth, i managed to kill him fast enough. Exiting is where HyperZoot improved on my run. At one point you come across a long row of red nerves (These will kill you instantly). It seems you don't need to slow down, while jumping over them, as i did in my run. If you use the dirty sock at the right time, the effect will stop while you are jumping over, thus landing at the right place without slow downs.

	"Not much here but exploding kiwi's. The dirty sock sprite is replaced with the army boot. There are some major shortcuts thanks to umbrella's and helicopter's. Cannon's are pretty useful so using them is a must. Jumping in water or quicksand is possible, if you jump right before dying. The floating army guys can spawn a helicopter, if you hit them after they throw there kiwi bomb. At the boss battle you have to wait for Stimpy to give you kiwi bombs to throw... Maybe they are pineapples! In any case,  while you are waiting, a bunch bombs fall from the sky. It is possible to avoid them, while on the ground but it causes a lot of lag. Other than that... Boom!!! Boom!!! Boom!!!

	"You will have to wait for most elevators to do a full circle before being able to jump onto them but there are some that, if activated in the right position, can be reached faster. The boss was not to hard, as you can see. The platforms, blocking me from throwing the hat, ended up being perfectly positioned.

	"Start's off with a scroller down a monster's stomach. Like in other levels, you try to avoid reaching 5,00$ when missing life points. The animation will slow you down like there's no tomorrow. Back on solid ground things get quite nice with the new weapons like the bookerang. You will notice some lag at one point, due to a bunch of eyeballs. I was unable to avoid that, as you can see. The second scroller is filled enemies and cash so you need to watch it here. It is pretty easy to past through most this stage without taking damage except for one part where two worms or "man eating dildos" hit you no matter what. Right before the end of this stage, you will notice, the screen stops for a couple of frames. I do not know why but it seems to be inevitable. The second platform stage Is pretty much like the first with a little shortcut at the end. For the final boss i just waited for it to appear, to start shooting, instead of going to it then having to climb back up.
