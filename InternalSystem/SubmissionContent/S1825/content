	"Like Randil did mentionned, this game is extremely random. Making the goonie appear at correct safe is easy as it's frame based. But manipulating enemies is complicated. 
	$LF
	"Especially, there are 2 important places where luck manipulation was needed for enemies.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The first one is at beginning of level 3. You must make sure no enemy is appearing till the bomb has exploded and make one enemy appear at correct time. In my version, one enemy did appear before laying down the bomb but I did make sure it disappears as soon as possible.
	[br

	$LF
	"Why is it so imporant!? It's for letting the counter, at memory address $11c, go down at 1. And when it reaches 0, a ghost is appearing which saves time later by letting dying the hero.
	$LF
	"Randil found it easy to do so, I think he was just lucky but trust me, it is REALLY HARD. With many possibilities I have tested, only one got the desired result.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"In other words, when $112 = 0,  $11c goes down.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The second place is even worse as I was forced to lose, 60 frames. :S. It is at beginning of level 5, a fish MUST appear when the bomb is laying down to explode. This one, I did tested so many things, I even restarted the whole game several times in hope to get the desired result, but didn't even managed to get the 1st one, the one where I must manipulate the ghost, to even rework, so I lay down my hands, at least, for now. If I take the shorcut at level 3 to reach level 5 as optimally as possible, a mouse appear, in the secret room, so soon that he moves right and that saves lot of time but with that randomness, no fish appears at beginning of level 5. So, to make it appear, I was forced to kill an extra mouse at end of level 3 which changes, of course, the randomness at secret room and the mouse doesn't appear so soon. So, in other words... THAT SUCKS!
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Also, in level 3, I was forced to lose some time because of some Fratelli brother appearing at wrong time which cancels the mouse to appear there which was needed to collect a bomb and also manipulating randomness. If it's possible to get the desired randomness without losing time, I think the level could be improved by 8 frames but I did try hard to solve the problem but I failed.
