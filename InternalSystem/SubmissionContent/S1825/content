	"The second place is even worse as I was forced to lose, 60 frames. :S. It is at beginning of level 5, a fish MUST appear when the bomb is laying down to explode. This one, I did tested so many things, I even restarted the whole game several times in hope to get the desired result, but didn't even managed to get the 1st one, the one where I must manipulate the ghost, to even rework, so I lay down my hands, at least, for now. If I take the shorcut at level 3 to reach level 5 as optimally as possible, a mouse appear, in the secret room, so soon that he moves right and that saves lot of time but with that randomness, no fish appears at beginning of level 5. So, to make it appear, I was forced to kill an extra mouse at end of level 3 which changes, of course, the randomness at secret room and the mouse doesn't appear so soon. So, in other words... THAT SUCKS!

	"Also, in level 3, I was forced to lose some time because of some Fratelli brother appearing at wrong time which cancels the mouse to appear there which was needed to collect a bomb and also manipulating randomness.
