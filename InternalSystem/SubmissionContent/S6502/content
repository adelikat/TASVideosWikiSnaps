	"Warriors of Fate is an ancient arcade game like Captain Commando or Final Fight.This tas is 4 minutes faster than anonymous tas(21:55,but 22:30 in fact) on youtube/niconico.This type of game is very hard since its powerful random.It looks that there is no optimal strategy in tas.Overall priority:advanced weapons>ride horse>medium weapons>Unarmed>inferior weapons.
