	"Mercenaries is unlocked by completing the main game.  It is a timed minigame with the objective of scoring the most points before time runs out.  Per the intro of a map "Eliminate as many Ganados as you can before your evac chopper arrives!  Successive kills will result in earning you more points!"  Initially only Leon is selectable.  There are four other characters playable when unlocked after scoring 30000+ points in one of the four (unofficially named) maps:

Enemies run into the player's line of sight, meaning less time is wasted hunting, and more time is focused on killing and moving to the next objective.  Wesker has the best weapon selection.

		"The greatest potential for increasing this score will require the entire run to be redone from scratch.  If I went full speed to the final kill(#348), there would have been about 30 seconds left, which is roughly 29 seconds better than my RevC iteration.  It takes about 23 seconds to run from the starting point of the map to the 1st or 2nd Bonus Chests.  If a bonus timer is active before the 1st kill registers, there is a potential 4630 more points to gain, assuming bonus chest kill counts remain the same.  This is the nature of this stage:  A maximum score has not yet been found.  Each run brings more improvements in efficiency to use in the current run, the next run, or for other player's to incorporate. These ideas improve the score next time.  Mathematically, if all 348 enemies are killed in the 93 seconds of Bonus Chest time, Max Score is 345*1300+3*11500=483000. At this point I'd estimate the max actually possible with programmer level knowledge to be about 420000.  I will call this run "good", not perfect.  If a perfect score is determined, the goal could then be changed to "Reach perfect(max) score in the fastest time."
