	"Astyanax is a pretty standard platformer where the main difficulties are extreme lag and the characters huge hit box. The improvements here mostly come from improved boss fights in the early game. Astyanax gains power throughout the game (his max damage starts at 2 and by the end of the game it is 20.) However you can only swing your weapon at full power when the power bar is charged up, which takes considerable time. In the previous movie, Marx almost always waited for full power swings, but it turns out in the early game you have much higher DPS just swinging with power 2. In the latter part of the game it is still optimal to wait for full power, so the second half of the game is mostly the same except for adjusting to RNG.

	"This game polls input in an unusual way, it first polls player 1, then sends out a separate poll for player 2 (each poll request polls both controllers, so the second one is not necessary.) The bot (at least the TAStm32 V3) is too slow for this approach and occasionally misses a request, causing desyncs. Additionally, polling happens at uneven intervals, and controller reading is even occasionally interrupted by MMC3 interrupts, so filtering out the second poll doesn't work either. So this run is currently not console verified.
