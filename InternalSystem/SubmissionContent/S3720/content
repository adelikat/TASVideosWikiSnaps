	"The evil genius, Silas Volkmire, and his sidekick, the Dark Queen, have kidnapped the daughter of a well-renowned scientist and Zitz, one of the awesome Battletoads.  Now the remaining Battletoads, Rash and Pimple, must rescue the two captives and stop the deadly duo from fulfilling their plans to control the world.

	"Do you know how do I choose my runs to TAS? Do I search for old runs? Runs with few rerecords? Runs from TASers that I dislike and want to take some sort of silly revenge? Do I have a dream that one day all of the SNES runs will belong to me? Do I have a desperate need for attention and I would work like crazy on a run, just so it would be on the front page for a few days\hours? Well, one of the previous alternatives apply to one of my other runs, but none of them to this one; I was trying to watch the published run on the emulator and faced a lot of sync problems, so I decided to update it on a newer emulator.

But TASers are persistent beings and when I was fighting the Dark Queen I felt the need to try Rocky's fight again. The solution; sacrifice one of the frogs to take advantage of the invincibility period.

The obstacles can be avoided on the first or last possible frame, the first possible frame is preferable only on "Rail Out" sections. Rash is eight frames ahead of Pimple, so, do something with Rash, count six frames and then repeat with Pimple, simple as that.

	"I've quoted a line from T-Bird, on the Bowling Pins bonus stage; it's neither present in the published run nor in my run. So, what? Well, I haven't figured out how, but it may be possibe to manipulate what the Dark Queen and T-Bird say between the stages so you only have to skip shorter text. Also, PJ posted a video on the forum of him skipping the first stage with a glitch on console, you bet we tried to reproduce this glitch on emulator, as you can see we didn't succeed, but a run featuring that glitch would save tons of time.

	"feos, for his awesome Battletoads & Double Dragon run, the one hit kill trick and most of the style of my run was inspired on his run, but also for feedback on the forum, thank you. PJ, his SDA run is also amazing and his tricks inspired me to find new solutions to solve parts of the run that otherwise would be a lot slower, thank you. FODA and Vatchern, the way I finish some enemies is a carbon copy of their strategies, thank you guys!

Not commenting does not mean not watch or support, I realized that now and so I'm sorry. I hope you have enjoyed the run. See you... mm... well, still don't know which one will be my next run, but whatever it is, without your support it will be meaningless, so see you there!

	"It seems the game wasn't hard enough, so you had to up the difficulty with fighting yourself! Segment after segment, you made it look way too easy. Skuzz was completely left in the dust. The Snake Pit was your personal workout room. The Dark Queen after meeting you decided she'd rather play with Billy and Jimmy, they're less violent. Also, best ending, terrific.
