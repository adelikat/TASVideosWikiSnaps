[h4 
	" Frame perfect turtle hop
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"When jumping on the frames before landing, it's possible to jump without having to see the ninja's walking sprite but doing this kind of jump has reduced horizontal speed for a few frames making it slower than a normal timed jump. You do get to see this kind of jump when dealing with a certain type of obstacle because there is a 1 (in 30fps) frame window where you can hop off from them unharmed.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Jumping off from spikes unharmed
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This little trick is one of the reasons why the TAS run is notably faster than the current best real-time runs. However, there are a few factors that make the trick not so easy to pull off. Falling speed and pixel positioning when landing on the spikes. There is a small row of pixels that are considered to be safe to land for 1 frame, the ninja is restricted to execute the slower turtle hop but if you play as Green, it's possible to execute multiple spike jumps by adjusting the timing of Green's double jump.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Vertical block zip
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This trick was discovered near the end of the run and it requires Blue to move closer to the block from underneath and hold up to go through part of that block. When deactivating the tornado due to time expiration or character change, the ninja's feet needs to line up with the base of the block for the zip to work. I had a look at the maps in the game and there isn't a way to zip into the sealed section and fully skip boss refights completely in Neo City.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Super short hop
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"A tap hop executes a jump at a reasonable amount of height but there are 2 ways to reduce the height of a tap hop.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"1) Use ninjutsu.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"2) Change character.

]p
[h4 
	" Menu navigation
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"As Green, it's faster to reach to Red/Blue by scrolling through the bottom, you only lose an extra 2 frames if you have at least 1 ninpo which is still super fast than scrolling upwards to select Blue.

[p 
	"100% only has 2 viable routes.
	$LF
	"My old 2015 stage order was: Highway -> Harbor -> Valley -> Woodland
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The current route now goes: Valley -> Woodland -> Highway -> Harbor 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I thought Highway first was the fastest but I lose a lot of time in the second section of Highway due to the lack being able to double jump to reach higher levels and it's notably slower than Valley first.

	" Valley 1
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"With only the red ninja, I had to wait for logs to appear, there are 2 types. A slow log and a fast log. The first life expansion is found right next to the first pair of whirlpools but the distance is too far to reach when using a log, so I had to take the higher route and drop down from an unusual position to get the faster log spawn as soon as possible without the whirlpool from stopping it. 
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Valley 2
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This section has a lot of jumping, some can be done a few frames faster but doing so messes up the position of the 2 spike enemies inside the topmost dark cage segment as my character would end up taking 2 hits instead of 1. The other problem is that even if a new version was ahead by 1-2 pixels, it wouldn't be possible to only break open the rightmost box that has a ninpo pickup as it will hit a left box and spawns a small life refill to recover 2 HP. I took damage on purpose in the first area to reduce LIFE BONUS points delay which is 100 points per frame.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"If Valley was brutal for using logs, this level can be brutal too with less HP as some enemies can dish out 2 points of damage. The first section has a lot of height jumping and it has a frame precise and pixel-precise trick right after the life expansion which is done by duck walking which happened right before picking up the life expansion.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The first Tornado was used at a certain location for 2 reasons. 
	$LF
	"1) The moment the ninja jumps after using the second tornado, I can still walk forward an inch without having to waste overall steps in the area
	$LF
	"2) You can deactivate the tornado by changing character but that requires a pause, I want to deactivate tornado at an appropriate spot.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Taking a hit here allows me to save 1 frame after completing the level, the 3 evil ninjas have various HP but from lowest to highest it's Left, Right and Middle. Since middle takes 5 hits, that one was the main target for optimising the battle.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Green Ninja has the ability to double jump and use shurikens to hitstun the army soldiers, Green is also the best ninja to break open item boxes without having to stop moving. A 5-way shot was used at the end at a specific time to reset the small self-destruct timer, this way it gets caught in the explosion and take damage to reduce the LIFE BONUS score.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Highway 2
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"It may look slow but double jump to Blue's tornado is the fastest way to reach the first floor, I switch to green because it's possible to double jump and not lose horizontal speed which the tornado has problems with when going diagonally. The main reason why the tornado was going straight up is because, part-way through a series of double jumps, I would have to deal with a hammer guy and going a few pixels ahead can cause problems because a (point blank) spread shuriken shot is the most effective way to kill him in a single hit.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Highway Boss
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The helicopter's swoop patterns are based on the ninja's current position. Green shurikens are very weak and so it's ideal to switch to blue, not only for stronger damage output but it has the reach which is vital for saving precious frames during the 4th cycle. Extra damage I took was intentional to reduce the LIFE BONUS score, I had to preserve some HP because I will need at least 11 during the final stage.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"One of the biggest challenges in this level was to figure out how to keep on moving right after the last life expansion, it turns out that a short hop and a shuriken shot right before landing puts the enemy into hitstun and allows me to go through him without any kind of knockback reaction.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Pink's bombs are very powerful against most of the bosses in the game reducing the hit count from 8 down to 4. It's possible to save a few more frames by taking damage after throwing bomb 3 but I didn't because:
	$LF
	"A) I needed enough HP for the last level and 
	$LF
	"B) there is a global timer running at all times in certain rooms of the final stage and not taking damage, speed up one of the rooms which negates the very small time loss during the boss fight.

	"Rooms B, E and G have assets that are running on a global timer. Room B, in particular, will exit the room in a certain time (assuming menu-based actions are exactly the same) even if my previous 4 stages were faster by ~30 frames. It's probably faster if I've found new gameplay timesavers that add up to 2-3 seconds worth but as of this submission, it wasn't enough.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Room D shows the first instance of spike jumping. 
	$LF
	"This trick has 2 factors, falling speed and (sub)pixels. The first spike jump was to avoid dying from the spike ball trap, changing characters during that jump allows me to execute a super low hop which simply stops the rising vertical speed the moment a character is changed. Green is great for spike jumping thanks to its double jump which was vital to reach the higher platform leading to Room C.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Room C blocks are running on a global timer and using the tornado spell in this scenario to the point I take intentional damage in the next room (E) is 54 frames faster than not using the spell. This is because when I enter the next room, I get to see an end to an earlier cycle which cuts down the waiting time before the damage boost. I still would have to pick up an extra ninpo later on (28 frames) in the level but I save more time than losing so it was worth using it (26 frames faster overall).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Room E is a cycle based room, the execution window to damage boost to the right, next to Door G is very tight to pull off.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Room G is the most annoying rooms for real-time runs because it's possible to reach to the end without stopping but the execution window isn't forgiving. Spike jumping isn't useful here because it slows the ninja down slightly and it's not possible to reach to the top right door without having to use the lower floor first.

I tried copy pasting the inputs to get consistent heights but even that wasn't enough to get it working, you can tell a spike jump will not work if the ninja does not show a walking sprite before dying.

	"Room B to D: (lots of blocks room) because I picked up an extra ninpo partway through the level, I can just double jump immediately and then switch to blue to cast a tornado.

	"Phase 2 was straight forward as there is a forgiving invincibility window which allowed me to sacrifice frames without wasting any time so instead of 3 hits per big jump, I did 2 hits per small jump which made the last 2 hits easier to figure out as I would have to move my ninja to the right to avoid the fireball trap, getting hit from that after selecting STOP Movie would have killed my character.
