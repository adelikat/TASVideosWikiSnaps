	"Sludge Vohaul is an ugly, evil genius and original brain behind the Star Generator of Space Quest Chapter 1.  He's got a bit of a grudge against the people of Xenon for re-purposing the Star Generator into a mechanism to sustain life instead of being used as the weapon Vohaul originally designed it to be. Vohaul is also slightly peeved toward Golden Mop recipient, Roger Wilco (aka TAS), for foiling his plan of having the Sariens steal the Star Generator back for him.  Mr. Sludge devises a new plan to infest Xenon with an army of robot Insurance Salesmen, which he somehow believes will sap the desire of life out of the people of Xenon.  Vohaul also kidnaps Roger to prevent him from again foiling the plan.

[p 
	"Unfortunately, as he did with the Sariens in Space Quest 1, Vohaul doesn't hire the brightest goons; and Roger is marooned on the planet Labion.  Will Roger survive?  Will he escape the planet? Will he be able to stop the evil mastermind of Vohaul?  STAY TUNED!

This would, however, force the player to navigate those tunnels without the gem in Roger's mouth; resulting in as a series of plain black screens which--while being technically more impressive--would be less entertaining as there would be nothing to see.  So this is potentially a very minor speed/entertainment trade-off.

He takes the shuttle off the planet and tries to escape but has the shuttle controls overridden by Vohal which brings Roger to the asteroid.  It's a really boring portion to watch...I highly recommend fast-forwarding it or watching the clipped encode instead.
