	"This is my first TAS I have finished. Planning took some time, and I continuously found more bugs and techniques. Took around a month to make this. This game is pretty cool. Nice stages and skills and so on. I'll maybe work on an improvement if you like this.

	"About the game; everytime I kick/jump, I lose one frame. Enemy drop depends on the frame they get killed, that's why it looks slow and sloppy sometimes, but believe me, it's worth it. I think it's not possible to zip right, but I zip up and left in this movie.

	"European version is slower, but has faster texts. Personally I like USA more and chose it. Movie surprised me with its 27:34 time, thought it would be under 25 minutes. Some bosses are slow, and when you fly to other island and collect gems take much time.
