	"We improved our previous pacifist TAS in 57 frames this time. The main improvement is let 2P game over at the last of stage 4, and start stage 5 with 1 player. The first truck can bring us more extra scroll drag, which makes 1p not need to jump up and hit the truck, and the corpse can disappear earlier and resurrect earlier.

[div class=p 
	"Compared with the previous TAS, this TAS appropriately increased the ornamental value. In this TAS, there is no need to shake the muzzle up and down to control luck, which makes the TAS look smoother, and the 1p and 2p actions are more synchronized. In the fifth and sixth boss, we have controlled the picture error of the enemy to show more glitch. Like the previous any% TAS, we control the muzzle and bullets to match the game BGM, making TAS more interesting.

	"Because of the eight frame rule of the third boss, we have no improvement before the third boss. We readjusted 2p's score so that 2p got 18700 points after the fourth boss. We improved 5 frames at the 3rd boss, including 2 real frames and 3 lag frames. If the lag frame is deleted, the speed of the third boss is the same as any% TAS. We have proved its optimal solution in the submission of any% TAS.

[div class=p 
	"In the fourth stage, we control the bullets in a new way, saved 1 frame in the first tunnel, and saved a total of 4 frames of lag in this stage. The fourth boss is the same as any% TAS, which wastes some time for 2p to die, but the fifth level can be much faster.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"In the fifth stage, one player mode can save more frames at the first truck. When we let 1p die at the second truck, we spent a lot of time controlling luck, got the perfect position of the enemy, and avoided a jump in the previous TAS, which was saved 1 frame. The fifth boss is same as the previous TAS, because we need to wait for the bullet of boss to kill 2p.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"In the sixth stage, for the jump before the first flame, we saved 2 frames by better jumping height control. Good luck in this pass, saved one pause, which saved 2 frames. The sixth boss is same as previous.

[div class=p 
	"In the 7th stage, we made 1p jump one more time at 24845 frame, so it would be 1 frame slower. But in this way, the jumping height of frame 25404 and 25503 is reduced. Each jumping saves one frame, which is faster as a whole. This technique may be used to upgrade any% TAS, but because there is only one frame improvement, we do not consider modifying the previous TAS for now. We saved 2 frames at 7th boss, the boss fighting is 2 frames slow by any% TAS.
