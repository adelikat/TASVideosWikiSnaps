The second part is a boring auto scroller where I get bored and start jumping and changing mario's direction rapidly. The boss of the level is Iggy Koopa, it's very simple, just jump on him several times and he'll fall into the lava.

I do somewhat of a tricky jump beetween the boo rings at the beginning of the level. We again, take the secret exit in this level, which we have to fight a boss for. After defeating the boss, the star road unlocks.

	"This is the final level of Super Mario World, Bowser is waiting for the player at the very end. In the level you have a choice of 8 doors, all leading to a sub level that you have to beat to progress further. After you get through 2 of the doors, you get taken to the final hallway which has a light mechanic that I skipped. I had a little bit of trouble getting through this section, losing around 5 seconds. The final boss, is of course bowser. To defeat him, you have to throw back the mecha koopa's that he throws at you. Pretty simple, but I make it a little bit harder, but quicker, by flying over bowser when he's about to throw the mecha koopa's which instantly damaages bowser. After defeating him, you beat the game.

	"There are several mistakes throughout this run, things that should never have been kept. You have an infinite number of retries via save-stating, use them liberally and make the run incredible before submitting. As Challenger pointed out in the submission thread, you're far slower than the fastest run we have for this category even with the blank input removed, and you will need to beat that to have a shot at publication. We have high standards for what we can accept: We are not a repository for any run that is tool-assisted. At our core, we are a records site for TASes, and every new run of a certain category has to be faster than the currently published run for us to be able to accept it. We do keep obsoleted runs for archival purposes, but note that they were at one point the fastest published runs, and were beaten in succession by runs leading up to the currently published run.

	"I'm always glad to see newcomers to the site, of course, so I hope the feedback doesn't dissuade you from sticking around and honing your skills. I recommend reading and learning from the other posts in this submission thread: Invariel's post will help you out quite a bit, for a start, but boct1584 and Spikestuff also give really useful information for newcomers. As for my own personal advice: You may need to spend months or even years learning all of the SMW knowledge required to make a publishable improvement, so I would recommend trying out other games just to hone your skills. SMW TASing has become insanely complex, it's one of the most optimized and technical games we have on the site and I'm almost certain it would be too daunting of a task to handle unless you're really, really prepared for it. Look around the forums and see if there's a thread for a game you know that isn't getting much attention, and perhaps try picking that up as a project. Keep your work within that thread and gain feedback from the rest of the people on the site, learn from your mistakes, and you should be making publishable movies in no time.
