	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"You begin with default weaponry, though only missiles are used in this run. Although Shanox's wings, arms and legs are vulnerable to attack, it is not neccessary to destroy them. Two quick shots to the head and it is blown clear. A further two missiles blow the remaining stump of a neck away and it's on to Qualifying Round 1.

]div
[div class=p 
	"What a serious waste of time. Borb is fought very similarly to Shanox, although he is able to regenerate his head and most of his limbs. Thankfully, a single Homing Missile destroys all his limbs at once. I blow off the first head and his second pair of legs so that he can't run away. Destroying the second head kills Borb but it takes a really long time for him to die. While I wait, I blow off his forearms for extra cash and carnage.

[div class=p 
	"A pair of Homing Missiles takes out his limbs and a quick cluster of Missiles to the head leaves the cockpit exposed even before Karl can move. One final missile to the now-exposed cockpit finishes him off. Normally, he would bail out of his mech and run along the ground, firing at you but it seems the Homing Missiles "killed" him beforehand.

He then taunts you with "A cyborg never surrenders!" and your game is over regardless of any remaining lives you may have had. We, however, do not even wait for him to land on the ground before he is pulverized by a pair of Missiles.
