This TM does nothing in Silver, making Gold superior due to this. Crystal doesn't have this nice map corruption TM either, and is even worse due to item 0x00's description crashing the game (in G/S, the item description is a harmless ?).

		"With the party terminator gone, the game lets me swap the moves of "Pokemon" outside of my party. This might seem to be overpowered on first glance, but in reality it's very unlikely data will line up with these "Pokemon" moves/PP. Luckily, it so happens that the 162th "Pokemon" will have Red's event flag in its "moves," so that can be knocked out easily instead of dealing with the E4.

		"Since the game will crash if it heals my party with no party terminator and since the game autoheals right before the credits, I have to get another Pokemon so I have an actual terminator in there so it doesn't just crash before the credits roll. I obtain HM03 for this purpose. This wrong pocket HM's pointer is in the middle of daycare code, specifically the code for withdrawing a Pokemon. In effect it will add a copy of whatever is in the daycare (in this case, nothing, so mon 0x00) to my party, and will add the terminator to go with it.

To do this, I just nuke the party stats with save corruption so all my mons have 0 HP. If all Pokemon in my party are fainted and a battle is initiated, the game activates a failsafe which automatically wins the battle.
