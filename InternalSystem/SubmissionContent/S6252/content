I got to the point where any time I would find a new improvement, it would be nullified by the random slowdowns caused by the game, so I think what I have now is much better.

If there is any more time to be saved in this, it would have to be from better understanding how the slowdowns can be optimized, since the game doesnt produce lag frames during them, it's a guessing game to what reduces it.  Overall, I'm satisfied with the end result.
