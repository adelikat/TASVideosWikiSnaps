	"Splatterhouse: Wanpaku Graffiti is much better known by its English title - Splatterhouse: Wanpaku Graffiti. It is the prequel to Splatterhouse, for either the Turbo Graphics 16 or the Sony Arcade. It was never released outside of the state of Japan, and it was never really all that entertaining to watch when TASed.

I'd put this in the same category as something like Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow, where accomplishing a couple extra tasks leads to an extended section after where the game "normally" ends. To be more specific: There are only two rooms that are unique to the published run/any% route. Every other room in the game is played in both runs.

Often this is just used for entertainment, hitting enemies behind me without slowing down and all that, but it shines in conjunction with a shotgun. Firing a shotgun normally recoils Rick backward quite a ways with each shot. You can see an example of this behavior in the Fly battle. However, if you turn around for a frame on the same frame you fire, then you can still fire forward while having the game think you fired backward.

I even picked up the TG-16 version on that there ol' Wii Virtual Console after beating it several times on emulator. I wanted to see if I could improve Diman's published run, maybe at the very least make it more entertaining to watch, and since I'm obsessed with syncing sounds to music I came up with what you presumably watched here.
