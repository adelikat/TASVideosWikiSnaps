	"Set at the hardest difficulty, this game is insanely hard to play in real time. I seriously cannot understand how the SDA runner achieved such a good time without dying – I know I could never. One mistimed jump could cost you death. Mickey’s jumps are short and his movement is slow when walking. To make Mickey run, simply run down a slope. Constant jumping is used to preserve the speed gained from running.

	"1-1: When I first started off doing this run I was pretty confident that is was greatly improvable, or so had Tompa told me and I improved nitsuja’s initial 1-1 version by 40 frames. When I contacted nitsuja about this he had a whooping 300 frames faster version of this level. This is achieved by using the momentum from throwing a dazed enemy at an object so that it bounces back at you, and then running in the opposite direction, getting hit by the enemy in the back. This is used twice in the stage and will let you gain a MUCH greater speed than simple downslope running.

Then nitsuja told me the boss was not manipulated from what you did during the battle or in the stage, but when you entered the whole level. Just like nitsuja I use the momentum from the last minion to gain speed to jump towards the exit.

Doing a super-bounce (getting the spider’s head under a block so that you don’t bounce up and down between hits) turned out to be slower because of the manipulation required.

I had originally tried to recreate the tactic nitsuja used for him, by jumping over him in the second cycle and shooting through the lava pillar to hit him in the back. After hours and hours of trying this didn’t work, so I kind of gave up on the project. When I came back to it I easily figured out an alternative way which happened to save 23 frames. Great.

Keeping yourself on the platforms while still spraying at the boss, staying away from the fireballs and not falling down is incredibly hard. I managed to save some time here because I aligned myself better on the platforms which allowed for less stoppage in spraying water.

Instead of doing the battle the intended way by stealing the bird’s eggs and launching them at her with the Robin Hood-suit, I do like the un-assisted run and use the magician suit (Zurreco originally found that this was faster). So I get two rounds instead of three. In the second round it is not possible to reach the bird to shoot him at the earliest possible frame when he’s coming down due to being knocked away.

Running on the ice blocks makes you lose speed, but they move faster than Mickey, so I stay on them. At one point I run for a bit on the ground, which makes me lose speed. This was because otherwise I couldn’t pass the spiong-obstacle (don’t ask…), the speed was too high!.

Goofy and Mickey are throwing to eachother while Donald is doing some kind of dance. What the hell is that? Seriously.
