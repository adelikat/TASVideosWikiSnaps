	"Here is my submission of Gex 3: Deep Pocket Gecko for the Gameboy Color, completed in 27’23”.  This cart is a close relative of the N64 game for which there exists a run found 
	[a class=intlink href=/1237M 
		"here
	]a
	". While this game does not have to variety that its big brother does, there still exist some charming elements about the hand-held version, and there are quite a few similarities between the two games. Unfortunately, unlike the N64 counterpart, Gex still wears adorable little outfits, but they do not have any sort of additional powers associated with them. So, throughout this movie Gex appears to be putting together a reunion tour for the Village People, all by himself. Additionally, you may notice that all of the levels and goals which appear in the GBC game also appear in the N64 version, but are now rendered in

	"The most two important things about this game from a TASing standpoint is that: 1) Gex has only one height of jump and one height of tail-bounce, which greatly simplifies optimizing input but leads to a somewhat sloppy looking movie; and 2) Gex is able to instantaneously change his velocity vector to the opposite direction within one frame, thus leading to a total lack of momentum, and thus a total lack of speed monitoring via RAM watching. All in all, this is a rather easy game to pick up and TAS, although there are some small nuances that aren't really worth mentioning here. If I perform a movement that doesn't make much sense, ask about it in the discussion and I'll be happy to answer it.

	$LF

[p 
	"A total of 23 remotes are needed to access the final level, and there are 6 main levels, each having three goal-derived remotes and one remote to be had by collecting all 100 tokens in the level. There are also 2 boss fights, each worth a remote, and one remote to be collected in the overworld. If you’re counting, that makes 21 remotes by conventional means. I chose to access one of the bonus levels (Remote X) for an additional one, and was left to collect the tokens from level one for the final remote needed. I believe the route chosen is probably the best, although there may be slight alterations made to it to make things slightly faster. Although it’s slightly tedious to collect all the tokens, it shows off a rather fun level. It also allows me to collect the first of the three bonus coins I need for the bonus level.

Oh, the TVs release flies when broken, giving Gex powers. Two blue flies will give him extra strength (as seen later in the game), but I have no idea what the purple flies do. Oh, and there's some moon-walking.

The last two remotes are almost identical in their path, and I actually pass by the last TV twice, just to show how stupid of a level this is. I also pick up a bonus level coin to complete my set of 3.

	"Creepy jumping asian girl! Some enemies (like her) are triggers for force fields which have to be lowered to continue on. The mech is a trigger for the door above him, and each alien tube is a trigger for the next door, so even when it seems like there is some flexibility in this game, linearity raises it's ugly head again. I apologize for the long walk back.

So, for 3 of the 5, I damage them once then come back to finish the job so that I don't have to wait for them. I tried this technique with the first elf too, but it proved to be about 20 frames slower.
