	]b

	"The substantial improvement comes from a new route, completely reworked from scratch. By aligning myself for a direct shot to floor 12 immediately on floor 1, I was able to save about 150 frames by turning two less times and not opening a door, minus the extra wait on the title screen for RNG manip. This run also completely forgoes collecting the Midas book, which is a pain in the ass to find as a container drop. Instead, I find three defensive items and two attack items that give me adequate stats against the Minotaur. Also, the Teleport book was found on floor 9 instead of floor 11.

If they're equal, as in this case (spiritual stats need to be multiplied by two), the Minotaur will only use war weapons. Since we previously focused all our efforts on war defense, we can absorb the absolute minimum amount of damage. The Minotaur's stamina, defense, and attack level vary wildly from frame-to-frame; by carefully selecting the frames we attack on, we manipulate the Minotaur to be very weak, being easily defeated and leaving us with only 1 HP to spare.

	"Treasure of Tarmin was the second licensed AD&D videogame on the Intellivision. The gameplay involves exploring a series of randomly generated mazes searching for weapons, armor, treasures, and magical items to battle a wide variety of monsters RPG-style. The game was released in 1982, meaning the 3D dungeon crawler perspective was very innovative for its time.
