	"A month later, we met again. This is the second improvement of Batman. I added some new routes to Batman, 171 frames less than before. Thank you (Riyan), let me realize the shortcomings of previous movies, this improvement also let me have more game skills. thank you very much! I believe this improvement is perfect. Improved more lag and some routes, and killed boss faster. Every time we encounter a different trajectory of the boss, this is of course related to the global timer. Oh! Don't forget to turn up the volume to enjoy the film. That's the main reason I like Batman.
