	"Kato-chan Ken-chan is one of PCE gems by Hudson (it is often abbreviated as "Kato-Ken" in Japan). This game is derived from a Japanese TV program, "Kato-chan Ken-chan gokigen TV". Main characters are Cha Kato (Kato-chan) and Ken Shimura (Ken-chan). They are famous Japanese comedians.

[p 
	"This is a typical side-scrolling action game, but the movement is odd a bit, and it has unique taste. You choose Kato-chan or Ken-chan as the player character, and clear stages using jump, kick, and "fart attack". You meet a boss at the end of each world. To complete the game, you must clear the world 6.
	$LF

[p 
	"This game is released as "J.J. & Jeff" outside Japan. But, it seems there are some differences between JPN and USA version (for example, fart attack is replaced by spray attack). Strictly applying the rule of TASVideos, I wonder I should have use USA version. However, there are some differences as I said. Moreover, I think the characters, Kato-chan and Ken-chan, are essential parts of this game. But this issue may need some discussion.

[pre 
	" 1-3 -> 1-4
	$LF
	" 1-4 -> 3-1

[p 
	"In 6-4, there is a wide pit and the hidden floor doesn't appear without the key. So, in casual plays, we usually warp to 6-3 from 6-4 and get the key, and play 6-4 again. But, in this run, I jump over the pit without getting the key, using an enemy as a stepping-stone.

[p 
	"The movement is managed in subpixel units. For X-direction, 32 subpixels are 1 pixel, for Y-direction, 8 subpixels are 1 pixel. In this run, a large percentage of the effort is put to subpixel optimization.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The heroes can jump to 3 heights (high, middle, low). And the jump height depends on the speed of the hero. But, we can always perform high-jump by pressing <up> and <jump>, or <kick> and <jump> simultaneously.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When the hero performs landings, he sometimes stops to move in X-direction for 1 frame. I call it "landing-stop". This is harmful for TASing and we should avoid it as possible. If the Y-coordinate of the hero exceeds (temporally) the Y-coordinate of the floor at a landing frame, a landing-stop occurs (it might be considered that "the hero is buried under the floor for 1 frame"). So, we sometimes can avoid landing-stops by adjusting Y-coordinate (stamping enemies, adjusting Y-subpixel, etc). Even if we can't avoid a landing-stop, we still can adjust X-subpixel to minimize the loss by the landing-stop. And, landing-stop is also a chance of adjusting X-subpixel.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Note: When we land on the right edge of floors, landing-stops never occur.

]p
[p 
	"Ken-chan doesn't cause landing-stops when he performs high-jumps to the same height. But Kato-chan does.

	"Unfortunately, finishing stages with a lot of vitality wastes time. This game converts vitality to score at the end of stages, and this process takes time in proportion to vitality (7 frames per 1 vitality). So, I could not help colliding with enemies on purpose to adjust vitality. This may not seem so cool, but anyway, I gave priority to saving time :(

	"After passing the goal line of each stage, it takes some time until the blue screen is displayed. And it seems the needed time sometimes changes by 1 frame. In this run, it takes 287 frames in 1-1, 3-1, and 288 frames in 1-2, 3-2. I don't know the mechanism of this thing, and I tried to save 1 frame in 1-2, 3-2, but it failed.
