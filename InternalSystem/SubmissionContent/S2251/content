	"Kato-chan Ken-chan is one of PCE gems by Hudson (it is often abbreviated as "Kato-Ken" in Japan). This game is derived from a Japanese TV program, "Kato-chan Ken-chan gokigen TV". Main characters are Cha Kato (Kato-chan) and Ken Shimura (Ken-chan). They are famous Japanese comedians.

[div class=p 
	"This is a typical side-scrolling action game, but the movement is odd a bit, and it has unique taste. You choose Kato-chan or Ken-chan as the player character, and clear stages using jump, kick, and "fart attack". You meet a boss at the end of each world. To complete the game, you must clear the world 6.

[div class=p 
	"This game is released as "J.J. & Jeff" outside Japan. But, it seems there are some differences between JPN and USA version (for example, fart attack is replaced by spray attack). Strictly applying the rule of TASVideos, I wonder I should have use USA version. However, there are some differences as I said. Moreover, I think the characters, Kato-chan and Ken-chan, are essential parts of this game. But this issue may need some discussion.

[div class=p 
	"When the hero performs landings, he sometimes stops to move in X-direction for 1 frame. I call it "landing-stop". This is harmful for TASing and we should avoid it as possible. If the Y-coordinate of the hero exceeds (temporally) the Y-coordinate of the floor at a landing frame, a landing-stop occurs (it might be considered that "the hero is buried under the floor for 1 frame"). So, we sometimes can avoid landing-stops by adjusting Y-coordinate (stamping enemies, adjusting Y-subpixel, etc). Even if we can't avoid a landing-stop, we still can adjust X-subpixel to minimize the loss by the landing-stop. And, landing-stop is also a chance of adjusting X-subpixel.
