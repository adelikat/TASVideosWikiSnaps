	": First of all, RandomGameTASes, welcome to TASVideos.org! Our submission form is for 
	[b 
		"completed
	]b
	" TASes only. As you realized yourself, your run only completes 1-1 and 1-2, which certainly doesn't result in a completed game. Also, the two levels are not really optimized, which results in a sloppy run that we can't accept on this site. I'm going to quote the text above the submission form you might have missed:

		" or other places. If you are simply looking for a place to store your movie files for distribution to other members, please consider
