	"As noted by warmCabin in 
	[a class=intlink href=/5939S 
		"his current submission
	]a
	", there are still some minor optimization opportunities when it comes to inputting the answers.  Basically it must be decided whether to switch directions to get to the next letter or wrap around the alphabet to the next letter.

And there's hardly even any gameplay to even start considering it for Moons - it's all just dice rolls and entering word letters on blind "guesses". The submission text already makes clear that it has little hope of being acceptable, given these issues - as such, rejecting.
