	"This game has a decent character roster of 6 heroes with their own special abilities, strengths and weaknesses. Unfortunately a few of them are just not good enough to be used. Our squad of choice is:
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Ms Megawatt - Fastest runner in the game, even faster when you upgrade her. Shoots lightning bolts at enemies potentially at diagonals which is very useful in the sewer levels. Her shots have a 1s cooldown before being able to shoot again, so her shot speed isn't the best.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Buzzsaw Girl - Potentially highest DPS in the game in the right situations. Fastest shot speed. Her upgrade allows her to do a flip move that can hit multiple times in certain scenarios.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Toolbox - A walking Hammer. Very slow, terrible melee attack but an incredibly useful special upgrade which lets him jump up and down and can potentally hit some enemies numerous times per jump. He destroys big targets like the Robosaurs very quickly.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Radium Dog - He can fly with his upgrade (but we don't bother to do that) but he also is far and away the best character for the final boss.

[div class=p 
	"The objective here is to clear 10 waves of robots across the various streets, and you're not beholden to a certain path. The route we take lets us grab all the powerups we need very efficiently. We need to fully deck out our squad with powerups before we get to the sewers (tehcnically there's a way around this but it's slow.) 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"We use Ms Megawatt here for her speed and her shot power. The final wave of robots normally take two hits to kill but her projectiles can do it in one hit. Regardless of the order, each consecutive street that you haven't cleared gets "harder" to the tune of more/more powerful enemies.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"You'll also see me fire off-screen a lot. In a lot of instances you can kill an enemy that's slightly off screen which is pretty good due to how the enemies spawn. Also this game has some of the worst hitboxes you'll ever see. Give it a try RTA.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"When you kill an enemy, another one spawns, usually in the same direction as the enemy you just killed. Moving horizontally can mess with the spawn speed and push the enemies further back. There are instances where I stand still to let an enemy spawn before running at it, else I run the risk of it not spawning fast enough.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"After you clear the final wave, you get a message that the boss spawned. The boss is a blimp, and it's where we get our first use out of Toolbox. His jump ability can destroy it in 3 hits, which we can do in just two jumps. We grab the first supercharger and it's off to the mall.

	"There are 3 floors. Floor 1 has a Robosaur, Floor 2 has 2, and Floor 3 has 3 and the boss. This is very straightforward.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Robosaurs are very strong. If you leave them alone they start spawning little exploding mini dinos which do a ton of damage. The Robosaur is also very strong in melee range. however, Toolbox makes very short work of these Robosaurs since he can hit 5-7 times per jump and they only take 20-24 hits based on what floor you're on. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Once the Robos are dealt with, the boss spawns which is basically just a head with a gun. This is where Buzzsaw shines. Her flip can hit multiple times like Toolbox's jump but she flips faster and is better at hitting lower targets. She makes quick work of the boss and it's off to the sewers.

	" The Sewers
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"This is a level like the Streets but with an interesting route. There are two types of encounters here. Lizards and birds. Megawatt is better for the birds, Buzzsaw is better/faster for the lizards and we route this accordingly. Switching characters takes 2 seconds, so back and forth switching would be 4 and we want to avoid this.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The lizards take two hits, which buzzsaw can pump out quickly, plus she can ascend or descend without a ladder by using her power. Even though Megawwatt is faster on paper, the slower shots make her just too inefficient for those levels.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Since Buzzsaw can't shoot diagonally and has to flip into birds twice to kill them, we opt for Megawatt's diagonals to save the day.

[div class=p 
	"This is a joke of a fight. The superchargers we've been collecting both make us invincible and we do 10x damage to the boss. There are 4 shields you have to bring down, which equates to "do 256 damage 4 times" and oddly enough he starts with 25 damage. I shoot on the way in to make that 26 which saves one attack cycle for the MVP of the fight: Radium dog.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"We get into position and Mayhem has no idea what to do against melee characters so he just jogs in place while we kill him. After each shield, we pop another supercharger and go to town until he's down. After the first shield he starts at 150 damage so we only need to hit him 11 times per. A very anticlimactic boss fight (unless that was the point like "you're OP, wreck this fool.")
