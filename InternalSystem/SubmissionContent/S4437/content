	"Zephyrz: This was the first game I ever speedran in real time, so I thought it would be appropriate for it to be the first game I complete a TAS of. With the new OoB glitch I really wanted to see how much time it saved on the TAS level, and thought I did well with my initial run; however, that's when MESHUGGAH got a hold of it. He came along and cut it down with optimizations to what you see here today and I honestly couldn't be happier.
