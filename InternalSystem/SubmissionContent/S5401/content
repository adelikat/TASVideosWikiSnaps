	"50 frame improvement to fsvgm777's run of this game through optimizations of jumps in several places. Most of the improvement comes in the form of a quicker stage 58 and ending the input earlier on the final "level," but several other stages had 1 frame improvements. I left fsvgm777 as an author of this movie since he put a lot more work into this run than I did (and I used his original movie file for edits as well); I'm not sure if I need to add him anywhere else on the submission to give credit, but let me know!
