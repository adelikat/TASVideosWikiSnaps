	"A decently popular homebrew button mashing game from 2002. I always enjoyed this game and I love button mashing and pattern searching (i.e. Tetris hypertapping) so figured I would TAS it just to watch it get blown out of the water.

	"After my initial TAS, I went back over 100~ re-records and researched if the cycle of inputs would eventually fall "out of sync" and start the round on a blank frame, with the input being on the second frame, particularly due to the difficulty increasing and each round lasting more time (= more frames). I figured if a round lasted an odd number of frames (or even, vice versa), the cycle would go off sync and the blank & input pattern be thrown off. (i.e. starting a round on a blank frame and the input being second, i.e. a frame late) For this, I hand-input the cycle starting only on the first possible frame of each round (which was a lot more arduous than it sounds).

	"On the "last" level, the input speed of the CPU matches the maximum possible input speed of the NES, so the game continues infinitely. As such, I allow the round to be lost instantly to complete the TAS, and first and foremost overall, end the input earliest. However, I thought it may be of interest if the encode includes this struggle for a few seconds to make the point complete (although not count towards time and purely for encode purposes):
