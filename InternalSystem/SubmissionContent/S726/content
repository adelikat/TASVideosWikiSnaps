	"The hard part about making this run is that while it's easy to get close shots and score birdies all the way, adjusting them to land right into the hole from a long distance requires a lot of tries and experimentation since the aiming doesn't allow enough precision ... I averaged about 70 re-records per shot. At least there's multiple ways to adjust a shot (aim, curve, club, wind and previous shot) so there's always a winning combination. I often ended up doing really curved shots or other weird things, but seeing them work anyway should look good.
