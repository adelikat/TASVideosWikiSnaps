	"Done on the USA course, but the Japan one could be interesting too since it's harder but probably doesn't allow a -39 score.

	"Played as Big Jumbo since he shoots the farthest (and swings the fastest). All waits are to manipulate luck, mostly to get good wind, but also to  change the hole's position on hole 14.

[p 
	"The hard part about making this run is that while it's easy to get close shots and score birdies all the way, adjusting them to land right into the hole from a long distance requires a lot of tries and experimentation since the aiming doesn't allow enough precision ... I averaged about 70 re-records per shot. At least there's multiple ways to adjust a shot (aim, curve, club, wind and previous shot) so there's always a winning combination. I often ended up doing really curved shots or other weird things, but seeing them work anyway should look good.

	"The hardest holes to clear were 11 (221Y shot) and 14 (super rough all around the green), 16 would be too if it's even possible to get an albatross on it.

	"The ending is always the same, it'll say "Nice game!" whether I score a perfect -39 or the opposite, +144 ...
