		"Routing - In comparison with the WR, your route is certainly not capable of picking up the required items to complete the category. I don't have a specific example, but if you watch your run against the WR...the route is definitely not up to par. In fact, you are still searching for your 16th star, as Suigi is ending his run.

	[li 
		"Execution of mechanical movement - I've noticed that many of your techniques are not speedily performed. Comparing to Suigi, your execution is very sluggish.  One particular action is when you perform your backwards jump to clip through doors and walls. Additionally, with all other techniques...you are just not as aggressive.

	[li 
		"Hesitation - There are times at which you wait to perform actions. In my experience...waiting is almost always bad, especially in the case of Super Mario 64. For example, speed runners catch Bowser when he falls back from being thrown at the explosives. It would cut a lot more time if you position yourself where he lands.

Even if you had beaten it...the category for 16 stars currently existed under a "Low %"  branch, which means that later submissions are using 1 Star, and eventually 0 Stars. Because of this, the low % category comes down to obtaining a key to get into the final area. Your run does this, but it doesn't beat those times.
