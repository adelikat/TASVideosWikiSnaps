	"About True Ending :-
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"To obtain the True Ending Player must claim all the 9 life upgrades, Claiming all Life Upgrades unlock the "Water Sword" which is the strongest Primary weapon in this game and it can harm Dahaka (but Prince doesn't know about that it can harm Dahaka). After Water Sword unlocks player must pick it up from its pedestal in order to get True Ending.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"In True Ending our final boss is Dahaka, who is theoretically one of the strongest boss in the Videogame history, he is unstoppable and no weapon in this world can harm the Dahaka.
	$LF
	"While in "Bad Ending" our final boss is Kaileena.
	$LF
	"True Ending leads us to story of the next game in Prince of Persia franchise.

[div class=p 
	"Life Upgrades are pretty well hidden in the map of this game. The most hidden life upgrade is the 1st one which I claim very first in this run, Normally this life upgrade was supposed to collect after we gain "Scorpion Sword" (which has the ability to break Cracked walls) and involves backtracking but we climb up to the life upgrade by the use of a barrel, Normally the barrel breaks as soon as we land on it but if we land on it from a very specific angle then there are actaully some frames in which we are able to move and wallrun up to life upgrade corridor. Life Upgrade corridors are full of deadly traps and after successfully passing them one can claim the life upgrade.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Normally this game is played on PC, almost all (if not all) RTA runners play it on PC at 60 FPS, but for the purpose of TASing it I had to use the Console Version of it, this one is Nitendo GameCube and it runs on 30FPS and due to this reason some skips don't work as same as PC Version.

[div class=p 
	"The Current RTA WR on this category is 1:59:15 and you might be wondering that why this TAS is only 2m24s faster than current RTA WR ?
	$LF
	"This because in RTA Category a Player is allowed to delete the Video folder from the game's directory and hence it skips all the  unskipable Cinematic Cutscenes from the game in RTA but that is not the case in TAS because I must use the Original, Unmodified and good quality ROM. Disregarding those cutscenes this run should be around a little less than 15 minutes faster.

	"Talking about movement there are many ways of movement in this game:-

	"Wallrun has the fastest animation among all these but the end part of the wallrun has slower animation.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Side rolls are faster than wallrun and normal rolls overall in the long distances but side roll setup takes time, side roll setup doesn't take long time to setup when we are about to move sideways.

[div class=p 
	"Normal walking is slowest of all on plain surfaces but when you are going downstairs then your walking speed increases a lot and becomes fastest among all (only in high inclined downstairs).

	"In some areas  game was behaving slightly different from PC version like in sacred caves (at 1:27:51) while climbing upto the ledge I was not able turn in desired direction before getting up so it lost like a second there and a few more such type of difference were there.

	"The most heart beating moment in this TAS was the last portal (at 1:54:23), this portal takes us from past to the present time, there is a glitch related to this portal, in this glitch this portal doesn't work and you can do nothing more than seeing your hardwork ruined, though the probability of getting this glitch is quite low.

	". It follows a clear ruleset and it's much more entertaining than all the other popular categories, so we can apply it for Alternative. While collecting all life upgrades could be considered as a form of full-completion, it has to be noted that it's also forgoing the usage of a lot of known glitches, so it's no applicable for Standard.
