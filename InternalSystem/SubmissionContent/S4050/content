	"Let me introduce the game again. You can go left or right and use the grappling hook with A. Doors can be used with  "Up". And a little physics: grappling for the minimum time gives the best vertical boost. Grappling for longer time yields in slower vertical speed but same horizontal speed. This is useful to avoid bumping the ceiling.
