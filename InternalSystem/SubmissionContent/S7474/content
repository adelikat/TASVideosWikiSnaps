	"Recently, Pocky & Rocky Reshrined was released as a new entry in the series. I got that urge to finally making a TAS of the GBA game since it was short and there was a fair amount of info already available for use thanks to kalimag. Pocky & Rocky with Becky (also known in Japan as Kiki Kaikai Advance) follows the titular characters as they seal the ghosts that have escaped after a century in their prison. The GBA game plays more like the arcade Kiki Kaikai games rather than the SNES Pocky & Rocky games, so movement options are more limited. Despite that, the game can be completed rather swiftly.

There is a bomb button but it both freezes the player in place and cannot be used by bosses, making them useless for speed purposes.

	"Becky actually originated from the FDS only game Kiki Kaikai: Dotou-hen as the player 2 character. This means she isn't just a 2000s sprite comic recolor of Pocky made for the game but still a weird choice for a third character. Anyways, her special shot is essentially the spread gun from Contra and has the best DPS in the game. Thus, Becky is the character of choice for absolute speed though for RTA it requires a lot more risky play and heavy mashing. It can be rapid fired quickly though there is variable time between shots. For some reason when rapid firing, the shots that are still on screen slow down their movement and linger on screen longer which may explain how the Nue boss fight worked out.

	"Sadly, Rocky got the short end of the stick with his special shot. His special shot is shooting multiple homing shots that chase down and hit enemies. The number of homing shots is 2 per purple ofuda level. Unlike the bootleg 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Mo Jie Qibing|href=/4294M)
	", bosses don't have i-frames after getting hit so having shots hit the boss after a certain time isn't really useful compared to absolutely aggressive play with other shot types. Even worse, Rocky's homing shots see a reduced benefit from blue ofuda boosts compared to the other shot options which is bad due to the item rank system. While a perfectly fine character for first time players and more cautious players, for damage Rocky is probably better off with the red ofuda shots.

Red ofuda give a piercing red shot that pierces through enemies. Yellow ofuda give shots that go across the screen but are otherwise much weaker than other shots. Blue ofuda adds extra damage to each of the shots currently equipped and can be stacked up to level 3 alongside another color.

There are also pickups that grant temporary invulnerability or a temporary CPU controlled assistant. The key is found out in the open in a static location and are required to spawn the boss. The invulnerability and assist pickups come with a lengthy animation so they are avoided to save time.

	"Since this game hews closely to the arcade Kiki Kaikai a ranking system apparently was implemented. There are two systems in play: item rank and life rank. Item rank goes up by 2 for every pickup collected including keys. Life rank is dependent on the number of player lives in reserve. These directly affect how much HP bosses have and apparently also affect their AI patterns. I avoid earning points throughout the game so that the final boss has less HP without having to die.
