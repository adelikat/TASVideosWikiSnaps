	"If you try to condor head too close too a small enemy you will end up throwing the enemy and wasting time instead. By inputting the opposite direction you want to condor head the frame before you press 1, you can prevent Kirby from tossing the enemy.

	"The fastest method of ascending without a ladder is actually frame-perfect condor dives, not just jumping. I didn't realize this until around 3/4 of the way through the run and I didn't want to suddenly start using a completely different method of ascending midway through so I purposefully didn't use it. For future TASes, do this.

[div class=p 
	"By doing a Spiral dragon with Landia the exact same frame your invincibility runs out, you can get hit by the Lor Starcutter and deal damage to it on the same frame. This is the fastest way to deal damage to the Lor Starcutter but obviously you have to wait for your invincibility to run out every time you do it.
