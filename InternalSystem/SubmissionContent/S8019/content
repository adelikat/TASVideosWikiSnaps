	"KUBO 3 is the last game in the KUBO trilogy of homebrews. This time it was made entirely by the child after his dad noticed he didnâ€™t need any help. Continuing from KUBO 2, Teenage Mutant Cowboy KUBO just saved his village by literally just collecting a ruby. Unfortunately, some mysterious asshole from the sky starts bombing the village - and the innocent people who live there. KUBO must retrieve not one, but five gems to restore peace to the village - once and for all.
