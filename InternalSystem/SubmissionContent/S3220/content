One of the most iconic, celebrated characters of MK, but here he has to eat the humble pie as he ends up in metaphysically bewildering trifles against his will more than once during the run.

	"As mentioned, giving input to some moves is a nightmare. Especially the morphing prompts are complex and take extra care to use. You see, if you finish your input while another action is taking place, like punching or ducking, the input goes to waste. Even worse, many morph prompts have something like an extraneous punch or even a jump in the middle of them, causing this kind of situations to happen all the time. For example, Mileena's morph prompt is Forward, Block, Kick, Forward, Kick. In a TAS you can fool the game by starting with a few frames of blocking or ducking, then giving the rest of the input while the blocking or ducking animation is on. Optimally it takes 10 frames to finally finish the prompt, just in time as the blocking or ducking animation ends. Sometimes invisible lag messes this count up, but whatever. I devised this kind of "quickest possible" prompts for all the characters before starting the run so that there would be less guessing and annoyance during the making of the run.
