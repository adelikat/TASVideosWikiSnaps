	"Also, this time around we learnt that each level can only be completed every other ingame frame. If lag had occured earlier in the level we could abuse this by waiting 1 frame at the laggy area to remove the lag frame and thus advence the ingame counter in order to always sure that the level is completed at a "good" frame.
