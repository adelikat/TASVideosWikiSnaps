	"Thanks to Pasky13's HUD lua script, feos' DT2 lua script and helping with DT1 and Aglar for being much more precise than me, we implemented more time savings into a proper "difficult" run (unlike any other published ones IIRC).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"We traded lag frames, removed lag frames, made better jumps to fall down faster or reach places earlier and manipulated bosses to be fast and close to us as much as possible.

	"It was a pleasure to work with Aglar. He is a good TASer. That's all, see you until my next TAS =)

	"Got interested in joining after playing a little with the early parts of the game and found out that there might be more things to improve than I earlier thought. And even if it's not a big improvement timewise it still contains quite some different maneuvers throughout the run. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"MESHUGGAH did a good job finding some stuff that I had overlooked earlier, which was what made me interested in trying this game again. I think we complmented each other really well with my old school and his modern way of TASing.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"One new observation we made was that this game has enemy subpixel carryovers. This means that when an enemy in a certain memory location leaves the screen, its subpixels remains and are taken over by the next enemy that spawns in that memory location.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Also, this time around we learnt that each level can only be completed every other ingame frame. If lag had occured earlier in the level we could abuse this by waiting 1 frame at the laggy area to remove the lag frame and thus advence the ingame counter in order to always sure that the level is completed at a "good" frame.
