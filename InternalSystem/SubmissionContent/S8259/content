	"Super Metroid Impossible is a romhack made by Saturn in 2006 that makes the game, especially bosses much more difficult. Bosses have more aggressive AIs and more health. Enemies and hazards do more damage and the world and items have been moved to withhold useful upgrades from the player.

	"The TAS aims to complete the game by beating all four major bosses and then mother brain as quickly as possible by taking damage and abusing minor glitches that RTA runners use such as moonfall and grapple jumps.

	"The route is mostly identical to the optimal RTA route, I based this off Zoast's record. The major differences are skipping the energy tanks in the X-Ray Scope room and Watering hole, as well as the reserve tank in Norfair Reserve Tank room. Skipping the second reserve tank made the double damage boost off the crab to grab plasma and skip spring ball more difficult. Since each hit deals 120 damage, one tank isn't enough to survive another hit so bomb spread is used to kill the crab and get a health drop after the second hit using pause buffering to stay alive at 0 health. Thanks to Sniq for helping me with that trick. Skipping the energy tanks really only affects the hell runs. TAS movement is enough to make it through with significantly less health than a human could.

	"This run obsoletes a TAS by Cpadolf from 2008. Its time was 1:21:40. A lot of the improvement comes from the moonfall in Green Brinstar Main Shaft to collect power bombs early. This skips a long trip through the Wrecked Ship and Maridia, allows for getting super missiles before Kraid and allows delaying Phantoon until Samus has more upgrades.
