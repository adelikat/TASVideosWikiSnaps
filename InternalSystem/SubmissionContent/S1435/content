	"The plot is rather original for a Mario game. Donkey Kong was watching the television one day, when he saw an advertisement for the new Mini-Mario toy. Falling in love with the Mini-Marios, DK rushed to the nearest store, only to find them sold out. So, DK heads to the Mini-Mario factory and steals a bag of the toys. Mario intercepts DK outside the factory, but DK runs away, Mario rushing to catch him. And so the chase begins...

	"This game is a combination between a puzzle game and a platformer, and a remake of the Game Boy game DK '94. Mario must stomp colored switches, bounce off of springs, bash enemies with trash cans, and defeat Donkey Kong at the end of each world to free the Mini-Marios and stop the ape from causing more michief.

	"This game features six 'regular' worlds, six 'plus' worlds, and twelve 'expert' levels. In the first six stages of each world, Mario must bring a key to the door in the first half of the level, then grab the Mini-Mario in the second half. The seventh level is a 'Mini-Mario' stage where Mario must guide the six Mini-Marios to the toybox. The eighth level is a battle against Donkey Kong.

	"The game has an automatic scoring system, and there are high-scores to beat for each level. The high score is directly dependant on the amount of time left in the level, but there are other ways to collect points, including collecting the three presents, bopping enemies, and hitting bricks with your feet. If you beat the level's high score, you earn a star. More stars unlock more expert levels. There are a total of 90 stars in the game to collect. Since a straight 'fastest-completion' run would look more or less the same as a 100% run, I decided to aim for 100%. So, my goals for making the movie were (in order of more to less important):
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		"100% completion (all levels beaten, all stars collected, all high scores)
		$LF
	]li
	[li

		$LF

]ul
[div class=p 
	"The 'highest score' constraint means that I try to get extra points from killing enemies and the like if the points gained are more than those lost from the time spent. It's of course possible to complete most levels faster and still get a high score, but I think getting the highest possible scores in every level adds to the entertainment.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"If you collect the three presents in a level, you get to play one of two mini-games. If the timer at the end of the level is even, you play a roulette game with your boxes. If the timer is odd, you play a game where you can switch boxes to avoid DK's fist. The first minigame takes much less time to play than the second game, so I opted to end levels on an even digit to always play the first minigame and save time (this is the exception noted above). The end result is slightly more boredom from having to see the same game all the time, but much less from having to spend less time in the minigames. I feel that this choice improves the entertainment of the run. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"So, in an attempt to manipulate the timer, you will see noticable pauses at the end of some levels in order to end on an even digit. This also means that there may be better strategies for some levels, but the time saved from the strategy could be offset by having to wait for the timer. On the other hand, better strategies on levels where I had to wait could save extra time from not having to wait.

]div
[div class=p 
	"Here is a short list of Mario's important moves used in the run:
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		"Backflip - This is probably the most important of the moves. Achieved by running forward, turning around, and jumping during the skidding animation. It allows for triple the normal jump height. This is extremely useful for jumping up to higher ledges quickly, and for taking unusual routes through some levels.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Handstand - Done by pressing down and jumping. Mario walks on his hands, preventing falling objects from hurting him (if they hit his feet, they fall away and give 50 points). Only used when necesary (since mario walks much more slowly on his hands), but an important lead-in to the next technique.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Somersault - After doing a handstand, jumping forward will give a larger jump than normal, then the third jump is the somersault. This trick is important because it has more horizontal range, and ever-so-slightly more vertical range than the backflip, so I use it in places where a backflip will not reach. It is less useful, however, because it takes a long time to set up, and a backflip is almost always quicker to perform.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[div class=p 
	"Some other gameplay notes:
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		"If Mario falls from too far, he will flounder around on the ground for awhile (or, if the distance is too great, will simply die). It wastes a lot of time to fall, so sometimes I need to move closer to the ground to prevent this from happening.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"On wires, Mario has a minimum amount of time before he can jump up. It may seem like I'm taking an unnecessarily long time to traverse a wire, but sometimes it's faster to simply scoot along it.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[div class=p 
	"In the making of this run, I discovered several glitches/tricks:
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		"After picking up an enemy from above, if you throw the enemy before hitting the ground, Mario will stand in midair until the throwing animation stops. It is possible to jump during that state. I use it to reach platforms an extra block above me without having to backflip.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"If you throw an enemy forward right before you walk off an edge, Mario will keep running (again, until the throwing animation stops) off the edge as if there was still a platform there. I use this in a few places to jump forward a few extra blocks.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"If you jump towards an enemy that is moving towards you, and you catch the edge of the enemy, Mario will suddenly be pushed forward to the top center of the enemy. This is used to glitch into spaces that are normally too small for Mario riding on an enemy.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Autofiring the A (jump) button will prevent Mario from grabbing ropes and vines, for some strange reason. This is a good trick when there are several vines in a row and I want to traverse them without grabbing each one, or when I want to jump to the floor without catching other vines. (On a side note, autofiring A during a handstand after moving forward will make Mario continue to move forward without holding left or right. But that's not used in the run)
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Autofiring the down button while on a conveyor belt in a one-block tall space will boost Mario forward at about double the normal conveyor speed. Unfortunately, I did not discover this trick until about halfway through the run (in World 6), so there are some improvements that could be made.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Jumping into the ceiling will boost Mario forward slightly. So, it's important to jump whenever Mario's head can hit the ceiling. In small (1.5 block tall) spaces, I can even autofire the jump button to make Mario zoom at double speed.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Projectiles will only hurt Mario if he is standing or moving down. I seemingly go right into fireballs without being harmed on several occasions.
		$LF

	"A pretty messy setup, but the key here is to press the switches that will drop the bomb on DK, and to press them again only at the exact moment DK does (to revert them to their previous direction). It looks strange, but it's actually somewhat straightforward.

Look for an any% submission in the future!
