[div class=p 
	"Why do you have to manipulate Y position? I do this to guarantee the final Y positions of the last 1 or 2 steps before enemies get to ledge are divisible by 2 (Y % 2 == 0). This is the only way to 100% guarantee Y will be equal to FE when get to ledge. The slight "bump" I give to Lindas by elevator changes their Y value to something that guarantees I'll get a Y value equal to FE.

]div
[div class=p 
	"If I don't manipulate Y positions, All direct paths to ledge (meaning mobs never walk back up towards elevator) always result in the same Y values once they get to the ledge. This leaves the Y positions for Lindas always greater than (FF, 00).
