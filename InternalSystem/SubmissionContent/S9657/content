	"A note to publishers: there's some intense flashing in some places. Mainly, the start and the end of boss fights with rapid black and white flashing for the background. Boss fights start around frames 101000, 162300, 171600, 175300, and 177600 (phase 2 of the final boss fight). There's also a brief but still kind of bright red flash whenever a desert tile is walked on in the overworld but I don't have exact times for that.
