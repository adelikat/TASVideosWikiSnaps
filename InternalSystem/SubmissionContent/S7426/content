	"The Maze, more commonly known as the Scary Maze Game, was a Flash game created in October 2004. It was made by game developer Jeremy Winterrowd and was inspired by Steady Hand.

	"This Flash prank disguises itself as a simple maze game in which the player has to utilize their mouse cursor in order to move a blue little dot through the maze. At the start screen, there is a note informing the player that the objective of the game is to pass through all 4 levels, and the player cannot touch the walls; however, there are actually only three levels in the game. The game also explains that it is best with the volume on, but, there is no sound in any part of the game except for the very secret level 4!

	": I know there's been some talk about easing the rules on triviality, but...I think even this is a little too far. The gameplay consists of three frames of mouse movement with absolutely no meaningful routing options. This is impossible to do unassisted, but it's trivially easy to make a perfect TAS of this. Rejecting for game choice.
