	"This TAS aims to complete the standard set of levels in Mario vs. Donkey Kong and reach the credits as quickly as possible. While the game scores your performance on a level (based on time, and points collected), this mode is ignored in this TAS. This version is 9176 frames faster (2 minutes and 22.9 seconds faster) than my previously published any% TAS through more precise play, better trick and glitch application, and the discovery of several new tricks and strategies in many levels.

	"Mario vs. Donkey Kong is a fairly complex game (though it may not be obvious when looking at some of the earlier levels), so it was not uncommon that I would discover a completely new strategy to beat a level much more quickly than before. I had also suspected that my previous attempt at this game was sub-optimal due to a variety of small, but common mistakes I made (e.g. autofiring A to skip past menus instead of finding the optimal frame). Because of this, I set out to make a v2 TAS that would fix these flaws and push the game to its limits. People familiar with the game might be surprised by some of the new routes I take through the levels. However, this is most assuredly a puzzle game, and people seeing "Mario" in the game title may make assumptions about how this game looks and plays. My advice to them is to forget that this is a "Mario game" and just enjoy it for what it is - a really great puzzle-platformer with Mario styles and themes.

	"Donkey Kong was watching the television one day, when he saw an advertisement for the new Mini-Mario toy. Falling in love with the Mini-Marios, DK rushed to the nearest store, only to find them sold out. In a furious rage, bursts into the Mini-Mario factory and steals a bag of the toys. Coming to the rescue of his own toy company (probably worrying about his quarterly earnings at this point), Mario intercepts DK outside the factory. DK runs away, forcing Mario to give chase and try to get all the Mini-Marios back.

	"Mario vs. Donkey Kong has very good graphics for a GBA game. The environments are really colorful and detailed, and add a great deal to the atmosphere of the game. Mario's adventure takes him through his toy factory, a Donkey-Kong style jungle, a volcano/fire land, a ghost house, a mystical forest, and a city during twilight. What is, to me, fairly unusual for a Mario game is that it gets just a bit surreal in the mystical forest and twilight city levels. The music really sets the mood here, as well, and is quite a change from typical Mario games.

	"In each of the six worlds, there are eight standard levels to play through. The first six are each split into two parts. In the first half, Mario must find a key somewhere in the level and take it to the door. In the second half, the goal is simply to reach and pick up the Mini-Mario at the end of the level. The seventh level is different in format and has Mario guiding six Mini-Marios to the toybox at the end (though only one has to actually make it, a fact that I exploit to save time). The eight level is a battle against Donkey Kong.

	"Unlike most Mario games, Mario has a variety of methods for moving and jumping. Here's a summary of each:
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		"Backflip - When Mario turns around, he spends some time pivoting on one foot. Jumping during this pivot will make him do a backflip, and is about 3 times as high as a regular jump. It has the benefit of being extremely quick to execute, so it's the best way to jump up to high ledges as quickly as possible.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Handstand - Done by jumping while crouched down. In this state, Mario walks on his hands and can deflect certain falling objects (such as bricks) with his feet. Since Mario walks more slowly on his hands, it's usually faster to just avoid the falling objects. However, this move is an important lead-in to the double jump and somersault.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Somersault - After doing a handstand, jumping will give a larger jump than normal. Doing another jump immediately after landing this one will make Mario do a somersault. The somersault has great horizontal range, and is the slightest bit higher than a backflip. However, it takes a long time to set up, and backflipping is usually much faster.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[div class=p 
	"Some other gameplay notes:
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		"When Mario falls, if the vertical distance is too great, he will be stunned and be stuck on the ground for a few seconds (Mario can also simply die if the fall distance is really large). This is obviously a big time-waster, so I sometimes have to get closer to the ground before jumping the whole way. If you think I'm unnecessarily stopping on platforms on the way down from some place, it's because of this limitation.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Mario is actually fairly hard to control once he's in the air. Once you give him forward momentum, you can only change his direction once (after the apex of the jump). This is the reason for some of the strange positioning while jumping in a few places.

This creates an extra "platform" that Mario can then backflip up to and stand on. I use this in a couple of places (6-3a and 6-5a) where I need to get both Mario and the key over a high wall.

The intended solution is to hit the yellow switch and set up the conveyors so that get the key stuck against the yellow blocks while you climb over and grab it. Here, I found out that with good timing, you can toss the key onto the conveyor belt, backflip up to it, and grab it before it falls off. This basically skips the entire solution and saves a huge amount of time.

The problem was that there was no way to get both Mario and the key back over the wall... but the new key-climb trick turned out to be the missing piece to this strategy. I do have to hit the conveyor switch twice – once to push Mario into the wall where I key-climb (Mario needs to be really close to the wall to make the key stick, and the conveyor going in the opposite direction makes it impossible), and once to get the lower conveyor going in the right direction to setup the second half of the level.
