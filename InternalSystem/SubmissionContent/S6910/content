	"Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus is a 2D flip screen scrolling platform game released in November 1998 on the PS1 and PC. This movie is the first to reach a sub 37 minutes on the PSX version due to the more accurate PSX timing method used on this site which makes the run finish at 36:49, on the emulator however the old timing method is 37:14 which makes this movie 3 seconds faster on the emulator but with the new timing method this movie is actually 28 seconds faster than the current published run. We currently have an active speedrunning community on Discord and this year we have seen some new strats found that can be used in the PSX version of Exoddus. Ultimately the PC version is the fastest for the any% category with fancy glitches like the Advanced Relocation Glitch (ARG) but since we don't have a Windows TAS tool the PC version can't be TASed yet. Also the way the game ends is fixed in the movie where Abe is meant to die in the background and the screen goes back to the first screen of the Boiler.

	"By timing this glitch perfectly you can make Abe stop and turn. To set it up, Abe needs to be standing near a ledge (pressing up whilst tunring arround) you will be able to make Abe do a backwards jump. Notice that when you press the opposite direction to where Abe is standing at the incorrect frame, Abe will just jump up and stand. But if you time it perfectly, Abe will jump backwards and possibly jump to another screen. This will allow you to jump backwards to areas and skip certain areas. Sligfantry's video can show you how this glitch works:
