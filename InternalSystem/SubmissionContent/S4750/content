	" by you, with the only difference that this run is five seconds faster. The previous submission was rejected because the PSX version, being just an emulation of the NES game with worse sound, did not provide any substantially different material from the published NES runs of this game. Particularly, these runs are in many respects almost identical to 
	(__wikiLink|/1103M|1103M)
	". The PSX version's instant weapon switching controls are nearly useless because it can't switch to Magnet Beam which is used most of the time, and Navi mode's alternate soundtrack (which by itself wouldn't be able to save the run anyway) is unused.
