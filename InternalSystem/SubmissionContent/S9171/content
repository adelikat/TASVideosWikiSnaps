	"But, those cables already kind of exist, somewhat, if you jump into where they should be they damage you, and if you do a frame perfect jump at the frame before they damage you, you can buffer a jump to inmediately reach the boss. Now, after you hit the boss, you get behind enough, the animation of the boss pushing you won't work as expected, and it will just teleport you near it, so if you preemptively jump and attack before that happens, you get to inmediately hit him again.

	"RNG changes in a few ways, if you stay still enough that the idle animation finishes, or at certain spots in levels, if you don't jump. It's also used by the chili pepper enemy on Vegetable HQ.

	"There's really only one thing in this game that's dependant on RNG, that matters, where exactly the Pyramid boss comes out in each cycle. Poking the adress to see how changing the RNG would affect the fight, the one I got here is the best, at least without wasting time to get a slightly better one, which would be counterproductive.
