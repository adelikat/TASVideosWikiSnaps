	"This run improves my previous Bionic Commando run by one second. I found that by complete carelessness I left a mistake (that I actually had fixed in another file) in the submission of my last movie. So I fixed it. It's in the last level, where after destroying the sector, I use the grappling hook and land on the platform above the one below it. In the previous movie I used the hook too early, landed below the platform, and had to go up. Pretty stupid of me to leave that in, but hey, it's fixed now.
