To keep things consistent with the objective, I only reset once the "W" appears next to P1's cards so the win is 100% confirmed. When deciding whether to engage the reset or power button, I decided on the reset button because the "W" is retained on the screen longer, and is therefore easier for the average viewer to notice the win did indeed occur.

	"Betting in this game costs time and has no effect on the dealer's decision-making, so it is always fastest to call, and HOPE the dealer also calls as it is also costly if he decides to raise the bet. Next, we obviously decline to trade in cards as that is just extra costly animation(s). The dealer never decides to fold in this game (which would be quickest if he could), and will instead trade in 0-3 cards. You might think, "Well obviously the less cards the dealer decides to trade the faster, right?" Thing is, if the dealer trades in 0-2 cards, he seems to ALWAYS want to raise the bet right afterward. On the other hand, if he trades in 3 cards, I guess he must have lower confidence in his hand because only then will he sometimes call afterwards. This is the scenario we want. One more thing: we also want the dealer to trade in his 3 center cards as the replacement cards will have less travel distance as they fly onto the table compared to if any of the edge cards are traded in.

	"To briefly address the maximum score run, I think the best course of action for it would indeed be the $1 -> $9999 version. "maximum score" should imply "the maximum amount that is actively scored through gameplay", instead of simply setting the score to maximum before any gameplay occurs. I don't see why it wouldn't be acceptable already, but if a discussion is needed over it then the best way of getting that discussion would be with a new submission.
