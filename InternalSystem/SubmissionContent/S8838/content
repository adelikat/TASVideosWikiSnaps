	"I also want to note that this hack applies minor gameplay changes, which isn't a bad thing itself, however through the purpose of fixing the game engine defects, it effectively makes the gameplay itself easier, which kinda cancels the charm of bootlegs being infamously "so bad, it's good". Still, this wouldn't be a issue if this hack was much more widely known and speedran.

	"Additionally, I noticed an obvious optimization mistake at the beginning of the second level played: after jumping, you grabbed the fences too soon, which loses the jumping speed. This isn't enough to cause a rejection, but I still wanted to point it out for future reference. Also note that I only tested thoroughly the first two levels.
