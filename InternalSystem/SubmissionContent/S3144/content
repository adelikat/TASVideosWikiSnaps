	"About the game
	$LF
]h2
[p 
	""Ultraman Ball" is a strange platform game. The hero is Ultraman, but for
	$LF
	"some reason, he transforms into ball form, "Ultraball". Essentially, this
	$LF
	"game seems to have nothing to do with Ultraman, because it is said that this
	$LF
	"game is based on an abandoned NES project, "Armadillo 2". Indeed, this game
	$LF
	"is quite similar to
	$LF

[p 
	"I don't think this game is very nice, but I think it is worth TASing.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Basically, the hero moves fastest when he is in Ultraball form and in the
	$LF
	"air. But the mechanics of this game is a bit complicated.

[h2 
	"Tricks
	$LF
]h2
[h3 
	"Levitation
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"When you turns into Ultraball, any acceleration is disabled at the frame,
	$LF
	"and Y-velocity is reset to 0. So you can virtually levitate by pressing <B>
	$LF
	"rapidly in the air.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"And, if you try to turn into Ultraman near the ceiling, you can't do it, but
	$LF
	"any acceleration is disabled at the frame. So you can fall slowly.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Piercing breakable blocks
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"When you collide a breakable block from the side, the direction of
	$LF
	"X-velocity is negated. This is annoying for TAS. But, when you turn into
	$LF
	"Ultraman while you are rising in the air, X-velocity is set to
	$LF
	"16*sign(previous X-velocity). This precedes the bounce by breakable blocks,
	$LF
	"so you can maintain X-velocity by pressing <B> at the same time as you
	$LF
	"collide a breakable block.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Vine boost
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"When you move horizontally while you holding vine, X-velocity is set to 48
	$LF
	"at the frame. So, you can boost by pressing <UP> and <RIGHT> rapidly on
	$LF
	"vine.
	$LF
]p
[h2 
	"Misc
	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"Some stages have bonus areas, and you can finish the stage by playing a
	$LF
	"bonus game. But the bonus game takes about 30 seconds, so it is no use for
	$LF
	"TAS.
