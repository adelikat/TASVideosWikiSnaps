	"Large Combos inflicts significant damages, just equal to that of 20 Chains. (looks this isn't a glitch) But 27 or more Combos earn only equal damage to that of 26 (21 or more Chains do also), so I use 26~28 Combos. Because a 26 Combo can't make any opponent's life to 0, some Chains are put. The Chains need to become bigger as game proceeds naturally, and  exceptionally in level 11, puts a Combo because Hitmontop have most lifepoints (than Murkrow and Dragonite) and putting Combo is faster than Chain. Combos can inflict damages immediately because numbers of Combos are decided when the Combos occured, therefore I can defeat opponents quickly.
