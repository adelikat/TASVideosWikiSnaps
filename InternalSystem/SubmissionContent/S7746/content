Doing so on the 7th rank is difficult, so I chose to do it with the pawn on the 6th rank. By setting up an attack along the e8-h5 diagonal, the core strategy is thus to displace the Black f and g pawns as soon as possible, position a white pawn on g6, and have the White queen on h5, to set up the discovered mate.
