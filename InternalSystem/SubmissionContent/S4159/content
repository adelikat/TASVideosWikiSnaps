	": The audience response for this movie has been quite poor. These kinds of runs come of as being inconsistent and arbitrary in their goals, and never well received. Why just avoid some glitches and not others? Things which are intentional but can be extremely abused are not used, while things which are not intentional are.

	"If you want to create a different kind of Mega Man run, I recommend creating one which avoids the optional Magnet Beam item. It can be considered low% which is an official category on the site, and at the same time is only possible in a TAS, so it's special. Since so many abuses and glitches are tied to this item, it will also offer a very different experience and will stand out drastically in most levels compared to the existing branch.
