	"In short, this is a perfect run which makes use of the games odd juggle system and wonky physics engine to create some hard hitting combos and some interesting carries. The main move used in is the air roundhouse tatsumaki, as it can hit up to 3 times (the juggle limit) and can be used to carry an opponent all over the place.

	"A fairly simple, but very time consuming TAS. The most difficult part was making sure I didn't get wrist cramps. That and dealing with random AI. That through me off a few times. Aside from that, I had a lot of fun making this one, as Akuma is completely broken, as he was in the older titles. One of the funner things about this game, though, is that you have an unlimited number of EX moves once your meter is full (which is broken beyond belief). I don't use it much outside of juggles and finishers, but it opens up a whole new layer of possibilities. I may make a Shin Akuma TAS of this game down the line, as he has unlimited juggle potential.

	"This run appears to have been played live, either at a slow speed or in real time. Menuing is noticeably slow (and was proven so), and there are a lot of blocked/whiffed attacks. For your future TASes, I highly recommend

	", following the advice in the submission thread, and especially checking out the rest of the forums. Study some of the other fighting game runs we have on the site, see what they do right, then come back and give this game another shot with frame advance and careful AI manipulation. Best of luck to you should you decide to do that, and I'm sure a number of other users (myself included) hope you do!
