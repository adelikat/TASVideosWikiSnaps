	"Tempo is a platformer on the Sega GameGear. To complete each level a yellow keynote must be collected that unlocks the exit sign. Tempo is quite fast during his dash state, which is performed with a double tap in the direction you want to dash. Tempo can also flutter, hovering without getting tired until gravity eventually brings him to the floor.

[div class=p 
	"The main problem to overcome in Tempo is that enemies constantly block Tempo's path, interupting Tempo's ability to dash. Tempo has several attacks to deal with enemies. Tempo can land on enemies, roll into them when dashing or roundhouse kick them. Tempo also has a musical note attack that only stuns normal enemies but does damage bosses like the other attacks.

	"Most enemies will knock Tempo into the air after being defeated, so these need to be jump cancelled. Some rolling collisions can be cancelled almost immediately, allowing Tempo to initiate a dash right away. There are sad wilted flowers in each level that serve as checkpoints. Being in the vicinity of these flowers slow Tempo considerably and unless Tempo is already moving fast enough through this area, it saves time to activate them before dashing.

	": There are a couple of shortcuts in the first level where Tempo can jump up to the next platform to skip large parts of the level, fluttering where a bug spawns boosts him up in one place. It is possible to dash through the first set of spikes by damage boosting twice, but if this is done then all the damage boosts in the second level won't be able to be performed due to low health. The start of the second level is a staircase platform area with lots of enemies so it is flown over. Damage is taken to save time with the overhead electric trap and with the spikes throughout the level.

It can alternately shoot a tadpole note that will turn into a smaller frog. The fastest way to kill this boss is to manipulate it into shoot its head downwards, hit it once and then hit it again after the head reattaches.
