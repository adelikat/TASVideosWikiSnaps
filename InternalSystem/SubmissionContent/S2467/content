	"In this final instalment of the Phantasy Star saga, you finally get to fight the root of all evil. Such a quest would normally take tens of hours, but with luck manipulation, it can be reduced to less than two hours
	$LF
	"This TAS is my second. Although it is much shorther than BOF 2, PS4 was actually harder. In effect, the AI for this game is utterly unpredictable. During battle, pressing A at the same frame can yield difference results. The number of times I had to restart to find what I was looking for...

	"Anyway, here are a few tricks to save frames

	]li
	[li 
		" Macros can be used to pre-determine actions. However, they are only useful if they can be used more than once (except for making combination attacks or specific orders, like the psyco-wand macro against Zio). Many people have claimed that targets can be pre-determined when using a macro; I have yet to find evidence for that. When doing healing, the target is usually in the center (see the zio fight)
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" When useful, combination attacks use less frames than two individual attacks
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" With luck manipulation, there is no need to hunt for treasures. Chaz uses only 3 swords during the whole game; I also shop only twice
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" The target in front is most likely to get hit; it can save a few frames
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Having turbo A and B pressed is a (real)-time saver and an in-game saver. Since my characters leve-up during boss fights, they can gain quite a few levels at the time

	"And now, tricks against the bosses

	"_Iglannova_
	$LF
	"Killing Hahn take a long time, and using macros lets the spawns attack. So I had to enter individual commands each time. For its 2nd for (in Zema), I took advantage of his susecptibility to instant death
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"_Juza_
	$LF
	"The trick is to make him cast foi on Gryz as often as possible (and with less than 16 hp of damage). I have Hahn killed after he casts vision (more dexterity)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"_Gy-Laguish_
	$LF
	"His fire breath is his weakest attack. With luck manipulation, Rune can withstand two attacks. Finally, to avoid healing, I waited to have Gryz die.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"_Zio_
	$LF
	"It's the only fight where a macro is used only once. His black energy wave is his weakest attack, and only Rune a withstand it.
	$LF

[p 
	"_Chaos Sorcerer_
	$LF
	"Another boss weak to instant Death
	$LF

	"_Dark Force I_
	$LF
	"With BLessings, his flare shot is easier to resist
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"_ xe-la-thoul_
	$LF
	"The hardest fight of the game. In order to save time, Rika doesn't cast saner. And since they cast a strong attack when they are attacked collectively, I need to take one down first. With enough damage, Rika can cast disrupt to take the first one down
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"_Lashiec_
	$LF
	"Another hard fight. Although he casts possesion (sleep) every other round, his thunderalbrt attack is very strong. I was able to keep everyone but Chaz alive
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"_Dark Force II_
	$LF
	"Shadow breath is his only weak attack (he also casts veil eye every second round)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"_Dark Force III_
	$LF
	"A tricky fight. Because of my low level, only his physical attack can be withstood, and by Wren only. Since his sleep attack can be durable, I have to wait for his anti-saner attack
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"_de-vars_
	$LF
	"the physical boss of Rykros. Therefore, Rune is a good scapegoat to withstand the attacks while defending
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"_sa-lews_
	$LF
	"the magical boss of Rykros. However, for some reason, he can withstand physical skills (2x slash, crosscut). He was second in the order; de-vars gave rika a good defence against fire, his weakest attack
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"_Profound Darkness_
	$LF
	"The root of all evil is relatively easy. During his first form, he only attack Rika; he can also attack raja with shadow breath if he defends previously. For the second form, in order to save time (thanks to Fres Feeling for the trick), I had raja cast miracle so Wren can attack more often. Also, Chaz miraculously withstood PD2's attack. It was quite a tour de luck. For the final form, PD3 can be manipulated to cast megid only once. For the rest, it's a switch between a physical attack and evil eye.
