	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"In 1992 Super Mario Kart defined the genre of "go-kart racing games" with ahead of its time graphics and gameplay that was kept almost unchanged in the numerous sequels it spawned. Its influence can be seen in console racing games as far apart as Wipeout and Crash Team Racing.

	" F.A.Q.
	$LF
]h3
[h4 
	" Why do you take the corners so wide?
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"To get the item I want from an item square I need to hit the square on exactly the right pair of frames. To delay hitting them without losing my speed I sometimes take corners wide.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Why do you bump into so many walls?
	$LF
]h4
[ul 
	[li 
		" To delay hitting item squares
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" To make mushroom boosts last longer (long boosts)
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Because I'm moving too fast to avoid them.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[h4 
	" Why do you sometimes go over dirt and stuff without hopping?
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"I'm in a "mini-boost" and unaffected by dirt and stuff.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Why do you change characters after the Mushroom Cup?
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"I think Koopa is faster for the other cups.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Why do you pause the game occasionally in the Special Cup?
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"To manipulate luck. I only discovered this works when I was up to the special cup.
