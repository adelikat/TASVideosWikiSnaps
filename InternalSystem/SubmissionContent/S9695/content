	"The run is performed on the Sinclair ZX Spectrum +2A. 128K versions of the Spectrum run their Z80 processor at a slightly higher clock rate, and the +2A and +3 also have some improvements in memory access speeds. The main delay in the game is in processing what happens after an action is input. As a result, the game runs fastest on these models. The +3 is a disk-based system, and The Hobbit has never been officially released on disk, so the run uses the +2A and loads the game from tape.

	"There are four versions of The Hobbit; v1.0, v1.1, v1.2, and v1.2 text-only. Each new version fixes bugs present in the older version, and in doing so, adds new bugs. Normally the game would draw graphics for each area, particularly slowly, but v1.2 text-only removes them; in addition, it contains a particularly nasty bug with the parser that's incredibly useful.

[div class=p 
	"The Hobbit has a complex text parser, especially for 1982. It attempts to break down sentences into phrases, substitutes nouns in earlier phrases into pronouns in later phrases, and then executes each phrase as its own action. However, the memory reserved for parsing phrases is relatively small, and using a sentence with a lot of phrases can overflow this buffer and overwrite other parts of memory instead.

	"I added the branch "game end glitch" since this uses a phrase buffer overflow to glitch the game's state straight to the end. There's always the possibility of someone making a TAS without using the phrase buffer glitch although making sure key NPCs cooperate throughout the journey would be a huge challenge.
