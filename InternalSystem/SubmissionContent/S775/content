	"Ecco the Dolphin, a run that i've been doing for well more than a year, (not redoing, just adding a few frames from time to time). The first thing one will notice when watching the run is that ecco kisses a lot of walls. But it can't be helped, at high speed ecco can make turns only every meter, and he has no brakes. So isntead of slowing down to be able to cut sharp corners smoothly i had to bump into a lot of walls to force cornering. Sorry about that.
