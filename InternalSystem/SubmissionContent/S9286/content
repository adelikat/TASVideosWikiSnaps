	"The main movement tech throughout the entire run is sliding. Pressing down + a (or b) will make Kirby slide, starting with a speed of 677 subpixels/frame. When Kirby is in the air, speed is not lost if you're holding the direction that you're moving towards. So, by sliding off a ledge, you can preserve all of that speed, then you can jump at the first possible frame to try to keep it. Every frame you're on the ground reduces your speed by 14, so it's best to try to use big jumps to clear much of the level.

[div class=p 
	"Another important aspect about the run is RNG manipulation. Since the game is very laggy, it's best to avoid certain attacks from enemies, such as a Waddle Doo's beam attack or a Sparky attack. RNG is advanced by doing certain actions that produce tiny stars, such as landing from jumps or from bumping into walls, so a combination of these could give you favorable enemy patterns.
	$LF
	"RNG is manipulated extensively to get good (mini)boss patterns.

	"Probably the most "major" glitch used here. When pausing on the same frame that an enemy loads in, it is still "active", meaning it will still move around and attack. If Kirby gets damaged by the enemy, you can escape the pause menu. When the game is paused, the map's collision is changed to the top-left room, so escaping the bounds of the level is very easy. Most of the time you have to float while in the paused state since trying to jumping or inhaling will unpause.
