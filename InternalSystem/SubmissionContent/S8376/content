	"• The game has a hidden in-game timer that counts the frames. It does not increment during lag frames or while the game is paused.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"• Spindash release speed is controlled by how many times the buttons A, B, or C are pressed and how long the spindash is held before being released. The first button press sets the held spindash speed at 8 pixels per frame. Subsequent button presses raise the speed by 1.5 pixels per frame and each frame the spindash is held lowers the speed by 1/32 of the held speed value. The range for spindash speed is bounded to a minimum 8 pixels per frame and a maximum of 12 pixels per frame and the release speed only occurs in increments of 1/2 pixel per frame. Thus, it takes 6 button presses to release a maximum speed spindash.

	" (found by CubbyCubbyCat) at the Classic Sonic Speedruns, they found out that it is possible to get a time save in this zone by going to the top path and using the blocks to make Sonic upwards and being at the very edge of it to get to the zip area. Forgot to mention, that part doesn't crush you. So after that finding, I found out that it is indeed possible with Knuckles. Well, some of it is... The 1st zip leads into the 2nd zip, There is a part of the level that is slightly open and that part, you need to make the game to think that you're on the top path instead of the downwards. With that in mind, the loop section would be open and you'll be able to go in that area without the wall stopping you. Then I TAS the level normally since the 3rd zip isn't possible with Knuckles because of his jump height.
