	"You may notice I take damage a few times in the run, twice in lv 1 and twice in lv 5. As near as I can tell this is due to an emulation bug. It doesn't happen on the original hardware or even other emulators, just pcxs and appears to be unavoidable. I don't know what causes three of the hits I take but the first damage I take in lv 5 happens at the same time solo's energy saw blades hit a wall so some how the game thinks when the blades hit something I should take damage.

[div class=p 
	"The fastest way to climb a wall is to jump three frames before you touch it, it will cause you to jump before you land on the wall. If on a wall you can press away from the wall to do a hassou jump. It's basicly a quick air dash horizontally and slightly up. You can cancel out of a hassou jump with a midi-giri but not with a double jump. There is no quick way to move along a ceiling so I try to avoid it whenever possible.

You can however cancel it with a strange backwards jump by pressing back and jump in a slide. The jump has very low vertical movement and decent speed but you can't double jump, midi-giri, or even change directions during it so it's nearly useless. Still it's a quick way change directions.

[div class=p 
	"This is basically a 360Â° slash that does more damage then a normal slash so most of the boss fights are about using this over and over as quickly as possible. When used it slows down your movement almost completely. If to many sprites are on screen sometimes it will not show the slashes but it will still do damage. You can only midi-giri once per jump but if you jump at the first possible frame before landing you won't be able to do it. If this move is used as soon as possible before hitting a wall/ground/ceiling the slashes will continue and still do damage but it will cancel Hiryu's animation so this is a way to do the midi-giri without going through the full animation. The quickest way to do repeated midi-giri are attached to a flat wall.

Hien fight is a pain, if your wondering why I pause alot it's because Hien is invincible most of the time when on the ground. If you attack he goes into a blocking animation. Also hitting with a midi-giri is harder because of the moving stage. He takes much more damage when in the middle of his dashing attack witch is why I hit him with a double midi-giri there.
