	"Plok is in a hurry, so he looks for opportunities to travel faster. He's lucky: He finds slides lying around almost everywhere. He finds nice presents making him a lot faster. He finds tiny holes in the Flea Pit making big shortcuts. He finds helpful sawblades, nice guys pushing him into the right direction, and even a lovely fish helping him climb a mountain. Even water helps him climb a mountain to discover one more slide. Being the only creature which can do bigger jumps without his legs, he decides to use this special ability a few times.

	"This game has some mean physics: With your legs, you have to hold "down" while in air after sliding, or your extra speed decreases drastically. Without your legs, you will only lose litte speed in air, but you can't do the high jump. In some places, you need the extra wide legless jump, and shortly afterwards, you need the high jump. But if you shoot them away, they will only come very slow towards you. You can get them back instantly if you hit an enemy or a shell with it. It can be quite complicated to get that work right. You can see a good example for this in Log Trail -- the legs hit the enemy behind me. If this wasn't happening, I would have to wait for the legs to come back, totally destroying the improvement.
