	"I redid the whole movie, and managed to hit the toon town tunnel 200 frames before my previous version.  This time I don't have to stop when driving, because I got lucky with the toon patrol.  The fight with Doom is better, and I don't think can get any better unless somehow someone can manage to start hitting him right as he is backed against the wall.  That way he won't get out of range causing you to stop. (also, thanks to Rick for the spring shoes trick)
