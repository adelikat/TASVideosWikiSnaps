		" RNG can be manipulated in a couple of different ways. One way is to delay an attack: each frame advances the RNG. This method is used occasionally in the TAS to achieve certain damage values on enemy units, and/or to ensure better subsequent enemy movement patterns. Another way is to adjust a movement pattern prior to executing movement. I think some Fire Emblem games share this method of RNG manipulation.
