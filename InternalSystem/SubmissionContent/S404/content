	"there are two modes, arcade and original. I played arcade mode which is shorter but more easy to watch. difficulty is hard.

	"I just played straightforward, aiming for the smallest time. Of course, given that getting hit paralyses the player for a couple of seconds, I had to do it without taking any hit. I didn't mind about items but the grenade launcher and the power bonus which increase weapons efficiency. I had to avoid other weapons and pick the other bonus if they were on my way.

	"well this is my first movie so everything was kinda hard. I tried to kill as much people whithout loosing time. I mainly use the grenade laucher, which main problem is its short range. but it's give a huge amount of damages, allowing me to destroy a lot of tought enemies quickly and it makes some pretty explosions. At the beginning, I had to use the rifle so I had to show some mercy and let several tanks behind. well I hope that people will enjoy it.

	"The game is quite well made, and it has got some cool music. I think it is something rambos and commandos fans may like.
