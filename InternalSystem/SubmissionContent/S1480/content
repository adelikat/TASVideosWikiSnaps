	"Not as popular as Super Metroid or the GBA games, Metroid II is still a game liked by many for it`s unique atmosphere and the famous Metroid game play. Many things are similar to other Metroid incarnations, while others differ (weapon acquisition, physics...). I loved the game as a kid, so I decided to try my first TAS with this.

	"First of all, the "Select-glitch" (A glitch that allows the player to open unintended paths by pressing select at certain frames) has not been used. No programming errors are abused, however I am not sure if some of the techniques are actually intended by the programmers, or are glitches (see below).

	"As opposed to the first submitted version, rolling instead of walking is only used until I obtain the Varia suit. Running with the suit is as fast as rolling, obsoleting rolling for a good part of the game. Thanks to moozooh for finding this out.

[div class=p 
	"The most important item for speeding the game`s completion up in Metroid II is the morphball. It is the fastest way of horizontal movement (walking 
	"[without the Varia suit as we now know ><]
	", jumping and the spiderball all being slower, in that order), so whenever possible (or feasible) horizontal movement is done with the morphball.

[div class=p 
	"Another property of the morphball unique to Metroid II (compared to other Mertrooid games of course) is mid-air-unmorph-jumping(tm). When leaving the ball form while jumping or falling, Samus can start a jump for a few frames, just as if she was standing on solid ground (spinning is not possible however). This allows for some interesting movement. This might be a glitch rather than an intended feature.

	"Jumping
	$LF
]h3
[div class=p 
	"As jumping is a rather slow type of horizontal movement (but the fastest vertical) it is avoided as much as possible. That means, all jumps take place in an as short time as possible, which is not easy in this game. 
	$LF
	"Before Samus passes half her maximum jump height, the jumping movement can be canceled by releasing the jump button. But if she passed half maximum height, she will execute a jump at maximum height, which takes time if in horizontal movement.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Several techniques are used to avoid that:

]div
[ul

		"Kneeling before a jump reduces maximum height

	[li

	"By moving horizontally for one frame, and then jump without holding any direction, Samus immediately rises up some pixels, saving a few frames on almost every Jump and a lot of time overall. This, again, might be a glitch.
