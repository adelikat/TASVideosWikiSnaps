	"Nigel Mansell's World Championship Racing is an ok-ish Formula 1 racing game for the NES. The game has some quirks, like Nigel Mansell himself teaching you how to play the game. I owned this game as a kid and I always wondered how it would be to finally beat it. Here it is, a manually routed, automatically (bot) driven solution of this game. This is my longest movie so far! I know this might be a monotonous one, but I did it for the nostalgia factor more than anything.

	"Early on I decided that I wanted to win all races. Of course, for an any% movie the end game could be reached by forfeiting all races. Similarly, the championship could be attained by manipulating RNG to minimize the championship score of the runner-up, winning a minimal amount of races and forfeiting the rest. I found these alternatives to be pathetic and painful to watch. Therefore I wanted to pursue a 100%, where we win all races decisively and gloriously. The judge must decide if '100%' applies here, given we skip the qualification sessions. Perhaps a 'perfectScore%' or 'winAllRaces%' category more closely relates to this choice.

	"Regarding car setup, I chose the aero setting that yielded better botted results. This choice did not affect max speed (seems like a programming faux pas, since in real F1 higher spoiler inclination adds grip but does limit max speed). Since wear tire is the most important factor in the pit stop strategy, I also configured the bot to take curves minimizing tire wear at all times. In some races I was able to pursue a single stop strategy. In the others, I distributed laps to allow the use of soft tires whenever possible.
