	"A single jump is used in this TAS to end input nearly a second earlier than not doing so. This game keeps saving your progress, even when you lose a life, just like Sunday Drive and Slalom, so this trick is used as well. Input ends on frame 29746.

	": I know this is a quick judgement, but there is no sense in keeping this game in the queue. It mimics the other games mentioned in this submission. Since I have been the primary judge for most of the Action 52 games, I figure to apply my understanding to this one as well. It is like LGR states...an auto-scroller where you survive. The playing time cannot be changed; however, ending input  early is the only option.  LGR does great by utilizing all extra lives to accomplish the completion of level 9. I calculated the savings, and it was roughly 35 seconds. This is the kind of strategy that is expected, for games like these. I'm just surprised as to how much was cut at the end. Great job. Oops...I almost forgot. I checked the menu also. He he. Good to go there, according to the findings that you made a few submissions ago.
