	"If you've ever played Megaman on the NES, you'll immediately notice how oddly similar this game is, both for the look and gameplay. The main character could very well have been one of Megaman's ancestors or previous lives (the story is set in 1999), except the game wasn't by Capcom ... so it's more of a cheap rip-off.

	"This game is more linear; there's 4 worlds (with 3 levels and a boss each), then the final bosses. It's also hard (no continues, no midpoints, dying at a boss forces you to redo the whole level before it), yet rewards you with one of the crappiest endings ever ...

		" Fire: when switched to, costs 4 life units and does a fire phoenix animation that hits all enemies on screen, for more damage than a charged shot. Generally a waste of time, but sometimes useful against bosses so they don't switch to attack mode one more time and cause an even longer wait.

		" Wall jumping: I made it look like an actual ability you can normally do, but it's not. It's used at many places where the broom would be slower, especially world 4, and the first 2 bosses where I got stuck into a wall to sneak up behind the boss.

		" Ultra-rapid fire: If you get hit while shooting (same frame), it'll shoot on every frame (there's normally a 8 frame delay) until you can move again. Very useful against the last bosses since they don't have any invincibility period, so they die fast.

	"This is actually my second run through the game (first one was 17:51, but I wanted to improve it before submitting). It's still possible to save a few more seconds, but mostly from minor things I only noticed in the later parts of the recording, and also because I still haven't quite figured out the perfect timing and control sequence for walljumping.
