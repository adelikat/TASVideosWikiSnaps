	"The main goal of this run was to get everything in the game (100% completion) as fast as possible. Getting all the items (even though I don't use most of them) is necessary to acheive the "good" ending, and also makes for a more entertaining video, I believe. My main chances to shine were during boss fights. The bosses in this game are (for the most part) highly manipulatable, making many of the normally frustrating bosses look extremely simple.

There is a very good reason why I don't come back for the vial when I have more vitality (i.e. on the second and third runs through the level), but it's a long explanation involving having enough vitality to mitigate the lag in the first underground area, which is important.

He "checks" to see if his mini-eyeballs are dead every once in a while, which means there's a frame rule on when he comes out of the slime himself. I can't seem to kill the mini-eyes fast enough for him to come out after the third "Ovnulation Cycle" (an endearing term coined by Dromiceius). This would save a lot of time if it could be broken (about 130 frames).

		" On the third run through the level, you may notice that I don't just die to exit the level. The reason is that the very thing I came here for (the life extension) would bring me to full health. I tried several ways of dying while collecting it, but the game just won't let you do it on the same frame. So I just walk out of the level by entering the boss room.

		" The aquatic parts of this level were the hardest to optimize, especially the areas where I had to continuously avoid spikes, destroy blocks, and kill the swimmy guys. The parts where I touch spikes or otherwise get hurt are to better position myself to eliminate as much as possible on the screen to reduce lag, which is a plague in this level. It's also necessary to space out your shots, even though it slows you down, since firing too many at once causes horrible lag.
