	"Dan started this movie about 1Â½ years ago (Sept. 2004), but had to stop at Stage 4 - the mine. A few days ago I (Nightcom) started a TAS for this game without reading the topic about it, which was kind of dumb but gave me good practice that I otherwise wouldn't have had.

	"I started to really enjoy how it was speedrun, with all the backflips and other precise timing one had to go through. So I decided to take the honor of continuing the unfinished run all the way to and through the final battles. I must confess that this was probably the hardest Dracula I've ever experienced, and that the movie makes the overall game look much easier than it is - in my opinion.
