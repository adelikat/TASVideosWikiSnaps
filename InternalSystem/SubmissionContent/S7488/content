	"A fast-paced homebrew game released in 2020 after an update to the tool GBStudio, Barry the cherry must embark on a mission to save his sister, Mary, from a bird chef(?) across 6 levels. Using his epic jumping skills and exploiting height enemies give him, Barry manages to save Mary from that pathetic bird in under 3 and a half minutes.

	"Introductory stage pt 2: this stage adds onto the first by showcasing ladders and adding wider gaps. Again, nothing notable happens here, just some quick jumps and avoiding ladders. This level, however, has caused me so so much trouble, including making me do the rest of the game again because I realised something so blatantly obvious was possible.

	"The Dungeon Tower is the final level, the lair of the stinky bird chef and a combination of all 5 prior levels. There isn't all too much to say about it, its actually quite straightforward. Unfortunately, there is a relatively large amount of lag that didn't seem to dissapear whatsoever (except for a few spots), the upwards movement may be improvable but I went through it numerous times and didn't come out with anything faster and I did have to stop for an enemy to shoot which is really annoying. I'm not sure how to avoid this since they appear to shoot as soon as they are loaded in.
