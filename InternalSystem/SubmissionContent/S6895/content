	"Gargoyle's Quest: Ghosts 'n Goblins, known as Red Arremer: Makaimura Gaiden in Japan, is an action-adventure/platformer game for the Gameboy. It was developed by Capcom, released on May 2, 1990 in Japan. This game stars Red Arremer (known as Firebrand in the West), who goes off into the Ghoul Realm to defeat the King of Destruction, Breager.

	"This game has an overworld, and within this overworld random encounters can occur. From what I’ve found, it appears that the game has a 32 bit LFSR for its RNG, which for the overworld seems to advance every 8 steps. But it doesn’t stop there: for these random encounters, the game doesn’t just use one of the RNG bytes, no that would be too easy, the game also uses a frame counter for these encounters. Essentially, the game adds the second RNG byte with this frame counter, then does a bitwise AND by 3, and if the result is 0, an encounter occurs (so ¼ chance for an encounter). This does end up with a fatal flaw, if going to a tile causes an encounter, delaying movement by 1 frame will essentially guarantee no encounter takes, which this movie takes advantage of a bit.

	"So for whatever reason, if you hold Left+Right on a wall, you can clip into a wall and if you do it for longer you eventually end up just zipping (and this also ends up glitching the level layout). Clips aren’t always used for zips though; they can simply be used to clip upwards/downwards a block, although this is usually used to get up 1 block higher rather than lower. This the main improvement of this TAS, as all previous TASes appear to have forgone this glitch (under the guise of “entertainment,” yet the currently published movie managed to get auto-placed in Vault, only reason it’s in Moons now is because it’s simply not vaultable). There are some limitations that do have to be considered for this glitch though.

		"-When flying, the most efficient way to conserve wing power is to periodically stop flying, fall for exactly three frames, and then start flying again. If you do this the right number of times, you will travel farther than you would by letting your wing power run out normally. This is used multiple times throughout the run to cross large gaps and get Firebrand to affix himself higher up on walls than he would have normally.

		"-If you try jumping off a wall while holding in the direction of the wall, you temporarily lose control of Firebrand while he jumps up. If, however, you jump off a wall without holding the D-Pad, or while holding the opposite direction of the wall, you never lose control of Firebrand and can immediately pull him back towards the wall. This allows you to climb up walls MUCH more efficiently. By my own research, the most efficient climb pattern is to keep rapidly jumping off, getting back on, jumping off... (once every 9 frames.)

Although luckily, it only happens for major zips, so minor zips are okay (which ends up useful for one section). I end up not needing to switch to the Claw and back for this stage due to clipping through the beginning spikes, although this is at the cost of some health. Due to the amount of damage timesave this stage has, I would either need to forgo one another damage timesave, or take a detour to grab the heart. Turns out that grabbing the heart ends up costing the least amount of time, so I do that.

	"This guy is a joke, 9 hits with the Darkfire and he’s defeated. I get ground to the spikes once I fire the last hit to avoid some lag. As an interesting note, his arms and upper head appear red, with the rest of his body green. This is really just a quirk with how the GBC colors DMG games. The GBC gives the background a different palette than sprites (for this game, it’s green for the background and red for the sprites). So most of this boss is actually just part of the background, with the rest composing of sprites. You might also notice that the sprites seem to sometimes disappear. This is really just due the GB’s 10 sprite per line limit, which ends up easily going over due to the absurd amount of sprites on the boss (4 sprites per arm and 6 sprites for the head).
