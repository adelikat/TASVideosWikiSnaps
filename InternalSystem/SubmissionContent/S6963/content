	"Improved with invulnerability of damage. If it is normal damage, it will be invulnerability of 50 frames, and in addition, since there is 26 frames of rigidity, the actual invincibility will be 24 frames, so it can not be used very much. If this is in the air, it will be invulnerability for 81 frames. However, if you just take damage in the air, you cannot use it because the loss is too large. As a result, I can't get much invulnerability. This is solved by "appearing graham very close to the stairs" and "damaging in the air as close to the floor as possible". Landing can cancel damage rigidity. As a result, the rigidity can be suppressed to 16 frames, and as a result, the invulnerability of 65 frames can be used. By attacking before being hit, you can reduce the loss due to damage rigidity. When it comes to an axe, using damage rigidity is 5 frames more efficient than not using it. I'm using this invincibility for graham's "turn left and right". You can expect an extension time of 5 frames for each turn. This increases the number of attacks that can be made per loop. The maximum extension time per session is 45 frames. This is adjusted to use the optimum extension time. Graham's appearance position and attack pattern adjustment are performed by sliding, ceiling collision, whip attack, and attack on graham. By shifting the timing of the ceiling collision, the range of appearance position adjustment can be increased. In addition, the range of attack pattern adjustment can be increased by using the additional attack of the whip. You can efficiently adjust the attack pattern of graham by adjusting the timing of the first additional whip attack and the second whip attack before the appearance. Some people may think that it can be Improved with the damage of the additional whip attack, but this attack pattern does not make sense in terms of the remaining damage of graham. These reduce graham's attack loop from 5 to 4. However, the number of axes used has increased by one. This consumes an extra 12MP. Also, 1 frame is Improved by performing the last attack on the stairs.
