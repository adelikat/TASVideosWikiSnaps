	" About the Game
	$LF

[p 
	"Super Metroid is a classic platformer with many advanced techniques and a very fine, subpixel-based move engine. The story is about a bounty hunter called Samus who has the goal to explore a foreign planet called Zebes to find and destroy Mother Brain, the evil leader of the galaxy who is breeding a mighty species called Metroids to abuse them for her own benefits. During the journey you will find a lot of items such as new ammo, energy tanks, special upgrades that speed you up or allow to pass certain areas you would normally not be able to, and making your character strong enough to be ready for the upcoming showdown against Mother Brain.

	"Despite being over 18 years old by now, it is considered as one of the best games ever made, and is still played by many people on a regular basis. Due to the many different move techniques, a high variety through the new upgrades, and a lot of route possibilities, this game is a very common target for many types of speedruns and playthroughs.

	" finally found it's completion after a lot of planning work, tests and delays due to other projects. It's one of the most difficult run forms in Super Metroid, as it forces to go through heated or water filled rooms without any of the suits for constant energy loss or greatly restricted movements, creating unique conditions not seen in any other run. The improvement to the

	]a
	" by Taco, Kriole, and Hero of the Day is 5056 realtime / 3993 ingame frames, with the main timesaver being from skipping the Grapple Beam, which due to new/improved tricks and strategies I developed for Maridia this year turned out to not justify the time it takes to collect after all.

	": In regards to in-game time. Since the Metroid series also made it prominent by changing the endings according to it, and players were competing based on it, it seems quite sensible for records. However, in terms of TASing, of course everything will be as fast as possible, and things like pausing the game during a long run to answer the phone or attend to human needs don't really factor into it, therefore in-game time makes little sense.
	$LF

[p 
	"In this excellent run though, the real time surpasses the existing time, so the run should be accepted. It is disheartening though to see old emulators being used, specifically with options to make timing as inaccurate as possible. Here's to hoping someone makes Lsnes runs in the future.
