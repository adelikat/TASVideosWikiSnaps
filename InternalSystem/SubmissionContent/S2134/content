	"I initially had no intensions of tasing this game. However - since this game lies close to my heart (it was the first game I ever beated) I occasionally play it just for fun from time to time. And while I was doing "unassisted" speedruns on the African Mines stage I accidentally found a quicker way to defeat the boss, and this was the reason why I started it. First I had the feeling that this timesaver would be the only one I could find but in the end I had been able to cut some frames here an there and had also found another two quite major timesavers so I'm pleased with the outcome.
