	"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III - Radical Rescue is the final Turtles game released for the GameBoy. Unlike the other GameBoy Turtles games, it isn't a sidescrolling Beat 'em up game, but is actually a Metroidvania by Konami released years before Symphony of the Night. Each Turtle has a unique ability that they can perform and the goal is to "rescue" the 3 other turtles (you start out as Michaelangelo), Splinter, and April. To do this you must fight several D-List Turtles villains like Scratch and Dirtbag before fighting the big bad (cyber) Shredder who is guarding April.

	"Most of this is the same as the last submission. Changes begin at around 13:28 in the video and around frame 48300 in the movie. One day while working on a completely different TAS I thought about this game and then realized I could abuse iframes to pass through the fire/steam? thing in the long horizontal room before the boss rush. This saved about 28 frames and then I saved another 16 on Triceraton for some reason. I had to take damage on... I don't even remember the next boss's name, but it was the fastest pattern I could get given the previous improvements and lost 5 frames here. I then saved another 38 frames on shredder 2. 21 of these frames were saved on the fight itself, and 18 more were from killing shredder close to the ground allowing the key to finish bouncing sooner. Lastly I saved another 9 frames on my way to April.
