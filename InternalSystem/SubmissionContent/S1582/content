	"Pete is the character controlled by the player, armed with a hose, with which he can spray forward and downwards. Firing the hose makes Pete move slower. Danny is his sidekick who has had one cup of coffee too many before this mission. Danny is indestructable, puts out fires using his axe, or by stomping on it. Danny also is the one who opens doors (Not using the axe though). Pete on the other hand every now and then runs through the fire without taking damage.
