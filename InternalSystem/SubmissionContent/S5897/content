	[em 
		"Track & Field
	]em
	" is an arcade game developed and published by Konami in 1983.  
	[em 
		"Track & Field
	]em
	" was developed to coincide with the then-upcoming 1984 Summer Olympics, and the original version (Japan's 
	[em 
		"Hyper Olympic
	]em
	") was licensed by the International Olympic Committee.  The game features 3 buttons, and no joystick.  
	[em 
		"Track & Field
	]em
	" rewards rapid button presses and precise timing in a unique and exciting way, and these concepts would define the genre for years to come.  Players would resort to all manner of trickery in an attempt to eke out as many button presses as possible, and button damage was rampant, causing later controls to adopt button guards for the Run buttons, and finally replace both with a trackball.  
	[em 
		"Track & Field
	]em
	" also bred fierce competition, particularly because players could compete head-to-head.  So much so in fact, that the game was at the center of history's largest arcade video game tournament, the "1984 March of Dimes International Konami/Centuri Track & Field Challenge", with over 1 million contestants worldwide.  Of technical interest, the game features early digitized speech, and is one of the first video games to feature parallax scrolling.

	"The "Sweet Spot":
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"In addition to a number of other factors which determine the Distance of a jump or throw, there exists another unseen factor.  It is a particular series of Frames during which beginning a jump or throw will result in a greater Distance than otherwise possible--a "sweet spot".  The Sweet Spot is only active during 2nd Try and 3rd Try.  Note that if the Distance of 2nd Try was greater than the normal maximum Distance, the Sweet Spot will not be active for 3rd Try.  During 1st Try, the Sweet Spot is a "Sour Spot", which actually decreases the Distance of a jump or throw!  Additionally, Player Speed must meet a minimum requirement in order to enable the Sweet Spot.  The minimum Speed requirement for a Try is determined by the result of any previous Tries.  The Sweet Spot operates on a cycle of 256 Frames, after which the cycle repeats.  During Long Jump and Hammer Throw, the Sweet Spot cycle is divided into 85 subcycles of 3 Frames each, with Frame 1 being excluded from the subcycle routine.  The cycle begins on the Frame on which input unlocks for a Try.  These 3-Frame subcycles are used in order to coordinate with the 3-Frame RNG cycle, thus allowing any given subcycle the chance for 3 different results via the 3 possible RNG results.  The duration of the Sweet Spot window ranges from just 1 subcycle up to 85 subcycles (i.e. 255 Frames, the entirety of the Sweet Spot cycle).  The duration of the Sweet Spot window is determined by Player's Speed when a jump or throw begins, the result of any previous Tries, the Frame on which a jump or throw begins, and the RNG.  Note that any Speed bonus (e.g. jump timing in Long Jump) is applied prior to the check for Player's Speed.  Each 10 cm/sec that the Player's Speed exceeds the current Try's minimum Speed requirement extends the duration of the Sweet Spot by 1 subcycle.  Any Sweet Spot subcycles which have been allotted are applied reverse sequentially, starting with the last subcycle in a cycle (i.e. subcycle 85, or Frame 253 of the Sweet Spot cycle).  Thus, provided even a minimal Sweet Spot window has been allotted, the ideal result for a jump or throw can be achieved by coordinating the jump or throw to begin on the same Frame that the last subcycle in a cycle begins.  The Sweet Spot is of particular significance to Long Jump and Hammer Throw, owing to the limited possibilities for RNG manipulation in those Events relative to other Events (e.g. Javelin Throw).  In order for a jump or throw to achieve maximum Distance, the jump or throw must begin during the Sweet Spot window.  In this TAS, where applicable, the Sweet Spot is exploited to provide maximum Distance.

	"RNG Manipulation:
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The RNG determines various aspects of the game, but most significantly, it determines the Distance of a jump or throw to some degree.  The initial RNG for a jump or throw is determined by the Frame on which the Event or Try began and the Frame on which the Jump/Throw button is first pressed to adjust the Angle.  Note that in the case of Javelin Throw and High Jump, RNG can be further manipulated during the jump or throw, after the initial RNG has been set.  Thus, the RNG can be manipulated by beginning input on a different Frame during a Try, or by entering different input for the Try (such that Jump/Throw is pressed on a different Frame).  During Long Jump and Hammer Throw, the RNG operates on a cycle of 3 Frames.  Of the 3 Frames in a cycle, 1 Frame of the cycle is the positive Frame, 1 Frame of the cycle is the neutral Frame, and 1 Frame of the cycle is the negative Frame.  Note that under certain conditions, a negative Frame, a neutral Frame, and a positive Frame can all produce the same result.  In order for a jump or throw to achieve maximum Distance, the RNG must be set on a positive Frame.  Throughout this TAS, the RNG is manipulated to provide maximum Distance, or to provide a specific Distance.

Although this additional Speed may be as much as 50 cm/sec, additional Speed does not guarantee additional Distance, whereas starting a jump from closer to the edge of the Foul Line does.  As such, the ideal location from which to start a jump is when the Player's foot is aligned with the right edge of the Foul Line, despite the fact that it provides only 30 cm/sec of additional Speed.  Note that there are 2 locations on the Foul Line which provide 30 cm/sec of additional Speed.  Ordered from left to right, the ideal location is the 2nd of these 2 locations.
