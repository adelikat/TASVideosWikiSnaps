		"Gameplay:
	]b
	" Dragon Quest IX continues the Dragon Quest tradition of turn-based combat, with a few modern twists. The game allows players to have a cooperative wireless multiplayer experience with up to four players. Unlike the other games in the main series, Dragon Quest 9 is a 3rd person RPG in battles and there are no more random encounters, instead the enemies are on a open world map and can chase you if they see you.

		"Introduction: 
	]b
	"After creating my character, there'll be a brief cutscene. After some chitchat back and forth, I will suddenly be thrust into a battle in order to protect innocent mortal townsfolk from harm. This battle is very easy, I managed to get a critical hit to quickly kill them. Then I receive a sacred item called Benevolessence. This is the crystallized form of mortals' thankfulness for being protected by the Celestrians. Then I and Aquila return to the Observatory, the mysterious, holy location from whence I came.
	$LF
	"The Observatory: I go upstair and speak to Apus Major, he congratulates me on a job well done so far, but tells me that it's time to set off on my own, my apprenticeship with Aquila is now over, and he tells me to visit the Tree of Yggdrasil upstairs. I have to use the sacred item I carry with, Benevolessence, on the tree named Yggdrasil. I then go back downstairs to speak with Apus Major. Now I have to go back to the Protectorate to gather more Benevolessence, on the way down, I open a chest to get a Chimaera wing (helps fly back to visited town) (breaking the jar before it is madatory), and a Seed of life which increases my Hero's max HP by 3 (very important on the first boss fight).
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"The Protectorate:
	]b
	" After regain control, I go to find a Keepsake Ring and deliver it to an old woman in the Church to receive a Benevolessence, then I go to the Stable and clear all 5 pieces of Horse Manure to receive 1 more Benevolessence. After I do this 2 jobs, nighttime will be summoned forth and Aquila will appear. After talking with him, I speak with a ghost and help him R.I.P and receive 1 more Benevolessence. Now I have 3 of them in total, time to go back to the Observatory.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"The Mysterious force:
	]b
	" I go straight to the tree to offer all my Benevolessence, then follow a cutscene. The tree blooms, the fruit called the Fygg appears in 7. The celestial train known as the Starflight Express arrives to ferry the Celestrians to the Realm of the Almighty. However, before the Celestrians can board the train, the Observatory is attacked from below by a mysterious and powerful force. The force scatters the assembled angels and knocks the Fyggs, the Starflight Express, and myself down to the Protectorate...
	$LF
	"Real adventure begin: After the cutscene, I'll find myself back in Angel Falls, but missing my trademark halo, and no longer glowing and floating. My class now is Minstrel, this is a good all-around class, but doesn't really stand out. After the conversation with Ivor, Hugo and Erinn, I'll regain my control. I go directly to Ivor's house and witness a conversation, then I come back to Erinn's house to sleep. At the next morning, Ivor comes to ask me to escort him to the Mountain pass. Avoid enemy encounters, I reach the Mountain pass and see the Starflight Express, nothing to do with she right now, I go to the right first to open a chest and find a Gold Ring (for sale later), then I go to the left to talk with Ivor again. Afer some conversations, I open the Menu and use 'Seed of life', then use Chimaera wing to fly back to Angel Falls.

[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Rescue Patty:
	]b
	" I go to Ivor’s house to deposit him, then comes short conversations and Erinn wants me to find Patty but not asking, but I will help her anyway. I go to the shop and open the closet for a Chimaera wing, then I sell my stuff to be able to buy an Soldier's Sword, which increase my Hero's ATK a lot. I then head to the Hexagon, enter it, do some method to open the door and go deeper. I need to reach Lv4 before the boss to easily kill it. I'm not very lucky at encounters because the number of enemy each time is just 1! So I have to take 4 battles instead of 3 to reach Lv4 (I also collect 210 Gold coins on the way). I then find a fainted woman at the center of the circular room, and she’s the missing woman the soldiers from Stornway were asking about – Patty. Now the boss Hexagoon comes to fight. There’s nothing much to talk, just attack and heal, I only managed to get 1 critical hit. After winning, I reach level 6 and earn 6 Skill points, I spend all on Sword skill. After that I am transported outside automatically, then I use Chimaera wing to fly back to Angel Falls.

		"Leaving Angel Falls:
	]b
	" I go to the Inn and see some conversations, then Erinn get back to her home. I follow and see a ghost infront of the house, I speak with him and know that he’s Erinn’s father. Suddenly comes a mysterious sprite-like creature, named Stella, she is in charge of the Starflight Express. Stella will now accompany me, but not as a party member, but rather as someone that watches over me. She promises that if I can finish Edwinn's unfinished business, she'll give me a ride back to the Observatory. I then talk with Edwinn again to know what is his unfinished business, then go to the location that he showed and find a trophy. I then show it to Erinn. Convinced of her father's legacy, Erinn agrees to accompany Patty back to Stornway. Then, Edwinn, with his business finished, finally R.I.P. But when Edwinn disappears and I am unable to see the Benevolessence left behind by him, Stella begins to wonder whether I’m truly a Celestrian or not. But anyway, we'll go where the Starflight Express lied. Stella opens the door for us and we go inside. But when Stella goes to start the mystical machine up, she finds that it's dead. Stella has come up with an idea: she hypothesizes that by helping more people and earning more Benevolessence, God will be on our side enough to help start the machine up. Once that's been resolved, I leave the train and continue to Stornway.

		"Helping Stornway:
	]b
	" When entering Stornway, I will force to come to Patty’s inn and witness a scene. After that, I get out and go collect some golds and item for sale (I really need money to buy equipments), and a pair of gloves to equip to increase my Hero's deftness. I read the sign to know that help is directly requested from King Schott of Stornway to deal with the Wight Knight, I must read it in order to get inside the castle. Then I go to the shop to buy Medical herbs, Chimaera wings, open chest for Seed of strength (+2 ATK), and buy a Rapier to increase my Hero's ATK. After get inside the castle, I meet the King and he engage me in conversation. He wants to hire me to go to Loch Storn and deal with the Wight Knight once and for all. A reward is waiting for me if I’m able to successfully do so. I leave Stornway and head south first to go to Hexagon from the back and get a Scale Armor (+DEF) and an item for sale, then I head north, but I’m not going to Loch Storn yet, instead I’m going to Zere first and enter it to be able to fly to it later (I also collect 2 Chimaera wing on the way). To be able to withstand the Wight Knight, I need to level up my Hero to 10, and all of my skill points are spent on Sword skill to increase my Hero's ATK. Skeleton gives the most experience so I go to Brigadoom for training and collect some equipments there. When done, I fly to Zere to buy stuffs, and fly to Stornway and head to Loch Storn from there (faster than going from Zere).
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"The Wight Knight:
	]b
	" After that there’ll be a short cutscene and the Wight Knight shows up, then comes the boss fight. This fight is not hard but takes long. After the fight, I learn that the Wight Knight has been going after the wrong princess all along. He's looking for the Princess of Brigadoom, a woman named Mona. Nonetheless, having admitted his mistake, the Wight Knight offers his apologies to the kingdom, and goes off on his way home. I then return to Stornway, I go to the inn to rest because it’s nighttime and I can’t go inside the castle at night, and I also need to refill HP and MP. After that I meet with the King. He isn't impressed with my handling of the situation, and need me to make the Wight Knight no longer walks the face of the planet... that is, if I want my reward. This decision upsets Princess Simona, and she quickly runs off to sob in privacy. But she want to meet me privately in her bedroom! She guilds me to go to Zere to learn about Brigadoom. I get out and fly to Zere, I go into the nurse’s house and hear the rhyme, and learn that Brigadoom is at the North (I actually go there to train level earlier!), when trying to get out of Zere, I run into the Wight Knight again. I tell him where Brigadoom is and we both go there.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"The Brigadoom:
	]b
	" I go through the door that I unlocked at the 1st visit here, and go directly to the throne, and see a cutscene. A creature called Morag confronts the Wight Knight. It appears that, in the past, the Wight Knight was to confront Morag, which took him away from Princess Mona. Now, Morag seeks revenge, and curses the Wight Knight so that he can't move. In the Wight Knight's stead, I have to do battle with Morag. The battle is long since my Hero's ATK is weak, and I don't get many critical hits. After that, Princess Simona shows up, wearing Princess Mona's old necklace. In a trance, she dances with the Right Knight, and he's then sent off, forever happy that he got to see his love one last time. Hereafter, I speak with the princess to make her go back off to Stornway Castle, then I get out and fly to there as well.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Receiving my reward:
	]b
	" When I go to the throne room, I find Princess Simona safely back with her parents. Everyone is happy now, and they all feel sorry for the Wight Knight, who they misjudged all along. The king’s ready to give me my reward as promised. But I get out of the castle first for a cutscene, then I go for the rewards (a Magic water (refill MP), Gold Rosary (for money), 1000 gold, and Aggressence (=750 golds)). Now I fly outside of Stornway and go to the Starflight Express. When I arrive, I and Stella don't find things quite how she wanted. Though I helped out those in Stornway, the Benevolessence I earned wasn't enough to get the Starflight Express back in the air. Thus, I won't yet be able to return to the Observatory. So I must continue in the Protectorate, I fly back to Stornway and head northeast to the checkpoint. Just head north and I reach Coffinwell.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Helping Coffinwell:
	]b
	" I go to the shop first to strengthen my Hero, then I go to the Mayor’s mansion and learn that this town has been hit by the contagious diease, he asks me to speak with Dr. Phlegming. Since his lab was locked, I need to talk to his wife first, then she takes me there. Dr. Phlegming has discovered through his exhaustive research that what's plaguing Coffinwell is more akin to a curse than a disease. Apparently, a dungeon to the west of town was where the townsfolk previously sealed the source of the disease. The doctor is convinced that the earthquake is responsible for a fracturing of the seal that kept the curse at bay. With all of that information garnered, I return to the mayor's mansion. Upon speaking with Mayor Laria, he hands to me the Quarantomb Key. I return to Dr. Phlegming and hand over the key. Now that he's been effectively snared into helping the mayor out by the mayor guaranteeing that I will protect him, and we head to the tomb. On the way to the tomb, I collect 3 Iron ores for alchemy later. This Quarantomb has a monster Metal Slime that gives a lot of experience so this is a very good place to train level and strengthen my Hero, so I level up my Hero so that he can learn Miracle slash (hit and refill HP) and deal more damage with sword. I also find Seed of skill (+2 skill points) and manipulate the chest for Toad oil (which use in Alchemy later). After turning on 2 switches, the door opens and I find the broken jar. Dr. Phlegming now patches it, but a monster named Ragin' Contagion appears and prevents him from doing that. So that my turn now, boss fight! This fight is easier since my Hero is strong now. When the fight’s over and Dr. Phlegming finished his work, I get out of the tomb and fly to Coffinwell.

[div class=p

		"Helping Catarrhina:
	]b
	" I go to talk to Catarrhina but find that she’s already died. She has the curse all along, but never said anything about it, nonetheless to her ungrateful and aloof husband. Then comes a funeral, and Stella shows up to tell me that I can’t get much Benevolessence because of this situation. I go to the inn to rest til night, then go back to the graveyard and meet Catarrhina’s spirit. She ask me to help cheering her husband up. I agree and come to Dr. Phlegming’s office. After speaking with him for a brief time, I’m able to convince him that Catarrhina is speaking through me. She wants Phlegming to visit with some of the people in town who were sick. She hopes that this will show him not only how important he was to saving so many lives, but how grateful folks in the town are to have him... even if he is a weirdo shut-in. There are four people in particular I need to visit. After that, Dr. Phlegming ask me to head back to his office. When we arrive there, the doctor tell me that he's glad he was able to speak to everyone, and to make Catarrhina happy one last time, and now she can R.I.P. The next morning, I find the town in a much happier mood. Stella says she sees Benevolessence everywhere, which is exactly what I need to get the Starflight Express moving once more. Then I fly to Stornway, and go to the train from there.

[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Return to the Observatory:
	]b
	" Before reaching the train, I interact with a female ghost, a very important NPC, though she'll wander off before very long. When I walk into the Starflight Express thereafter, another lengthier cutscene will take place. I now have enough Benevolessence to get the craft off of the ground and back to the Observatory. Apus Major is praying to Yggdrasil when suddenly the Starflight Express shows up and deposits me back in the Observatory. Astonished not only at the fact that I’m alive, but that my halo and wings are missing, Apus Major brings me back to his throne room so everyone can speak. I fill Apus Major in on everything that happened. It appears that Apus Major dispatched Guardians to the Protectorate after the earthquake to not only look for the Fyggs, but to also find the source of the disturbance, but none has returned. Apus Major then instruct me to visit Yggdrasil and pray for my wings and halo back, I do so, and fall asleep, then I bear witness to a disturbing and vivid dream. It appears that two divine entities are battling over the fate of the mortals back in the Protectorate. One of these gods appears to want to destroy the world of the mortals, but the other is hell-bent on protecting it. When I awake, my wings and halo hasn’t come back yet, then I hear a mystery voice tells me that I am the chosen one and I need to collect all the Fyggs, then it open a way for me, a blue tree appears to land with the Starflight Express. I also learn ‘Zoom’, a spell that like Chimaera wing. When Apus Major and his friends come, I tell him about my dream, then I use the Starflight Express to go to that blue tree.

		"The 1st Fygg:
	]b
	" I go to get 2 Lava lumps first, then go to the Alltrades Abbey and witness a scene: a mayor’s speaking with 3 individuals. These 3 people have come to change their vocation, but the man responsible for job changes, Abbot Jack, has gone missing. I then talk to the mayor to ask for the Fygg (a shining fruit). He gives me some clues, then I go down to find more. After asking for information, I find that the fruit has been eaten by Abbot Jack and he’s nowhere to be found. I speak with the mayor again and he suggests that Abbot Jack may come to the Tower of Trades. Then he teaches me a party trick called ‘Bow’ to open the door there, I register it together with ‘Clap’ to use later. I head out using Zoom (faster than walking), but instead of going right to the Tower, I go down to the Port Llaffan first. I see a crowd at the beach, and when leaving, a scene happens: Jona, a red hair girl, springs into action, summoning forth a great creature of the sea, Lleviathan, and it feeds everyone with plentiful amounts of fish from the sea. Take it aside, I fly back to Stornway and go to Erinn's Inn to use Alchemy, and creat Gigasteel Broadsword that increase my Hero's ATK a lot. Then I go out and talk to an old man to receive a Quest, and get a Strength Ring (+ATK). All done, I now go to the Tower of Trade. On the way to the top of the Tower, I get 1200 gold coins, a Sage's elixir (refill MP, value 750 gold) and a Magic Water. At the 7th floor, I find a magical door, when enter it, I finally find Abbot Jack, he is at the center of this circular room and doing his prayers. It doesn't take long for him to be overtaken by the evil spirit that's corrupting him. And the quaint old man Abbot Jack becomes a devilish monster known as the Master of Nu'Un. Now come the boss battle! The strategy doesn’t change, after the fight, I obtain the 1st Fygg. And now I can change my vocation!
	$LF

[div class=p

		"Changing vocation:
	]b
	" I go back to Alltrades Abbey, and receive an Armamentalist quest to unlock its vocation. I then change vocation to Mage to be able to finish that quest (use 8 skill points to learn Wizard Ward). And fly to Coffinwell and go to Quarantomb to train level with Metal Slime, since it the best monster to farm at the moment. Unlike the USA version, the Armamentalist quest in JPN requires to cast Wizard Ward and kill Metal Slime 3 times instead of 2. After reaching Lv21, I go back to Abbey to finish Armamentalist quest, and change vocation to Armamentalist to learn skills (use 32 skill points to learn Fire Fource, Frost Fource and Gale Fource, also Strength +10 and Resilience +20), then I change vocation to Thief and train level to gain more skill points (use 4 skill points for Deftness +20). After reaching Lv21, I change vocation to Warrior and this is the final class. I then still go to Quarantomb to train level to 20. At this time, I nearly finish building up my Hero:

		"The 2nd Fygg:
	]b
	" I fly back to Port Llaffan and luckily, it's only few steps to reach the night (because I can only meet Jona at night), so I don't have to rest at the Inn. I then go to her resident and we about to have a conversation, but another person from town storms into her house to tell her that Mayor Bryce is interested in speaking to her. She scampers off, promising to return shortly. I’m not waiting there and follow her. I overhear Jona's and Mayor Bryce's conversation. It appears that the mayor wants to adopt Jona, since her father Dylan went missing some time ago, and doesn't seem likely to return. And Jona tells him that she doesn't want to invoke Leviathan anymore, but the mayor won't hear any of it. He insists that Jona reconsider, and sends her off to go to sleep. Hereafter, Jona run into me, and offers to bring me back to her place. The hour is now late, and Jona says that I can sleep there. Then Stella briefly scold me for meddling in the affairs of this town before morning finally comes. I head back towards the mayor's home, and go to the backyard. I see Mayor Bryce's son, Bryson, near a locked gate. After Jona reiterated her desire to no longer summon forth Leviathan, Bryce took off with Jona towards the private beach. The gate leading westward was locked earlier, but now, thanks to Bryson, it unlocked. I go to that way and grap a Seed of Magic (increase maximum MP) and a Sage's elixir. Going through a cave and reach an outdoor location known as Cuddiedig Cliff. Here, the mayor is outright begging Jona to call Leviathan. But he doesn't want her to tell Leviathan to only bring fish. He remarks that there are all sorts of untold treasures under the sea. Clearly, the mayor wants to adopt Jona so that he can abuse her powers for his own personal wealth, but Jona isn't only hesitant, but outright uninterested in doing Mayor Bryce's bidding. Suddenly, Lleviathan shows up. The mayor asks it to bring it fish and riches, but suddenly, it attacks, eating Jona in the process! It's time for me to get involved, boss fight. Now the fight is finished very quick because my Hero is much stronger. After defeating the boss, Jona is released unharmed, and the true is revealed that the real Leviathan's been possessed by none other than Dylan, Jona's deceased father. Dylan did indeed die out at sea when a storm suddenly hit his fishing vessel, but before he died, he saw a shining fruit, and then he found himself at one with Leviathan, the sea god. Knowing that he left Jona behind in the village to fend for herself, he delivered up fish to feed her and make sure she was taken care of. He never intended for things to get so out of control, or for her to be used by Mayor Bryce. Dylan then leaves both his daughter and Leviathan behind, with Bryson, Mayor Bryce's son, swearing to take care of Jona in his stead. I then obtain the 2nd Fygg.

	" Next morning, I get out and find a boat docked nearby. I speak with the captain and he’s willing to bring me out to sea. After a brief time, the ship deposit me in a tiny settlement called Slurry Quay. I then open a chest for a Seed of Strength. I leave the quay and go to Dourbridge, at the brigde, I meet the woman's ghost again. She nearly stops me for being a Celestrian, but thinking that she's made an error, she keeps on walking. After that strange encounter, I go to the Lonely Plains, then I go to the Heights of Loneliness, this entire dungeon leading to Zere Rocks. After entering Zere Rock, I go to the house at the end of this rock-town and meet a Slime, it can talk and it tells me that Mason is the man who create this entire replica town. Then comes a minor earthquake and I head outside to see what the source of the quake is. I see a gigantic stone golem named Garth Goyle, and it’s boss fight. Not very hard. After the fight, I see an old man ghost, and he goes down to the cellar, I follow him and find that is the ghost of Mason, who has passed away to the other side. He did eat the Fygg that hailed from Dourbridge, which allowed him to make a wish, but after I defeat the Garth Goyle, he can R.I.P now. Then I obtain the 3rd Fygg, I get back to Lonely Plains and head south to go to Bloomingdale.

All I know is that speedrun.com splits them; that may simply be due to the significant difference in language timing in regards to a leaderboard setup.  I'm guessing RNG would be impacted by the timing differences even if ther isn't anything else.

I'll leave the ultimate decision on whether or not this suggested splitting should happen up to the senior Judge and Publisher.
