	"This is an any% run, because it completes the game as fast as possible, reaching the credits scene, post credits scene, and the point where the game kicks you out into the title screen faster than anyone else has done it on the PS1. Compared to the times on speedrun.com, this TAS is a bit slower than the record because they use a glitch that's not in the original and they're playing on a much faster remake anyway, so I don't feel I can compare these fairly. However it's 50 minutes faster than the run without glitches.

	"I made this TAS because I wondered what the original game looked like after playing the remake on Nintendo Switch. But because I didn't want to actually bother to play through the original due to so much text mashing, and there wasn't a single full game run I could find online, I decided to TAS it all the way through. My only regret is not naming the character something creative and instead going for the fastest option, "0". Zero is a cool name though. I submitted this TAS because someone begged me to submit it to TASVideos, and I figured that it was worth a shot. It took me the entire day to figure out where the submit movie button was. This is my first TAS, and out of all the games I wanted to TAS I finished the longest one first.

	"At the beginning, if you're wondering why I waste time picking up a comic book, it skips like 8 text boxes. In the babylon shopping center, the shutter is only open after making a full lap around the mall, and the fire alarm is required for story progression flags.
