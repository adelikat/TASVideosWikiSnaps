	[em 
		"Speedway!

	" (EU: 
	[em

	[em 
		"Spin-out!
	]em
	" (EU:

	[em 
		"Cryptologic!
	]em
	" (EU: 
	[em 
		"Cryptogram
	]em
	"). It's your average run-of-the-mill retro racing game, where you play as the driver, trying to rack up as high a score as possible by accelerating and dodging other cars within a 2 minute time limit.

	"After pressing "0" to start the game and "2" to select difficulty (2 is the harder difficulty, which is preferred for TASing), gameplay starts on frame 1. After pressing those buttons, the game itself takes about a third of a second to load everything before the timer starts ticking.

	"Score is built up most quickly by holding U to accelerate until you start earning 1 point per frame. After the acceleration process is finished, the score is 98 frames behind the frame count. Due to an error in programming, it counts 121 seconds instead of 120 because the timer shows both "02:00" and "00:00" for 60 frames (it should be one or the other). The actual race time is about 2:00.9, slightly lower than 2:01 because the Odyssey 2 runs at about 60.05FPS instead of a flat 60.
