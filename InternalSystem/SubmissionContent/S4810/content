	"The boss skip here was originally found by jorf in a real time run. The trick is to spawn an item in the first slot and get it to fly close to the boss' room. This prevents the boss from spawning. It's a relatively rare setup, since enemies don't always spawn in the slots in the same order, and the direction the item flies is also random.

Just morph ball over and then go back, I also do a quick jump to start the screen scrolling up to where it needs to be for the mini-boss on the other side. The last boss is much quicker then in the original.

	": The older runs of this game were judged based on an apparent assumption that the game identifies whether it runs on a NTSC or PAL system, and fixes its internal timing accordingly. However, while there are some differences, the timing is shown to be 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=significantly different|href=/Forum/Posts/416256)
	" between NTSC and PAL anyway, with NTSC timing being much faster than PAL timing. As this game was only released in Europe regions, and therefore intended to be run on PAL timing, this means the game is running faster than intended.

	"While there have been precedents of this game being accepted with NTSC timing, and this run is objectively an improvement to these runs, the old runs are also over nine years old, and there is no reason to continue a bad precedent of running a game on these settings now that it is known and verified to be faster than intended. I'm rejecting this submission for that reason.
