	"Mortal Kombat - Deadly Alliance is the first of 3d trilogy games released in the 2000s era, it's the most simple and it sets the standard for future games, so if you know about deception or armaggedon, it's very similar to those. It doesn't have pause glitch, traps or infinite combos that are speedrun relevant, so this run has more variety to it.

	" . The verifcation movie plays literally 1 match with each profile, puts both profiles against each other and wagerglitches koins with 2 profiles, 2 controllers, and buys Nitara, the unlockable characte,and sets difficulty at max. I will NEVER TAS KNOQUEST MODE, WHICH IS JUST A BUNCH OF TRIALS, because it would have to unlock everything and then do all the combo trials and tests. I also used portable.txt to make the emualtor more stable and easier to configure, it doesnt seem to have anything written on it, so i don't understand how it works.

	"Neijin sadly has a cooldown which is not reset at round end. Since most attacks are slow, unfortunately it's no good to start attacks without Neijin, and you end having to wait for it if you went too fast in the last round.

	"With her very strong strings, she makes short work of most enemies, but the strategies for best rounds vary because there are more damage amplifiers. With multiple amplifiers, i realized single hits were better and spinning kick could cause around 45% by itself!

	"If your enemy is caught with with a weapon in its hand or in the air, it will take more damage, and this allows for faster strategies. Rounds will vary, and some different combos would be possible if enemies were closer to walls, fortunately the new strategies don't need that. Manipulating RNG will be the improvement for any one who wants to tackle this and maybe new combo routes and optimizations. Maybe some new strat with anotther character?

	"The Sub Boss Moloch is usually very hard, but here he gets wrecked, he's not juggleable or pushable so i tried using that to go faster but no new strat was more relevant than short strings.

	"In terms of entertainment, fighting games can be rather dull to TAS since the fastest way to beat the enemy sometimes happens to be very straight forward and repetitive. That's why playaround / glitch demonstrations can be more favourable when it comes to these games. In this case, fatalities are the most sorely missed element, being a central aspect of what makes Mortal Kombat such an appealing game.

[div class=p 
	"None of the above precludes acceptability. We're in the business of beating games fast and this movie certainly does it, and in an evidently optimized fashion. Furthermore, the fights here are satisfingly violent and fast-paced. The use of damage amplifiers make quick rid of the enemies at the expense of some health (takes damage to go faster). Finally, the final boss is indeed fatalized (fastest way to end the game).
