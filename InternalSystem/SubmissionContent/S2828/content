	"I got the idea for this some time ago and wondered how such a movie would work, and decided to make a |Testrun at 14:03.33. This movie improves the Testrun by roughly 45 seconds due to general optimization, much better boss fights and generally becoming more familiar with the game. I also tried to showcase some more interesting things than in the testrun, such as odd enemy behaviour and narrow avoiding of projectiles.

The goal is not vastly different from the existing publications, however it is different enough in gameplay to warrant its own publication.  In particular the "no damage" part restricts damage boosts and other damage tricks.
