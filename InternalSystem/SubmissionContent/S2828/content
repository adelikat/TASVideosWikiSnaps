	"The original Castlevania is set in the year 1691. Simon Belmont must make his way through the eponymous castle to destroy Count Dracula. To make his quest a little bit harder, Simon is not allowed to use subweapons or take damage.

	"I got the idea for this some time ago and wondered how such a movie would work, and decided to make a

		"Testrun

	" at 14:03.33. This movie improves the Testrun by roughly 45 seconds due to general optimization, much better boss fights and generally becoming more familiar with the game. I also tried to showcase some more interesting things than in the testrun, such as odd enemy behaviour and narrow avoiding of projectiles.

	"Most of the work here consisted of getting a rosary or potion to spawn. The Mummies could perhaps be improved by getting the long whip and hitting them from afar, but I find it more interesting to stay between them the whole time.

	"Certain enemies such as Fleamen act differently, depending on wether you are facing them or not. If you face them, they'll do a slower high jump, allowing me to reach a door before one could hit me. I got a potion to spawn early on, allowing me to ignore a fleaman that would otherwise have slowed me down.
