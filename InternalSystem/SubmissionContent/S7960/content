	"Like almost every other wrestling game, we rely on ring outs as the fastest possible strategy. This game has a training mechanic where you can build power (which equates to more damage) through a mashing mini game. The power is not overwhelming and we don't need it to ring people out. It serves no benefit since pinning people would take too long.

	"We start by running toward the opponent who launches us to the outside to start the 20 count. The 20 count is "shared" and you can't break it by rolling back into or out of the ring. The count to 1 is 60 frames, and 2-20 are 64 frames apiece.

	"What you can do however is lock down the AI. If you're actively doing something, they can't get back into the ring. This holds true even if you're standing in the ring while they're outside, you can 30hz mash punches and they literally can't get back into the ring. This is boring though and we don't lose any time by having stuff actually occur outside the ring so I did a few things.

	"After beating the 9 other wrestlers, we face the final boss who is a lot stronger than the others but even demon wrestlers respect kayfabe and accept defeat with a ring out. The hesitation before entering the ring is on purpose, as anything faster makes him recover faster and enter the ring for some reason.
