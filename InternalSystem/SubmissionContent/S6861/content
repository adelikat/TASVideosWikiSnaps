	"Most weapons in this game cause a knock back when it is hit against a wall. In this run the clubs alternate attack (Which is used to solve puzzles including fire) is used to gain speed that is normally not obtainable. To do so you must run at a wall, then use the alt attack for 2 frames, and then either jump or dash jump in the opposing direction. Dan's normal walking speed is 27/28, and 56 whillst daring dashing, the maximum speed that I have personally gotten from this technique is 97 under certain conditions. This is very useful through out the run.

[div class=p 
	"This is where the run takes a huge left turn. It has been known for more than a decade that you can clip inside of the dragon fire gate, but it has never be known on how to get out. The exact method that I used was actually tested by the previous taser of this category, but it was overlooked, and called not possible. I personally have been trying to find a way out since I started running this game, and while I was tasing the game with the old any% route I decided to try this method, and it worked. This meant I had to restart the tas. This glitch saves well over 10 minutes, and is this games version of Spyro 2's Gulp Skip. Being able to complete this level without dragon armor means you do not have to visit the entire right side of the map, thus skipping all of those levels, and any key items those levels require. The problem that I encountered while tasing this trick was the enemies. When you use the alternate attack on the club it tends to aim at near by enemies, so I had to manipulate the enemies to be away from where I do the knock back dash. After you escape the gate, you grab the yellow rune and finish the level.

This loop saves us from having to fight the rock golems.

	"This was definitely the hardest level of them all to tas. The amount of rng manipulation is crazy. I use this glitch called the soldier despawn glitch, which allows you to fight a certain amount of zarok's men at a time. You may be wondering why I do it differently then the other tas. That's because if you do it with this method the game crashes. It crashes on console and mednafan, but works fine on inaccurate emulators. The method I came up with to still use the glitch is to spawn in the extra soldiers and kill them. The goal that I had in mind for this was to have 1 of my men remain in the end so the cutscene where they give you health is very short. The amount of time it took me to actually do this was crazy. Each soldier is luck dependent and can either dodge or attack, it's very random, so this was a huge pain in the rear. I end up spawning the soldiers in 2 seperate waves, 2 soldiers, and then 2 more once those have died. This skips having to heal any of your men.
