	"Shackled is a 1986 arcade game from Data East. It's basically their attempt at making a Gauntlet clone. The main mechanic that sets it apart is that saving other prisoners lets the player swap between different shot types outside of the basic dagger.

	"As an extra note, Shackled is a bad dump according to MAME. From my casual play the music sometimes just stops for no real reason. This doesn't seem to happen with the Japanese version, Breywood. There are also gameplay differences but that seems more of an intentional change between regions rather than a dumping issue.

	"In the world version, Shackled, there's a kinda hidden exit on the first floor that jumps straight to the credits when used. This is more likely an accidental dev door left in to test that the ending works. This door isn't present in the Japanese version, Breywood, so it's generally not considered a real 1 credit clear taking that exit. The full game instead has 100 floors to complete before reaching the proper ending door.

[div class=p 
	"I would not consider this route to the end as a proper completion as it's the equivalent to the joke TASes that simply go to the options and rolls credits, at least for normal publications. The Playground section of TASVideos is where this run is best placed. I've considered wanting to do a full 100 floor clear on either/both versions of this game since there haven't been any reported 1 credit clears of this game as far as I know. Both regional versions would likely be separate publications due to their changes but I haven't taken the full work and research to be sure.
