	"Hey guys! This is DJ Incendration here, with a new TAS of the game Dragster, for the Atari 2600. This run beats the current run by MrWint and Omnigamer by 0.31 seconds (real time), thanks to some experimentation! Not as much research was put in as the current runor the rejected submission, where Dat1joker's submission privileges were unnecessarily revoked, but I'm happy with this nonetheless.

	"This run was able to skip most of the beginning actions and get to the part where the notes go up slowly, and you hit the button and Left. I'd recommend that you watch the current submission and compare it to this one.

	"Thanks to McHazard and adelikat for their TASes of MTPO and SPO, since I never would have known about TASing or this site. Also, thanks to Todd Rogers, who I believe is legit, even if a lot of research was put in. There's video evidence that it's legit!
