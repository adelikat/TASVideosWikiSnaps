	"Hey guys! This is DJ Incendration here, with a new TAS of the game Dragster, for the Atari 2600. This run beats the current run by MrWint and Omnigamer by 0.31 seconds (real time), thanks to some experimentation! Not really though... There wasn't as much research put in as the current runor (Dat1joker) whose submission privileges were unnecessarily revoked, but I didn't realize that I was early. I hope a lot more research is put in for the 5.51 which I know is possible. If one person did it, it will be done again (without ROM editing).

	"Thanks to McHazard and adelikat for their TASes of MTPO and SPO, since I never would have known about TASing or this site. Also, thanks to Todd Rogers, who I believe is legit, even if a lot of research was put in. There's video evidence that it's legit!
