	"I choose Hard to get big challenge for the tool-assisted TAS. With Easy I can spend four more lives on summoned items, in levels 12, 16, 10 and 17. That would save about 4000 frames. On Easy skill 60 frames per level are spent on longer score screen. With 28 levels that is 1680 frames. So the Easy run would be 2320 frames faster. The Med run would be almost the same. Hard is best.

After switching a human there is cooldown of 44 frames, so you cannot switch. If you are a pro tas editor and see a big mistake, then it is proably the cursor delay or some other delay that cannot be avoided, so please try to improve it yourself. Killing dinos gives a long delay. The moving platform can hold only one human at a time.

	"With Hard skill you have 8 lives. Reserve lives are lost when a dead human is respawned. Another use for lives is to transform them to items. Each level requires that you have some number of humans alive. Summoning an item takes 328 frames, so it is usually faster to grab a nearby item. Each level has a limited set of items available, so you cannot summon any item in any level. The best route requires that you find the summons that save most time without losing too many lives to get game over.

You can wait at the home hut to prevent 6 frames of lag, but then the viewer has no idea why the player is not moving for a long time, so it looks bad. I make a speed/entertainment tradeoff and wait on the moving platform, so that you can see the platform cycle. You can see the moose too, so I think it is very worth the 6 frames. If you do not like the decision, then you can edit it easily. You can summon a spear to save 1037 frames, but you must save the life for a bigger save elsewhere.
