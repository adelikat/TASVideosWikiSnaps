	"Gliding asteroids and a layer of clouds separate you from your supply base on Planet Kaylon. Yet...crusing over the planet, you spot a supply base below. But as soon as you send off a shuttle ship to the base, a cluster of asteroids sails across its path. Darting quickly through the asteroids and clouds, your shuttle narrowly escapes collision before touching down on Kaylon.

	"I have vague memories of this game. If it wasn't for "Bagdad", I think I would have eventually gotten to this. In fact, I don't think I played any of the other games until many years later. It probably happened when I finally got a Commodore 64 a number of years later.

	"There is no selection of difficulty. You start on the first level and proceed until the difficulty increases beyond a solvable situation. In this case, that situation occurs on Level 29. Why is this unsolvable? The way the physics work, you cannot fall fast enough to slip through a one block gap. You have to have a two block gap at minimum to continue on.

[div class=p 
	"As with all B.A.S.I.C. written games, the speed of "interpreting" the language as it runs, has severe drawbacks on performance. So, to help out with speed...you cannot just hold a direction, as it will initiate the polling of the full joystick routine. If you were to analyze this movie's inputs, you'll find two and three frame inputs, surrounded by nothing. The difference in holding a direction can add a probably 30 frames per drop. So it is to your advantage to let off the direction until the polling comes around at the right time.

	"The amount of effort spent here, was around 6 weeks. I had originally thought of applying a seed RNG, by using the command "RND", but there is no way I'm going to run this full length TAS for every combintation...which can be hundreds.
