	"The original SMW was written in ASM and thus not very portable at all. The SMA2 rendition of the game is a complete rewrite using C++; most exploits of the original game do not exist in SMA2. The only exploit I used (which may or may not have been an intentional part of the game, I do not know) is making autoscrolling areas move faster by pushing right on the edge.

	"The aim of the speedrun was to make a very quick defeat of Bowser from a clean Save RAM. The in-game statistics say it is 7:57 minutes, but I'm not entirely sure that it is accurate. In any case better than my run on the real GBA (15:28 minutes).

	"Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2 is an excellent remake of the original game. There are many changes throughout, most of them to adapt to the GBA's low screen resolution. One of the major changes is the addition of Luigi's special abilities, due to the absence of a two-player mode (they kept two-player SMB3 in SMA4, why couldn't they do it in SMA2? -_- sigh, Nintendo). Others include the adition of Dragon Coins to nearly 
	[b 
		"every
	]b
	" level, such as Ghost Houses and Castles (which are replayable after you get 96 goal completion); addition of voices (I don't like this one); a pretty-cool introduction; and pretty-cool cutscenes when getting all 96 goals and all Dragon Coins in all levels. There's many, many more differences than this of course, check out one FAQ at GameFAQs for a list of them.
