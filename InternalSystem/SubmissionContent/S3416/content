	": I found this run to be sub-optimal. Normally a run which is slightly sub-optimal and not really noticeable is okay. However this run isn't good enough for anything but the vault, with its primary criteria being speed. Since this run can be better optimized, I'm not going to bother putting it in the vault either. Rejecting.
