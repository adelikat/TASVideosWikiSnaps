	"This submission is for WWF Wrestlemania Steel Cage Challenge for the NES. This is one of the worst wrestling games out there. While it boasts an impressive roster of wrestlers they all look terrible and everyone pretty much has the same moveset. There are no signature moves. No finishing moves. Just bland and generic moves. That everyone has.

	"We choose the WWF Championship mode as this would be the full game goal mode. We have to win 9 matches. 6 regular, 3 in the steel cage. We choose The Undertaker as our wrestler because it doesn't actually cost any frames and I REFUSE TO PLAY AS THE HOLLYWOOD BLONDE JABRONI I PUT HIM IN THE CAMEL CLUTCH BREAK HIS BACK MAKE HIM HUMBLE. Shout outs to Iron Sheik.

	"For the normal matches we use the trusty ring out strats. This game has some manipping involved as well, as there is a timer byte (0x0404) that counts down from 14 to 1 and when it hits 1, anyone who's not in the ring gets their count updated. By exiting the ring first, we start this timer ourselves, and by time the opponents follow us out they get hit by the timer immediately and start at 1.

	"As much as I wanted to have some fun during the ring outs, any offensive moves or grapples that connect actually delay the count by a not insignificant number of frames. In the ideal circumstance the first count takes 100 frames and the rest take 101. Because of this, we have little choice but to kite the opponents around and not initiate any grapples etc. For "Drama" and "Entertainment" I occasionally violate social distancing protocols and stand very close while they don't do anything to me. Exciting!

	"The 3 cage matches can be won by climbing to the top of the cage or pinfall. You don't even technically have to "exit" the cage. You just win when you reach the top. And for some reason, if the opponent gets up at all while you're climbing you just fall down. They don't have to do anything to you. This game sucks.

	""exiting" the cage is faster and we wear down our opponents with the Undertaker's signature high flying offense that he was renowned for, throw in some stomps, throws, etc until the opponent is weak enough to let us exit. We actually have to be careful though, if you do too much damage the opponent gets 3/4 of a health bar back so careful planning was needed to do enough damage to win, but not enough damage to trigger their mega heal.
