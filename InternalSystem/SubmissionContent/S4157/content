	": These kinds of runs are generally not well received and this run is no exception. In order for it to be eligible for the vault, it has to be a real record without any obvious flaws. Quite a few flaws were pointed out in the discussion. Further, some fights seem to use faster strategies than others. An occasional block and retaliate should in some cases also prove faster than techniques used in this movie where Scorpion jumped out of the way of an attack, or used other slow moves. Rejecting.
