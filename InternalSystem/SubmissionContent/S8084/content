	"Ottos Ottifanten: Baby Brunos Apltraum, also known as Baby Bruno's Nightmare but will be shortened to BBA from now on for convenience, was a 1998 video grame developed by Bit Managers and published by Infogrames. The gameplay concept originally developed in 1993 as a The Adventures of Pinocchio, based on the public domain fairy tale version, but Infogrames shelved it as it wasn't based on a known license. When the Ottifanten license was acquired, Bit Managers took the original Pinocchio prototype and reworked it quite a bit in such a way that they do play very differently.

	(__wikiLink|displaytext=rejected submission|href=/6858S)
	" of the prototype version for not being different enough from BBA. After having watched both world record RTA runs of both grames I believe they are different enough to be considered different grames with TASes that can be published alongside each other. The only way I could make some proof of that was to TAS it. While possibly a foolish endeavor, it's probably one of the best ways to make concrete comparisons between the 1993 prototype and the 1998 release.

	"In Pinocchio the map floor is an 8x8 grid. This was done with small grid tiles, objects, and sprites. In BBA, all the elements in stages were made larger with more detail. As such, the HUD was heavily shrunk down and the map floor was reduced to a 7x7 grid. Losing about 25% of available floor space does affect how some levels are approached between the versions because map distances and movement cycles are affected by the map shrinkage. This makes any maps similar between the two have skips that are only doable in one version or the other.

[div class=p 
	"The addition of items to BBA introduces a new and intentional mechanic that gets utilized throughout this TAS. All of these are considered platforms while they're around. This leads to skips that weren't possible in Pinocchio such as using milk or bombs to jump over otherwise fatal obstacles. These objects can also be placed on top of hostile enemies to ride on top of them, which is also an intended mechanic due to a late grame level requiring the use of that technique.

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"To me, this one seems to be a deliberate change by Bit Managers rather than an oversight of the prototype version. The reduced screen size and the fact that items could be used as platforms would mean that having diagonal movement would make skips, both deliberate and unintentional, easier to pull off. With the level design for later stages being more puzzle oriented it would make sense for them to remove 8 way movement so the player can more deliberately focus on how to approach some levels.
