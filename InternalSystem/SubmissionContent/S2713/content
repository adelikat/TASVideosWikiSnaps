[div class=p 
	"Pipe Mountain: Nothing serious here, used the 6/5 speed trick on the whole level. The pipes skip part was a nice but very simple.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Grisba Chucks: Using the Yoshi was pretty useful here, I just skipped a pretty big puzzle part with the Yoshi-drop jump in the dark cave. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Donut Lift Town: Two walljumps in this level, and both were quite useful. With the dark Bowser music level I skipped a relatively long puzzle part again. 
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Emerald way: Minor skips here. 
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Iggy's Castle: Nothing serious here, at least I could play around a bit in the scrolling part.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Marble Valley: To be honest, I still don't know how to do that part with the walljump (outside) without a shell or a walljump. =P I quite broke that little puzzle part in the cave though, I think. And finally got a cape!
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Doneky Ruins: Minor skips here with using the cape. Btw, this level inspired me during making my Big Boo's Legion 2 level, Mysterious Shrine. That's true!

[div class=p 
	"Sunset Run!!: Nothing serious here, but really. Just flying. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Marble Angry Zone!: Damn, I noticed that badly developed swimming only after I recorded the whole video. =/ I'm really sorry for that. Fortunately it's not too long. At least I could fly under the ground in the later part. 
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Larry's Castle: That weird layer 2 scrolling part was very interesting to beat, but I think it isn't too bad. Other than that, nothing serious in this level.
