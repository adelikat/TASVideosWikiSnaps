	"Delisoba Deluxe is an unreleased game for the Sega Saturn. It was commissioned by a game show of the same name with CAVE heading development. The game originally uses a custom made scooter to control the in game scooter. The game was never officially released with copies only given out to audience members at tapings of the show. The game is designed to be played in turns, so after the first competitor's timer runs out you swap to the second competitor. It isn't possible to beat the game on the first competitor with default settings.

	"The game itself isn't very remarkable, but it does provide a couple of interesting speed traps that are designed to prevent you from going full speed at all times. The TAS does a quick deceleration at one of these points to squeeze between a bus and a car to avoid crashing.

	": So while this TAS seems well optimized with the default settings, default settings are not inherently a Vaultable branch. There is an option to increase the max speed cap all the way up to 255. With changing that option, this TAS becomes easily beatable. Given it's the same course, changing these settings isn't akin to a different mode. And because audience response was understandably meh, default settings didn't seem possible for moons. In fact, increasing the max speed makes the game a bit more interesting as well because you have less time to react to stuff and may be forced to let go of the gas more often. I would like to see a TAS with 255 max speed or whatever is most optimal if one could never truly reach 255 without ending up in a forced crash state.
