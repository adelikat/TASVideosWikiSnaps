	"This game is Mega Man game which was rushed, with untranslated voices and bad translation. Some bosses were poorly designed and look like a mess as well. Some stages are also poorly designed, being impossible to pass with the wrong armor or character, or structure randomization. The difficulty of the game is

	"In fact, things in this game exist just to kill you, that's for sure. Not to mention that Xtreme mode turns entire stages into enemy soup. This game also introduced a new hazard enviroment system, wich means that a stage will have some enviroment variations depending on the stages that you went previously, some of these being incredibly annoying and some not being much of a problem. A Stage will only have 1 hazard at a time, meaning that if you went to 2 stages that would cause hazard in a stage, only the later one will take place. This game has 8 different hazards, and those are:

Abused the ice glitch here, while jumping with dash speed, before you touch ground you release forward, and you will slide, that plus dashing allows zero to travel at great speeds, this can only be done in plain ice terrain. I also used the Invencibility Glitch wich is achieved by using Rainy Turtloid Power in a momment where you can't finish it because of an absent floor, in other words, i got a fast slide because of ice, used the technique, since i leave ground before it finishes, i end up being invincible. I also discover that you can avoid the first big pits with falling ice with Zero. Later i manipulated the final ice rows part while i was waiting for the ice to fall in the second big pit.

In the second part of the stage, using Ice allows you to advance faster and avoid to be trapped by the compressor once aswell.

		"First
	]a
	" one is a script that just show you the values of the common adresses you would be using on RAM Watch, these includes: Player's HP and Inv values, Souls collected by X and Zero, the X and Y Speeds and Positions with SubPixel of the player, the dash meter and a charge meter that only shows when the charge of any of the 2 weapons is greater than 0, that prevents it for showing when using Zero. It also shows the Boss HP and Inv if there is one. Also shows the RNs that got burned in the previous frame.

This script is used for Nightmare Snakes (midboss in Blaze Heatnix stage). The user would have to determine the fastest/convenient set. Sadly enough, it can only be done in flat terrain.
