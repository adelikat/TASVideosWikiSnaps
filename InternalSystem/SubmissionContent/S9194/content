	"Moving Around: So for starters, you can Move Around with the analog Stick, You can jump by pressing the A button. Now to move the Camera with a C controller Stick also if you press the Z Button will zoom out a bit.
	$LF
	"Combat: For Combat, it's simple! you press the B button to pull a hockey Stick and press the B button to throw at the robots and damage them, also you can press the R button to Aim at Robots Correctly.
	$LF
	"Vehicles: In Rocket Power Beach Bandits we have 5 vehicles, which are a Skateboard, RollerBlades, Jetski, BumperKarts and Hoverboards. So the thing is you noticed that the Jetski, Bumper Karts and Hoverboards are not in the option in the menu that's because we only can ride these vehicles at certain Levels.
	$LF
	"Twister Cam: So for the Twister Cam the only thing you need to know about Twister Cam is that I can take pictures of Evidence of Golem Industries so we can bust them but... you won't be seeing me taking pictures a lot... until we get to Twister Snoops a lot 2.

	"What Silver Coins does is it helps you progress through the story mode Because i needed 15 Coins to be able to play the Shooting Gallery so that we can get to The Lakes which is the next Level.

	" and Halfpipe Skateboard: Now this is the very first Level Of The Game which teaches the basics of how to use a Skateboard and do tricks also you can see that I try to get kinda low on the ramp and jump and do a trick so that way we can speeds things up a lot. now you notice that once I got to 24000 points I started to play around a bit and not do tricks. I did that because over 25000 points I got a gold coin but in this TAS I'm not going for Gold Coins they are nothing special yet.

That you can ride the wall with the roller blades by pressing up so i can stay on the wall, also the physics are very weird when I do that as you can see. Now once i talk to the Little Girl whatever her name is. i did that so i could activate another level called Shooting Gallery so we could get a Bus Ticket to The Lakes.

		"Level 6 Pumping Station 1:

	" Now let me talk about the normal route of this level usually in casual gameplay you would go all the way to the right side to jump on the boxes to get where the boxes is then go to back to the pump station to climb on the ladder to push the button and it will do a little cutscene of showing the door is opening so that's the normal route. but in speedrun, we just go to the left side of the pump station and jump on this tiny rock and jump over the gate usually you only need Reggie to do this jump but also Otto can do it, and Twister but the only one who can't do it is Sam because he short lol. Now here is another Skip just in 1 level you will be seeing i go for a wall clip to push a Robot to the door so once i manage to jump over the robot i be able to clip myself to the other gate and im able to get to go to the next level.

So this is the part where Golem Guy goes up but you notice he having a bit of trouble. well, thats because he is trying to where left side of the map where he is supposed to go up.

	": Before the judgment, a personal note. This submission restores my faith in TAS (not that I ever lost it in the first place, lol). The author had tried before to submit a movie (
	(__wikiLink|href=/8884S|implicitdisplaytext=8884S)
	") for this game but unfortunately we could never make it sync. Instead of just giving up and let it go, the author set to re-make the entire movie from scratch. Keeping in mind the sheer length of this movie, this implied many more hours of work.

	"I collaborated with the author through these weeks/months to make sure his work-in-progress movies didn't desync and am happy to report all this effort paid off in the end. I always thought complete re-do's (once, twice, or several times) are a must to achieve really superior TASes. Every time you start again, you do it with a much better knowledge of the game. This is indeed a case that proves this rule. This submission is more than 4 minutes faster than the previous one and contains many new tricks, including out-of-bounds shortcuts.

	"The movie looks sufficiently optimized. I can only complain about the lack of entertainment inputs during time-based trials, where the author sometimes just stays put or does not make any cool tricks. These were huge lost opportunities that taint an otherwise entertaining movie, so I hope it doesn't happen again in any further submissions.
