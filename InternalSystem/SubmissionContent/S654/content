	"Making this movie was suprisingly easy, probably due to experience. There were a few difficult spots, though. Getting missles for the first red door in Kraid's lair after restarting after the Ice Beam was tricky. There are almost no monsters to kill for missles that won't slow you down. The hardest part, though, was getting into Tourian. Getting that Rio to line up just right took a lot of time. I somehow lost a time unit on the escape over my last run, and I don't know how.
