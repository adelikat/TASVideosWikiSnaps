	"Hetfield90's Mega Man X2 TAS in 31:15.15. It is 1900 frames(~31.5 seconds) faster than the published run in terms of actual gameplay improvements, and 1453 frames(27.3 seconds) faster outright due to disparities in lag/load time emulation as well as frame rate between Snes9x 1.43 and BizHawk. Emulator used was BizHawk 1.9.4.

[p 
	"For as long as I've been involved in Mega Man X2 speedrunning, it had been largely taken for granted that the fastest method of completing the game involved obtaining the Shoryuken, and such has been done in RTA and TASing of this game ever since Blechy's TAS from 2004. But while I was on Gator's stage in the making of this TAS (at this point still collecting items for Shoryuken), FractalFusion brought it to my attention that the two routes could actually potentially be very close. After testing the differences between the two routes using known any%/low% strats, I concluded that it was ~5 seconds faster to forego obtaining the Shoryuken. However, over the course of making this TAS, through the development of new strats specific to this route which acquires only the buster upgrade, the time saves of the route reached as high as ~18.5 seconds. More details on the differences between the two routes can be found in

[p 
	"Now what was previously the category most similar to real-time gameplay within the SNES Mega Man X games, Mega Man X2 Any% now is arguably the least. Because of the nature of Shoryuken cutting out a substantial amount of RNG and difficult execution, the route/strats in this TAS will likely never be attempted by any real-time speed runner seriously intending to compete with top Shoryuken times.

This global timer is particularly annoying, because it can't be manipulated in any way, and you simply have to work around it. For Gator's stage, every time the global timer resets back to 0, it initiates a screen shake. The duration of this screen shake is then determined by the RNG value on that frame, which can be anywhere between 32 to 64 frames, and for whatever reason, capsules in this game do not open until the screen is perfectly centered. Unfortunately, the only way to optimize this in routes that start Sponge>Gator(whether you are collecting the upgrades in Sponge's stage or not) is to manipulate a 32 frame screen shake just before you reach the capsule(namely through dust sprites from wall slides during the Sponge fight), and then delay your movement so that you reach the capsule the frame after said screen shake ends(so that you can get your toe in the capsule during the dialogue with the strike chain). I had to delay 12 frames in the buster upgrade-only route, and FractalFusion had to delay 9 frames in the Shoryuken route.

By firing it from far away I was able to reach a full t4 shot before his i-frame reset from the fireball throw occurred. Another annoying part of TASing this fight is that you want to fire the buster shots from wall slides to remove the shooting animation time, but shooting bubbles forces Stag to throw fire balls which resets X's i-frames and interrupts his jumps, so it is almost impossible to jump over him to get to the wall closest to him. I managed to get around this on the final shot by expending my first charge shot by taking damage at a specific time and letting go of shoot during the knock back animation.

Because of this awkward interval, Spin Blade would normally only damage Bubble crab every 66 frames, and you would lose 6 frames on each hit. However, by manipulating Crab's movement so that he walks out of the wheel, allowing it to fall for a specific number of frames before he throws up his pincers, catching the wheel again, the wheel's damage interval is thrown out of whack and can actually damage him every 60 frames.

I tried as hard as possible to make it look like Zero has an AI in this fight since all of his attacks are strictly positioning based. You can literally stand just outside of saber range while jumping over his green shots and spamming Speed Burners into him every 60 frames for the whole fight.

	"I am glad I made this TAS since the route is something so different from what has ever been seen in TASes and RTAs before, but I don't think I will try to improve it any time soon unless some more optimizations are found, despite some already being known that weren't feasibly hex-editable into this run. Since this TAS obsoletes the Shoryuken run, my next submission will be a 100% run which collects the Zero parts in addition to Shoryuken.
