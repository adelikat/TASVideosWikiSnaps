	"This TAS is of New Adventure Island for the PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16, released in 1992. The plot of the game is that Master Higgins' wife, Tina, along with six children, are stolen from their wedding by this purple monkey known as Baron Bronsky. This means Higgins has to traverse 25 levels to get ll of them back.

	"The mechanics are largely the same as Adventure Island on the NES. Fruit can be picked up to increase your energy bar, and running out of notches on that bar kills you. However, at the end of each level, it takes each notch off for points individually, which takes a while if you end with full notches. Therefore, it is most beneficial to end a level with one notch remaining, which is easier said than done usually. Many levels end with fruit in places you can't get past and the -4 levels always end before we have the chance to lose most of the bar.

	"Sometimes in stages you will come across eggs, which when broken reveal gifts. They can either contain a fairy that grants invincibility for a short time (can be helpful in certain places), milk which fully restores your energy bar (BAD BAD BAD BAD), a flower which does nothing (?), and, best of all, a skateboard which increases your movement speed. The skateboard is the best, but taking a hit with it will make it disappear and slowing down will just slow your movement and won't put you to a complete stop, so it can be hard to manage at times.

	"One strategy we aimed to employ was the use of corner boosts. If you get Master Higgins in just the right positioning, he will clip into the corner of a platform and get boosted forwards slightly, saving a few frames every time. However, it doesn't work on every corner if you are trying not to slow down, so many corners are passed without boosting.

	"Many obstacles cannot be passed without waiting, such as the fiery whomp things in the -4 levels, the lightning clouds in 5-1 and the floating skulls in 6-3. You can see enderpal7 (me) ranting about these in the user files for New Adventure Island.
