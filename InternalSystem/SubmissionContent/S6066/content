	"Disney's Tarzan (often called Action Game) is the video game adaptation of the famous Disney cartoon in which we can follow the titular ape man's adventures while being raised by gorillas and growing up in the jungle, his life being full with interesting plot twists. In the game we can run, surf and climb our way through 13 levels of varying difficulty, going through challenges such as: being chased by elephants(Stampede, the 4th level), fighting against Sabor, the furious leopard (Sabor Attacks, the 6th level), guiding Jane, the female explorer, the girlfriend of Tarzan, away from baboons and other perils of the jungle (The Baboon Chase, 7th level), the adventure of Terk, Tarzan's gorilla friend, in the cluster of apes on the British camp (Trashing the Camp, 8th level), and finally, there's the last battle with the main antagonist, Clayton(Conflict with Clayton, 13th and last level).

	"The aforementioned things are done here as fast as possible, and without specifically paying attention to item collection, with a variety of smooth movement and one major glitch being used (the box clip at the end of the 8th level, a glitch requiring almost pixel perfection, which skips a huge slow climbing section, and along with it something like a bit more than ten seconds maybe). The run's correct TAS time is 26:09.3, which means it being timed from power-on to the last input(while rolling the credits). No deaths included, only taking damage in favour of faster speed in some places.

	"Since optimization possibilities are limited in this game, including any new routes or glitches, this TAS wasn't really hard to make, given that the author is good at running the PC version of this game in real time. There is most likely still time to save in this run, but with current knowledge it doesn't seem possible to improve at the moment. Maybe the future will surprise us.

	": Hi TheGreatestRoman and welcome to TASVideos. Here at TASVideos we want movies that aim for perfection. This TAS quite clearly was made without many TASing tools implemented. The menuing at the beginning is extremely subpar and in level 1 alone I managed to save 15 frames of gameplay in half a day in addition to menuing improvements:

	"Later levels are much worse, I was constantly able to find minor mistakes littered throughout. From not holding right soon enough at the start of a level to jumping directly into an enemy when you can easily jump over it by holding the jump button longer, this TAS is riddled with mistakes. I've checked 6 levels so far and pretty much all of them have such sloppiness. I believe that the TAS was made without using frame advance and was instead played in real time. We want TASes that demonstrate superhuman play, and sloppy mistakes are far from superhuman. I would recommend reading the
