	"This is a very good submission with a lot of well planned bomb placements. There were some bits where it kind of feels like it's possible to finish faster but RNG being something to consider throughout and the fact that remote detonated bombs are finite upgrades makes that harder to test. Nice work guiding Bomberman and his brother Bomberman 2 on their quest.

	"Also I'll leave it up to the publisher to figure out the game's name. The Japanese name is Bomber Man World, the US name is New Atomic Punk - Global Quest, and this version of the game has both regional names but the default DIP switch setting is set to the Japanese name.
