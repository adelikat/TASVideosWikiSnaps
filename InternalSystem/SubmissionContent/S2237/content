You need to travel all the way deep into Abadon's domain in order to stop his plans, and to do so, you'll also need to master quite a number of spells that will surely be useful on your journey. Then again, there are a number of spells which are completely useless, but who's counting?

	"As for gameplay, you recover mana at a fairly slow pace. Sure, it may be 6 points per second, but when you consider that some spells takes a hundred, and others even more than that, it's quite a few seconds that gets added up. Then throw in the fact that you can go from 100% food to 0% in 4.25 minutes, and you'll find yourself hanging around a food shop while you charge up your shield spells, taking thousands of mana to get all four at 100%. Hey, it is an effective tactic! Additionally, bosses regenerate health, so you must deal damage quick enough to have hope, and if you're out of mana, the mana regen alone isn't fast enough.

]p
[p 
	"One FLEET FOOT(1) takes 100 mana and, cast at an optimal timing, can save 179 frames. One JUMP(4) takes 36 mana and saves 59 frames. Since mana is a limiting factor, it's often best to use FLEET FOOT. The JUMPs are still used to speed up a few things when convenient.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Since FLEET FOOT gives a considerable amount of frames saved, and is costly in the mana department, one limitation to your speed is mana management. I don't see much of a way to squeeze out any more from mana than what I did, since when I faced the fire demon in the CASTLE, I had 3 mana left after my last LIGHTNING bolt. That ain't much.

It takes over 8 seconds to regain that mana, but not nearly so much to enter the menu, learn a spell, and back out. With this train of logic, I decided it's in my best interest to occasionally visit the menu to learn spells, as seen in this run.
	$LF

[p 
	"Slotermeyer's run learns JUMP first thing and hops away. This would certainly make use of that mana other than my menu transitions. I keep thinking what I did is faster, as I have to learn those spells someday, but I can't convince myself it is. Maybe I should have jumped and see...
	$LF
]p

I use a single FLY spell of a high enough level so that it lasts clear through the boss battle and beyond. Note where I saved my game... Yea, not exactly a bright place to do that, eh?

Incidentally, it is possible to skip the ferry if you manipulate the lightning a little or use IRON BOOTS to negate your flying, then FLY once more just as you hit the water.

[p 
	"Since this place has a potion shop, I buy mana potions for mana! I immediately drink two and buy replacements, where the 1000 extra mana surely comes in handy later. I also use the menu transition to learn JUMP. It's quite obvious when I start bouncing all of a sudden.
	$LF

[p 
	"These jumps can frustrate nearly anyone. And there's ghosts that damage you on top of that. Even at some cost of mana, I only use level 4 JUMPs, as switching to a lower level for smaller jumps takes a screen transition to do so. Probably not worth saving the 7 or so mana for each of those jumps.

	"That green gargoyle thing is defeated by the ever-trusty LIGHTNING(4) spell. I'd ask the weather to not be so selective about which flying thing to zap, but no... It doesn't listen. I do make a "missed shot", but due to the order of how Paul fires his attack spells, I have no choice if I want to go fast as possible. He always goes upper-mid-lower, in that order. If I fire twice, and shoot off upper and mid, Paul insists on making the next shot a lower one, no matter how long I wait, except when I leave the area.

If I could last until after that tree, I could replace the FLEET FOOT used there with UNKNOWN... and later FLEET FOOT through the DUNGEON for a little longer due to having more health then.
