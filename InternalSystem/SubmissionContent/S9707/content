[ul 
	[li 
		"Main reason why choosing this version! Resetting in US version makes you lose all your progress and start over. Japanese version however keeps all your upgrades when you reset and start from Area 1. This clearly allows for many shortcuts whenever we try to revisit Area 1 from a very far area. This proved to be useful after Area 3 and Area 6, as we needed to go back to Area 1 after defeating their bosses. Though, you do lose ammo for car's missiles and car's lightning bolt.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Death management was revised too. Death-warps are only used if Reset-warps are not beneficial, thus some of the deaths in current published run were skipped allowing for further time save.

[h4 id=Area7Shortcut 
	" Area 7 shortcut
	$LF
]h4
[ul

		"Another huge difference between US and Japan versions is the ability to skip straight Area 7 boss. In Japanese version, if you stand on the lava while Jason's hitbox also contacts another enemy, you still take damage during the pause and un-pause fading. If Jason was perfectly timed and positioned, he can gain just enough of distance to be able to take damage during un-pause fading and gain enough i-frames to skip to the boss room. ShiningDragoon

Though, it is still confusing sometimes as some buttons work on certain situations and don't work on others. It was a lot easier nonetheless!

	": When I first saw this submission, I had to judge it. I love this game and I loved watching Big Jon run it. Because it was PAL, I thought it was going to end up being the same kind of situation as 
	(__wikiLink|href=/5238M|implicitdisplaytext=5238M)
	". In that case, PAL obsoleted the US version. Not because the game was different, but because it behaved differently at 50Hz. This opened up major possibilities that changed many strats and the route. For Blaster Master, the differences in the game are enough to separate it from the US version. The apparent coding differences, allows this game to perform actions that are not possible on the US...thus leaving me with the thought that this should in fact be a separate branch, as indicated by
