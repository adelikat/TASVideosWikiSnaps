	"Run Saber is a pretty blatant rip-off of Strider, by Horisoft, but it's still a lot of fun for that. Basic plot (far as I can tell) is that aliens have taken over the Earth, and the Run Sabers, two genetically enhanced soldiers, are the planet's only hope. This TAS, using Alow (the male Run Saber) clears the game in  15min 16sec, with input ending at frame 54960 and the final hit connecting 4 frames after.

	": As much as I liked the video, I feel this can be greatly improved. Jumps need more precision, such as when you jump high onto one platform, only to jump again onto another, don't jump so high on the first jump. Also it seems you stuck around to battle certain enemies which you could run by. Lastly, while trying to make the bosses entertaining, I did find some fights had less than direct attacks, where some just barely missed, these have to be improved. All in all, I think it needs to be redone with more accuracy.
