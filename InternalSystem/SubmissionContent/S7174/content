This results in Ness facing to the left, which allows him to hit target 8 with a falling forward-aerial.

	"Popo the Ice Climber (as he is without his partner Nana while breaking targets) uses several edge cancels and a few attack startup autocancels to climb his stage. Most notably, target 1 is broken using a trick with Popo's neutral-special. The ice block would usually break the bricks on  the stage, but it has its own ECB which extends past its hitbox and interacts with the bricks' ECBs instead of breaking them. Thus, it bounces off the bricks to the target. Additionally, the brick directly below Popo is broken by the hammer swing, resulting in the attack being edgecanceled. This saves 0.75 seconds over the old record which did not use this trick. The ice block hit for target 7 is delayed by the hitlag of the hammer hitting target 6, allowing the ice block to fall off the moving cloud later and not miss its intended target. The bird holding target 10 is not RNG-dependent. This stage is also the only one which plays series-specific music by default.

The first boomerang is thrown down and chased upward, causing it to curl up and eventually hit 3 targets. The second boomerang is thrown down and not chased upward, causing it to curl down and hit 4 more targets.

Mewtwo is bottlenecked by the moving platform he lands on after target 3, as well as the burner he hits after target 5.

A phantom hit occurs when a hitbox intersects with a hurtbox by less than 0.01 units (targets and hazards cannot be phantom hit). Smash DI requires the victim to be in both a knockback animation and in hitlag, and a phantom only triggers the hitlag state. However, if one is already in the knockback state from a previous move, the hitlag from the phantom is sufficient to allow Smash DI. Then, if one Smash DIs into the full hit of the move or hazard, the phantom is canceled and regular Smash DI can be performed. This results in one additional Smash DI pulse and allows a TASer to precisely select their knockback direction, as the direction is chosen at the start of the full hit, which is after the first Smash DI. The usage of phantom Smash DI optimizes Roy's horizontal movement, allowing him to slide off the first platform to become actionable, airdodge to the second platform for even more speed, and hit the flipper at target 8 from the left for another damage boost to reach targets 9 and 10.
