	"I don't have any practice on SMW TASing but I'm comfortable with this game now... You have SpeedCaps at

	[b

	". 
	[b 
		"49

	" speedcap is the max so I reach it and then leave 
	[b 
		"R
	]b
	" and jump to maintain it. I went for Lui power which is it's unique feature. It gives you extra height while jumping and you can hold 
	[b 
		"A
	]b
	" while falling to decrease the falling speed. The major drawback of this PowerUp is that it makes some appreciable amount of lag. The X-Speed keeps varying every frame and just like the P-Speed, we unlock the under 50 pace by getting to 
	[b 
		"38
	]b
	" speed by running for couple of seconds.

	"It was brutal. The most haunting part of this TAS is a mixture of majorly Vertical and at many places, a Horizontal Scroller. It was the most difficult part because it had many enemies and many lag frames due to the traces of Lui PowerUp. There's a spot at which even passing through the enemy is very difficult and then cutting time is a different story. I tried my best to fall down or accelerate in the Left/Right directions as quickly as possible to save time. If anyone makes any improvements, it would be this level for sure and surely from lag reduction.
