	"The storyline is typical: Magneto wants to destroy humanity, and the X-men, leaded by Charles Xavier, need to stop him. The game is a simple beatâ€™em up, but you don't need to kill all the enemies to advance. Sometimes you do though.  Each X-man has some advantages over the others, and the choice for each stage isn't as hard as it appeared at first. Psylocke is the fastest, Beast is the strongest (highest damage rate), Gambit and Wolverine are in the middle of this. Cyclops is a good choice for a realtime game, but is much too slow for a TAS; however, you must use him at his starting stage.
