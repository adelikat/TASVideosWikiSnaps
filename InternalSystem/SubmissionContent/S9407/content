	"The game has 29 stages (4*7 stages plus 1 final boss stage), and there's 1 WR speedrun on twitch of the game that I used for a quick overview of the individual stages. One starts with 5 lifes, and every finished stage adds 1 additional life. There exist passwords for the stages, and there also exist maps of all stages on VGMaps:

]div
[div class=p

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The most important part of the optimization seems to lie in the order in which one collects the keys together with which paths one uses to do so (basically a Travelling Salesman Problem with enemies chasing Bugs Bunny).
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Micro-optimization & finetuning that can still be done and tested out:
	$LF
	"- some other routes can still be tested and optimized and compared with each other in the stages where the best route isn't as obvious (even though in almost all stages there's only 1 predetermined path that one can go, sometimes with doors spread throughout a stage that lead into empty rooms to confuse the player)
	$LF
	"- maybe dfferent directions should be pressed in some cases to make Bugs Bunny move forwards to reduce lag/change the lag pattern (since Up, Down, and Forwards make Bugs Bunny move forwards, with Up and Down also making Bugs Bunny move/transition up or down whenever possible); or one could also leave some directional inputs out since not all of them are needed for movement
	$LF
	"- in some cases when enemies generally don't need to be manipulated to be out of the way, one could anyways mess around and test different manipulations of their movement (by pressing directional inputs), since this most usually leads to lag differences
	$LF
	"- maybe some strange effects could be achieved by using left+right or up+down; or maybe lag differences could be induced by adding more new button presses to the usual ones (like select or holding multiple directions at once); or holding some buttons instead of releasing them could reduce lag
	$LF
	"- it probably would also be useful to figure out the general AI that the enemy types use, and memory addresses for the frames in which they check for inputs could be useful (aswell as further memory addresses for all kinds of other aspects)
	$LF
	"- maybe there'd be ways to climb up walls or keep the falling state or prevent falling to hover over gaps or to prevent death when running into an enemy, or maybe there'd be methods to interact with an item that is further away (above or right below Bugs Bunny for example) to collect them from different places
	$LF
	"- one can also play around with the timing of using bombs or arrows for influences on lag, or maybe it could be possible to kill multiple enemies with the same weapon/attack (and maybe even short detours in some stages might be worth it to kill another enemy early on to reduce the accumulated lag for the rest of a stage)
	$LF
