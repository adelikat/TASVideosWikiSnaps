	"This is my first TAS, and I’m very happy with how it turned out. I played this game over and over again when I was young, so finishing it in the fastest time possible is more of a personal goal for me. This is actually a very easy game for a first TAS, since the physics of the game are easy to figure out and the game itself isn’t very difficult. Though it’s received mixed reviews, I think it’s a decent platformer for the Game Boy Color.

	"In this game featuring the famous SpongeBob SquarePants, SpongeBob stumbles upon a legendary statue that opens the way to the Dutchman’s Underworld. SpongeBob must unlock the statue and defeat the Flying Dutchman to get the Golden Spatula and become the Master Fry Cook. The game has developed a sort of cult following, especially among younger ones. However, there is still very little on the Internet about the game (there were only walkthroughs and a debug code to help me out). All of the tricks and the glitch were found by me.

	"I started this in November a week after reading Groudon199’s 2006 suggestion of this game in the GB/GBC wishlist. Contrary to what he thought, none of the weapon upgrades need to be collected and the Undersea Desert boss doesn’t choose his attacks based on luck manipulation. Because I don’t need to do the "side quests" to get the weapon upgrades, I can blaze through this game going straight for the oven knobs in the 4 knob-areas.

	"I started this run two weeks before I finished and submitted it, but sometimes I got all the way to Dutch Under and then was able to save frames from the first levels or got desyncs early in the movie and had to start the run over (copying most of my input from what was left of the desynced/suboptimal movie). I once got most of the run finished and then realized I could have saved a frame in the menu at the beginning of the game by turning "Account for Lag" off. But I'm glad that it syncs now and that it is optimal.

	" Moving
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Jumping is almost always faster than walking. So I will mostly be jumping to move. Jumping the right distance is hard to do in real time because the jump mechanics of this game are terrible. I remember my fastest completion time a few years ago being about an hour because I kept jumping into enemies and pits. The bad controls may make the run even more entertaining for those who have played the game before.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The few times I walk in this run (unintentional joke) are when it saves time, like in caves with low ceilings. Jumping the highest saves more time, not only because SpongeBob can reach higher platforms but because it moves him farther horizontally than any other jump. After landing from a jump or fall, walking for 1 frame will allow a greater horizontal movement than jumping immediately after landing. SpongeBob squats before he jumps: for 10 frames in a normal jump, and for 17 frames in a spring jump. Holding the B button for any less amount of time will usually result in a lower jump. SpongeBob also seems to gain more horizontal distance if he starts his jump on an odd frame (I don't know why this is true, but this occurred in every area I tested it in).

	"In this game, SpongeBob's hit points are represented by layers of clothing. When he has his brown pants on, he has two hit points. If he takes damage, he will lose his pants and only have one hit point left. If he takes damage one more time, he will have nothing on and you will "die" and start the area over. There is no Game Over in this game; you can "die" over and over, but you'll keep restarting at the last checkpoint until you complete the area. There is also a "hall monitor uniform" which you can get to provide a third hit point, but it is too far out of the way to save any time.

	"However, I really wish there was a way to glitch through the ceiling in the second area of Kelpazoic Jungle, since the whole level is one big map. You can see the floor of the final area above the ceiling at about frame 12710 (or 3:35 in the encode). I don't think there's a way through, though; this seems to be a pretty solidly programmed game.
