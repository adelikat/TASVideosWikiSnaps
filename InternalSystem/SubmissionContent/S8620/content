It is a classic game that is addictive. Even though I remember this being available, I regret never experiencing this in my childhood.

	"I play this game on the hardest difficulty, which includes maxing out the running time and the speed of the snake. As you can imagine, this poses a major threat for a human. The length of the snake certainly will become a hazard, late in the game; however, more importantly...the speed of the snake is more of a concern, since the game runs too fast where turning on an exact frame is available on every frame your press a direction. So we are witnessing a situation, that requires extreme accuracy...which only a TAS can overcome.

	", we brainstormed and came up with some ideas. Still...nothing helped. Eventually, I had a thought...while laying down for bed. It was a radical idea that forced me to break my current thinking. Good thing that I studied it...as it worked. Not only did it work well, it exceeded my best efforts by more than double the points! The idea was to trap off 2 of the 3 walls so that you can concentrate your efforts in a smaller area where mice can be instantly available. Of course, this only started working after the snake got to a certain length. Now...here is the results of multiple run-throughs of this new strategy. Total time of making was about 4 weeks.
