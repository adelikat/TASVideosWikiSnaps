	"Yes i started doing Glitch Hunting 6 Months ago when I was messing around on Mortal Kombat Armageddon Konquest Mode. The Very First glitch i found was Weapon Cancel Glitch. ill explain that glitch in a bit. So anyways this TAS took me long to make, because my dolphin been having problems with disc and i found out that i can't have a Wii remote and GameCube controller connected so shout out to CasualPokePlayer for Helping me.

	". so Pause Cancel is when you Pause the Game to do a certain Movement very Fast like Taven Can Roll then you press pause and as you can see he goes back to his position very quickly so he get through tight angles best examples for this
	$LF
	"Botan Jungle. He Can also Cancel his attacks Like Punching, Kicking and also his Special Moves, the special moves that won't work is ground pound and TimeStop, and Teleport they can't cancel like the others.

The Main goal is to hit 82 seconds on every fight, i sometimes hit 83 seconds if im lucky. So When Taven fought Kobra as you can see he keep using Ground Pound Special Move so that way i can Manipulate the CPU to Jump so that way Taven Get Extra Cripsy Damage. you going to be seeing me abusing  Ground Pound in every fight just to defeat the enemy very fast. Now in Armageddon Konquest Mode there will be Training Session to get through but its not really Similar Deception Konquest Mode. But it does teach the basics of the game unlike Deception which teaches how to play other characters.

The Main Trick is when you go up to the weapon at certain timing you press the block button then grab the weapon and then you Roll and spam ground pound to cancel the animation of this is the most important part you must have no blue power in order for this glitch to work. i did tested all the Weapons in Konquest Mode that you can grab and some of them don't work and some of them not worth to weapon cancel. also fun fact if you try to way Weapon Cancel GLitch on TekuninWarship it's creates a SoftLock also the enemy's doesn't spawn so pretty much you are stuck.

Turns out that while the game mechanics are mostly unchanged, there are difference on technical level, most notably loading times being much faster and the ability to skip cutscenes for the PS2. But once we disregard those version differences, we can see that this submission is much faster regarding actual gameplay segments, despite using the hardest difficulty setting. Also, I could see there has been a good amount of research of game-specific mechanics in order to perform TAS-only strategies. Well done! Accepting.
