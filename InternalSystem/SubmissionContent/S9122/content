In fact, it is around 9 minutes faster than  the best speedrun that I could find. I realized, after comparing a number of levels, that this work is an excellent effort. At first, I was hoping to see more TAS only tricks, aside from the precision work being performed. Later on, I wasn't disappointed...I started seeing more skips and tricks that humans would probably consider too risky, and thus be a run-killer.
