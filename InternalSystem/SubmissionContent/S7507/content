	"Thunder Force II, also known as Thunder Force II MD in Japan, is a port of a Sharp X68000 game by Technosoft. This was released within the first year of the Japanese Mega Drive's life and was straight up a launch title for the US Sega Genesis lineup, both in 1989. Even though the port has cut levels, graphical downgrades, and various adjustments to weapons and levels, the game plays well with almost no lag. While half of Thunder Force II is a horizontal shmup a la Gradius, the other half is a top-down shooter where a map has to be navigated to find and destroy bases around the map a la Bosconian.

	"The game's story is about the ORN Empire attacking the Galaxy Federation with their new mothership, the Plealos (Preareos as seen in the epilogue). The mothership has destroyed the planet Reda and uses the planet Nepura (Nebula in the US manual). The Galaxy Federation sends the ship Fire LEO-02 Exceliza (Thunder Force II in the US manual, I guess since the first game never left Japan) to destroy Plealos.

	"Diagonal movement is slower horizontally/vertically compared to just moving in the cardinal directions when needing to head in a cardinal direction. However, this does make it possible for micro-adjustments in positioning. This is mostly relevant for playing around rather than speed. For speed, it's best to just take the most direct path, especially for top view stages.

	"Manually pressing the button rapidly is faster than the game's auto fire. The main problem is that sometimes button inputs have to be spaced out due to shot limits for every weapon. Auto fire runs into this problem less since shots are sent out in a spaced out way such that it's not a concern for real time play.

	"In most of the top view stages, the only important targets are destroyed by the bombs dropped when shooting and not the bullets from the ship's current weapons. This makes weapon choice mostly irrelevant for completing top view stages. Since the screen keeps scrolling upon death in the top view stages, this makes burning some lives to reach the goals faster. The major downside is losing all pickups and being set back to the default guns. Sorry to those who wanted to see a no miss run.
