	"If you run this on Ubuntu within VMware, the game will crash on the second level. This is because of the particle effects that rely on the GPU. You can use -no-gpu-effects to make the game run, but it will remove box breaking effects and air blasts. I like the effects, so I encoded this on my laptop which has linux natively (you can also have the effects in a KDE Neon virtual machine with no issue). Also, the game forces 1920x1080, so you'll need a monitor larger than that to encode it properly. And on top of that, the first few frames are at a different resolution than the rest, so you may have to start playback, progress a few frames, and then start the encode - otherwise the resulting video will be garbled.

When curled, Tril's movement is more physics based, as he is in a ball. When curled, he can roll left or right, jump, and slam.

	"You can only curl/uncurl once while airborne, and doing so instantly resets your up/down velocity, allowing you to stop if you're flying up or falling down really fast. If you slam, there's some bug that lets you uncurl and then immediately curl again, allowing you to regain momentum quickly. Slams also have a small cooldown based on when the button is pressed, not when the slam actually occurs.

Seems to be really rare; however, not rare enough that the concept of the game can't be analyzed against similar types of games. The actions in this game seem to be fair optimized. Some spots appear to be an issue, but after looking over and over...I finally caught on to some of the limitations. Things look pretty good. No obvious mistakes.
