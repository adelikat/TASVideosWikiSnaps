	"Aside from routing, death warps and frame perfect rope grabs are the most important ways to save time on this game. Also hit detection is only processed every other frame (alternating per player) so this is used to duck under certain enemies and quickly keep moving.

	"This is a several second improvement over my last WIP. Seeing as no improvements were forthcoming from anyone else, I decided to go back and give a final look at the second half of the game before submitting, as I don't like having unfinished projects. It's funny how many things you notice after a while of not looking at something.

	"Now for the judgement: I will accept this movie for the Vault tier. The game is OK, and the movie is well optimized, but the game doesn't give that much possibility in way of interesting movement or optimization. Getting the two player ending (since they are different) seems like the right choice for a game which is played as two players the whole way. Using Hard instead of Normal doesn't seem to make any difference in this case (after the update which loses fewer lives), but that's alright.
