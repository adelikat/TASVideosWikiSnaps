	"Hello, This is my third finished run of this game, this time it's a full run on the US version of the game, as I already completed a run with the last 3 dungeons, this time I will only explain some stuff missing from my other runs submissions which is the cape and a glitch I found with the floating platforms

	"The cape is an Item that makes your movement much faster when walking but has a defense of 0, it doesn't matter as I never take lethal damage unless planned, this item is acquired in the second dungeon and after that, my primary way of moving around is by walking

	"The floating platform glitch which I call the ultra jump is a glitch where you land on a floating platform (mostly found in the second dungeon) on its side, then you jump before the game attaches you to the center of the platform, conserving the momentum for air momentum making your jump super long, the farthest to the center the longer the jump, it can also make the jump shortest by jumping to the opposite way

	"One more thing to note is that this time the warp gates are bought at Arcs and not in the ice castle, I believe I bought one more that I needed adding about four seconds of the run but I realized it too late, I ended up using it, recovering some time in the process but it's still slower

	": I've spent enough time on this. There is really a lot to this game. When trying to compare it to actual speedruns, there is a considerable amount of differences that makes me wonder the category I'm comparing against. I roped

	" in for a conversation and then eventually our judges. After all the conversations, I can relate my confusion about this game to a new person trying to understand the tons of categories for Super Metroid. Heck, even on top of that...TASes vs Speedruns are even quite different, of the same category. Well, I have to say that this game looks really well done. Having no feedback to run on, I am also guessing that anything really bad would have been brought to light. Because I see that is is massively faster over many of the speedruns I've found...I think we are OK with this.
