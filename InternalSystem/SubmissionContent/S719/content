	"I completed this game without collecting any instroments! The only Item I collect is the L-1 sword. The method for beating this game seems to be well known, and am shocked that I don't see a time attack for it. Thanks to David Wonn for his well known glitches. ( http://kontek.net/davidwonn/ ). The only difference between what he features and what I did was that when warping to the level 8 in-game warp: You do not have to restart the game then, rather falling on the right hole will warp you straight to that warp! That saves a lot of time. This game was hard because luck manipulation was very random it seemed. I wasn't fighting the game to create just a good path, I was fighting the game to glitch right as well. When I am fighting the Aghanims it appears that I waste time by missing the first set of balls. You cannot hit him then, you are only fighting the "invisible" one (there are two). I don't see where this time could improve very much.

	"_EDIT:_ It looks as though I waste time by hammering on the buttons, mostly I did this so link wasn't just standing there.  After I pass through the nightmares layor the second time heading north, I have to wait for him to come into action or the game will make me fight him (which I cannot do with only a sword).  Second, when i am fighting the Aghanims:  I found that they didn't like to both shoot balls at the same time, rather one would shoot the exploding bomb type thing and the other would shoot a ball etc.  My movements and apparent lack of competence was the only way that I personally could make the balls shoot right.  On top of that, I then had to make the game glitch so that i was fighting the worms (so there is only one axe fighter and a floating axe.) Which proved fun.
