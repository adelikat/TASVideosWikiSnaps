	"After looking thoroughly at all the most promising hacks available for Battle City, I had to come to the conclusion that only Zeng Ge Hack and Binary City are the ones suitable for our standards. The issue is that most hacks are just re-skins or level mods, which wouldn't introduce much different gameplay compared to the published Battle City 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=movie|href=/2421M)
	", as everything would end up consisting in erasing enemy tanks all the time by manipulating repeated spawning of the handgrenade item. It also doesn't help that a massive level hack was commercialized as a bootlegged cart, namely Tank 1990, which means that it would be applicable for Vault and thus leaving even less room for considering the addition of downloadable-only level hacks.

	" other actual gameplay hacks made by another author, named TLT. However, with all the due respect to the efforts of that hack author, those consist of very plain game mechanics that don't make for high quality hacks, nor would they be able to be a good base for showcasing tool-assisted play. The fact that on Romhacking.net those hacks feature higher download counts than Zeng Ge Hack can't be considered indicative of a stronger following, also because those were released years before Zeng Ge Hack.
