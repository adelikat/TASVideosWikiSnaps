	"Somari is a Hong Kong pirate (unlicensed, not a hack) game that takes Mario and puts him in Sonic's world on the NES. It is an extremely difficult, glitchy, hard to control and colorful game. The levels and badniks are modeled after Sonic 1, with the addition of the spindash from Sonic 2. This game is not only difficult, it takes a special person to get through this game unassisted and not have ones ears and eyes bleeding. Try it yourself if you think you have what it takes.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The main goal of the run is to get through levels as fast as possible. I disregard the score tally screens, which unlike most Sonic runs, count rings separately from the time bonus. Some total frames can be saved by sacrificing level time to decrease score tally screen time.

[div class=p 
	"Speed in this game is basic integer speed. There are two speed values for Somari, which are an internal speed value and the screen speed value. Max normal speed is 5px/frame, although zipping is possible at 7px/frame. After passing certain internal speed threshholds, Somari's screen speed instantly increases or decreases to the next value, which is why at times Somari tends to have a large visible jump in speed. These threshhold points are abused heavily in the run.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"All jumps are of a fixed height (unless a ceiling is hit). Speed can't normally be gained in jumps. However, in some cases, touching ceilings, corners or collecting rings can cause the speed value to change (such as increase if you are holding a direction). This is abused heavily throughout the run.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Spindashing and rolling sucks in Somari, because it can't be interrupted. You can't jump or cancel out of it - you have to wait until you slow down to 0 speed (either naturally or hitting a wall) before you stop rolling. However, when coming out of a spindash or a roll, you can start walking and accelerating, even in air. Because of this, spindashes and rolls aren't used much in this run, but it is sometimes used when speed is very low and an enemy needs to be killed, and where taking damage takes more time than the acceleration gained by being able to walk in air.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Somari is limited to 1px/frame max speed in the water. However, acceleration and the internal speed works the same in the water as well as out of it. As soon as Somari leaves the water, he will transition to above water speeds depending on the internal speed (so, if internal speed is 246 and Somari is going 1px/frame underwater, if he jumps out he will go 5px/frame, since a speed of 246 is within the 5px/frame thresshold).

	"When running off a ledge, Somari will continue to accelerate.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Many things in the game are based on a 60 frame timer (and likely some other timers I haven't found), such as spikes, Orbinauts, and the delays in the arrival and leaving of the score tally and title cards. Enemies are usually based on Somari's position, but can also be affected by if they spawn on an even or odd frame, or position within this timer. Because of this, I delay about 120 frames at the end of Spring Yard Zone 3 to set up spikes and other objects to be optimal and end up with a net 230 savings in Labyrinth Zone 1.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The score tally screen gives points for rings and a time bonus. However, the time bonus isn't actually implemented so it always gives 5000 points. The ring bonus takes 4 frames per ring to count. Again, the goal of this run is fastest level time, not fastest overall movie input time, so I list a SCORE TALLY after each act and possibility of saving frames specifically on this screen.

He ran a lot of the levels first and then I'd come through and basically clean up. I don't think he really cared since the game got done and we both were able to see and find some neat glitches.
