	"The game has at least 3 versions: the original Japanese release (J), the North American release (U) and the European release (E).
	$LF
	"Besides the language localizations, there's a notable difference in gameplay which makes the original Japanese release unique: 
	$LF
	"It takes much less EXP to LEVEL UP in this version than in other versions. 
	$LF
	"In fact, it's the later releases that increased the EXP requirements for all levels by 20%, which makes usual gaming harder. (Yes, that is the tradition.)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"It's said there has been a Japanese re-release, but I didn't find much information about it and don't know if it changed anything.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"For this run, 
	$LF
	"the (U) version is chosen because the timing rule allows to ignore the disvantage of longer dialogues in the (U) version

	"The "new glitch" that doubles the power of the big-bones thrown by Skeleton was actually pretty old. 
	$LF
	"It works under the same mechanism as the famous 
	[em 
		""Mars + Black Dog"-4x-attack-power
	]em
	" boost. 
	$LF
	"Not only does the game wrongly compute the STR with the card combination currently selected (except for certain attacks), 
	$LF
	"but also does it determine the attribute of the attack with the current card combination. 
	$LF
	"That is to say, although the big-bones have a fixed STR as 3000, 
	$LF
	"its supposed DARK attribute could be turned off with a non-DARK card combination, 
	$LF
	"which avoids having the attack damage halved due to the enemies' DARK resistance.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"As a result, Nathan can deal "doubled big-bone damage" on DARK-resistant enemies like Dracula, 
	$LF

	$LF
	"The key to reduce them is to manipulate the Skeleton Bombers' action timers

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The first Skeleton Bomber always has enough time to attack as Nathan is too far away from it when entering this room. 
	$LF
	"The second and the third ones can be manipulated before they are activated. 
	$LF
	"It turns out that I need to manipulate the maximum value of the timers to avoid the attacks. 
	$LF
	"However for some reasons in the (U) version it doesn't reduce any more lagged frames 
	$LF
	"to avoid two both bombs than to avoid just one. So I revert to avoid just one and let the other the bloom.

	$LF

	"The "first round" has a fixed time for every kind of Dracula's attacks.

	"I manipulated him to do the meteos attack that takes the shortest time. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Since Dracula becomes invulberable when his HP drops below 1500, I only used the attribute glitch for the last hit this round. 
	$LF
	"As the minimum count of Dracula's ramming attacks is 2, but Skeleton unfortunately can't even evade the first ramming attack, 
	$LF
	"Nathan must dodge in the human form and re-activate the Skeleton morph later, 
	$LF
	"which means that the attribute glitch in this "first round" is cost-free.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"For the "second round", it's faster to abuse the attribute glitch for 1-hit-KO than to hit dracula's eyeball twice.
	$LF
	"The former is faster even at the cost of the extra menu operations because it finishes off Dracula directly in his "humanoid/demon form" instead of the "eyeball form",
