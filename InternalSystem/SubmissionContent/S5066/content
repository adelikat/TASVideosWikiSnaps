	"Dancing Pikachu has skills that no other Pokémon or deity has.
	$LF
	"He can run at incredible speeds with turbo A inputs (FORESHADOWING), can warp to the end of levels and levitate, spark everyone in his path, being the very best like no one ever was, color a dinosaur white, leak images for Pokémon Sun and Moon, kill freebooters like SoFlo Antonio and Webnations, make the dankest of pokememes, knows who are the really good Poketubers, throws pokeballs better than that other Pikachu, can make Ash Ketchum age, makes real rerecords unlike that guy MrWint, do ACE without ACE, makes ProtoMario feel inferior in comparison to Pikachu's Pokemon Theories, can cancel Pokémon Talk twice, among many MANY other impressive things that only this Pikachu can do.
	$LF
	"You should admire his dancing skills too, he's so good at it.
