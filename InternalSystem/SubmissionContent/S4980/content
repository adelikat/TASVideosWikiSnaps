	"There are 3 difficulty options in this game : Easy, Medium, Hard. In Easy mode, 5 levels of the game are skipped, so Any% = Any% Easy. Compared to Medium, Hard difficulty adds a few ennemies, but more important, it gives more life to bosses, and makes The Descent (autoscroller) longer. As a result, Hard difficulty makes down times of the run even more boring, and is not worth it compared to the few number of enemies added. On top of that, the game is only speedrunned in Easy and Medium (I'm a speedrunner myself), and the two already existing TASes of the game were done in Medium.

By everything, I mean : the star count, cutscene(s) with Papa Smurf, Password, Map overview. Fun fact : if you collect stars, then do a cutscene skip at the end of the level, the stars will be counted for the next level. For example, if I take stars in Black Forest, then do a cutscene skip after defeating the Smurfivore Plant, I will get a star count at the end of Lake 2.

At the 4th star, after the first hedgehog, jumping over the platform without touching it is frame perfect. To avoid falling into the 3rd hedgehog next to the platform, I do an air walk. You cannot do that otherwise. The spider part is very interesting. Because I don't want to wait for 1st spider cycle, I take a damage on it, while jumping so that I have a shorter recovery time. Between the two helmets, I do a very precise jump : a frame perfect 1 frame jump. This jump allows me not to get hit by the 3rd spider, but by the 4th one. You can see that after getting hit, I lose a bit of time hitting the bottom of the helmet. If I hadn't done that, I would've been able to go through the 6th spider without getting hit. However, I would've had to get hit by the 7th spider, which is too slow. Instead, I get hit by the 6th spider, where I manage to turn around, so that I get projected to the right, AND into the helmet hole, which is very precise.

Normally, you have to pass by the bottom of the map, then to come back to activate the detonator. It is possible to bounce on the 4th bird without landing on the upper platform. It saves a very few frames, but to do that you only have a tiny subpixel window. I got it the first time I did the level, but then I optimized the climbing at the start, which changed the subpixel value. I tried to manipulate it but couldn't reach the correct window. Instead of this jump, I'm using the property that getting hit while crawling doesn't push you. Only one frame of crawling is needed. I don't like the next part of the level because I feel like it would be possible to save some seconds, but this would require subpixel manipulation. What I do here, is that I don't take the star above water, I activate the detonator, then I use the rabbit to go to the upper platform. I could amost use the rabbit to take a damage that would push me on the platform it's jumping on, it's so close... Maybe it would work with subpixel manipulation, but it's so hard to manipulate. It is possible to take the star instead, then using the rabbit to get the damage boost, but it is not worth it. I cannot manipulate the rabbit cycle, because I have no waiting time.

If you are on the trunk while it's rotating, you fall and die. On top of that, there are enemies, and holes. Because the trunk turns by a quarter turn each time, the holes are either open or closed. On SNES, this level is deterministic. However, on Genesis, the time when the trunk does its first spin is random. I think there are 5 different possibilities. I'm not manipulating RNG here, because I have a pattern for which I don't need to stop running even once. Now the weird part. Sometimes there is a platform under a hole, see for example the star under the second hole. When you are in the hole, the trunk doesn't rotate anymore. I think this is the explanation why when you air walk above a hole, it delays the rotation of the trunk. I do that every time I can, as a result, the trunk doesn't move once in the second half of the level. This creates a sound bug near the end, when you hear the trunk moving but it doesn't actually move. I couldn't get the 2 frames save jump at the end of the level.
