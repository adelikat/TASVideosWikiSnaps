	"I really liked to work in this because this game has a lot variety compared with previous series. I had trouble with desyncs during the all run, it was around 7 to 9 desyncs on each fight. I looked to explore this game with my knowlege to respect of tricks and glitches during each fighting to offer a good run.. In this my run I also looked not stay tied in combos, instead, I was looking for action and constancy during the matches and  dedicated more combos versus CPU.
	$LF
	"I don't used Roll and StriderH. Roll hasn't many variety in your moves there's weak combos and your super combos are similar to the megaman one. Strider Hiryle has nice super and moves and your combos can reach infinite on the corner screen, however, the run there are matches enough, if i were add more a match could be boring watching it. In all the matches, I added some sort of glitch or trick so, if were more one I would have repeat tricks and to avoid repetition, I prefered finished all the sequence match on Chun li and Spiderman vs megaman/war machine.
	$LF
	"Note: I selected 2x spiderman and 3x venon, simply because this 2 fighters are really glitchy in this game,  both char you can to do the glitch called " webglitch" that it happens when you hit the your enemy with a some projectile like "web" and  before covered the opponent with this wed just hit in this moment, so you'll get add some move during this moment and the game will give different response.

	"Captain Command throw 100%
	$LF
	"I was looking in all the fighters a throw that could bring some 100%, similar to the zangief fatal throw on SF2WW game.
	$LF
	"Well I did a lot attempts and found the same behavior using the CC. The grab the enemy and is lethal.
	$LF
	"you need to throw you enemy with MK or HK, and using the frame advance do several times this sequence: back+lk,mk and back+hk . If you follow this sequence the captain command won't release your enemy

	"combo trick: limit the stage 
	$LF
	"This trick is used by the combomakers. you can freeze the stage for you have various points for add more combos only on a screen or part stage... this trick make you move to forward or back without the stage continue.
	$LF
	"It's very cheap do it. you need just block a super of the your enemy then add a combo on your enemy. If during the combo you travel by side to side, the stage won't give continuity.. so, you'll can add a lot combo. But if you stop of do the trick will be canceled and the stage will give continuity.

	"Rockman/megaman tricks..
	$LF
	"Normally you need let charging your buster about 35s to that when you release it the your opponent will take a damange about  24 hit combo (which more you charging the buster more hit the your enemy will take it).
	$LF
	"Wel, now if you have been defeated by the web glitch, the game will take it to a charging "infinite", thus allowing it  a 100% combo with mega buster.

	$LF
