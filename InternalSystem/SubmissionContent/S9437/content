	": So after discussion and review the current goal of "low%, warpless" was changed to "minimal".  "low%" is typically used to show completing as little of the game as possible, but here the game is warpless meaning ALL the levels are played which is contradictory.  This is a little different from just pacifist since no items are gotten.  This is closest to "low score", but here there is no waiting at the end to truly get the lowest score so a "lowest score, warpless" does not fit either.  However this does minimize interactions with as many in game objects as possible, and the branch was changed to "minimal".

It would not take that much to change it to either of those categories.  In light of that this is also not bad enough to reject, so this will go to Playground.
