	" While the difference in input file length between this TAS and my 2013 publication is 3:46.71, the actual gameplay improvement is significantly larger.  Due to differences between the PCSX and PSX-BizHawk cores, loading times are closer to the console (i.e. longer) on BizHawk.  This affects the timing on everything from loading screens between rooms, to how long cutscenes load, to how long it takes to call someone via CODEC. If this run had had loading times comparable to the previous run, it would have been under 1h25m.

On the first wave, Meryl will not shoot, no matter what you do (she's never even pointed a gun at somebody before and her first-ever kills are the three guards who spawn during the next cutscene).

A single burst of auto fire from Meryl's FAMAS assault rifle is enough to kill one guard on Extreme; however, that's not good enough for us, since we'll need her to double- or triple-kill as often as possible so the guards don't go towards our own kill count (for an optimal route, we want our kill count to be 18 by the time we get to Liquid Snake).  To get around this, I shoot the other guards just enough to leave them mortally wounded without actually killing them, then move around the map,

For some reason, by shooting Ocelot as soon as he yells "Draw!" it puts him into a state where he is only able to fire just to the left of you.  From there, as long as I keep firing at him as soon as his invincibility frames run out, he will keep trying and failing to shoot me until he runs out of bullets.

The first part of the boss fight won't trigger until Meryl reaches a certain step counter. I take Meryl on a specific path around the boss arena so that when her step counter ends, she'll end up in exactly the same spot where she normally has to run to start the next cutscene.  After that, a single stun grenade knocks her out once Mantis has fully taken her over, and then the fight properly begins.

	"Psycho Mantis has a rather unusual gimmick: he's a telepath, which means he can read minds - or in this case, your controller input.  In order to beat him, you need to use the second controller port, which he can't read.  That being said, if you're planning on beating this boss quickly, there's a lot more going on to this fight.

[div class=p 
	"Mantis randomly teleports between various spots in the arena.  Normally his hitbox disappears while teleporting, but it actually still exists for brief periods of time.  The game tries to make sure you don't hit him by accident by removing your ability to lock-on to him while he teleports, but if you run and gun, and know where he's going, you're able to hit him in transition.  After several rounds of teleportation, he switches to shielding himself with telekinetically controlled furniture and paintings, which will also hurt you if touched.

[div class=p 
	"Here's where things start to get a little complicated. Normally, Mantis does not take any damage from explosives such as grenades or C4, even if you're using controller 2.  However, the game represents this by having Mantis take the damage and then instantly regenerating it, so for a brief period of a few frames he's still hurt. After 19 shots from the pistol, Mantis is at low enough HP that a point-blank grenade will lower his health enough to trick the game into thinking that we're much further ahead in the fight than we are, and the game will skip ahead to the part where Mantis plays around with the possessed Meryl.

Human enemies do not have locational damage in this game, so there's no point in going for headshots, and my tool-assisted aiming can compensate for Snake's shaky aim which is normally compensated with Diazepam.  I luck manipulate her starting position by burning frames while out of bounds so that she starts out running to the right, allowing me to snipe her immediately as soon as I enter. Since I start with less sniper rifle ammo than I need, and grabbing more ammo along the way would be slower, I need to make a quick diversion to the top right corner to grab more.

By hiding around a corner and shooting Nikita missiles at him, I get him into a stunlocked phase where he will try to fire at Snake from behind cover constantly.  However, because he can't hit anything when he has invincibility frames, it allows me to get a Nikita missile right up close to him.
