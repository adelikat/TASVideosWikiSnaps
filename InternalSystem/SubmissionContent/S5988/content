		" If you don't have any scares when approaching the cave frogs in the sewer stage, the game will freely award you with an umbrella scare.

The flies have one movement component that is linked to the screen and then one component added on top that is random and only manipulable by throwing potions or delaying earlier screen transitions. Because of how the component linked to the screen counters any of Beetlejuice's movements (unless he's at the edge of the screen, where he can move while the screen doesn't), there is no point in trying to dodge the flies. If they have the wrong pattern, they will always hit Beetlejuice, no matter what. Got through unscathed though thanks to the manipulation in the auto-scroller before.

		" The mouse starts out in a room to the right. Every frame, it randomly moves horizontally or vertically (although it seems to have a bias for continuing in its current direction). In order to reach the left room, it needs to pass through a narrow corridor. The rather strict requirements consisting of mainly moving to the left and hitting the narrow corridor make this a very low probability event. The mouse doesn't respond to Beetlejuice's movements, so the only options for manipulating it was by throwing a potion or by delaying previous screen transitions. The end result was good, but not perfect. I had to stop the vertical movement for 2 frames.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" The last set of rooms demands a fairly long time spent with flies swirling around. Again, there is no way to move out of the way of the flies due to how their movement is built up. Unfortunately, it didn't line up completely this time and I had to use an additional manipulation for the flies. The only manipulation left was a delay. This was the reason for the 2 frames of delay right before exiting the mouse room.
