	"Yet another improvement, by 16 frames, still using the same strategy.  The time is now 00:30.03 (1802 frames) ... almost under 30 seconds, but unless I missed something unexpected, I don't think it's possible to do any better.

	"I spent the last 1-2 days figuring out the game's randomness completely (different variations and frame timings) by looking at the code and memory viewer, and made a program that simulates it. Then, given the initial random values, it tries all possible timings that lead to victory and only keeps the fastest one ... doing about 500000 re-records worth of work in 15 seconds.

	"The result was only 10 frames faster than on the last run, but it should be optimal. Then right when I was going to record this run to submit (after finding and testing the best combination), I found another way to manipulate the card order: when entering the player's name, both the amount of letters I enter and the time between each (including End) affect it. Trying different ones until I found a pattern in the results allowed to save 6 more frames.
