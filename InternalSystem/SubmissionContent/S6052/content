If the HI speed is set before resetting the console, the RNG won't be affected, and the TAS will resync, except for the necessity to change some inputs after triggering the Remove glitch, which doesn't affect completion time and it's trivial to fix. You can see the submitted movie resynced in HI speed

The ending cutscene for clearing Level 20 with HI speed could be considered as "best ending", however this doesn't mean much if the actual gameplay contents are completely redaundant; this movie can still obsolete a movie that starts from Level 20 HI speed.
