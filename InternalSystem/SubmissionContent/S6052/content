	": The author stated in the submission text that there is no time difference between MED and HI speed, and I comfirm it. If the HI speed is set before resetting the console, the RNG won't be affected, and the TAS will resync, except for the necessity to change some inputs after triggering the Remove glitch, which doesn't affect completion time and it's trivial to fix. You can see the submitted movie resynced in HI speed

		"here

	".

[p 
	"Since this movie doesn't feature any gameplay difference between using MED or HI speed, both are acceptable in this case. The difference in the ending cutscene is not a problem, since our 
	[a class=intlink href=/Guidelines.html#SelectYourDifficultyWell 
		"difficulty guidelines
	]a
	" are specifically referring to differences in gameplay. The ending cutscene for clearing Level 20 with HI speed could be considered as "best ending", however this doesn't mean much if the actual gameplay contents are completely redaundant; this movie can still obsolete a movie that starts from Level 20 HI speed.
