	"Touch Detective, also known as Mystery Detective in Europe, is a 2006 Nintendo DS adventure game developed by Beeworks and published in Japan and the US by Success and Atlus, respectively. The game follows detective Mackenzie as she works to solve 4 cases to join the Great Detective Society. The game is designed in the style of a Lucas Arts adventure game where there's no fail states. Along with tracking her investigations, Mackenzie keeps track of a Touch List of interesting things she touches over the course of the game.

	"The goal of this TAS is to complete all 4 Episodes of the game from a fresh save file. This means having to deal with minimizing the amount of entries in the Touch List as the optional ones are sometimes in the way of normal interaction. The total number of entries added to the Touch List in this TAS is 15 out of 50 entries.

	"While it's possible to use the face buttons and D-pad to move a cursor and select objects, it's much faster to simply tap the touch screen. If it's a movable area, Mackenzie will generally go towards where the stylus is tapped or held. For distinctively longer areas spanning more than the screen it's better to hold the stylus down in place as tapping multiple times can stop Mackenzie for a frame per tap.

[div class=p 
	"The interesting part is that the direct pathfinding check is slightly narrower than Mackenzie's movement hitbox. This means that the first check can be fulfilled without actually having a clear that. When that happens and Meckenzie runs into something that blocks the path, she will simply do her interaction from the spot she stopped at rather than the intended location. This can "warp" Mackenzie to screen transitions and allow her to grab some objects at longer than intended ranges.

In contrast, the text for giving the cake after knowing about the items to give has more text boxes to go through.

After reviewing this, it certainly beats all known records; however, the author did mention to me that the WR has a warp in it that has not been applied to this run. This makes this run even more impressive. Being roughly 10 minutes faster, I think it sets a very good base for any future submissions
