	"This is my first complete TAS (first TAS period, really). I drew inspiration to do this game from a rejected TAS of the same game which used a password to skip to the final level. As this is my first TAS, I expect there to be much optimization that would need to be done. The physics in this game are pretty bad, but the game itself isn't that bad. I'm proud of what I've done with this TAS, and hope to be able to do more in the future.

	": This game is absolutely terrible. I'm not sure how much of it is the fault of the game, but the run itself doesn't come across as being that great either on a technical level. The votes are positive, but comments on the run quality are scarce. I can't make much out of the audience response, so I'll disregard the votes. I'm accepting the run for the Vault. Neither the game nor the run seem to have what it takes to make a good Moon-tier TAS.
