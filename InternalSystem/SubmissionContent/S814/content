	"Earnest Evans is a game I owned on a console, but was never able to beat. It's a fairly hard game that's somehow related to El Viento which were both made by Wolfteam. 
	$LF
	"Earnest Evans is a Indiana Jones-esque treasure hunter who has to go through various levels and settings and battle hordes of monsters and bosses.

	"This game has many pros and cons. The graphics and monster designs are excellent, but some of the level designs are some of the laziest I've seen. Also, the gameplay is somewhat screwy due to conflicts with the ground. Earnest has to jump a lot in order to avoid losing his momentum.

	"Earnest uses a whip to attack enemies and for hooking onto things jutting out from the ceiling in order to swing from them. Other one-level weapons are rocks, a ball+chain, and a hammer.

	"Unfortunately, this game suffers from some lag. I did my best to minimize it, but the whip is a very weak weapon, so attempts to kill larger things to reduce lag only worsens the situation.

	"This game has A LOT of bosses. Some levels have one boss, some more than one, and some have none at all.
