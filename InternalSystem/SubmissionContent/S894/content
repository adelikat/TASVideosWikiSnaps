	"Fox was chosen because he has the fastest running speed out of the available characters on start up, and one of his moves is less dependent on frame usage than almost all other moves-- his down b ground cancel. This proved to be very useful as you'll see. It was for these two qualities I chose him, but there's too many character variables to know just yet who would be the best for TAS.

	"Started recording at 12pm, and finished at 7.5am. The game, I believe, looks very cool for TAS. This is probably the most painstaking ssb project I've undertaken since I forced myself to complete all character's very hard mode with 1 stock no continue, eh 6 years ago? How much of my life I've wasted on this game since it came out... it's depressing.
