	$LF
	"	A frame rule was discovered on this level that manipulated an enemy at frame 12522. The RNG at this point cause the character to shoot left, where it normally shoots right. Previous TAS (due to not grabbing "red potion" in mid-air), wasn't able to manipulate this.

	"	Found the right jumping pattern to land on the "Green fountains" to avoid being shifted up in the air longer.
	$LF
	"	At frame 35914, special positioning was discovered to be able to edge out a jump at the bottom. I was able to start my jump a number of frames later, which allowed for me to skip the "goo" with two jumps rather than 3...which was much slower.
	$LF
	"	The next step was to land on the edge (closest to the goo) so that I can avoid sliding down and also be able to jump after starting my dash. This allowed for me to clear the slippery goo going up...which causes Bonkers to slow down.

	"	Staring at frame 37934, a new approach to optimizing the jumping pattern was researched. I did this in order to figure out how to skip the piston, which was the issue in the previous TAS and for RTA runners.
	$LF
	"	By not jumping onto the characters, you can avoid the delay time in bouncing off them. This gave me enough time to squeeze by the piston at 38421. This made the biggest cut of the stage.
