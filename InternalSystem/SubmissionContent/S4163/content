	"Like all the other Mortal Kombat fighting games made, MK1 is about warriors fighting against one & another In order to win a tournament or to survive with power & fame. Scorpion is chosen due to his ability to teleport Punch behind them & stab them in the chest with his Spear to & defeat them at the fast pace.

	": I found the play in this run to be a bit more polished. However, this run is still filled with noticeable problems. As a TASer, one needs to look at the little things and see how they can optimize them. Take the 
	[em 
		"Come Here
	]em
	" move. When the enemy is closer, it completes faster, and when the enemy is farther away, it takes longer. When the enemy is close to the other end of the screen, Scorpion's screen wrap attack would be much quicker than this move, and better for 
	[em 
		"Finish Him
	]em
	". In other cases, there are still faster attacks like a jump kick pulled off while the enemy is still in the process of standing up. In general, moves need to be selected which minimize the time used by an attack and the distance the enemy is thrown to. Scorpion's screen wrap is good to close the distance after a strong attack, but was rarely used to do so.

	"Other issues are pointed out in the discussion thread as well. Some of these issues were also present in 
	(__wikiLink|/4157S|4157S)
	" and commented on there. It takes a while to really understand TASing technique in depth, so please try to incorporate the suggestions, and polish the play better. I would recommend trying to improve upon a game already commented upon, and once you've mastered what it takes, then to embark on other games.
