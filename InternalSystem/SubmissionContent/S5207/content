	"It's finally done! This was easily the hardest TAS I have worked on, and I am happy to finally have it on the workbench. Despite being only a small improvement in frame count over Phil's run, this TAS is completely different. I used a new experience route where I lost frames early on to gain enough experience for the powerful elbow attack to use earlier in level 4, saving enough frames overall to make it an improvement.

	"Overall I am very pleased with this run, despite being under 9 minutes long it challenged me every step of the way until everything came together at the very end. I think the strategy used here is optimal overall, although it can probably be done slightly better, if RNG and enemy behaviour is carefully reverse engineered and analyzed.
