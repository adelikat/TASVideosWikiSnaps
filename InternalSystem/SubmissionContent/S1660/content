	"Soon three more seconds, I don't know if this is good or bad results. So twice before completion, the first I used the S, but I found it's too weak, so I used the F, the advantages of the F is strength, but it also has shortcoming - its requency is too slow. I will try my best in the game on the details faster than the original, but it's micro, I can't strive for more time in the way. In the 2 Area, I spented less time to kill the tanks. Another, I can kill BOSS very fast, in the 7 Area, I changed the F to the S, because I can fell very fast in the channel, in the 8 Area, I changed my gun once again, because it can kill BOSS faster than the default gun.
