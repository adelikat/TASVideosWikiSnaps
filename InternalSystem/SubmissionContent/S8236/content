I'm glad that I walked away from this for a few days, because I came back an noticed that this TAS would be better off with completing it with "earlier ending inputs". This gives the viewer more to watch, and a higher TAS time.

Believe it or not, the response was different enough that I couldn't perform the same tactics across both regions. So...I took the best one out of the two versions, and this time it was PAL!
