	": This TAS makes no sense on many levels - first, it seems incomplete - you just stop after 4 levels. Secondly, your goals seem unclear. If it is max score, you don't kill many ghosts. If it is speed, than you kill too many. Thus, I'm rejecting it as suboptimal/incomplete.

	"All that said, this is a really bad game choice. I doubt anyone could make a TAS of this worth publication.
