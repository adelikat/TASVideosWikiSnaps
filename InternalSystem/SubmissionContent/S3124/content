	": In general, autoscrollers make for very boring TASes. There is very little that can be done to spice them up. While this game is not specifically an autoscroller, once the penguin hits top speed, their is little to differentiate it from a standard autoscroller. After considering the opinions posted in this thread and the previous one, even people who had played the game in the past, found this a poor game to TAS. The levels are repetitive, the action is questionable, and there is only a single boss, which is repeated twice. While the TAS was well done, the audience doesn't seem to see this as a publishable game.
