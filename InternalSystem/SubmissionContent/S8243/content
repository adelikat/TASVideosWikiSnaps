	"Several glitches are utilized to quickly complete Battle for Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob can glide faster than usual by letting go of the D-Pad, SpongeBob can go even faster if the glide is done off of a moving platform or after jumping off of Mystery after taking damage to activate an extremely fast glide. Mystery can also perform a double jump, allowing for backtracking and several sections to be skipped. if a double jump is done off of a robot, the boost from the robot will be stored allowing for an extremely high jump. By jumping off of mystery, the player can clip through thin ceilings, massively changing 2-5 (New Robotropolis). When riding mystery, SpongeBob can duplicate spatulas to skip 1 spatula in the level. If the spatula is on the ground a Dupe can easily be performed, if not SpongeBob must jump off mystery to duplicate the spatula.
