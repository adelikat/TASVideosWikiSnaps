But this any% submission not only is a Vault material, but it also shows that the "pacifist" version can't provide any unique content over it, only a bit more jumping.

	"So here I seem to introduce a precedent, when a movie with trade-offs hosted in Moons gets obsoleted by a Vault movie containing a pure time record. If I don't do it now, the next Cross Fire "pacifist" submission will be optimized tougher and look just as this one, so if we keep hosting 2 different branches, we would bump a dilemma: rejecting the new "pacifist" submission for being a bit less entertaining, or accepting it as a time improvement. Rejecting the more optimized movie isn't very productive, especially for a tier borderline material, and hosting 2 different goal movies that look just identical except for a few jumps isn't wise either.
