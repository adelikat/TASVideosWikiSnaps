[p 
	"This is an excellent game under NES platform regarding game screen and BGMs. Therefore, there are a lot of lag.
	$LF
	"The major characters of the game are two squirrels- Chip and Dale, whose models are different (different cloths). Given this, there is much less lag when Chip holds Dale than the other way, which is very special. 
	$LF
	"In Stage-Western World, when Chip is driving the tramcar, Dale needs to keep killing himself to reduce the lag.
	$LF
	"Therefore, we need to protect the squirrels during Stage1-6, in case we don’t have enough lives to suicide in Stage-Western World. 
	$LF
	"Besides, game has a lot lag regarding the details (e.g. the movement of main characters, sound effect of landing, sound effect when enemies appear, act). Therefore, players need to avoid such lag in the detailed operation.
