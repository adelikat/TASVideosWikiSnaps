	"This is a new hack so changes to the hack are possible. This submission is a TAS to complete the game as fast as possible. I have it labeled at 22-exit because I'm pretty sure that right after you get the cape in "Well Made Camera System", you can get the second cape in the level, die and possibly complete the secondary exit in "Angry Parachutes," saving 9 exits. However, due to the level not being frozen, even if this was possible, it might potentially activate a third exit, or not do anything at all. I haven't tested this yet however, and my next TAS of this will be the 100% TAS. So I'd label this as 22-exit (or RTA any%) for the time being. The link to the hack:

It is to note that this hack is pretty aware of some glitches so stuff such as walljumps are patched and L/R Scroll is disabled. Therefore some capeless skips aren't possible. There's alot of going back to get a cape as well.

Using the cape you (possibly) can go under the wall over the lava pit to get the secret exit.) I have to warn anyone that watches/plays this level that it may cause eye strain.

Some spots are insanely tight with piranha plants and Dino Rhinos, making this alot more precise. The second section is alot harder. However it's also the only actual level-based section that is possible to get P-Speed. Conserving it is insanely hard though because the Layer 2 is moving alot harder because they are skewers instead of just ground and walls, so you can't just hit the wall and turn around.
