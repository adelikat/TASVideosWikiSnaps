	"Points at the start can be allocated to multiple stats.  Attack, Special Attacks, "?" (which is really just the desperation move), Health, Defense, and Ochama (mischievousness).  Ochama is one of the stranger stats I have seen in a video game since it seems too increase the chance of having your moves fail or something and then your character does some sort of pose.  Not completely sure if there is anything else to that stat, but it did not seem useful for the tas, and there is not that much info on it either.  Anyway the useful stats for a tas are Attack and Special Attacks.  Allocating max 5 points for each increases their damage some in the match.

	"Damage depends on a couple things, but most importantly remember this: Try to hit the enemy in the face when they are doing something.  They is the best way to do more damage. For instance the Hard Punch version of Mercury Aqua Mirage (the whirlwind attack) has a base damage of 14, if you hit them in the face with it, it does 18.  Hit them while they are doing something it will do 21.  Hit them in the face while they are doing something the damage goes up to 24.  Adding the extra allocation points it can do 29.  Of course it does not quite work out to getting that everytime even in this tas, but that is the idea to defeating these opponents quickly.

	"RNG is really obnoxious as usual.  The enemies do not easily cooperate at the start of the match which tends to be the main issue.  The main way of changing behavior is to delay moves or doing different movements.  The enemies tend to be sticky in their moves and are quite resistent to changing. Very often there are 10 frames here and there that have to be delayed to change behavior.  In some spots waiting works too, but that is more rare. Usually the enemy already knows what it is going to do and does it anyway regardless of what you do.

	"The optimal moveset for the initial enemies is this: Enemy and Mercury walk towards eachother. Mercury uses Hard Kick close by then Mercury Aqua Mirage(Light Punch), and enemy walks forward and takes the hit.  Then the enemy walks forward while Mercury recovers.  Mercury recovers, then walks forward and uses the Hard Kick close to enemy then Mercury Aqua Mirage(Hard Punch) where the enemy walks forward and takes the hit.  If everything goes correctly the initial matches on Nakayoshi can end with the timer being 98.  However the game seems to really not like for some reason when the rounds end that fast since then the later enemies give horrid RNG.

Mercury uses Hard Kick close by then Mercury Aqua Mirage(Light Punch), and enemy walks forward and takes the hit.  Then the enemy walks forward while Mercury recovers.

[div class=p 
	"The later half have enemies with slightly more health so instead of walking forward a jump kick with Hard Kick is added in to take out the additional health.  Often though the first Mercury Aqua Mirage is changed to a Hard Punch version since the enemy will not cooperate.  The hard punch version covers slightly more distance, but has a slightly longer recovery time.  97 on the timer is the best I have seen with the later half of the roster with their extra health.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"So basically this game is an RNG fest if you are trying to have each round be optimal even when it only takes a couple moves to beat each round.  The enemies have a lot of available options that they can do that need to be often finagled. They can move right which is a no go.  They can jump which is another action that needs to be removed.  Mercury's Hard Kick needs to be close to have both hits get in so if they try to counter the move needs to be very short or slow.  They can block which is another thing that is not good at all (only the last half of enemies on Nakayoshi tend do this).  If the enemies stay still that may be good enough, but there is some slight time loss.  
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Realistically a good match is around the 97 timer.  If a lot of bad enemy choices happen an 96 on the timer can happen due to trying to stop or get around them.  If someone really figures out how the RNG works then in the future maybe everything can be optimal.

Had a couple faster fights with Venus, but the second fight of Moon went badly on the two times this happened. So probably 20 frames or so lost on Venus potentially if rng had worked.

The Mercury Aqua Mirage move is only good if you can get in close since the special move upwards, otherwise the Bubble Spray is a better option.  Chibimoon also has a special that makes her get off the ground and that means that hitting her while she is in the air would cause lots of time loss if she gets hit upward. Chibimoon also likes making use of her double jump, and we do not want the enemies to jump at all.

	": In this game you fight  a series of schoolgirls to get a chance to kick Uranus. The author chooses the easiest difficulty which allows him to allocate more skill points and makes the enemies more passive. This choice does arguably reduce the time required to reach the ending. However easier difficulties are typically not the best choice in fighting games, and this is no exception. A bit of a fight-back or skillful evasion might have helped.
