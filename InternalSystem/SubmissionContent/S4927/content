	"We improve the published run by 2668 frames (44.5 seconds), notably by incorporating GlitchMan's offscreen wand grab and using a cloud to skip World 7's 2nd fortress instead of 7-4 (where a new strat is used to shorten the level). Significant differences in power-up usage and in-level optimizations make up the rest of the savings.  There are 27 extra lag frames due to speed/entertainment trade-offs in Worlds 6 and 8.

[p 
	"These strats freed up P-wings for use in other levels, saving time not having to wait for a platform (6-F1) and not having to serially regain P-speed (6-F2, 7-4). That said, SMB3 is a fairly horizontal game, and using a P-wing takes time both to equip it and to recover fire afterwards, so P-wings aren't a huge TAS time saver.

	"Unlike prior runs, here the Hammer brother is manipulated to stay over by the castle. This delays killing it, but it takes the same number of total steps, and fighting it at this map location makes a Flower available. Grabbing the Flower just as the scene ends lets us get the power-up saving 30 frames of animation delay vs getting Flower from the Airship.

	"The technique to run the Hammer brothers into each other off-screen allowing collection of the Hammer item has been known for a while. A lot of luck manipulation is required to make it work, however, and the savings up to this point resulted in terrible RNG to pull this trick off, no matter which crazy Hammer paths we tried to manipulate. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The nearly 3 second delay needed to manipulate the Hammers made a rather unexpected strat profitable. Instead of using a P-wing for the shortcut in 2-Fortress, as originally planned, we get a leaf in 2-2, ordinarily completed as Fire Mario. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Having the leaf makes a running/jumping level like 2-2 very complex and much slower as Mario rapidly loses speed when jumping/flying. Not using a P-wing also makes 2-Fortress slower because P-speed must be gained and repeatedly regained. With a lot of optimization, we were just able to get the leaf in 2-2, keep the P-wing, and still make the RNG work. Therefore, the completion time for World 2 is the same, but we still have a P-wing to use later.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Instead of taking damage on the boss in 2-Fortress, we keep the leaf for the tricky pyramid level, where we use careful P-speed management and the tail-flip attack to save about 1 second.

	"Another world that requires a complex Hammer brother path - here to avoid the need to fight both Hammer brothers to be able to get across the retractable bridges. This time the RNG luck was reasonable, and in an improvement vs the published run, the extra Hammer ends up trapped where it can't move (Hammers won't move over completed levels or the Spade game), saving the time it would normally spend walking twice (and the need to manipulate it).

	"Efficient manipulation and killing of Lakitu as well as speed-preservation by ducking off a ledge into water allow us to keep the Fire Flower for 4-4 instead of using a P-wing. This saves time in 4-6 and 4-Fortress2 (not having to get a new Flower).

[p 
	"A strat demonstrated by GlitchMan is used to keep fire in 5-1. This loses about 3 seconds initially, but about 5 seconds are recovered having fire for upcoming levels, especially the Fortress boss and not requiring a Star for 5-7. The prior run didn't get fire back until 5-7.

[p 
	"About half a second is saved using a P-wing on 6-Fortress1 as Mario can fly up to the spikes without waiting for the platform. The star grab was also improved by a few frames.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"World 6-5 is an underground level where Mario must get the leaf and fly up a narrow shaft to the exit pipe. Completing 6-5 was a natural choice in the published run because, while we'd found an above-ground skip for 6-6, it was pretty time-consuming and we'd lose additional time getting a leaf in 6-Fortress2. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The combination of GlitchMan's faster strat for 6-6 and the availability of an extra P-wing made doing 6-6 faster by about a second. Using the P-wing on 6-Fortress2 and clipping into the ceiling during flight also completes the level about 1/2 second faster than the published run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Keeping the leaf after the 6-Fortress2 boss fight saves about 1/4 second by taking damage to achieve faster P-speed and less lag in 6-8.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The end of World 6 brings perhaps one of the most unexpected strats we found. Both the published run and the submission complete 6-8 as big mario, with no fire, and must complete either 6-9 or 6-10 to get to the Airship. There's an easy wall-jump shortcut to skip most of 6-9, making it the obvious choice. Unfortunately, the World 6 Airship has a leaf rather than a flower for its power-up, so the published run lost time stomping the Fortress3 and Airship bosses, but gained some back by flying up to the wand.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Thanks to the wall-jump wand grab, though, the wand grab is no longer faster with the leaf, and both boss fights are MUCH faster with fire. This fact, along with some minor savings having fire in 7-2, made it faster to complete the much-long 6-10, which has a Fire Flower. Overall savings are about 1/2 second.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"While we were going nuts trying to save frames, we decided to waste some...the consecutive rows of white blocks are a fantastic place to show off the "buzz-saw" technique of grabbing and throwing rows of white blocks without losing speed. We took steps to minimize the extra lag, but it still clocked in at 25 frames. As it's a very dramatic TAS-only technique, we decided to take the speed/entertainment trade-off.

	"As mentioned, 7-2 is faster with fire. As in the 100% we perform the new 7-4 skip using a P-wing (it can also be done with a leaf but is about 3 seconds slower as you need to get P-speed twice).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"7-Fortress1 uses the most technically difficult strat in this TAS. The default strats for this level would be to use a P-wing or a leaf, delaying getting P-speed until entering the first door. Of the two, it's faster to use the P-wing, which would then be unavailable for 6-Fortress2. We realized we could be keep the P-wing for 6-Fortress2 and be faster overall if we could get P-speed before jumping to the door in 7-Fortress1.
