	"Jet Pilot Rising is a homebrew game made by d4s and released in February 2018. In this Flappy-Bird-esque game, you play as a cat holding on to a rocket, flying through areas of tight gaps and incredibly designed and animated enemies.

		"All buttons move the rocket up, and no inputs makes it drop down, so the game requires you constantly tapping if you want to stay consistent. I was able to figure out that pressing the button for two frames and nothing for four frames, repeating that sequence, keeps the rocket level. Therefore, maintaining this going constantly directly to the right is the fastest. However, moving slightly diagonally upwards or downwards loses no or infinitesimally small speed. Moving any more than that up or down will slow you down, so this isn't just a free game to TAS, there is some skill required to perfect it.

		"In the final of the four levels, the walls close in, making it hard to stay in a straight line. I hug the walls as much as possible without touching them to stay as straight as possible

		"The hitboxes in this game are extremely kind. Many enemies are almost hard to die from when you have the accuracy of a TAS, instead of weaving all over the place like a normal person. The most kind by far is the block enemies that fall on you. I phase through most of them.

		"You may notice that there are many coins scattered around the levels. As far as I can tell, they just give you extra lives and thus are not needed to beat the game.

		"Also, in the final level a giant cat spits fireballs at me about half of the level. If you stay in a straight line, the cat will always fire beneath you, so it's not a big issue.

	[li 
		"At the end, I fly up almost top the ceiling so that when the rocket tilts back down, I baaaaaarely fly into the end and beat the game. I almost submitted it without this, but it saves about half a second so thank goodness I didn't

	": Run looks good to me, with nothing glaring out that needs attention. I took it bit further and wanted to find out the strength of this TAS against RTA efforts. Found the best version I could find, and it appears that this TAS beats it by about 40 seconds. Good job.
