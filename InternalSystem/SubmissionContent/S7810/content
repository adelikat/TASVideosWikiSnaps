		" MORE EFFICIENT MINI-SUB PICKUP: There are four possible locations for the mini-sub. If you grab it during the port-to-port power up, the best spot is in the South-West as it uses the fewest tiles to reach and then return to your port-to port path. But I figured out a way to manipulate Jaws so that he follows you to the South-East spot after getting Power 3. This ends up being faster since you don't have to double back to the path.

	": When considering a new branch for the Alternative class, the most important thing is having something different than the existing branches, and I think that this is the case. Basically what lacks in the fastest-completion branch is the bonus scene and the mini-sub, whose are apparently unavoidable in a deathless run. This also ends up bringing a different routing and optimization challenge for a TASer. Additionally, this is also
