	"One of the absolute worst licensed stinkers released for the 5th generation. A truly terrible shooter. Trying to play RTA is a nightmare, as your character's arms when aiming lags behinds the crosshair by 3-10 frames, leading to bullets flying all over the place. The AI is legendarily bad, spawning, running forward while shooting, then standing still without doing anything as soon as you walk past them. Levels take less than 2 minutes to complete even if playing RTA. This garbage sold for $60.

	"This TAS aims to beat the game as fast as possible on Hard difficulty. All levels are completed, without going for the 4 'evidence' bonus collectibles in each level. They give nothing but extra character mugshots and shooting range minigames and would have taken a few extra seconds per level to go out of the way to collect. Many sections of the game are essentially mini autoscrollers, waiting for particularly flagged enemies to spawn in and be killed/you needing to walk past a certain point for a door to open or your partner to move forward.

	": Yeah, this is one of those mythical "so bad it's good" games. For a casual gamer, this might be a lousy experience, but this movie thunders through the absurd at a lightining pace and the amount of one-liners and witty puns thrown in the middle of death and violence makes it all the more entertaining.
