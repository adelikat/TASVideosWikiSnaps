	" wasn't my final attempt on Choujin Sentai. Yeah, it's ridiculous, but I made another improvement for my first TAS. But I have an excuse. Just listen to

	"When I was mindlessly playing ChoujinSentai (maybe for 100th time or so) I figured little trick about sticking to ceiling while holding A button. That's why I rewrote 2 levels and saved 1.5 seconds, but before submitting new FCM I tried to revise every action - to ensure 1-frame-perfectness of the movie.

	"For example, I decided to change first level into pacifist mode (+ playing with death), choosing red ranger - saved 17 frames on select screen. Even if you prefer action, 1st level should be interesting (and short) to watch. At 2nd level I show interesting feature that can be considered as a bug - when you precisely jump under a platform you are able to continue rising even after character bumps into ceiling. It looks and feels like double-jump, but can't be abused.

	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/nesrocks

	" for last level's vertical shaft tactic. At first I was sure that it's impossible to use gravity there (there's not much room for jumping), but when I changed whole level strategy I managed to perform a jump down the shaft, which saved 5 frames.

[div class=p 
	"2 boss battles were changed to look better (and faster by several frames), but other seem to be frame-perfect. Also, last battle was rewritten for another creative way of time-saving. In last battle player can stop recording with the last hit being initiated, so it's better to save energy shot for last action, cause it makes more damage than normal punch (but also takes more time to release). That's why movie stops when boss is still alive, but previous input guarantees that battle will be won.
