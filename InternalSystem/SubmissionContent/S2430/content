	"In this special episode of Looney Tunes, Bugs, Daffy, Tweety, Porky, Taz, Speedy Gonzales, and the Road Runner decide to rip off popular games such as Atomic Runner, Sonic the Hedgehog & Gradius. They do this by going through this Sunsoft classic as fast as possible so that they don't die from all of the ripoffs. This has lead to some.. strange results.

	"This is a 10.44 Second (626 frame) improvement over Pekopon's run due to some new tricks & shortcuts I used as well as some lag reduction.

[p 
	"It starts out all normal in the first room. After that, it is all gains from here. The biggest gain is from a new shortcut I found. It turns out, the game has no top boundaries in these stages, Tweety's stage, the Road Runner's stage, & Taz's "bonus stage". So because of this, I just hop over the boxes of TNT that I would normally have to break on Room #7.

	" stage can go die in a hole. And then get decomposed by a fungus. But seriously, I hate this stage. This is one of the most annoying levels to find improvements on. So much that I only saved an epic 2 frames on this level.

	": Good improvement with the time, but I wasn't too fond of some of the entertainment choices, particularly with the Porky airplane stage and the Taz stage. However, that didn't seem to bother people, so I'm accepting this. I also took a look at the GBC port of this game, and it actually looks very nice, so I would recommend that any future versions of this game be done with that ROM.
