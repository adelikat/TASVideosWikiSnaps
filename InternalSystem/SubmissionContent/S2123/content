There were seconds, minutes that I could have saved if only I had looked a little closer at my surroundings.  My quest for fame and glory was ruined because of my mistakes.  Even with this,” he muttered, more to himself than Farah, staring at the still-bloody Dagger at his side.

He found himself standing in a familiar room: a chamber, empty of life, containing a rope, a pillar and a horizontal pole.

[div class=p 
	"In January of 2008, after my first run was published, I already had ideas brewing about a version 2, with my goal being under 42 minutes.  I knew that sections of the first half of the run were unoptimized because of new movement techniques I had discovered late in the development of v1.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"However, one major event served as the primary motivation for me to start working again: the ass-kicking my first run received in the post-publication ratings.  Seeing all of these low ratings (entertainment-quality) – 7-5, 5-7, 6-7, 5-6 – from some of the top runners on the site made me realize that I needed to push this game further and entertain the elite at the same time if I was to make a name for myself in the world of tool-assisted speedrunning.  (If it turns out later that these are average or above-average scores for a first-time TAS then I apologize; I needed all the motivation I could get, even if it happened to be false).

	" over at GameFAQs), saving about 10 seconds alone.  I reasoned that with this glitch, along with abusing a similar glitch in S4R5 and optimizing the first 10 minutes of the old run (which even I admit was sloppy and rushed), I could get the run under forty minutes, which I found to be no problem in subsequent route testing.  I found more glitches along the way, of course.  I started recording version 2 on and off, starting on January 22nd.

I felt that I was being mean by depriving everyone of a WIP on IRC, so I decided to break my previous silence on technique and show a sneak preview work-in-progress, which ended just before the fourth boss.  Then Comicalflop started frame hunting and asking questions about dodgy movement present in my old run.  I protested, explaining away my movement choices and airhopping skills.  That was when The Flop took matters into his own hands.  It went something like this.

If the Prince jumps and hits his head underneath a platform (it must have collision detection on the bottom) or the underside of a wall, the game will reset the Prince’s movement status to “walking” for 2 frames.  Jumping on either of those two frames will cause him to hit the wall again and repeat the process, moving forward slightly.  This allows the player to skip small sections of the game by jumping

However, despite being an invaluable trick, airhopping is slightly slower than running because of the constant jumping, so the amount of airhopping that I use in this run is minimized to make the Prince go faster.

Normally, when you hit vA on such platforms, the Prince drops through the floor, and when you hit v>A, he jumps forward.  The key is to trick the game into thinking the Prince is on a different kind of platform.  This is done by holding vA for two frames before landing, tricking the game into landing normally, then holding v>A for the remainder of the roll.

The death cancel I mentioned in the tricks section is used to avoid a few jumping puzzles, abusing the highly convenient flame jets so Farah can take damage and cancel the fall.  Unlike the Prince, Farah can basically cancel death anywhere because her fall only takes away your control of Farah and doesn’t render her dead until you hit the ground.  Therefore, I’m able to abuse this bug on two different occasions to cheat death.
