Using the No Despawn glitch, I collide with a fish for 22 minutes until I reach the maximum score of 999999.  Credit goes to

	"Normally, when you collide with a fish or enemy sub, the enemy despawns immediately, and seaQuest (your sub) despawns 35 frames later.  However, by colliding with an enemy in a special way, you are able to prevent the enemy from despawning, which keeps the seaQuest's despawn timer from completing.  In this case, you get 20 points for every frame you are in contact with the enemy.

	"Using this method, it takes 22 minutes and 53 seconds to reach the maximum score of 999999.  At this point, the enemy swims away (without ever despawning), and the kill screen is shown.  In the kill screen, the "Activision" text at the bottom is replaced with "Copyright 1983", though you never actually die.  This is the same behavior as when you reach 999999 by means of normal gameplay.

	"In order for the glitch to work, the seaQuest's X position must be 8 greater than the fish's X position.  Because the fish does not even appear on the screen until frame 278, the TAS contains playaround gameplay until the fish is ready.  The seaQuest's maximum X position is 134, and the fish in question enters from the right (higher X) side of the screen, so the earliest we can trigger the glitch is when the fish's X = 126.

	"For this first fish, you must collide with the right (back) side of it to trigger the glitch.  This collision would normally involve the hull of the seaQuest, but if you clip the top right corner of the fish's collision mask, you can collide using the seaQuest's rudder so that you are still facing right.  This saves 1 frame.
