	$LF
	"A very evil platform game with some nice graphics and decent (but quickly repetitive) music. It's evil for two reasons. The levels are extremely difficult, and Pugsley is very fast and his shoes appear to be covered with grease. When playing normally, you would almost never press the dash button, because if you do, you go even faster! In this run, the dash button is held down almost the entire time.
