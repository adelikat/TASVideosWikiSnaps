	"Using frame advance and minimal speeds, i try to stick as close to bosses as possible to make use of the bombing attacks to maximize damage output.

	"Lightning bombs were utilized in a way to destroy any target worth any point value and to damage the final boss a bit faster, some targets can't be destroyed by normal means, power-ups also award points.

[div class=p 
	"Points aren't awarded for individual boss targets, however enemy spawns are farmed without affecting overall time, so i concentrated for the majority on weak spots as soon as possible, ignoring targets with no value.

	"Stage 2 was a nightmare to get right, getting all of the rocks was very hard to pull off. The boss is also peculiar in the sense that his hitbox changes, normal bombs have no effect until he decends to the bottom of the screen.

	"Stage 1 and 7a's train boss has a similar issue, when the main gun is destroyed, the object remains there until the cannon that pops off gets to the bottom of the screen, this is why i go upwards and then forwards straights after destroying the gun.

	"Something also notable for TASing this title is the issue of lag the game experiences, after killing bosses, stop firing, it reduces the frame lag considerably

	": Nice game, and good approach, but since it's an autoscroller game, the main thing to do is optimizing everything that's not hardcoded: menu navigation, destroying enemies that prevent your progression as fast as possible, item management. Ending input ASAP is also necessary.
