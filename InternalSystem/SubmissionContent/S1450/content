	[li 
		" When I'm falling, L+R also prevents the game from checking if I should die when I get hit.  That lets me survive a few lethal hits, and keeps me alive with 0 hearts filled.

	[li 
		" I discovered (but did not use) a glitch that downgraded my boots (from green to purple) when I purchased the legendary (light blue) boots.  If it's possible to do that the first time I buy boots, and downgrading from no boots wraps you around to the best boots (pure speculation), you could knock a minute or two more off, and possibly not need a shield.

	[li 
		" In round 3 a monster drops a shield upgrade.  That alone magically grants me a shield, even though I don't pick up the upgrade :) .
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Some monsters and projectiles have hit boxes that are annoyingly large.  (You can get hit even if you are 5 pixels away from touching.)  Because of that it's pretty difficult to run through the game without getting hit.  Since I don't upgrade my armor, eventually that made it impossible for me to damage boost off (or through) monsters lest they kill me instantly :) .

	]li
	[li 
		" The gauntlets I frequently pick up double my attack power for a limited number of hits.  Most boss battles are fought with gauntlets.

		" The occasional waggling or odd behavior when monsters die is so I can manipulate a glove drop or increase the value of the money they drop.
