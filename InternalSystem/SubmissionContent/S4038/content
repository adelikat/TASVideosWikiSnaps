	"I did not optimize everything as much as I should have. But thanks to aleckermit, he and I tackled this game and pushed it to it's limits. 
	$LF
	"The goal of this TAS is to get through the game as fast as possible. Thanks to the new clipping technique, we were able to shed off a lot of time from the old run.
	$LF

	"I would also like to give a lot of credit to TheVeman3000 and Lo1ts for finding out about the clipping tricks that made the run even better.

	"aleckermit did Enemies Vanquished, Island Infiltration, and Equinox. I did the rest of the levels.

	"As a side note, loading times in between levels are faster on the emulator than the actual GC console.
