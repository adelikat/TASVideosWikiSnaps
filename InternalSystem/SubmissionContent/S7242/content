	"Undertale is a 2D role-playing video game created by indie developer Toby Fox. Undertale has three main endings: Neutral, True Pacifist, and Genocide. This TAS achieves the Genocide ending, which can be considered the "bad ending" to the game. In this ending, the player must complete the kill requirements in each area and then kill each area's boss. The TAS is optimized for Z/Enter presses and then time.

	"The idea behind the Z Button Challenge may be familiar to many due to Super Mario 64's infamous "A Button Challenge". These kinds of challenges simply involve completing the game while avoiding using a certain controller element as much as possible. In the case of this TAS, said controller element is the Z/Enter buttons. These 2 buttons have the same function, which is moving forwards in menus and advancing textboxes. Because the 2 buttons do the same thing, they will henceforth be referred to as just the Z button or Z press. The Z button is the most important button in the game, along with the arrow keys.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"First, it's important to accurately define a Z press and the concept of half Z presses. A Z press has three parts to it: when Z is pressed, when Z is held, and when Z is released, and together, this forms one complete Z press. Usually, it's the pressing that's useful, because that's the only part that advances textboxes and menus. However, sometimes it's sufficient to just use the holding part (the "half Z press"), which allows us to close the "You Won" or "But nobody came" text at the end of battles. Now if we map out the required Z presses to kill a one-hit enemy, it would look like this: We need to press Z to advance to the monster select menu, we need to press Z again to start the attack, we need to press Z again to attack, and we merely need to hold Z to close the "You Won" text. So, how many Z presses is that total? The naïve answer would be four, three to kill the enemy and one to close the "You Won" text. However, we can do better. We can actually do it in three by simply holding out the third Z press to be used for the half Z press, because the half Z press only requires Z to be held, not actually pressed. In this fashion, closing the "You Won" text doesn't add any additional Z presses to the run, since the final Z press just leeches off of a previous Z press. So in conclusion, since that last Z press counts in some contexts but adds no additional Z presses in other contexts, we refer to it as a half Z press.

	"This TAS features complex and unintuitive routing, and heavy usage of RNG manipulation and complex glitches. The run involves following the Genocide Route normally in Ruins, followed by doing a complex series of glitches to obtain the Punch Card, an extremely glitchy item which is normally unobtainable in Genocide. Afterwards we complete the Genocide requirements in Snowdin, Waterfall, and Hotland/Core, the latter of which has some more amusing routing involving a detour to New Home. Finally, the Sans battle (a major source of Z presses) can be completely skipped with the Punch Card Exploit (explained below, this is the main reason we obtain the Punch Card earlier) and the run can be completed, with the Fallen Human destroying the world. This TAS is special because it's the first real use of Genocide Punch Card (GPC), the latest major glitch discovery in Undertale speedrunning as of the time of writing. For a TAS optimized for time, GPC is currently not worth it, mainly because it's 1.0-exclusive and thus can't take advantage of the shorter Japanese text in newer versions of the game.

This can be useful in certain circumstances such as when you are moving left or right but need to be facing up or down.

The reason this glitch happens is because there is one frame between using the punch card from the item menu and the punch card opening where the player has full control, and it is during this one frame that the cutscene trigger is activated. Because most cutscenes only lock movement at the very start of the cutscene, the punch card's own ability to unlock movement after being closed is enough to skip the entire cutscene.

When the player touches a room transition, the variable global.interact is normally set to 3. Then once the player reaches the next room, the game checks if global.interact is set to 3 and if it is, the game runs the code that places the player at the appropriate door marker. However, if global.interact is not 3, the player is not moved from the default location in the room. This default location is manually assigned per room by the game developer and is often closer to the middle of the room than the door marker is. There are several methods of triggering a wrong warp, all of which achieve the same result: setting global.interact to 0 (the value for full player control) while transitioning to the next room.

Certain text boxes, such as dropping an item, use a variable called global.msc. When a textbox is created, the object creating the textbox assigns a value to global.msc, which is then used to lookup which set of text to display. By creating such a textbox between the cutscene's sets of textboxes, global.msc is changed to something unexpected, and so the following sets of textboxes will display the textbox that corresponds to the current global.msc value instead of the cutscene text that is meant to play.

Choicers are types of textboxes that give the player a choice between two different options. These choicers also use the variable global.msc. If the set of text that is playing includes a choicer, global.msc is incremented by 1, which normally contains the post-choicer text, if any, as well as potentially other code that accompanies the selected choice. If another choicer is then activated, the value global.msc is incremented a second time and the corresponding set of text is displayed.

]h4
[div class=p 
	"Undertale's RNG is determined by a seed that advances each time RNG is called. By calling RNG a different number of times, different outcomes can be achieved. Text calls RNG twice per character per frame and so changing how many frames text is displayed is the most common method of RNG manipulation. RNG is manipulated for various reasons such as getting particular monsters in random encounters and determining which step count random encounters will occur on. One thing to note is that the function randomize() is called upon loading into the game and this function sets the RNG seed based on the system time. However, after this initial seed, RNG is no longer affected by system time until the save file is reloaded or the game is restarted. RNG manipulation is used throughout the run and for the most part this is accomplished by delaying clearing text by anywhere between 1 and about 25 frames. Usually, the unlikelier an event is, the more frames it costs to manipulate RNG. While this does lose a small amount of time each time it's done, the various timesaves afforded by manipulating RNG more than make up for the few frames lost in the process.

We also do some RNG manipulation in the name selection screen to get a certain "fun value". This value is randomly assigned at the start of every run, and determines what special events can occur during the run, such as special phone calls, NPCs, or other secrets. We want a fun value in the range 40-45, as this corresponds to the phone call from Sans in Snowdin asking if your refrigerator is running.

A few rooms later, the first glitch in the run is performed. By interacting with the sign next to the door and entering the door at the same time, global.interact is set to 3 by the door, then to 1 by the sign, causing a wrongwarp. Doing so allows hitting the second switch without hitting the first switch, saving a Z press. Additionally, doing the room in the wrong order this way messes with the cutscene since Toriel is still waiting for you to hit the first switch, meaning you're unable to progress. Fortunately, hitting the switch updates the game's plot value, which tracks how far you've progressed through the game. Most cutscenes destroy themselves upon entering the room if the plot value is too high, so leaving and reentering the room will cause the cutscene to despawn. This also skips the extra dialogue at the end of the room, saving more Z presses. A few more rooms later, we run into First Froggit. It allows you to get LV 2 and increase your ATK/HP/EXP stats, but there is an issue. The game doesn't consider this a kill for the purpose of the Ruins kill counter, which means that you can choose to flee instead. Killing costs 1 extra Z press over fleeing, so we flee. The extra EXP we could gain by killing him is not useful later.

Switching rooms after every kill causes the step count required to get an encounter to be much lower. Reading a sign in the room with the 20th kill skips the third phone call event.

Once the rock stops moving, we regain movement again (still during the battle transition) and walk into the rock again, which starts the second part of the rock cutscene. Then after exiting the "But nobody came" encounter, we regain movement and thus have text storage. We use this text storage to get persistence glitch off of a second "But nobody came" encounter. Then, in the pitfall maze room we fall into a pit and interact with the sign on the same frame. The pits work by enabling phasing, locking movement, and moving you manually, but by closing the sign text, we regain movement. Thus, we can go back into the persistent room while having phasing enabled, which triggers phasing storage, allowing us to completely bypass the rest of the rock cutscene and saving 1 Z press.

By interacting with the box on the same frame the step count to get a random encounter is reached, the battle transition will start once we close the text, which also opens the box. By closing the box, we regain movement during the battle transition. As the soul starts flashing, the game locks movement a second time for some reason, but equipping the Toy Knife just beforehand bypasses the issue. We can then use this encounter to get persistence glitch. Technically it's possible to get persistence in fewer Z presses, but this requires getting a second random encounter here.

Doing this allows the player to skip some text and retain movement during the cutscene after killing Ice Cap. An invisible wall blocks you from getting close to Sans and Papyrus, so we can't just skip the cutscene. By using the stick (which is automatically in your inventory after equipping the Toy Knife) before the second set of text starts, you can regain movement afterwards again, since that set of text usually locks movement. We use the Z presses used to mash the first set of text to also use the stick. It's possible to grind out encounters during this cutscene, but as mentioned we need the Lesser Dog encounter for later. At the end of the cutscene, we use the last few Z presses mashing text to use the stick again, which gives us text storage. This allows us to skip the fun-value dependent Sans phone call at the end of the room.

	"The base steps counter is extremely high in the first possible room (340), but is only 20 upon entering for the first time (This changes after the first encounter, Aaron). Since Aaron requires at least two turns to kill, we skip this fight by triggering a room transition on the same frame as the encounter. The same is done with Woshua for the same reason in the next room. Afterwards, we kill 12 Moldsmals due to Moldsmal being a 1-shot. Temmie is also a 1-shot, but due to only appearing randomly after several scripted encounters later (which would need to be skipped) and due to Moldsmal appearing as a double encounter, killing Moldsmals is fastest.

Autosaves are created at certain points throughout the game, but don't actually affect the save file you load from the main menu. Rather, they are more a safety save in case you die and didn't have a recent save file, in which case you'll reload to the autosave. It's important to note that at the point of this autosave, we're still on the Genocide route, with the redemption flag not being set.

	"The next trick is the most difficult trick ever done in Undertale, and as the time of writing it's one of two tricks that has been pulled off in a TAS, but not RTA (the other being 4-cycle Mad Dummy). In the next room, we PCE the Sans phone call and leave the room on the right and re-enter it. The reason is that the trigger is several pixels wide, and if we PCE it from the right we can PCE it multiple precious pixels closer to the sentry station. Next we overflow the camera behind the sentry station and use the text to regain movement during a random encounter. Then we PCE the Sans call trigger and close the punch card on the frame the soul starts flashing, since that locks movement. We walk to the sentry station and overflow it, then interact with the camera as soon as we can reach it, which happens be on the last frame before the battle starts. Everything I just described from the Sans call PCE is frame- and pixel-perfect. After fleeing the battle, we have movement and 3 different textboxes (the Sans phone call, the sentry station text, and the camera text). We then grind out another random encounter. We use the camera text to regain movement during the transition, open the punch card, and use the Z presses from opening the punch card to close the sentry station text. Doing so allows us to regain movement for 1 frame while the punch card is up, which we use to move into the room transition and get persistence glitch while the punch card and the Sans call is up. Because the Sans call has a choicer, we've just set up a second choicer storage. We then die to the encounter. This reloads the autosave made before the first Undyne spears chase, where the redemption flag wasn't set and Genocide was not yet aborted. However, since persistent rooms stay persistent so long as the game is not closed, the 2 choicers stored in the Sans call room and in Box Road are both still there.

	"We now head all the way back to the beginning of Snowdin (again), grinding out a Moldsmal encounter first. On the way, we interact with the Old Tutu, which sets global.msc to a certain value corresponding to the tutu. It just so happens that the global.msc values directly after the Old Tutu correspond to the punch card box next to Nice Cream Guy. The first global.msc value checks if there are punch cards in the box. If there are, it prompts a choier which can be used to get a punch card from the next global.msc value. Otherwise, it just shows text that there are no punch cards in the box, without a choicer. The second global.msc value simply shows text that you got the punch card and puts a punch card in your inventory, without checking if there are actually punch cards in the box.

[div class=p 
	"Once at the Sans call room, we close the stored punch card sprite to regain movement and activate the choicer, which increments global.msc to the value corresponding to punch card box. Because the box is empty, it doesn't prompt its own choicer. It's important that we regain movement and exit the room while the Sans call is still playing and without mashing all the way to the "Click" text at the end of the phone call. The reason is that the Sans call is technically divided up into 3 sets of textboxes: the "Ring..." text, the Sans dialogue including the choicer, and the "Click" text. All three textboxes set global.msc to a different value, and only the last textbox gives us movement. This means that if we were to completely mash through the phone call to regain movement instead of using the stored punch card sprite, global.msc would be set to the punch card box by the choicer and then to a different value by the "Click" text, ruining the trick.

	"In Box Road, we use the choicer stored there to increment global.msc again, from the value corresponding to the punch card box to the next value after it.

	"At the same time, we enter a battle with Moldsmal. Recall that when we exited the room last time, we got an encounter on the same frame, meaning the exclamation mark was stored in the persistent room. When we reenter the room, it's still there and thus starts a battle. Normally, the battle to start is determined as soon as the exclamation mark appears, but since the exclamation mark is already there, the code to determine the battle doesn't run. Instead it just starts whatever the previous battle was, which was Moldsmal back in Waterfall.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"After exiting the battle, we instantly get another random encounter. This time, it's because the step count to get an encounter only gets reset to 0 upon entering an unpersistent room that can spawn encounters. Because our step count is high enough from walking all the way through the Sans call room and parts of the Doggo and ice rooms, we get an encounter as soon as we regain movement after the Moldsmal battle. This is also the reason we menu-buffered through parts of the Doggo and ice rooms; we would have otherwise gotten an encounter in the Sans call room. The battle text would have also reset global.msc, which would have ruined getting the punch card.

	"Next, we complete the Snowdin kill requirements. Since Ice Caps die in 1 hit, we grind out all Ice Caps in the ice room. With best-case RNG, switching rooms is slower than staying in the same room. In addition, by getting an encounter at the same time as going onto the ice, we can regain movement during the battle transition. This allows us to already start grinding out the next encounter during the battle transition. For the 16th kill, exiting and reentering the room is faster again. After completing the kill count, we can finally leave Snowdin.

By using the bag of dog food and the north wall, it is possible to stand on top of the trigger for the Mettaton cutscene without triggering it until the movement keys are released. By opening and closing the menu and then interacting with the dog bag, closing the dogfood text gives movement during the cutscene. We use the Z presses used to progress Mettaton's first textbox to close the dogfood text, interact with the fridge, and mash through to the last textbox, which triggers text corruption, shortening Mettaton's second set of text to the last line of the fridge text. This saves Z presses overall by reducing the number of textboxes to mash away. Watching the entire cutscene is required as this sets flags to enable the Genocide version of Hotland and Core, with disabled puzzles and no phone calls from Alphys.

Fleeing Astigmatism instead of skipping him avoids a 1.0-exclusive crash later in New Home. Finally, we PCE the Mettaton NEO fight and the Alphys cutscene in the following room to get to New Home.

The difference between the two (aside from a different story) is that most Monstertale encounters can be cleared in 1 Z press, while Floweytale encounters have about 5-20 lines of dialogue each, all of which need to be cleared using Z presses. Unfortunately, we can't get past the encounters in the long room, because the first one has Shyren in it. Shyren is a redemption flag monster, and sets the redemption flag if a battle with her is exited without having killed her. Since it's impossible to kill Shyren in her Monstertale encounter, it will unavoidably set redemption flag, aborting Genocide. This means we'll have to get through all the Floweytale encounters in the long room later.

The first 5 Core encounters are scripted, and encounters 3, 4, and 5 have enemies other than Whimsalot and Final Froggit in them, so we skip them by entering the room transition on the same frame as the encounter. Once we get to LV 14, we're also able to kill Astigmatism in 1 hit. Near the end of the grind, we visit Warrior's Path to kill the first encounter there, as it's a scripted Whimsalot + Final Froggit.
