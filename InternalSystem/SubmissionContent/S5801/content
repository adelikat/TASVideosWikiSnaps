	"There are six events to compete in: Sack Race, Boot Throwing, Pogo, Overboard, Pile of Pizza, and River Jump. To get to the end, all events need to be played three times. You need to score 2,000 points to advance to the next round, and you need 5,000 to make it to the finals. Finally, you have to get least 10,000 points to medal. There are three possible endings, they depend according to your final score: 10,000 for bronze, 12,000 for silver, and 15,000 for gold. To get there, you'll have to score big. In Sack Race, you'll score 40 points for every second remaining. In Boot Throwing, you'll score 50 points for every 3 feet of distance. In Pogo, you'll score 250 points for every bar cleared. In Overboard, you'll score 20 points for every second remaining, but only if you win. In Pile of Pizza, you'll score 50 points per pizza by balancing them to the end. In River Jump, you'll score 1,000 points if you succeed. This run goes for the gold in the fastest time possible, but not necessarily the maximum score possible. I tried out many strats, come up with the best ones possible, and this is what I came up with. I hope you enjoy it.

	"This is the first event, and the longest one of all to speedrun. A fully charged leap is performed at the start. Semi charged leaps are done for optimal movement. I do a weak leap to the finish line. No matter if you cross the finish line, you have to touch the ground for it to count. Also, Woodstock pushes Spike forward when he's falling behind (that's Snoopy's brother). A time of 20.1 is the best possible time.

	"In this event, you rotate the d-pad counterclockwise to build up power. The further you throw it, the more points you get. In this run, it's faster to get a double foul. Logically, throwing it backwards is the only way to get a foul. But, a glitch is used to get it done slightly faster. Throwing it downward normally registers it as 0'. There is a specific frame that registers it as a foul.

	"Carefully balance the Pizzas as you get to the end. Just holding right grants the fastest time possible of 13 seconds, but you only get awarded for 4 pizzas at 50 points per pie. The fastest time for getting to the end with all 20 pizzas is 17.2. In this run, I go nice and steady to balance the pizzas, then rush to the end, dropping only 2 pizzas, with a time if 16.9.
