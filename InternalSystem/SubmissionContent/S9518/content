	(__wikiLink|displaytext=noted by posters in this submission's forum thread|href=/Forum/Topics/26041)
	". There's some fairly standard tricks that don't get implemented throughout this submission, such as using a jump to move forward faster than going through the walk startup or jumping before going down a pit for a bit of extra falling speed. These are more noticeable towards the beginning of the movie since I started seeing more of these techniques being implemented more often later. There's also just places where there's unnecessary damage boosting done when other workarounds would result in faster movement.

	(__wikiLink|displaytext=a comparison video against a faster TAS of Mega Man with the same goal|href=/Forum/Posts/534365)

I only completed Guts Man's stage and I ended up grabbing the energy element at the end of the stage 284 frames faster than your submission. I don't even think my input file is close to super optimal but I am able to share that input file with you if you want to check what I did differently more closely.

	"On the positive side, there's still a lot of solid movement and strategies seen from what I presume is an early effort into TASing in general. Don't be discouraged by my judgment notes above. I see the potential and hope you two can look at this as a learning experience towards building your TASing skills further, whether it's with more Mega Man TAsing or something else entirely.
