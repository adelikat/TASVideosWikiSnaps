	"This is a rather short run of a special stage in Cho Ren Sha: the SHOW TIME!! stage. The only (and intended) way to access it is by accessing Kakusi Mode (holding Up for 5 seconds at the options menu) and setting the stage to 0x000F, which also independantly sets suicide bullets.

	"The arbitrary restriction used in this run is 'no bombs', in order to make the run more entertaining. Otherwhise, since you have enough resources to bomb the three bosses, the run would consist on sitting on bosses and bombing.

	"As for the run itself, optimising damage is trivial. The shot pattern lasts 12 frames; to shoot at an optimal speed, shooting again is needed. It consists of three volleys:

[ul 
	[li 
		" the first volley is three shots that go straight, with the middle shot further off and green.

	]li
	[li 
		" the second volley is the same, but the two side shots are a little angled sideways.

	[li 
		" the last volley has no green shot, and the two shots are even further angled sideways.

]ul
[div class=p 
	"Each green shot deals double damage and awards double points. Optimising this run was a matter of hitting all shots, and starting to deal damage as early as possible with the first volley (that deals the most damage.)

	"Because of this, I have a lot of room for entertainement, and made it the primary focus of this run (hence the "high" number of rerecords.)

	"I finish input by suiciding into the third boss: this saves a bit of time, as the ship does significant contact damage when dying. (This wasn't used on the other bosses; even if it were used at the end, leaving a bit of time as the next boss comes, the shots would hit later and I would lose more time.)
