	"The TAS strat is to mash up at 15 Hz (the game runs at 30 fps) and sprinkle in some left and right presses in between, like [up, wait, up, left, up, wait, up, wait...] As such, it is possible to dodge all obstacles without slowing down. However, certain tiles function as walls, so it's possible to press up and not go anywhere. It would be incredibly tedious to verify that this hasn't happened in my run by hand, so instead I wrote a

So I don't fault LGR at all on his efforts; however, warmCabin has shown us that it was necessary in order to get around the horrible coding that is hindering to manual efforts.

	" jumps on the scene and talks of some improvements, but this is where I got confused. I first want to apologize for not understanding what was going on in the first place. The scenario was discussed that emulation could be the reason for some of the frame cuts discovered; however, I thought it was within the use of FCEUX. The improvements were uploaded, via the WIP area, but for bizhawk. Even then...Otaku's TAS was done on "Action 52 (USA) (Rev A) (Unl).nes", while 
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/warmCabin 
		"warmCabin
	]a
	" used "Action 52 (USA) (Unl).nes".  So  "Revision A" was the reason for all the frame cuts. Now that I understand what is going on...this is not really an improvement in game play, but just a loading difference.
