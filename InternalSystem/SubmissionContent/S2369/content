	"When you see this movie, I think you will share my view that the theme of this game clearly is about chocolate, cake, pencil, A B C letters and stuff like that :) I think the creators of this game really wanted to make this a "joyful" and pleasant game for young children.
	$LF
	"I decided to TAS this game as its one of my childhood gaming memories and I think it makes a decent effort for submission. It was fairly easy to TAS this game. Mickey's somewhat slow starting momentum was sometimes slightly annoying. As far as I am concerned, there arent many tricks involved in this game other than the ladder trick and 1-frame zipping. The ladder trick involves having a ladder up at the screen and where you can jump high and grab the ladder's highest point. Once the screen has stopped scrolling upwards, you can stand on a ladder and jump on it and reach the nearest platform instead of climbing. All in all, it was a pleasant experience for me.

	"This new version was reworked from scratch and is much faster (about 2 minutes and 3 seconds faster than my previous submission) and cleaner compared with the previous submission so I hope you enjoy it more this time!
