	": The fun thing about console ports is that there are enough precedents on this site that we can accept good runs of all of them. That's a fun thing for me, by the way. It means I have to think less. Given that my position on this site is literally "I gotta think about submissions a lot", anything that helps me think less is a boon. Even better is the fact that I can reuse old jokes of mine, like directly copy-pasting things while explicitly saying that I am copy-pasting them, and treating it as a joke instead of trying to be funny in an original way for the first time in my life!
