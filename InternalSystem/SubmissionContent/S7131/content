	$LF
	"Nidoking has good stats and a great move set through TMs, is available early on, and can deal with virtually any matchup.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"But Nidoking also has downsides. Its main downside is that it is very slow to get going: Catching a Nidoran is very much out of the way, it requires the help of Squirtle to get through the first gym, and starts with only slow moves.
	$LF
	"It loses more than a minute and a half up to Mt. Moon, compared to just using Squirtle the whole way.
	$LF
	"Nidoking does later make up for it with efficient moves like Thrash and having access to both Fissure and Horn Drill as one-hit KO moves for the late game.

	"What I initially wanted to find out is whether this Nidoran route is really without alternative, or if it's possible for the Squirtle route to hold the large initial lead to the end, being overall faster than the Nidoran route.
	$LF
	"And the answer turns out to be 
	[b 
		"yes

	": It's possible to end up ~6.5 seconds faster than the published run.

	$LF

[div class=p 
	"This route started out as a meme, which was meant to be interesting to look at, not necessarily fast.
	$LF
	"To my surprise, even though it was an unoptimized meme-fest (e.g. fighting Brock with Charmander; canceling Charmander's evolution), it ended up actually being faster than the Squirtle route.
	$LF
	"When I looked into how this could possibly be, I realized something that is obvious only in hindsight: Changing your main battle Pokémon during the run can actually be faster.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p

	"And it makes sense, at first glance, main switching mid-run seems like a terrible idea, for many reasons:

	$LF
	"As an added bonus, it does not learn any new moves on level-up, saving extra time.
