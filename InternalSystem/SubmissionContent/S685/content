	"Cameltry is a game kinda like pinball but without the flaps and instead of the ball going around it is the board thats moving. The point of the game is to get from start to finish (naturaly) in the fastest time possible, and that is hard. This game may look kinda easy to just zoom through but it is not. The key to fast completian of the game is the bouncing. Generaly it goes faster to avoid all kind of contakt to the walls but that is simply impossible. Sometimes it is even faster and required to bounce for a faster run.

	"I try to make this movie interesting to look at and in the same time comlete it as fast as possible. The hardest part of this game is to control the bounce. If you press down near a wall the ball will shoot of and speed increasing. This is not just hard to do in the right direction it is also very unreliable since the ball can go in any kind of direction.
