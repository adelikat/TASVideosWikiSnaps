	"This TAS of 007: Agent Under Fire aims to beat the game in the fastest possible time (in-game-time and real-time-attack) from a fresh file using the hardest difficulty, 00 Agent. 00 Agent's lack of auto-aim, the appearance of less in-game hint cutscenes, and higher level scores (thus more Gold Reward upgrades) make it the fastest difficulty to TAS on for both IGT and RTA timing standards.
