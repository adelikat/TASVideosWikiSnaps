		"MOVIE MAKING

	" - a pain in the @$$, but i loved every minute of it. chakan has to be one of the oddest moving VG characters ive ever used (Genesis' seems to produce these more from my experience). the roll is fastest, but making him stop is somewhat troublesome, especially since most rolls are followed up by jumps and its the same button. jumps carry height the longer jump is held down. and something i can only seem to do via slowdowns is rolls off an edge and then do a spin jump. it saves some time and gets in that extra inch or so needed at times. ive restarted several times with this game, trying to find the most optimal potion routes (and often experimenting with a PRACTICE movie file). there were some desyncs... but nothing major.
