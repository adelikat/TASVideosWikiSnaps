	"Phantom Bullet - When a round ends, a short series of musical tones plays, then the screen resets to a new round, with the players in their starting positions. A bullet fired right before the next round screen sets up will sometimes carry over into the next screen, often with fatal results. With practice, you can shoot your opponents before they get a chance to move!

This requires precise timing that isn't always possible due to frame rules involving when the gun can be used. That being said, I managed to get this off twice in this TAS, saving a lot of extra time.

	"Shooting a bullet influences how the next round's map is generated. By shooting extra bullets after getting a point, I can generate more favorable maps that allow for points to be earned on earlier shooting frame rules via ricocheting bullets off of more favorable trees or getting better lines of sight. Note that shooting a bullet adds a lag frame but generally the tradeoff is worth it.
