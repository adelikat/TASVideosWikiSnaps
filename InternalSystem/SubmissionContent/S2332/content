		" First of all, I use Backflip in  the entire game (exept for the stages of automatic run or the stages of sky surfers), The backflip is the faster way to advance and give you invencibility from the second frame till the last (you can´t avoid damage forever), other usefull move is the cannonball, it can be performed when you are doins a jump and touch the B buttom again (when tha mecha is rising in the jump).

He fly away, and you can´t do anything to manipulate the next attack (I think you can alter this whit the last hit of you do in his last action...) He go down and Shot 4 ectoplasm (1 attack), and I Kick the 1st two nad touch the floor in order to kick the other two. The fact is, I do this in this way (and is nice to see) for alter the next attack, that will be release the core in the right part of the screen. after that, SLASH rapidly and he die.
