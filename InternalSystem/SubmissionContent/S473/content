	"Super Turrican was definately an interesting find for me.  It plays very similarly to Metroid, but uses a weapon system similar to that of the older Contra games, and you have infinite ammo.  Also, the exploration element is limited to the majority of the levels consisting of one or two paths that continue through the game, while the rest simply are dead ends, with no way of knowing which way is correct other than to memorize it.

	"This mazelike design made this game horribly frustrating my first few times through, until I got the levels mapped out.  Even with the levels memorized, the jumps require to complete the game are very repetitive and frustrating.  The run is not perfect, but Super Turrican is very difficult to do speed runs on.
