	"You have lost your soul. Your goal is to collect your soul, which is split into 3 pieces. You have the power to take a soul of different creatures to use their abilities. One soul allows for a double jump, another soul allows for a dash, and finally one of the souls allows for shooting fire balls.

[div class=p 
	"For this TAS, only the dash soul is used, purely for speed purposes. Most of the game can be skipped with an infinite jump glitch. After you finish an attack, there is a small window where you are able to jump. This renders the double jump soul useless.

[div class=p 
	"The path choosen is relatively straight forward given these circumstances. You are normally intended to backtrack after you have collected souls to collect the final piece of your soul, which is leftwards of where you initially spawn. The infinite jump glitch however let's this soul be obtained early and skip the backtracking.

	"It is then just a mad dash all the way rightwards and downwards into the cave where the final soul piece resides. The game is done once the player touches this final soul piece.
