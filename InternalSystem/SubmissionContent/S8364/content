	"Super Smash Bros. Brawl is a fighting game released for the Nintendo Wii in 2008. While its core mechanics are the same as its predecessors (Where the genre’s traditional health bar is replaced with a percent counter, with the goal of knocking opponents off the stage instead of reducing their HP to zero), Brawl changed many aspects of the game from Super Smash Bros. Melee, and is considered the “slowest” game in the series as a result of some of them. Brawl is also the first game in the series to have a dedicated story mode, called “The Subspace Emissary”, and is the main focus of this TAS. While this aims to fully complete the mode in contrast to my previous submissions’ “any%” category, several improvements across the TAS can be retroactively applied to them.

Pressing the A button in combination with the control stick allows characters to attack with a variety of moves (Including Jabs, Tilt attacks, and Smash attacks on the ground, and aerial attacks in the air), and pressing the B button in the same manner allows unique Special attacks to be used. The Z button is used to grab opponents, and the L/R buttons are used to shield against or dodge enemy attacks. The C-Stick allows Smash Attacks to be used on the ground, and aerial attacks in the air. The D-Pad is used to perform character exclusive taunts, but they don’t do anything meaningful aside from looking flashy.

Enough about the RNG was known for me to make an RNG brute-forcing Lua Script - many of the spectacles in this TAS would have been considered impossible without it.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The RNG’s RAM address is 0x805A1E8C, with values taking the form of a 4-Byte Hexadecimal. New RNG values are almost always generated by taking the preexisting value, multiplying it by 0x41C64E6D, adding 0x3039, and using the last eight digits (The lone exception is during room transitions, where the last value generated has its last two digits floored to zero, making the RNG “jump” from one sequence to another). The RNG value changes many times in a single frame, with the exact amount depending on the amount of things calling it (Many enemies on the screen at once bring the call-per-frame number to over 40, for example). Numerous player actions also change the RNG (Generating dust from running, jumping, attacking, pausing and unpausing, etc.), which makes manipulating it a relatively quick process.
	$LF

	"The Item Drop System
	$LF
]h3
[div class=p 
	"On the frame an enemy is defeated, they drop a random item the character can use. The general item probabilities are dependant on the enemy itself (With specific enemies having their own individual item pools), the stage or room one is in (With some specific items not showing up at all, like Super Mushrooms in most of The Battlefield Fortress), and the game’s difficulty (With higher difficulties increasing the chances of Trophy Stands and Stickers dropping, for example). As RNG is called numerous times per frame, and that every value corresponds to its own item, many items are initially “trapped” in-between frames, requiring RNG manipulation to make them appear on a whole frame. Notably, pausing and unpausing the game up to three frames before an enemy dies prevents the RNG from moving up to six values (Two values per pause frame) in comparison to normal; this means a given frame of enemy death has four different item outcomes - one regular outcome, and three pause outcomes. Exclusive to fight areas, running advances the RNG once for every frame the run is active, making it even easier to manipulate.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Due to further advancements in RNG knowledge (Thank you, Eon), I was able to create an optimized script that makes repeatedly loading a savestate obsolete, thanks to the items themselves being predictable now alongside the RNG values themselves.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The item that an enemy drops is determined by converting the RNG value into an integer, generally with bounds between 0 and 1000. The value is then compared against the item pool’s corresponding list, where each item has a specific value; the first item with a value smaller than the RNG’s value is what spawns.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The one situation where the new script couldn’t be used was the case involving Stickers, as their sub-ID pool is in a different spot that I just could not find no matter how hard I looked. However, as I could still find when a Sticker spawns through the Item Table list, I was able to create an optimized version of the old script that exclusively checked values that generated Stickers, which was several times faster.

This includes increased attack power to a given type of move (Arm moves, Leg moves, etc.), increased defense, and so on. The holy grail of stickers for this TAS is the “Bullfrog” sticker, which has a character spawn with a Bob-Omb in every single room. It’s the only sticker with this effect, and allows for incredible feats of damage boosting when combined with a specific technique (Explained below).

	"To prevent characters from being able to fly all over the place by taking ridiculous amounts of damage, the developers attempted (Key word: 
	[b

	") to add safeguards related to the camera. In the free-roaming sections, the blastzones are tied to the camera’s boundaries; moving past them causes a character to be KO’d. When a character takes launching damage, the camera freezes in place for a time, with larger amounts of damage causing the camera to freeze for longer. This leads to an intended mechanic where attempting to damage boost all over the place is met with being KO’d from the camera’s frozen blastzones. However, the developers missed some important details that allowed me to do exactly what they wanted to prevent.

	"At first, it was believed that only electric attacks were capable of unintended behavior: If one gets hit by an electric attack and SDIs into a wall or ceiling before hitstun ends, the camera doesn’t freeze, and the player flies through the level. I found out later that it works with all attack types, but that non-electric attacks have much tighter timing (Getting a wall or ceiling bounce on the first frame of hitstun, instead of any frame of hitstun like electric attacks). They also have the added requirement of the player needing to move directly into a wall or ceiling the instant the attack hits; the trick doesn’t work if the character is frozen in hitlag or not moving in general, unless the wall or ceiling itself is moving.

	"This occurs because the game only explicitly freezes the camera if the character is in the neutral “taking damage” animation; immediately entering a wall or ceiling bounce (Or in the event of hitting a Jyk, air-dodging on the frame of impact) skips this animation, and doesn’t freeze the camera. Because this technique always (Except the rare Jyk scenario I mentioned) requires you to be in the wall or ceiling bounce animation, I’ve decided to name it “Bounce Boosting”, for a shorthand of “Wall-Bounce Damage Boost” or “Ceiling-Bounce Damage Boost”.

The next section involves a series of retracting barriers and switches that you need to hit to unlock them. I unlock the first barrier, and use the Motion Sensor Bomb I picked up to perform a very peculiar Bounce Boost; the speed and timing of the barrier falling back into place allows me to momentarily clip out of bounds, but not enough to actually remain there.

Peach’s ability to repeatedly spawn Bob-Ombs is also a very vital asset, used in many locations.
