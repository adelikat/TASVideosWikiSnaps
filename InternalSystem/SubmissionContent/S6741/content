	"As usual with runs of the Punch-Out games, this TAS aims for in-game time, then real time. Because some of Mac's actions (star punches, stunned punches) briefly stop the clock, these don't always go together.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"However, there's a glitch which results in faster in-game times at the cost of about a minute of real time. If Mac lands a rapid punch unstunned, the clock will stop and will not start again. The only way to start it again is to do something that would normally stop the clock, such as throwing a star punch or knocking the opponent down.

[div class=p 
	"The clock stop glitch only gives faster times on four fights, meaning most of the run would be unchanged. The original plan was to combine the two runs into a single tasproj, with the four clock stop fights as separate branches. Unfortunately that isn't possible right now, so this run contains only the no clock stop branch. A submission using clock stop will follow.
