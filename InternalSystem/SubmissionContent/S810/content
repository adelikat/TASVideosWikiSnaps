	"Jo is your average American teenager with a love for kendo.  How lucky she is to be sent to Japan for the summer to attend Honest Osaki's Kendo School and Used Car Sales!

	"It's the first day of school, and it's a five hour commute (or would be, anyway; I managed it in a little over an hour).  Osaki (AKA Bob) appears and tells her the situation.  The path to school will take her under a lake, over a snow covered field, and through what can only be assumed to be the local terrorist group's toy factory, bringing her face to face with a giant robot, a chibi doppleganger, and a feathery regeneration of the Doctor.  To help her, Bob hands Jo a small golden elephant that will turn Jo into a Magical Girl(tm)!  Her first lesson?  Don't be late to school!

		"Going through the level intermissions too fast will result in a screwed up pallette for the next level.  Usually the change looks so natural that only those familiar with the levels will notice, and even then.  It's easily noticeable in levels 3 and 5 where it looks like I have a slightly bad dump.  You can witness the pallette correct itself in levels: 4, as I'm entering the building; 5, after I beat the boss; 6, as I'm leaving the subway.  It fixes itself in level 7, but the transition is smoother.
