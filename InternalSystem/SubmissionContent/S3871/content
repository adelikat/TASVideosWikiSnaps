	"This is (obviously) the sequel to Konami's (in)famous Yie Ar KUNG-FU game, which appeared in the arcades in 1985 and was ported to many home computers and consoles. The NES and MSX ports were done by Konami itself. This sequel appeared a year later and this time Konami only released it for the MSX and some other home computers got a port by James Software Ltd, most of them hardly getting near the quality of Konami's excellent work. Part one was a simple 16kB game with only 5 bosses, repeating endlessly. Part two however, this time 32kB, has 8 different bosses and 3 screens of pre-stages (can get you an item to replenish life, not interesting for the TAS), several backgrounds and an ending scene.

	"You can basically:

[ul 
	[li 
		" walk (very slow!). You cannot walk through the sides of the screen (no warping).

	[li 
		" jump forward (fast, but takes quite a while)

	" TAS tactics
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"For the TAS I used some simple principles:
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" Go through the pre-stage screens as quickly as possible. I use a minor glitch here: you can already start the jump before the screen is visible (you won't see the player standing at the start of a screen). I do have to attack some of the enemies here and there to avoid getting hit by them.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Approach the boss as quickly as possible, using forward jumps (sometimes bouncing), otherwise you can't hit him.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Beating bosses:
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" to prevent getting hit, do small movements (often backward) or just attack and miss. Basically game AI manipulation.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				" bosses tend to walk backwards quickly at some points. The only thing you can do then is jump to him to get in reach again. Walking is 
				[b 
					"way
				]b
				" too slow!
				$LF
			]li
		]ul
		" the bonus item at 0:21 gives you temporary invincibility, but it's obviously not useful for this run. (For normal play it is also not very useful, as it lasts only shortly, you can hit the boss only once or twice at most...)
		$LF
	]li

	" Final words

	"I hope you enjoy the run! I certainly enjoyed creating it. See this YouTube video for a rendering of it:
