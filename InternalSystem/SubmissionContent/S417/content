	"-It's difficult to make a puzzle game interesting. I pondered a few because of the rarity of the runs, and this one won over Tetris. I tried as often as possible to make the viewer wonder why I put a piece where I did only to find out later that it cleared out viruses 2 rows underneath while still maintaining a solid speed. Unfortunately, the game has a solid memory of what pieces are coming next, and once I got an opening to win, it would have taken an extra 2 minutes-ish to clear the board, and even then, the virus died before the extra pill pieces were cleared so they were there anyway, but I left it so it appeared that the remaining pieces were at least the same color. Unlike other puzzle games of this genre, the pieces given don't alter based on the remaining obstacles - in other words, just because you don't have any red viruses remaining doesn't mean you won't get any more red pieces. I aimed primarily for the fastest time and secondarily for an entertaining video. It will probably be still be more boring than the least exciting action game, but at least it's short.
