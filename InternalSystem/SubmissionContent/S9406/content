Some major glitches discovered since then change the route massively. Additionally, RBA was not allowed at the time of the previous TAS but is now and is heavily used, mostly to always have bombchus available. Equip swap, which allows equipping items as any age, was also discovered which allows for better routing such as Jabu-Jabu's Belly as adult. Many other tricks were found since then to speed up segments too, such as early bow with hookshot jump, bug push Door of Time skip, frozen timer with master sword and glitched damage with Quick Putaway.

If this is done with a Deku Stick, and you break it in a way that would normally give you an indefinite broken stick you put it away instantly and get glitched damage. This glitched damage has many properties and the most useful is Din's Fire property. Since crouch stabs use the last damage value you now have this glitched damage every time you crouch stab.

	"On the 1.0 version of the game exclusively you can quickly put away your sword just before walking off a ledge and then, the frame after, press B to do a jumpslash in the air, and do an "Empty Jumpslash".

This puts him in a weird glitchy state called "Speak A" (because on English the A button would say "Speak" even after walking away from the NPC). In this state the game still thinks Link is talking to the previous NPC since the textbox didn't finish. If you then bring up a YES/NO textbox with Saria's Song you can run the dialogue they would normally have associated to a YES/NO textbox. This is known as Text Transfer Glitch. This allows us in two cases to skip a lot of the trade quests. By using Speak A we can get the Broken Goron Sword from the carpenter in Kakariko, which is the same carpenter you'd normally trade in Gerudo Valley as Adult. By doing Double Speak A we can sell the Bunny Hood to the running man without ever having gotten it, skipping the entire Mask Quest.

The bugs hitboxes are tiny, and Links hitbox is only large enough to interact with the bugs on a very few specific frames of his animations, one of them being the landing frame of a backflip.
