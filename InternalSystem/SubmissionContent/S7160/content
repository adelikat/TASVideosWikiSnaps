[div class=p 
	"The way to keep speed in this game is to keep jumping. Each frame you are on the ground will drop the speed. So normally you want to jump as high as possible. By landing at the edge of a platform, you can avoid losing speed while being able to stay longer in the air. Speed will also be kept if you jump into a wall. The speed can be kept while changing direction in midair, you do however need to re-build the speed fully before you land. This was extra tricky in a level like 3-1.

	" By setting up the next enemy boost differently, I could stomp on the enemy and reach up the higher platform without having to rub against the wall. This also helped me keep higher speed throughout the rest of the level, in combination with landing at the edge of platforms to gain further distance without losing any speed.

I struggled hard to find a pattern where I could get perfect RNG for both him and the boss, but was unable to do so.

If you had endless magic, it is possible to stunlock him and keep hitting forever. Sadly, the magic will run out eventually and using the fireman suit to hit him does barely any damage.

	"The first step of the fight is therefore to get him to do an attack which spawns the lanterns, which will give ammo refills when killed. I could slightly have changed when the attack occured, but I kept the same as the previous TAS.
