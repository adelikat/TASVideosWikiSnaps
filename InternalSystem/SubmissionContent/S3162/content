	": Some of the previous runs of this game were a bit boring. Not this one though, it never fails to deliver. Great Koopa kicks, ridiculous out of nowhere high jumps, clever and *impossible* fireball shots, and other great shenanigans make this run fantastic. Accepting as improvement to previous runs.
