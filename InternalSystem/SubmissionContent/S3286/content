	[del

	" platformer that usually takes many tries to complete. This run aims to do so in the fastest possible time.

[p 
	"Secondly, the reason why I used the "4 stage" version instead of an extended one is because the 
	[a class=extlink href=http://www.geocities.jp/z_gundam_tanosii/home/Main.html rel=nofollow 
		""official"
	]a
	" site only has this version. Also, a  
	[a class=extlink href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_mario rel=nofollow 
		"source
	]a
	" claims that Syobon Action only has 4 stages, implying that the extended version is a fan-game.

	"With enough horizontal velocity, you can clip slightly into a wall if you turn around for ~1 frame. Then simply hold onto the jump button ("Z" or "UP") to jump again once inside the wall.

[p 
	"To turn quickly, bump into a wall for 1 frame then immediately turn around. It's faster than turning without bumping into a wall. Used once in stage 1 - 1.
