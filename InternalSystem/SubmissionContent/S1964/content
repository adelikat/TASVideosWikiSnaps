	"Hello, TASvideos. My name is NDS_Emil and this is my first TAS. My aim was to get as far as I can with two players. I recorded it with snes9x-1.51 and I must say that I didn't use a savestate at all. The total number of frames are 43733. I had Left+Right/Up+Down allowed and I didn't used it. My aim was at first to complete the game as fast as possible with the highest score. I have got much damage to save time becuse it's hard to control two players when player two (Zitz) has same bottons on the keyboard as player 1 (Jimmy).

	"I am afraid you are mistaken - this is not your first TAS, because this movie you submitted is not tool-assisted. It is a movie of a person playing normally, and poorly at that. You die and get a game-over in the third stage.
