So in other words I managed to dash earlier saving enough frames to remove 1 frame rule loop (nearly 8 frames per course that requires unlocking a skull door). I noticed this happening frequently after Course 22.

	"The boss battle had slightly worse luck than the previous run and I’m assuming the manipulation is an RNG to an RNG because I can manipulate his attacks at times but when it comes to the position, it seems like I can’t manipulate that during the battle. So if I wanted to manipulate an attack at his exact starting position it seems like I have to either sacrifice a few frame loops (multiples of 8), but that alone is quite a lot as I haven’t lost loads of frames due to imperfect luck.
