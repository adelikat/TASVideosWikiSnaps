	"It was hard to kill or avoid enemys like the red areemer because they can move so fast, and I sometimes get damage to save times. I changed my weapon to knife in stage 3 because knife is better than lance because they can exist up to three on screen at a time, lance only can exist up to two at a time in this game. I tried not to shoot weapon on ground because arthur (the character's name that I'm controlling) stop to walk when shooting weapons on ground. Sorry for my bad english, i hope i can tell information correct to people who read this submission. Please enjoy my movie.
