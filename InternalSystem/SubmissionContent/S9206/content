	"According to its plot, the Earth's population decided they have polluted it enough, and migrated elsewhere, leaving robots made of orbs ("orbots") behind to clean up the mess. One of the higher level orbots gets his head accidentally attached to a nuclear warhead, goes insane and usurps total control over all mechanical beings left on the planet. This is the state the main hero, orbot Vectorman, finds it in after returning from one of his garbage discharging missions.

	"I opted for "Wicked" difficulty in this submission instead of "Insane" (the hardest difficulty). A higher difficulty means enemies have more HP and Vectorman has less. Since there are no enemy interactions whatsoever in this TAS, I thought it would be pointless to change it. Moreover, changing the difficulty would mean you would have to watch the 12-second title screen cutscene again, which is annoying to sit through twice.

	"Up to 3 photons can be on-screen at once. Normally, Vectorman can shoot one photon every 7-8 frames. However, you can shoot photons at a faster rate by changing state during the cooldown interval. These state changes can include anything from stopping running, starting running, turning around, jumping, landing, ducking, and unducking. This property was used heavily when destroying the TV containing the bomb morph.

[div class=p 
	"Shooting a photon diagonally forwards within 10 frames after landing from a jump will grant Vectorman a 160-subpixel ground acceleration for one frame instead of the standard 32-subpixel ground acceleration. It would seem beneficial to do this after landing from every jump, so why don't I do that? Because shooting photons often generates lag. Sometimes, the time that would be lost due to lag outweighs the time that would be gained due to a diagonal-forward shot, hence why some jump landings don't have them.
