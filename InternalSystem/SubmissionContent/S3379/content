		"This movie improves 38 seconds over nitrogenesis previous run through better optimization, not slowing down as often and improved boss fights. The gameplay is very simple and consists mainly of running right and shooting things. The game is completely rendered in tiles, so the screen only updates 8 pixels at a time (at a framerate of 15fps). 
		$LF

	[li 
		" This makes input very crude, but straightforward. It does mean the player character can only move 8 pixels at a time as well, hence some of the jumps don't look as close as they could. Your jump height is fixed, but you can steer your jump. On the plus side, it allows for smooth scrolling, including the illusion of parallax scrolling.

		" Everytime you gather a hundred coins, the game stops for a moment. Each second you save on the timer also counts as an additional coin, so I did my best not to collect unnecesary coins. All in all, I think it's impossible to get less than 200 coins, though you're welcome to prove me wrong.

		" You can upgrade your weapon multiple times. Using a fully upgraded weapon in busy screens creates lag. I labelled the movie as "contains speed/entertainment tradeoffs", because I was willing to trade a few lag frames for a couple of neat and impressive shots.

		" Bosses have tiny weak spots that aren't exposed at all times. The fully upgraded white ball does 4 damage, the small yellow ones 2 damage. All bosses have 60hp, except the last one, who has 70.
