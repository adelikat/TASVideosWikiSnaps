Going up by 1 floor would make sense as the fastest way to progress through the hotel, but because of the way the elevators work it isn't. We'll get back to that later.

	"Once the game has loaded the elevator, the game starts a timer that goes from 0 to 47, after which it resets to 0. The cycle needs to be completed 4 times for the door to close and the elevator to start going. After this, a completed cycle will do one of two actions:

	"For example, when traveling from floor L to floor 12, the game will need to complete 3 cycles of the elevator timer. First to change the floor number to 11, then another one to change it to 12 and the final one to stop the elevator.

	"This cycle can be completed early by pressing A. This can only be done after 24 frames, so on 0-23 nothing happens, but on 24-47 the timer will reset to 0. With specific A presses, we can minimize the time the elevator needs to reach the target floor. The final A press (or completed cycle) needs to be as close to the stopping point as possible, otherwise the elevator will slow down early and lose time. The A press is sometimes adjusted to line up with the timer for the door opening as well.
