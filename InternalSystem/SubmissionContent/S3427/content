	"I improved 46 frames until the boss battle starts but I had more lags (8) mostly because of laggy collision detection. I tried many variations, most of the times I got a very bad (nearly instant death) at Zulu stairway so this is what I got as the fastest.

	"As discussed in the discussion forum, using the PAXKKLAA game genie code fixes the ending, which IMHO looks better than a pair of sloppy tits. Dwedit made a temporary encode to see it in action: http://www.dwedit.org/files/MESHUGGAH_GhostBusters_ending_restoration.mp4
