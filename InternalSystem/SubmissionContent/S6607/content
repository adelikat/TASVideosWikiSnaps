	"Due to the relative simple nature of this game (easy physics, no lag etc.) I wasn't expecting much of an improvement at all so I'm really pleased with gaining almost 30 seconds. Almost all the time gained came from better tackling of the individuals rooms themselves. The run sees almost no route change, the only difference being that I do the "Gauntlet of Evil" before getting the Orrexium shard in that area - this heavily calculated route change saved a whopping 1 frame!
