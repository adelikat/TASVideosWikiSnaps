	"I selected "Time Attack" mode because it allows you to exit the stage by pressing Start+B. I can exit the stage without having to wait for the time of the "FINISH" animation and it will still count the level completion time. This saves 10 seconds off this movie.

	"I found a way to improve the zipping glitch with the tree trunk with better pixelation. This time it sends Tails through the tree trunk for the second lap in a row (his speed needs to be <1E00). I skip the final lap by going over the goal post over the top of the screen and crossing it again when I fall back down.

	"When Tails is jumping up and he is within a certain distance near the platform where the goal post is, the goal post won't count a lap when he crosses it. This allows Tails to fly through the ceiling during the countdown. Jumping over the goal post is faster than spindashing through the level.
