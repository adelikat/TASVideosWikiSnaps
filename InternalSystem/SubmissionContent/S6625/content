	"Fantasy Zone is a 1986 Shooter arcade game developed by Sega. It was ported to many consoles including the Famicom, which is the version that this TAS uses. Unlike most shooters, Fantasy Zone does not autoscroll, making it a very interesting TAS game. Each level involves destroying 8 enemy bases which allows you to fight the boss for the level. The game has 7 levels and then a boss rush at the end.

But before TASing that, I wanted to make sure that I understood all of the known tech about the game. This is why I decided to TAS the NES version and compare my knowledge to the previous TAS.

	"I’ve had experience TASing the Master System version before swapping to NES. Some major changes are: 2 different bosses, Master System lets you keep your shot upgrade forever if you have all of the speed upgrades, SMS doesn’t limit your fire rate on normal shots (SMS = 3 shots on screen max, NES = 5 frames between shots), SMS has the demo glitch and your movement post shot doesn’t affect your shot’s trajectory on SMS, SMS can handle more than 1 damage calculation per frame, SMS doesn’t seem to have a frame rule.

[div class=p 
	"This means that each level only checks if it should fade out once per second, causing a 60 frame frame rule. The frame rule check occurs when the boss disappears and the coins spawn, then it’s a constant amount of time until fadeout. It also occurs between bosses in the bosh rush.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"This frame rule doesn’t increment in shops, so it’s important to buy exactly what I need and nothing more. Usually a frame rule would make things boring, but it actually causes me to carefully route my upgrades and only buy exactly what I need to hit each frame rule.

[div class=p

An example of this is level 2’s boss, which takes twice the damage with the laser beam and is also much easier to hit with it. The downside of the laser beam is that you have to be on the same height as your enemy and it’s got a lower fire rate than the 7 way shot, as you can cause damage every frame with strategic 7-way shots.

[div class=p 
	"More use of this weapon was the primary timesave in this TAS. This usually deals the same damage as laser apart from some bosses like level 2. The main advantage of the 7-way shot is destroying enemy bases. You can deal damage to bases while travelling to their height, meaning you have to slow down much less than with the laser.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The main downfall of the 7-way shot is the difficulty of optimizing it. When firing, you will actually get a 7-way shot but then you can only fire again once one of the bullets has disappeared. If you fire at this point, you’ll shoot one bullet instead of 7 and it seems to be in an inconsistent but predetermined. It could have something to do with which shot had despawned.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Optimally, you can damage an enemy every single frame with the 7-way shot. An example of this is level 7’s boss. However, you would be very lucky to do this with bases as they have a small hitbox and you’re travelling towards them. What usually works is firing a 7-way shot every second frame which often gives you 2-3 bullets (when close to a base). Out of these 2-3 bullets, usually only one will hit the base. Occasionally you can get one B press to cause 2 hits to a base, but this requires you to be a certain distance away and hence would require you to slow down. The main issue with getting several hits in is that you need to hit the enemy on different frames with different bullets. If 2 bullets hit on the same frame you despawn both but only get the damage of 1 bullet. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Usually with the 7-way shot you can destroy bases without slowing down just by adjusting your height. This is also helped by the extra time you gain as you can destroy the base form underneath/above rather than having to destroy it before you hit the side of it.

You also have to manipulate enemies to make sure that none are spawned when you’re trying to fade out. A particularly annoying case of this is level 3 which has a type of enemy that will sit up the top of the level and follow you around, never leaving the screen. You have no choice but to RNG manipulate those enemies to not spawn, which is not easy considering you can’t actually see them when they spawn unless you scroll right up to the top of the screen.
