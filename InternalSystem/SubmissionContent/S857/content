	"The main objective of the front character is to reach the next door fast as possible and the back character is to support the front plyer by killing any ennemies on his path and help him to jump higher at all costs (suicide if necessary).

	"Some of the hardest things to do in this movies was climbing while avoiding ennemies and avoiding most lags as possible
	$LF
	"I think people will like this movie because of the tactic used with the two players.
