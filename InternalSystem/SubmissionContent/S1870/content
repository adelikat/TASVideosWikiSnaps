		"Garfield - Caught in the act
	]a
	" is a relatively new (1995) game for the sega genesis, which was later ported to windows (with a different level order and a bonus level). While it is rather slow paced, it features a well known character, nice graphics (even some prerendered 3D objects) and a good variety of level themes. The story is about Garfield repairing the TV after accidentally destroying it. The remaining parts form an evil being, the "glitch", who traps Garfield into the television (can be watched in the intro). Now the player has to fight through 5 movies to face and defeat the glitch in order to rescue Garfield.

The second one seems to always come as the 8th after the first one. By attacking him, his bomb throwing can be ended, forcing him to go to the other side. The moment, that he starts throwing again can be manipulated by attacking him, while he changes the side. This leads to the following strategy: Manipulate the boss to throw an unlit bomb as early as possible and interrupt him with this bomb as soon as he tosses the second unlit bomb. Then attack the boss with this bomb in such a way, that it minimizes the walking duration.
