	"Powerpig is a homebrew Game Boy Advance game developed by Genecyst for the NeoFlash compo 2013. The game is currently available from the developer on

	". The goal of the game is to simply reach the exit goal in each of the 28 stages. This game allows for capturing enemies similar to Tumble Pop, albeit without the ability to then use said enemies as projectiles.

	"I first learned about this game from Kusogrande, hosted by Brossentia. It was probably there due to the fact that the music is a cacophony and the vertical movement is a bit iffy. Despite those bits I find this game a bit charming to actually play since it's a neat challenge to try to maximize score. This TAS just aims for speed, so the score mechanics aren't too relevant for this submission.

	"Pressing the B button shoots a short range beam from the gravity gun. Enemies get trapped in a bubble if exposed long enough to the beam, with their size determining the amount of time needed to trap them. Even if they're not trapped, enemies are at least temporarily stunned and can be safely passed during that time. This consumes beam ammo which can be replenished by collecting coins. The beam hitbox also extends upwards and downwards which means enemies can be stunned with the beam to bypass them safely.

[div class=p 
	"A note about the beam stun: sometimes the stun can end for what seems to be a frame which causes Powerpig to lose a life. Normally losing a life would put Powerpig back to the start of the stage but in these brief cases this only loses a life without losing positioning. I have no idea why this happens but this affects the later stages waiting is done to not get hit by this weird period of enemy contact.

	"Getting close to walls will shift Powerpig next to a wall. This can be helpful if the shift is in a favorable direction to move forward faster. Other times this can push Powerpig away from the desired direction so inputs are delayed to avoid that.
