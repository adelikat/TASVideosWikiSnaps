	"Some hate and some like this game, but one way or another its a very short and challenging game. TASing this game is very frustrating and manipulating the sequences of enemies is just a royal pain. I tried to make the manipulation as hard as possible to notice, sometimes its invisible like jumping on a very specific frame when its neccessary to do so for hitting an enemy or jumping on a ledge, while others require minute delays even one frame delays such as the one of the parts on the last level can cause fantastic results.

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"An extremely short game based on the Karate Kid movie. The author explains that some movements might not seem optimal, which is because the player has to avoid both entering bonus stages hidden everywhere around the levels and kicking bosses offscreen as well as the setup of enemies. If a boss goes offscreen, it regains all of its health, which of course isn't a good thing.

	"Had the kid been this strong in the movie, then Miyagi may well have been Daniel's mentour.
