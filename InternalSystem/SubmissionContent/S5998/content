	"Differences and tricks :
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- Use of the joystick instead of the D-pad saves couple of frames on many occasions.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- Sometimes, you lose control of your character before a scene, and he turns himself facing a direction.
	$LF
	"Most of the times, making him face said direction, before losing control saves couple of frames.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- Same thing applies to NPC you have to talk to. It's usually faster to start talking to them when they face you, instead of making them turn.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- Renaming characters. Most of the dialog boxes takes the same time to appear and disappear no matter how much letters are in it.
	$LF
	"But there are several occurences where text scrolls at its own speed and characters' names are mentionned.
	$LF
	"In those cases, having less letters saves time. It does indeed for Zidane, Dagger and Eiko.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- Puck Skip. When controlling Vivi for the first time, if you start talking to a NPC on the same frame Puck hits you, you keep control of Vivi, and can exit the screen right away.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- Slide Skip in Dali Underground. At the end of the underground part, if you simply go up, Zidane starts to slide before watching left. By stopping on the right frame you avoid the slide.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- Quina Limit Glove Vs Standard fight. Limit Glove is a Blue Magic of Quina, that deals 9999 damage if Quina's HP is 1.
	$LF
	"While it significantly speeds up Gizamaluke, Beatrix 1 & 2 and Antlion fights, it takes quite some times to get.
	$LF
	"I actually TASed up to Fossil Roo, both route. Turns out that not getting Limit Glove is faster with the Random Numbers I had (~15 seconds)
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- Gizamaluke's fight. Since it's a TAS, you'd expect it to go tentless. However, now that we don't have Quina, the fight is longer and the enemy has a lot more turns. Which means he would have used magic a few times. Having him not be able to cast and restart his ATB is faster overall.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- Antlion's fight. Same as Gizamaluke, the use of a Tent saves time by stopping him from casting Magic.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- Alexandrian Soldiers in Cleyra. It is faster to make them escape instead of killing them, because it would skip the post-fight screen.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- Lucky Seven. It's an ability for Zidane. When his HP end with a 7, Lucky Seven will deal either 7, 77, 777 or 7777 damages with equal probability. Very powerful at the moment you get it and not as time-consuming as Limit Glove to watch.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- Moogle Skip. In Madain Sari, before it turns night for the first time. You can talk to the Moogle offscreen to trigger the event right away, instead of having him come inside the house.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- Mistodon Skip on the Iifa Tree roots. You can't get chased by a Mistodon for the first 120 frames. After that, every frame there is a check.
	$LF
	"A pointer goes through the Random Numbers table one by one and check RN mod 60 with another RN. If it is equal, a Mistodon starts to chase you.
	$LF
	"So, what to do, if we have one of these in our table ?
	$LF
	"Sometimes, the pointer skips naturally a number, but not necessarly the one we want. It is possible to push the number that is skipped a little further by stopping to run for a few frame. It doesn't work everytime though.
	$LF
	"Another way to skip a number is by calling the RNG. It can be done using Cure or a Phoenix Down. Fortunately here we only had 2 numbers to skip.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- Mistodon Skip in Alexandria's streets. On the second screen, there is supposed to be a mandatory fight. But the programmers put the trigger zone and the exit of the screen very close, and it's possible to reach both at the same time. In which case the exit takes priority.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"- Tantarian. If you have followed the RTA community, you've seen some runners fight Tantarian to get the Running Shoes and Auto-Haste ability.
	$LF
	"It decreases the length of your ATB and fills it up 150% faster. While useful in RTA, under TAS conditions it saves very little time (~ 15-20 seconds) compared to the time it takes to get (~ 1 min 10 seconds).
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- Reaching the Black Mage Village by boat from Lindblum. It is faster to go North exiting Lindblum to reach the BMV, however you need to take the same boat to reach the Desert Palace after.
	$LF
	"When you add the two trips, it's overall faster to go South from Lindlum by a couple seconds.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"- Room with the four holograms in Oeilvert. While it's safer to exit by the bottom, the two loading times instead of one, makes it faster to exit by the top.

[div class=p 
	"- Ark. Stealing the Holy Lance makes this fight longer but saves a lot of time for the next fights.

[div class=p 
	"- Desert Palace and Valia Pira. Now that we have the Holy Lance, we can deal way more damages to Valia Pira but we have to disable a second Bloodstone.

	"Two hits from Freya and disabling the Bloodstone is still faster than Limit Glove.
