	"This run beats FODA's currently published run by 3025 frames by input length or 3007 frames (a little over 50 seconds) if counting when you actually beat the game. This was way more than I had hoped for when starting the run, as I thought I'd only add one shortcut (which ended up saving around 500 frames) and gain a couple of frames here and the due to better presision by utilizing memory watch which the previous run didn't. But the more I studied the game the more "hidden" physics I discovered, and I also found a useful glitch that involves falling through moving platforms and platforms that fall down when you stand on them.

	"If you walk by alternating the left and right buttons every frame you will almost keep the speed you just had (it's 16 subpixels slower per frame on average, 1 pixel is 256 subpixels), it only works on ground. This means that if you can get a temporary speed boost (from a downhill or lian) and do the 1-1 running when you hit flat ground you can keep that high speed as long as the flat ground lasts. Another way to slightly increase your speed using this is to land a jump while having the throwing animation (which requires that you actually have something to throw, which only happens in levels 2-2 and 2-3. It can also be used right after landing a normal jump if you don't have enough space to jump, this will result in a speed that's only 8 subpixels slower than jumping. Another way to use this also exists, but I banned that which I'll mention further in the speed/entertainment tradeoffs section.

	"This trick is even weirder than one above. Basically if you're pushing in a direction in order to get your x-speed down to 0 and and you on your way to this number pass by the speed value of 0 pixels and 32 subpixels you speed will immediately go up to the maximum walking speed you can normally get. So if your speed is 0 and you want to get to maximum speed as fast as possible you must first accelerate normally until your speed is 0 pixels and 112 subpixels, then push in the opposit direction until 1 frame after your speed is 0 pixels and 32 subpixels and it will go up directly to the speed of 1 pixel and 96 subpixels.

	"If you in picture above want to jump from 1 to 2 (where 2 is a solid plattform), you must reach a height of at least 1 pixel above the height of that platform, otherwise you'll just hit the wall. But if 2 was a non-solid platform you'd be allowed to be on the same height as platform in order to start moving right just at the edge of 2. However then you wouldn't be standing on the block but rather fall through instead, and once your height is lower than the platform you won't be able to kove to the right anymore. This trick is used two times in the run, even though I take use of the physics in the falling and rising platforms themselves rather than jumping.

[p 
	"As mentioned before I choosed to not use one type of 1-1 running, namely the one that you can start just after landing a jump where you've stopped pushing forward 1 frame before landing it. This can at most result in you moving 1/52th faster than the normal jumping speed and it can be used anyware to save very little time, which is why I don't use it - because having Mickey wobbling his way through the whole game would just be tedious to watch.
