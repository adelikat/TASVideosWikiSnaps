[div class=p 
	"All the recent any% runs of the various ports of Montezuma's revenge (along with a bit of help from Spikestuff) prompted me to look deeper into doing an all items run of this port.  This is a much easier port for routing an "All Items" run as there are significantly less items, a smaller pyramid, and limited options on where to use various usable items.

						"A particular example is in the room where the sword is obtained in Level 3.  Without the ladder boost, it's impossible to make the jump over the lava to the sword on that particular floor cycle.  Without the boost, an entire cycle's worth of time would be lost.
