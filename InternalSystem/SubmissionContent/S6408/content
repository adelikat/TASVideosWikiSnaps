	"All the recent any% runs of the various ports of Montezuma's revenge (along with a bit of help from Spikestuff) prompted me to look deeper into doing an all items run of this port.  This is a much easier port for routing an "All Items" run as there are significantly less items, a smaller pyramid, and limited options on where to use various usable items.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This is an all items run, not a 100% run; in the sense that it collects all items without visiting every room (though we don't necessary require visiting all rooms in other games where 100% runs are done).

[p 
	"To my understanding this is a vault eligible goal.
