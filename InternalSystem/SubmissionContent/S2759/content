	"Golden Axe 3 is very similar to other games. What sets this game is the addition of new moves and a 2 player cooperative mode, which enables combination of blows and spells. There is also a system of route, which may take longer or not and may be more difficult or not. (I dont speak English yet)

	"For this run I used the characters Kain Grinder, the barbarian and Chronos, the cat man. They have the best outcome in a cooperative way, with greater reach and effectiveness. The damage that they cause your stroke together are extremely high. This allows for rapid progress in the game. I tested some routes and keep going over it seemed to be the best strategy. It is somewhat difficult to hit three enemies at once. Four enemies is even more difficult. In some cases it is harder to make them line up, then have to find the exact point.
