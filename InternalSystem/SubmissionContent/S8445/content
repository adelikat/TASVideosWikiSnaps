	"Xanthiom is an Atari 2600 homebrew game developed by Mathan Games in 2023. The player controls Lieutenant Grisham, on a mission to rid the threats to the galaxy on the planet Planet Coati 5. This homebrew is very much a take on what the original NES Metroid would be like on the Atari 2600 with the limitations therein. I found this to be a pretty fun game and it's short enough that the lack of saving or continuing isn't that big of an issue.

	"I (nymx), during my analysis of 
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/Darkman425

	"'s submission, was noticing that jumping was being affected when hitting the edges of a floor from the bottom. Because of this, I started using it to interrupt my jump so that I could land earlier and continue my progression without the long wait in the air. Well, I did this a number of times in various places and one attempt got me lodged in the floor. At that point, I noticed you can do a 50% duty cycle jump and continue upwards...as long as the floor had another block above where you stood. After I made this discovery, I talked with Darkman and he mentioned that a map existed of the game. I used it to figure out places that would benefit from this glitch and continued cutting large chunks of frames, bypassing lots of rooms towards my next destination.

	"At the beginning of the game, there is a missile to the left. Trying to execute this glitch early failed...probably because of the added abilities of the "Hi Jumps" boots, which probably has the upward acceleration to skip detection and cause this to happen in the first place. If this is not the case, then it might still be possible to perform this early missile grab and cuts another huge chunk of frames.
