Custom parts can be used in 2 or more players battles, though they affect nothing for 1 player mode. To acquire prime "gold parts", players must complete 120 gold cards during 3 hours in-game time, in hard mode.

Also each have 2 custom parts somewhere (except 5th world, in which 1st stage have 1 and 3rd stage have 3 parts).

Others are bomber battles which need pumped bombs to get cards.
