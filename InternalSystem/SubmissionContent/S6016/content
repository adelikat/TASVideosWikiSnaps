	"Loosely based off the plot from the first season of the Japanese anime. Three school girls are plucked from a mundane school trip in Tokyo Tower to save the world of Cephiro. Hikaru, Umi and Fuu must awaken the machines and become the legendary Magic Knights; defeat Zagat and learn the dark truth about the world they've been sucked into.

	"The biggest grievance with the previous submission was the fact the bosses take so long to beat. Thanks to Pumpkin Anakohn for explaining to me how the infinite magic trick works. Better still you don't even need to meet the mana costs to pull off the glitch. Allowing the games most powerful spell to be infinitely spammed. I was aware of the glitch in the Japanese version, but didn't believe it would work in the North American version. However, it turns out that I was't executing the glitch correctly for all this time.

	"I also found a faster way to enter Lair of Truth by accident. I got the idea after watching my previous TAS. While taking to Clef I accidentally left the warp out on turbo. Causing the tiny map sprite glitch when the camera tried to center on the main trio. Taking this into account I tried the same hypotheses on the cutscene after talking to the village chief. Sure enough it worked, but with a complication. You're off screen, and have no way of visually tracking where you are. That's no big deal when you can use a data viewer, but even then it's hard to navigate through an off screen maze. Eventually I was able to figure out how to get back on screen in a timely manner. Allowing me to pull off the Lair of Truth bush clip.

	"For those interested I also did an RTA run for this category. TASing the off screen map glitch helped me immensely, but it still required solid memorization of movements with little room for leeway. It also made me realize how inaccurate emulators are for loads, frame rates and lag.
