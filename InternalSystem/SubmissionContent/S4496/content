	"VOTERS - Please note that I know this submission will get rejected, I do ask that this still be considered...since it is a real run in the Speed Running world (particularly AGDQ 2014). Please vote on the entertainment part and not that it is a submission that will be accepted by the rules.

	"This TAS submission was an effort to improve my previous TAS (4%) of 5:47. This new submission naturally improves by 20 seconds, due to the skipping of the super missile. Another 7 seconds was eliminated because of my continued TAS understanding. So...this new submission was reduced by a total of 27 seconds.

	"First off, I must state that the beginning parts of this TAS was taken from CPADOLF's 100% run. Shortly before the entry into Brinstar, I started modifying it to conform to my run (starting with the first E-Tank skipping). The entry into Brinstar is where my script is completely mine. Efforts from Ivan have helped to make this new improved TAS possible. Ironically, after my first submission...the Deer Tier world started battling for first place again. Coincidence? I have no idea but a few days later...it started. Because of that and Ivan, I have spent about 2 weeks in revamping my older version to create this one that now holds a TAS record of 5:20.4.

	"For those who are not aware...the Spore Spawn is a race to beat the "Mini-Boss" and grab the super missile that it guards. Because of normal sequence breaking, this boss can be skipped...thus saving lots of time for speed-running.

	"TAS Administrator...Please consider this, as it is a Special Category in the Super Metroid world for beating the Spore Spawn mini-boss.!!

	"My reason for creating this version (and the previous one) was to give the speed runners an idea on what a TAS time would be like. The current human world record is 6:09, shared by TwoCat and Behemoth. You may offer it to the Gruefood Delight section, but I have to submit this so that our speed runners can view the record.

	"In timing this category, you must start when Samus steps off her ship (which is +12 seconds). Timing ends when the "Super Missile" is grabbed and the Item Acquisition fanfare disappears . This leaves us with the time of 5:20.4.

	"1. During this remake, improvements were made in various techniques to pick up more speed. One particular item was my inefficient wall-jumping. 
	$LF
	"2. Another item was to manipulate the system until I got the "drops" that I needed to continue on. One way that I accomplished this, was to shoot enemies on a different frame to receive a different drop (most of the time). Sometime this wasn't good enough, so more frames were delayed and thus changed the drop outcome.
	$LF
	"3. Difficulty was encountered during the two round boss fight to make sure that the proper missiles were delivered for a defeating blow. First round...4 missiles. Second round, 3 missiles are injected before the mouth if fully opened. Another 3 missiles are delivered after Spore Spawn stops moving and then is defeated. I find this odd, since two super missiles don't defeat this mini-boss.

	": This run can't be published as it breaks site rules (as outlined in 
	(__wikiLink|4481S|the previous submission)
	"), and the author knows this, yet decided to submit it anyway. This is not what the submission queue should be used for. Cancelling.
