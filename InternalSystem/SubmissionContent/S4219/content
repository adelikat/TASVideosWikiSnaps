	"The original goal of my project was to optimize the old route. I ended up saving 8 frames by heavy optimization, then Inzult reminded me of a time saver, of which I watched a video but forgot it when I worked on the run, in the island maze which saved 89 frames addionally. Even with zero encounters on the swamp this run would only be ~180 frames faster than the current 
	[a class=intlink href=/1082M 
		"published
	]a
	" movie. This run however is 389 frames faster, cause of a new route of which previously was thought to be slower. Inzult did some testing and found out this route is faster, so I redid all of my work and now here it is.

When Link talks to her one frame before she goes inside the house and the timer reaches zero, she will change her direction and goes into a wrong entrance.

Normally it is not the case that left+right is pressed and then nothing, to actually press this button combination it is required to press down on the same frame too. It is also used to change the facing direction of Link. This glitch only moves his sprite not his hixbox and therefore is only used for entertainment.
