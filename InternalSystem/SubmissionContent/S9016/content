	"Finally, I decided to join the crowd and present to you the first "Text Adventure" game for the C64 on this site. While others exist, I am still focused on completing the library of Compute's Gazette games. Here...this game wasn't something that I was interested in, at the time.

Well, that has changed and now here is the finished product.
