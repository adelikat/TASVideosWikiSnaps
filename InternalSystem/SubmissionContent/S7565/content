	"This run improved the published TAS by 1497 frames (24.91 seconds). Unfortunately, the movie doesn't have any notable route changes compared to the previous attempt. All the improvements come only from better optimizations. New routes using recorder warping were planned with multiple possibilities, but I decided that not all of them could be realized. You'll need to get the recorder early to make full use of the glitch, but level 5 is too far away in terms of location, and the amount of keys it takes to complete level 5 is very high. If you visit there before collecting the magical key, it will be noticeably slow as you will have to detour some rooms due to lack of keys. Still, I think it's an impressive achievement to see this run improved by almost 1500 frames over previous run.

	"I don't think these objections need to be handled anymore, as the previous run have already been published without issues, but I want to get its problems straight. Because there may still be audiences asking the same question. Some viewers after watching the run could say:

	"These arguments arise because the game does not officially provide a collection rate. Games that offer a collection rate, such as Metroid Zero Mission, or Donkey Kong Country, can indisputably define the criteria for "Full Completion". For games that do not provide it, however, players have no choice but to arbitrarily discuss on the standard. The same goes for this game. When a run is submitted with such an ambiguous goal, the feedback of audiences plays a big role in the judgement, as far as I know. The previous author, TASeditor decided which items to be included in "all items" as follows, which was agreed by most of the audience:

But the opinion was refuted, as the movie would be boring if it was actually done that way. Imagine going back to the rooms to replenish for 1 rupee of the final blow to Ganon. Almost all viewers would not want such a process, and so do I.

This means that you lose a lot of time if you don't recover enough life until you complete the level, so I came up with a new strategy using fairy counters (0x0627). It's a game system where if you kill 16 enemies without getting hit, the 16th enemy will give fairy as a bonus. Since its value increases immediately when the enemies die, multiple fairy can be dropped at once.
