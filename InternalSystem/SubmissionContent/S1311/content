	"Regarding to 
	(__wikiLink|612S|Bisqwits Speedwalk)
	" recording, i thought it should be possible to do it faster than he. I watched his submission about 100 times to find, where there is a "time" for improvement. I found some, mostly 1-frame-improvement. Soon on recording i noticed, that i forgot about the 21-frame-rule. Nevertheless I TASed it until the end...
