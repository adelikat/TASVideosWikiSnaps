	"So here's how it works!!  We take an old game and each runner does one map or screen!!  Then you submit it to the workbench under the POVERTY name, it gets rejected, someone else rummages through the Gruefood and does another map, and submits it to the workbench!!  And so on!!  It's totally logical!!  Plus Gruefood is hungry and this is an awesome way to make sure he never gets below the POVERTY line!!
