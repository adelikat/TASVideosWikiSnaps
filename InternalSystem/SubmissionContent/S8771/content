	"The most important thing is the attack bug. Jumping after attack locks the player to attack state dealing continuous damage while jumping. Once we start jumping it is best to never stop because otherwise we need to attack again to restart the bug. Sometimes a few steps are needed to adjust the player position so that the enemies line up with the jump cycle.

	"Player starts with 0 karma. If we take sword out when the first monk is visible, then we lose 5 karma which causes harakiri. So we must put sword away and give a coin to the monk to get 10 karma. Now we can kill the monk to reduce lag and move fast with the sword out again. Since we use attack bug we don't need to worry about karma for the rest of the game. We kill everything because it is the fastest way, but we kill more ninjas than monks so total karma stays positive.

	"Enemies can be despawned to the left side when the screen is scrolling to the right. This is used in the final level to despawn the last 2 enemies which saves time when we don't need to make extra attack moves. The enemy positions lined up so that it was faster to take damage than avoid it. The movements look strange because there are invisible ninjas that need to be despawned.

	"If you are willing to spend 1000-10000 rerecords on the final level I think you may find some better enemy patterns to save some more frames. To improve the other levels you would probably need a new movement tech that somehow makes the screen scrolling faster.

	"The balance between executing the "Jump" strategy and walking seems to be right, although I think a lot more effort could probably expose some time cuts. I like the fact that
