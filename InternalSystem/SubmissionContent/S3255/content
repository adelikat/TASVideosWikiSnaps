	$LF
	"Cave of Darkness + Archdemon is generally thought of as the hardest of the three possible paths, so we take that.
	$LF
	"Therefor we need either Hawk or Riesz as the main character; Hawk's intro is about 1.2k frames faster, and he's more or less the 2nd best fighter in the game, 3rd without a certain lvl-up glitch.
	$LF
	"He sports a double attack and decent attack power. He'll class-change to a ninja to gain more atk than the other choice allows. As icing on the cake he gains spells that deal minor damage but at the same time debuff for the same amount a pure debuff would; I only need (or rather want) exactly one debuff: def-down, which he can use later. The optional atk/mind down is covered as well.

[p 
	"Kevin basically has to be taken, in this case as 2nd character; he's the best fighter in the game, no competition.
	$LF
	"Like Hawk he has double attack, but +1 str over him. During night time he can change into a wolf form for a 1/7 atk boost, giving him the highest atk of everyone (at least once he has gained a bit of additional str, early on it's only a very minor boost).
	$LF
	"If he is hit in wolf form, he even gains the +1/3 atk buff for free; saves a lot of items and spell animations.
	$LF
	"And to top it all off he has a glitch that's unique to him, which can basically max out his attack once I get a specific item.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"So with two characters I've already covered everything I want, need and can make use of; Charlotte and Angela are out as they are mainly casters.

	"A class change first increases stats to the maximum of the old class then increases the maximum and allows us to learn new spells; access to a higher level tech is given as well but those should not ever be used. 
	$LF
	"When class changing there are two new classes to change from, both with slightly different max stats, different lv2 tech and different spells.
	$LF

	$LF
	"One double attack is about 1/3 longer than a single attack but hits twice and therefor adds 2 points to the tech bar, getting us way faster to a tech.
	$LF
	"Lv1 Techs on the other hand are all more or less the same in length: twice a single attack; for double attack users those hit twice as well, and without any attack penalties.
	$LF
	"In short Hawk&Kevin get twice fast from tech to tech, while dealing twice full damage on those.

	$LF
	"I "need" max strength as soon as possible, no wait that would be by level 17, I want it at level 7 for the main character and 9 for the others, so let's get just that. This can be done at or directly after Tzenker without massive delays.
	$LF
	"Afterwards we'd want to aim for level 18, that should ideally be achieved near a mana stone or the goddess state in Mana Holy Land to class change soon after the level up; any later than Mana Holy Land isn't advisable as the nearest class-change opportunity would either be a massive back track or at the end of the game directly before the last boss.
	$LF
	"Initially level 18 at Lugar was missed by a few thousand experience, so it was delayed to the next chance which is already the last.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"After leaving Mana Holy Land with class changes and lv 18 we have to face the God Beasts (that name is such an overstatement); so how much experience is to be gotten? Not much. For certain reasons I have to hit level 27 right before the 8th God-Beast; level 26 would work too, but the leeway for experience would be in the single digits.
	$LF
	"The specific reason is that Kevin has to be watched where and more importantly how he gets a level up; he needs to get it in wolf form, else I'd need about 2 minutes longer for every boss I'll still have to face till the end, probably some more, and a few minutes inbetween bosses would be added as well.
	$LF
	"And it's not a good either to *need* Kevin to fight in the rest of the room if he levels up since he'd be down to about Hawk's atk level (with the weapon I gave him) or basically zero (without said weapon).
	$LF
	"This kind of avoid to level up at a lot of situations is what dictates all non-forced fights for the rest of the game.
