	"Its a nice game, where you control a Dino which must defeat the bad enemies in a Tower. You must search in every Stage for a Key, that you can reach the next Stage. After every 8 Stage is a Boss, which you must defeat by throw bones, boomerrangs or use bombs.
	$LF
	"Is use only Bones and Boomerrangs, because bombs takes to much time. Only sometimes I use bombs, when this is the best choise I think.
	$LF
	"You must walk 32 Stages up and then again down. So after 32 Stages you see an ending, but its not the real ending. You must walk down again all 32 Stages. The easie part is, all Keys are at the same position, so most you must not search long for them. Only when enemies dig them out and hide them somewhere else.

	"I found out a trick later in the game, which help me to defeat some Bosses in the half of the time. You must just wait 2 Frames every throw with the Boomerrang, then it hits much stronger and the Boss will defeated in the half of the time or faster.
	$LF
	"For examples: as I hit the 5. Boss as fast as possible it takes me 30 hits. Now I have done it with only 14 hits, because I wait 2 Frames before I throw the Boomerrang every time.
	$LF
	"So its not possible here that I Attack as early as possible, because I lost much time then.

	": I think this is a bad choice for a game. After two levels i watched it at 300% without missing anything, after a while more on full turbo. The gameplay is extremely bland. Get key, walk to door. And then you have to do all the levels again, only backwards. It makes for a very repetitive and boring movie. Rejecting.
