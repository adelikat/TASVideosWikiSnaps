	"Akumajou Densetsu, also known as Castlevania 3 need I say more?, played using Grant and beaten as fast as possible while being very entertaining to say the least. I hope everyone enjoys this awaited run, not that it was in high demand, I know I enjoyed making it. It's really up to you to describe this run.
