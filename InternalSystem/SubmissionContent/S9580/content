	"Frankly there's not much to explain here, the game is pretty straightforward. The only notable bits of tech is that releasing a grapple gives me additional speed so spamming grapples is faster than swinging like a normal person would. Longer hooks tend to break at high speeds (like, literally, it just acts as if I released the grapple myself), so occasionally I refrain from building more speed or intentionally slow down to be able to turn a corner later. Thorns take 2 frames to kill me, so I can bonk on them or jump off them as long as I immediately stop touching them on the next frame. Some flowers require me to come make the return trip before they count as collected (like the underwater one), so restarting from checkpoint isn't an option to skip backtracking.

	"Optimization always feels dubious with these kinds of games, there's simply so many variables to account for with how and where to grapple, how much speed to build, especially with the hook mechanics punishing very high speeds. I am satisfied with how much I optimized the movie but I'm sure if someone really wanted to they could improve it by a fair bit.
