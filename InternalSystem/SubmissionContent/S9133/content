	"Little Lancelot is an NTSC port, made in 2019, of the original NES game The Legend of Prince Valiant, apart from the difference in framerate, which makes this game run faster, there's no other differences with the original, which is why I decided to TAS this version instead.

	"A death is taken on Level 3 for this reason specifically, since the death itself loses some time in the level, but without that live you gain back the time in each consequent score screen. That's the only death that is taken for that reason tho, couldn't find any other. There is one that could work at the end of level one, where if you die after the second bat boss, the scroll continues while dying and puts you slightly ahead in the level, but since dying refills your health, that loses enough time in the score screen to make it counterproductive.

	"On Level 5, there's some spots where I jump off ladders in a weird way that looks suboptimal, this is because you can't jump off ladders if you are too high up the ladder and there's a platform, but if you jump too low you don't reach the platform you are jumping to.

Jumps in this game are short so most of the time its not that useful, in Level 3, for example, there's many situations where it could be useful, but the ceiling is way too low.

[div class=p 
	"This level is one of two shooter levels, in this one, the game scrolls by using the Dist resource, which you get by shooting enemies, or bonuses, and there's also certain enemies that will stop the scroll until you kill them. Enemies also have some RNG as to when exactly they decide to get out of cover, so its manipulated so the enemies that stop the scroll appear as early as possible.
	[br

	"Also, you can only shoot after the reload animation of the previous shot is done, so it's importnat to make the first shot as early as possible and make sure you move the cursor over to the next target to shoot it at the first frame possible.

	"In the bear fight, it could be possible to make the bear stay on the center by making it do the dodge animation, in which you can hit it with the B attack, tho it does less damage than the A attack. This is not worth tho, since when the bear dies, it moves to the left and falls off, so it's better  to kill the bear as left as possible. This fight and the viking fight are done to open locked doors, btw.
	[br

	$LF
	"In the viking fight, it doesn't have that problem the bear had, so if it were possible to make him stay in the center it could be better, but that's not possible, where he moves is not set by RNG, but by where he is and where you are, you can only manipulate the delays it makes and what attacks he does.

	"In this level, when a ship is shot, a new ship spawns on one of the edges of the screen, which ship and where exactly depends on RNG, so its manipulated so a ship that can be destroyed by only one shot and where it can be shot as early as possible appears every time.
