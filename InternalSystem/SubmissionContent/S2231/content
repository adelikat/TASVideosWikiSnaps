	"Speed run of Golden Axe 2 on the genesis, it is a few minutes longer than Golden Axe 1 because you can’t strike enemies that are off the screen, so sometimes you have to wait quite a few frames to let them get closer. The only solution is to keep them in the middle of the screen. I used down-stab most of the time as this is the most powerful move (and hardest to hit with).

	"Game mode is set to Hard, with minimum health, no hits taken.

	"Level 1:
	$LF
	"Very easy, the first enemies are slow and stupid so it is easy to manipulate them and hit them at the same time.
	$LF
	"I used dragon as they can hit enemies out of reach off the side of the screen, and barge faster.
	$LF
	"Mages are easy as there’s so few of them.
	$LF

[p 
	"Level 2.
	$LF
	"I use magic on the first group, pink soldiers are harder to manipulate than others. I don’t use the dragon as that one sucks, and I needed to throw skeletons into pit. Skeletons take a while to die, but are much easier to manipulate than other enemies.
	$LF
	"I hit the main boss twice, one before the magic and again after, glitching through his sword.
	$LF

[p 
	"Level 3.
	$LF
	"Blue group have low hp so die fast. I use the pits as much as possible, until you are forced to carryon.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Level 4.
	$LF
	"Again, I use the pits as much as possible until you are forced to go off-screen. I manage to stab 3 skeletons at once, but when there’s lots of enemies there’s usually one that strays away.
	$LF

[p 
	"Level 5.
	$LF
	"Nothing that interesting here, I use the fire dragon at all times as it can shoot off screen. I have to dance a bit as the AI attempts to separate all the time.
	$LF

[p 
	"Level 6.
	$LF
	"Stab multiple lizards at once, I HAVE to use magic on the large group to keep them contained or they run everywhere. Use all my magic on the Cerberus’ as they have huge hp and are in awkward position. Flame the hell out of the rest of the enemies.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Level 7.
	$LF
	"I force the 2 Cerberus’ together against the pillar and just stab them. I use my spare magic on the next two. Then stab them. Throw skeletons right on edge which is why they don’t fall straight away. Skeleton randomly falls off screen.
	$LF

[p 
	"Level 8.
	$LF
	"Surprisingly easy, just stab.
