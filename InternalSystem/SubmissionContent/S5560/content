	"Most people scoff at the idea of a video game based around McDonald's, however this game was produced by Treasure, the same company that made the games Dynamite Headdy, Wario World, and Mischief Makers.
	$LF
	"Ronald and his friends find a piece of a Treasure map, that leads them on a search, along the way they encounter a Giant Tomato, a Goblin-like alien, and a pirate named Captain Lips, each of these bosses give Ronald a piece of the magical treasure map, which then changes its form and leads them to the moon. They hop on a rocket and travel to the moon, the rocket crashes and they have no way home. Ronald is abducted into an alien spaceship, where he must then find and fight the final boss. The final boss guards the treasure, which was a chest that allows Ronald and his friends to travel home, which is all they wanted in the end.

[p

	": The technical quality of this run looks good. It looks better than the published Expert difficulty run. And as a comparison TAS for Beginner real-time runs, it certainly does its job.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"However, the difficulty setting chosen is an issue here. Choosing Beginner difficulty rather than Expert difficulty skips certain stages/sections, and this affects more than just autoscrollers. Skipping out on stage content is generally a bad reason to pick a lower difficulty, and in this case I don't see it being justifiable enough to obsolete the Expert difficulty run (especially considering the mixed feedback), nor to publish it alongside that run (as the content overlaps too much). Without a viable way to publish the run, I'll have to reject it.

[p
