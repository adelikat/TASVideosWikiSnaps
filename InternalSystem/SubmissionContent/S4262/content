	"There are 3 starting positions for the AI on the first screen, depending on what frame you press reset to start the game on. When you start the game, however, there's about a second long waiting period, and for each frame you wait to hit reset, it adds 12 frames to this waiting period. I was able to route plan well enough to allow for no reset-waiting to happen.

[p 
	"As far as I know, there's no way to manipulate the AI starting positions in the proceeding screens, so the rest of the game is simply just maintaining my speed (slowing down when I need to change 2 lanes) and a good helping of route planning. As I said previously, there's bound to be better routes in this, but I'm not versed in Lua and so can't write scripts to test every single route for me.
