]h3
[p 
	"When Dredd is entering terminal there is centripetal force - 1 pixel/frame aimed at the center of terminal. Exactly in the middle of terminal force is absent, and and he stop there, at least that's how it should be. However Dredd is able glitchly enter into terminals without animation in any point far from middle (execute regular terminals glitch) and the force will not disappear so if keep hold "Up" after exiting terminal this force will continue to slowly move Dredd in this direction further and further... even through the walls.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Whith uisng this glitch is possible fall through the floor, second application is get bogged down a little to the ground and obtain ability to clip through the wall. This glitch require very complicated preparation. Game keep specific valuve about where is a ground in RAM adresses (0x1A8D) - it is our Ground Zero valuve. At first you need to make a jump from a lower possition to set up Ground Zero valuve we need.  No matter what circumstances, but do not jump after (or new valuve will be witten) until reach right place. When you are in in place you need to make jump make a leg kick in the air and hit a celling at the top by head.  And then you will fall down to Ground Zero.

	"Normally after getting damage bosses have period of invulnerability before they can be damaged again. But simultaneous explosion of two grenades is causes of double damage (200%).

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Dredd able to enter in terminal without animation by pressing "up" after kick in the air after jump. Also by using this method, he can enter in terminal in any point of it, not only in middle; Almost always after visiting terminal go in opposite direction, so glitchy entering on the very edge of terminal have double benefit; Well, now terminals glitch have not a double benefit but triple!

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Jumping ladders up is faster than climbing and also jump on top of the ladders to not trigger the animation for climbing up a ladder.
	$LF
	"Climbing ladder down animation took 21 frames before control gain back. In some places at top of ladder have obstacles and faster to not jump down immediately after end of animation, but climbing down for 4 frames and only then jump down, in result Dredd pass horizontal distance while falling.
	$LF

	" ZZ-climbing
	$LF

[p 
	"At climbing up long ladders (which require 2 or more interceptions) zigzag-like jumping from one side to another is faster than simple jumps up at the middle.

[h3 
	" Temporary invulnerability
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"After damage Dredd have short period of invulnerability. Very often is useful to specially get damage earlier and later avoid some new attacks which you can't avoid without slow down without invulnerability. In apogee of this idea you even can hit yourself by ricochet of your own rubber bullet.

	" Cancel the landing animation
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Kick leg in the air at the right distance before hitting the ground. It was used only in old movie but no used in new one.
	$LF
	"I discovered another method shooting immediately after hitting the ground have the same effect. It is 2 frames faster than kick before landing. Such cancels are used hundreds times, so in total it allowed to save significant amount of time.
	$LF
	"One minor interesting moment about ghostbuster gun. New method of cancel landing animation require to shooting after landing, but in one place bring problem because man in the blue cloak with shotgun fire in response. I can't jump here and get this hit without time wasting because i need it to climb down ladder. But if i shoot him from ghostbuster gun he not react. Besides ghosts from dark judges it was only one place in run where use this weapon was useful.

	" Flying
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Used after boss fight in 1-2. Zed shield's attack leads to flying until Dredd will hit barrel or wall. (No more used.)
	$LF

[h3 
	" Diagonal shooting glitch
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"While diagonal shooting pistol while falling, sometimes enemy get damage while real bullet was not touched them. It almost have no application. I used it only once in 7-1 to hit flamethrower operator. Also it accidently happened in 9-2 while i shoot in barrels and hit ladder-man behind me.
	$LF

[h3 
	" Cancel falling from corner animation
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"When Dredd run to end of platform and fall from precipice, before falling he spending a few frames in air very short animation and have less vertical speed when he start falling. So jump into precipice is faster than falling. Beside some rare cases when jump is obstructed it save 10 frames per hole.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"In game there are also exist horizontal ladders. Dredd's survival reflexes says to grab hold it when he jump near such ladders. Leg kick in the air suppress this reflex and allow continue traveling at full speed.
	$LF
	"Also leg kick in air allowed to extend body and get items which unreachable normally.
	$LF
	"It was used once in 9-2 to get armor-piercing bullet.

	"Well, as we know now leg kick in the air is also absolutely necessary part of set up to keep ground zero value in memory.

	"Small route shortcut by Ground Zero Glitch. However to reach upper area of map need to wait platforms, and unfortunately even with new shortcut is not possble to catch previous cycle. And besides, in new route got some extra lags. You can ask what a hell you you doing, why not keep old route? But there is benefit it is possible to kill another (previusly unreachible) robot by rockets and save 3 armor-piercing bullets. And also enough time to get yet 3 bullets, so in total saved whole 6(!) armor-piercing bullets which is priceless. (-1)

	"Unlike most other levels this one was improved purely by old good technics - used armor-piercing bullets to destoy more barrels diagonally.  In my previous TAS this shortcut was not possible becouse of lack of armor-piercing bullets. With new weapon management (remember level 6-2) it became possible. (196)
