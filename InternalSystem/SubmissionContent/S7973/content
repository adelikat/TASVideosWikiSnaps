	"We start out by building up 56 points as quickly as we can. The AI racks up 48 points themselves. Even though mathematically it looks like we should be able to shave off a shot or two in terms of raw points, I was not able to find anything faster with only 53 points instead as the RNG was less favorable at that point and since our input is ended we can't keep manipping stuff.

	"Once we rack up enough points, for the final input we position ourselves to where the AI will just waste massive amounts of time not trying to steal from us, letting us burn down the shot clock after we've already ended input. This eats up a ton of time, which is good since the opponents are not scoring. This is the other reason why fewer points could end up being bad, as it allows the AI more time to catch up and score which in most instances they are rather good at. Let's call this a fluke stroke of luck since most of the other permutations I had tried didn't even win, let alone win by 8.

	"I don't think we need to decide how exactly this movie needs to be obsoleted in the future, because both ending options are usually up to the author. The point about potentially delaying game completion indefinitely through shorter movie input does not apply here, because the game in its nature is still timed, even with the delays that come from how randomness aligned.

[div class=p 
	"Manipulating the game to end sooner within the movie of the same duration as this one, would absolutely make sense to obsolete it. Shortening input, which in turn means more careful manipulation of the future events, also works in my opinion. Delaying movie length to end the game sooner is not so clear, so we'd have to ask the community when it happens. To me, that would be less a impressive achievement. But still, no hard ruling here.
