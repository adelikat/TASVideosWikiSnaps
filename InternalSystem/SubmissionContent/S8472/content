Worse, every time you bump into a tree, you spill some of the gold dust. You must keep your cool-the sheriff's best archers are all around you. You had better find your way to safety.

	"Here is a game that I was excited to play, but when I finally got it typed in, I discovered quickly how annoying it is. I quickly stopped playing this and never came back to it. I think of this kind of game as extremely painful to play, as any speed-running of it would get crushed by the constant RNG nightmare. So....time for a TAS!

You can quickly tell that this game is optimized, by not having to backtrack, which is a virtual impossibility for a human. So, I manually controlled RNG like I do for many other games on the C64.
