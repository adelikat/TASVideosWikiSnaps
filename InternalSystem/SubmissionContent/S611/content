	"This run through River City Ransom is on the Advance ("Hard") difficulty.  I play as Alex.  Throughout the game you must defeat gang members and defeat various bosses to rescue Ryan's girlfriend.

	$LF
	"Unlike Sleepz's run through the game, I do not use a trash can.  Rather, I use a box, a tire, and a chain.  The box and tire are virtually the same (Except the tire can roll away) while the chain is used near the end of the game to defeat the Dragon Twins faster.

	"I die once after defeating Moose to reach Waterfront mall faster.  This speeds up the trip to Blade.  I found no other death that saves time.
	[br

	$LF
	"Also to save time I very rarely grabbed the coins from the bosses.  This is mostly because it's not needed.  Also I occasionally don't pick up an enemy's coin, because it'll vanish before I defeat all the gang members, so I won't have to wait near the body when I could be attacking others.
