After reaching the top of the grave, I release the shield and Link attempts to grab the bush, but since link is not strong enough to grab it, Link is teleported to the bush while keeping the same height and thanks to ISG, we can keep this height and climb the seam where an HESS is done with another bombchu to cross it faster. Note that while making the TAS, a new trick was found and resulted in being able to

		"slower

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- After the Dead Hand battle, we are performing a very time-saving trick which is the Boat Skip: We first perform an entrance point glitch on the sliding door using the hover boots to set the void warp position to where we want. We then get ISG out of a pot which is very fast. I then use again the Twisted Bombchu trick to start a hover very fast. We then reach a tiny spot where Link can go through that causes him to void. After that, I do a simple sidehop, and reach the room with the Boss Door. Using a bombchu and invincibility from a roll, I drop the bombchu and perform a ledge clip after a roll which makes no damage to then be boosted to the loading zone of the Boss Room. This trick is over 1 minute faster than Swordless Link's hover method.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- Because we don't have bombs yet, we can't do the invisible Bongo Bongo glitch that avoids the Boss presentation cutscene.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- After defeating the boss, the Ocarina Item glitch is performed while playing the beautiful intro of the Simpsons to delay the Shadow medallion cutscene. A death is then done at the right time to skip that cutscene.

	" Death Mountain Trail
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"- We start with an A-Slide out of a Tektite. Later, we have to change our direction, so there's 2 ways continue: either do a Z-Slide and keep a high speed, but not be able to change angle afterward, or either loosing a big part of speed (down to -10 instead of -18), but be able to change the angle afterward, in order to reach the Goron Village as fast as possible. Using a bombchu to do a HESS is again useless here because we have to wait for the night to come later, but it must still be fast enough. The big decrease of speed ended up being significantly faster than the Z-Slide.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Goron City

[p 
	"- A megaflip is done on the rope to ground clip and reach the statue without talking to the Goron.

[p 
	"- Here comes a very funny and interesting trick that is the Skulltula Hookshot Jump: I first wait a little bit because night is not yet reached, but extremely close (the waitings before were worth). The Skulltula is then killed, and its token is collected in mid-air with a sidehop during which I pressed the fish bottle (can be any cutscene item) to delay the token obtaining as long as I don't look at the token. I then use the enemies again to reach the flag very fast, then I hookshot the flag at a spot where I look at the token right before obtaining it, so it takes the token. After the text dialog is closed, or if the camera somehow moves, Link is propelled at a height depending on how high the hookshot was targeting. After the Hookshot Jump, I pull out a bomb and do an A-Slide to reach the seam and hookshot the Silver Gauntlets chest and finish with a SuperSlide to reach the Mirror Shield chest. This new method of getting the Mirror Shield is faster, and also saves a lot of explosives that can be used later in the run.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- 2 bombs are used to perform the Boss Key skip. I also take damage from the first bomb and hover with it, because it will be necessary to have low hearts for the incoming cutscene skip. This uses 1 bomb less than in Swordless Link's previous movie.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- During the Naboru fight, I drop a bomb 1 hit before defeating her so the bomb does it. During the bomb timer, I climb the throne and grab the corner of it using a slash right when Naboru is defeated by the bomb. This makes Link clip through the floor with the ledge grabbed, so it just needs to be released to void and skip the cutscene of Noboru's death.

[p 
	"- Twinrova was manipulated so fires 3 times a row, and then once. Currently, nobody managed to get it 4 times a row, which is maybe impossible.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- In the room above Darunia, an A-Slide is first done to get past the fire walls, and also goes through the fire without taking damage, since the A-Slide and the roll makes Link invincible for a short amount of time. This A-Slide is followed by a Z-Slide to change the angle and reach the bigger fire wall where a bomb is pulled to megaflip through it and skip the switch that deactivates that walls. This is followed by a third bomb that is used to blow up the fake door.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- By performing an A-Slide or whatever method that results in a speed of -18 (SuperSlide, HESS) on a corner with a precise angle, we can clip through it, but before this, the angle is changed at the last frame in order to face the Boss Room loading zone and jumpslash to it.

]p
[p 
	"- Volvagia has a hitbox located under the first fire hole that can be reached either by dropping a bomb on the corner of that hole, or either by weirdshoting. The weirdshot is a better way since it saves many bombs and can deal damage faster. Unfortunately, the hammer has to be used at least once to kill Volvagia.

However, since we touch the loading zone right when the game voids us, it wants to put us where we were before the void in the room that we entered.

	"This movie obsoletes a two-hour published movie by 22 minutes, or just over one-sixth of the previous run's runtime. That is a lot of time. In fact, even real-time speedruns have caught up and beaten the TAS' time thanks to newer routes and strategies. In a practical sense the published TAS is well obsolete already, and as a site that aims to provide high quality TAS videos, we do not really want to let such old records stick around, especially when newer TAS records exist. This is a strong reason to publish such a newer TAS record on the site to obsolete the older one, rather than keeping up just the record of the older one.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Additionally, even if the status of this submission were applicable as precedent, it would still exclude many other potential cases. This is an instance of a Mupen64-rr movie obsoleting another Mupen64-rr movie; it does not provide any precedent for accepting a Mupen64-rr movie as a new publication, or accepting a Mupen64-rr movie to obsolete a BizHawk movie.

[p 
	"This movie is not easily reproducible on BizHawk - the run shows expansive effort in maintaining a high technical standard in a 102-minute run of a highly technical 3D game. This run could probably have been made in BizHawk to begin with, but the author did not find that a workable option.

	"The major question here is - how rigid is this rule? We already make exceptions for this through the continuance system, which already shows it is not perfectly rigid. We have exceptions to the rule. Therefore, arguably it is reasonable to make further exceptions, especially if similar situations apply. This movie was started (in its current iteration) before continuations stopped being handed out; the only real difference here is that no continuation was actually asked for. Would this situation and controversy really be so different if homerfunky had made a short post about the production of this run in the continaunce topic?

There are a lot of different things we can do there, and the community members themselves are divided on what they consider the best solution.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"For one, we could hard-line on our rules and accept only that which strictly adheres with TASVideos' goals and aims. That is an option, and a stance that a number of users in the discussion topic have expressed. It makes sense to uphold rules consistently. On the other hand, others don't agree that emulator choice should be the deal-breaker for accepting a run, especially not if it is a high quality run that would obsolete a significantly outdated record that currently exists on the site, and which uses the same emulator to begin with.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The bottom line is - we have a movie which was not intended to follow the rules of the TASVideos community to begin with. Instead it was intended for sharing with other communities. Do we restrict ourself from accepting the movie for our own site if it does not fully fit in our ruleset, or should we leave room for some flexibility in the rules? In the end, I think that the negatives of this movie are outweighed by the benefits that taking it in has for the site and its community, all points considered.

[h4 
	" Accuracy
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Mupen64-rr is a horrible emulator, in terms of emulation accuracy. This is a pretty well established fact at this point. It is also one of the reasons that it is no longer an accepted emulator. The alternative we have for TASing is BizHawk with its Mupen64Plus core. That core is not exactly brilliant either, but it's still an improvement.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There are a few practical questions to ask here when it comes to emulation accuracy between these two emulators. How much of a difference does it really make in this particular instance? In practice, it's not that much - Mupen64 emulates Ocarina of Time more or less correctly, at least with the right plugins. Mupen64Plus in BizHawk provides a general emulation accuracy improvement, but it's pretty marginal in this case. There are no significant dealbreakers or inaccuracies that Mupen64 has here or that the movie relies on. It's not a good situation, but it is a workable situation.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This also ties into obsoletion. This movie is set up to obsolete another Mupen64 movie. Emulation accuracy is not going down, it merely stays the same. It's not an ideal situation, but it is manageable. It would be a different situation if this movie attempted to obsolete a BizHawk movie, or even if the movie did not attempt to obsolete anything.

[h4 
	" Publishability
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Here, we take into account the other reasons that Mupen64-rr was banned for submissions. Aside from the general lack of good TAS tools (like proper memory watching tools, or lua script integration, or other useful features common with today's TASing emulators), it was banned for having

	[a href=/Natt/CaptureHallOfShame 
		"AVI dumping issues

Rejecting the emulator meant relieving this nightmare from the publishing staff (mostly), and they would generally not be happy to have it brought back on them. For that reason alone, I would not have allowed this run to be submitted in a typical case.

[p 
	"Fortunately for this submission though, there is
