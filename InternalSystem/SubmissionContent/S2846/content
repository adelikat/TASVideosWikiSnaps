	": As TASVideos's 
	(__wikiLink|WelcomeToTASVideos#MiionStatement|Mission Statement)
	" says, "Our runs are held to high standards". Not only does this mean that a TAS should have no apparent mistakes, but one should also try his very best to get something as close to perfect as possible. This TAS is filled with mistakes. 238 rerecords is not enough to optimize a 36 minute TAS. Please carefully read 
	(__wikiLink|TASHowTo|this page)
	" and the pages linked from there on how to make a TAS that could be acceptable for this site. Also make sure to post a work in progress on the forum to get some tips before you submit another movie. Rejecting this for being very improvable.
