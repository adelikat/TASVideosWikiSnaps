Each block can give a powerup if manipulated, and so I grab super-speed and invincibility as much as possible.  The big downside is a Zelda-like (but not quite as constant) annoying low-energy beep.  Why the developers thought that this was necessary on the overhead segments, and not the other styles of play, is beyond me.

Also I don't know what this boss is supposed to be, or his twin brother later in the level.  A big, floating, armored...beetle?  I doubt whoever designed this pile even knew.  The designers were approaching the legal limit by this level, anyway.
