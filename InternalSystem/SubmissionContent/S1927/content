	"Here, for your viewing pleasure, is my run of the Lion King for the Sega Genesis. The run itself is 2294 frames faster (38.23 seconds) than the 
	[a href=/354M 
		"currently published run
	]a
	" by Dan. The Lion King is one of favourite games for this console; visually and musically it is one of the most beautiful, the gameplay is very responsive and tight and the difficulty is very high (and misleading for a Disney game). The plot of the game is faithfully (for the most part) based on the movie of the same name. Being a huge fan of the movie and the game I was drawn to doing this TAS and am glad I was able to churn one out. I began this project almost immeadiately after submitting Majora's Mask and was not prepared for how challenging a TAS it would be (this project was very redotastic). The improvements come from a couple of new tricks, new routes, a dash of new glitches, all seasoned with better precision.

	[li 
		" Level One: The Pridelands
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" I jump to grab a ledge about halfway through which saves about three seconds This ledge is insanely difficult to get as Simba's position has to be of an exact value for it to work. This allows me to take a slightly different route up the left side of the level.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				" During the Hyena battle you may notice that I take damage. This means I can get inside the hitbox of the hyena to damage it a few frames earlier when it become vulnerable.
				$LF

[ul 
	[li 
		" Level Two: I Just Can't Wait To Be King
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" After riding the ostrich I press jump for a single frame causing Simba to long jump for some reason. I use this to grab onto one of the higher animals. Saves about three seconds.

[ul 
	[li 
		" Level Three: The Elephant Graveyard
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" There's a secret tunnel about a third of the way through that Dan didn't know about that saves about three seconds.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				" If you jump over the top of the screen the game, for a single frame, thinks Simba is on the ground. There is only one place I can use this but it conveniently allows me to jump over a few Hyenas.

		" Level Seven: Simba's Return
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" One of the most beautiful levels of any game from this era in my opinion. Perhaps a screenshot from here?
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				" Many of the ledges that Dan grabs can be jumped over using a high-jump (jump + attack button).
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				" Dan never glitched past the second leopard battle. It seems impossible because they don't exhaust like normal but after a bit of luck manip I found a way to pull it off.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				" Rolling the boulder near the end can be skipped by a high-jump to the platform.
				$LF
			]li
		]ul
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Level 8: Be Prepared
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" Some of the geysers that Dan takes damage from can be jumped over with a high jump.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				" I tried to make the "boss" interesting. Feel free to skip it...

		" Level 10: Pride Rock
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" Usig a high jump I was able to grab a higher grapple rock than Dan right before the final boss.
