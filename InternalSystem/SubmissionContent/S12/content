	"Anyways, ItŽs The little Mermaid this time. I usually like the Disney games. 
	$LF
	"Chip n Dale and Duck tales among others are really fun to play. Little 
	$LF
	"Mermaid however isnŽt that fun =/. However yet again itŽs a very fast and 
	$LF
	"easy game. Anyone should be able to finish it. But not this fast (I think 
	$LF
	"at least).

	"Well, the controls are a little bad and you'll lose little speed while not 
	$LF
	"swimming in a straight line. I tried to avoid it as much as possible but I

	"think itŽs pretty good anyways. Ah well.
