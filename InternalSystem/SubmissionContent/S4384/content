	": Hello Ambiance 69, and welcome to TASVideos. Unfortunately, I'm rejecting your submission. The movement slows down a lot unnecessarily (which could be avoided with more careful and frequent use of rerecording), which is not helped by the many time-wasting movements throughout the run, such as often repeatedly crouching while running.

	"In addition, this isn't a good hack choice, as the hack seems to offer nothing over the hacks that are published, such as 
	[a href=/2627M 
		"Hard Relay Mario
	]a
	" (in difficulty) and 
	[a href=/1336M 
		"Extra Mario Bros.
	]a
	" (in overall hack quality/extensiveness).
