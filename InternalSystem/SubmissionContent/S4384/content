	": Hello Ambiance 69, and welcome to TASVideos. Unfortunately, I'm rejecting your submission. The movement slows down a lot unnecessarily (which could be avoided with more careful and frequent use of rerecording), which is not helped by the many time-wasting movements throughout the run, such as often repeatedly crouching while running.
