	"In reality, Sweet Home is a seminal horror film and game combo. The film is indeed about a film crew, who visit the seemingly abandoned mansion of artist Ichirou Mamiya with the intention of restoring his paintings and filming a documentary about him and his work. The mansion, as it turns out, is not abandoned, unless ghosts don't count. The game, closely following and expanding upon the events of the film, is often credited with creating the survival horror genre in gaming. The game has been cited as a direct inspiration for the Resident Evil series, and many of the features and mechanics of the game were ahead of their time. Wikipedia says this game has "Metroidvania-style exploration", which I hear is the Dark Souls of exploration!

One is, ironically, the main benefit of the first move glitch: As I explained earlier, the other party members have no collision, so it is entirely possible for them to move into walls while they're desynced, which is at best a significant time loss and at worst a complete softlock. Even if you manage to avoid trapping characters, though, if they get too desynced then you can't open the menu. The game works on a tile system, and I believe every character has to be properly on a tile in order for the menu to open.

Character EXP is stored in two byte offset values per character, and under certain circumstances, when they gain EXP for the second time, it will be written to the value that controls the second bite, essentially multiplying their EXP gain by 255. I believe this is governed by the character who finishes the fight, though not in the obvious way of "the final blow gets the EXP". Emi, for example, seems to never be able to do this. From my testing, when Emi finishes a fight, Akiko will get EXP glitched. If Akiko finishes a fight, Kazuo will get EXP glitched. If Kazuo finishes a fight, no EXP glitch takes place.

	"This is the second big reroute from RTA, ignoring basically every part of the Lake and just move glitching wherever possible. Normally, you need to use Logs to bridge the two-wide gaps over the water and make your way over to a couple boats, where you can sail down to collect the Shovel and then back up to the Monument. In my case... Move glitch, move glitch, Shovel, very big move glitch, Monument.

	"This is the first time where prayer is needed, and it requires a prayer of 28 or higher, which means a character at least Level 7. All we have is Emi right now. Even though Kazuo and Akiko and a second Emi are constantly there helping her in battles, Emi Prime is all by herself on this puzzle. She looks at the Monument, then rubs the Shovel on it, then prays for the loss of her sanity after the quick rub and/or squeezy-squeezy. The Monument, embarrassed, explodes. Two more quick looks and we get the Low Key, which is highkey very important.

	"Move glitching all the way back. Along the way, Taguchi grabs the Low Key from several hundreds of meters away. Normally, when you return to the green statue room from the Lake with the Low Key in hand, you get a cutscene with the mysterious Yamamura, but since this is specifically triggered by the presence of the key, having Taguchi store it means we can skip the cutscene, as he's not in the party that enters the green statue room. We grab the Tool on the way back, grab a Bowgun for later, and rejoin with the party on the 2nd floor. After another fun trip out on the Veranda, we use the Low Key to unlock the door to the Inner Sanctuary and briefly enter and exit to re-align our party. Akiko finally gets her Silver Sword. Hooray!

	"Due to the boulders, this area is the only one in the place with actual game-affecting lag in it. Unfortunately, despite being the precursor to Resident Evil, none of these boulders are punched, just walked through like they mean nothing. This room also contains the first of many mandatory QTEs. The best way of dealing with these QTEs is always to pray. Not only does it always work regardless of prayer level, but it's the fastest of the potential options.

	"Emi disbands the party while they're near the stairs, as her return route is going to be a little different this time. The ice room gets move glitched into. The ice here only pushes you downwards, so the Bowgun we picked up earlier must be used to cross. Move glitching would also be possible, technically, but the area Taguchi has to move around in doesn't quite work out here. This is where we pick up the first of three Blue Candles, required for the final puzzle of the game.

	"Moving through a bunch of maids and down into the depths of the mansion, we pick up the second Tonic since it is quite literally right there and also necessary for the final section of the game. It gets used in the next battle to ensure that the whole party is healed, and also to make sure we have a free inventory space. This is the section of the game where we need a lot of items at once: The final puzzle needs 3 Blue Candles, and the final boss needs 4 distinct items to be used at specific times. Speaking of items, we grab the Two Keys and get spirited away back near the rest of the party.

This is a lot more frustrating than it sounds, as not only does it throw off the RNG for everything afterward, but it also affects textboxes and movement in subtle ways, meaning everything needs to be double checked to ensure no frames are being lost.
