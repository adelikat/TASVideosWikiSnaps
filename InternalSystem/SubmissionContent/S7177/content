	"I guess this is already known, but this platform has a cycle from the moment it spawns. For 3 frames it moves and stops for 1 frame. In order not to be moved in the direction in which the platform is moving, the jump must be made at the moment when the platform stops. I managed to spawn the platform at the exact frame to make the jump without waiting. This and improvements in the previous levels allowed me to save the framerule.
