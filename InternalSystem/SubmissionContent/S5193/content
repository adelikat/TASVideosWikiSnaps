[p 
	"The main reason for choosing to do an all stages run on this version is because it's one of two main categories which utilize the Doppler Skip glitch to offer completely unique content from the SNES version. While an PSX any% run shows off a buster-only end game, all stages shows how the z-saber can be used in the Maverick stages.

	"The 35038 rerecord count on this run is far from accurate. We worked on the majority of stages in this run simultaneously in separate bk2s from the main one, and then hex edited everything together at the end. The 35038 figure comes from only a handful of stages, plus what it took to fix RNG/sub-pixel desyncs. This game version has practically no gameplay lag outside of the Virus climb, so it's very hex-friendly. The intro, Catfish, Vile, Doppler 2, Buffalo, Seahorse, Hornet, and Doppler 4 stages were primarily worked on by Hetfield, with Tiger, Crawfish, Doppler 1, Rhino, Beetle, and Doppler 3 being primarily worked on by Zam.

		" Wall Jumps - Wall jumping animation has a 2 frame delay to it, as opposed to the 5 frame delay in the SNES version. Since wall jumping is optimized by balancing maximizing average speed while minimizing the frames of delay from extraneous wall jumps, more frequent wall jumping is much more effective in this version. In particular, contrary to the SNES version, double kicks are given priority over single wall kicks in static single wall climbs. Here's a

		" Slope Jump Anywhere - When walking down a slope in SNES Mega Man X games, you walk faster and jump higher and faster than if you are walking on flat ground or just dashing in general. This mechanic still applies to PSX Rockman X3, but you can also get gentle-gradient slope jump speed from walking on flat ground. This is useful for getting over ledges that would otherwise require a wall jump. It should also be noted that gentle-gradient slope jumps do not go quite as high in PSX as they do in SNES.

[p 
	"The general idea behind the all stages route is to kill Vile in his secret stage as quickly as possible, obtain Zero's saber from Doppler 2, and then use it to expedite the remaining Maverick stages.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The route we ended up going with initially went Buffalo>Tiger>Vile(in Catfish) and used death abuse to skip the Vile escape sequence altogether, and return to Catfish's stage later with the saber. We actually finished the entire TAS using this route before realizing that it was faster to go Tiger>Beelte>Vile(in Catfish) with the same death abuse. Right around this time, FractalFusion figured out how Catfish's AI worked differently from the PSX version, and showed that you can still 1 cycle him on PSX without drill or saber, which I previously thought to be impossible. This opened up two more potential routes, those being Catfish>Crawfish>Vile(in Catfish) with the same death abuse, and Tiger>Catfish>Vile(in Crawfish) with no death abuse. The Tiger>Catfish>Vile(in Crawfish) route ended up being faster than the other two routes by about 500 and 600 frames respectively, and 843 frames faster than our intial Buffalo>Tiger>Vile(in Catfish) TAS. Even though that run is already obsolete, it does show off saber tech in Catfish's and Crawfish's stages that the submission TAS doesn't, so here is an encode

		" For some reason, I was unable to dodge the spike ball at the top of the Zero climb the way Paosidufygth did in his any% run, even if I copied his inputs from the start of the stage exactly due to the spike ball moving slightly differently. The way spike balls move doesn't seem to be related to global timer or RNG, because I couldn't fix it by delaying frames, so I guess I'll chalk it up to possibly being due to PSXjin emulation error.

		" Glitchman also discovered that it's possible to perform a double Ray Splasher hit with one ammo during the second Vile phase, saving you the time you would have to waste by doing an additional charged shot. This is only possible to do once during the fight, since it has to be done while Vile is jumping from left to right so you can hit him point blank with the first shot and max range from up high on the wall for the second. It can't be done while he is jumping from right to left since the final ray splasher shot fires up while facing left, and you would need 1 more frame of travel time to hit him from underneath.

		" Mosquitus doesn't actually have to reach zero during his death animation in order to blow up, he just has to reach a wall or floor. Under normal conditions, he won't fly close enough to the wall to trigger his explosion, but getting grabbed near a wall and staying closer to the wall than him when he is deciding his next direction will allow for it. Even though the setup for this glitch takes longer to pull off and leaves you further to the left than otherwise, it saves time by completely eliminating his descent sequence. This also gets rid of the single most difficult thing to manipulate in any of the SNES Mega Man X games, since normally during his descent he flies in a random direction once every 4 frames, and you need to get to a place in the RNG sequence with around 30 consecutive favorable directions which usually takes multiple stages worth of manipulation and redoing boss fights.

		" By weapon swapping the frame before you hit the ground while in saber animation will cause your next saber to not come out, allowing you to weapon swap off it at any time, which allows you to do much more optimal wall climbing with saber boosting. Alternatively, if you don't have time to set up a saber whiff, you can weapon swap off any saber jump up to 9 frames into the jump before the actual saber comes out. This type of saber jump is usually enough to get over small ledges that would normally have to be slope jumped.

		" Glitchman discovered a couple of slippery surface movement mechanics in his SNES any% run that aren't been seen in any of the published X3 runs. The first being that if you let go of forward the frame you hit the ground, the first frame of your dash will be dash speed instead of walking speed like it normally is. The second is that if you do a slope jump on ice(there is a glitch in both versions where you can slope jump while moving left on flat slippery surfaces) and leave the directional inputs neutral while you're in the air, you retain a lot of the slippery surface speed, which is a bit faster than normal slope jump speed.

		" Despite already killing them both in their Ultima Weapon form, Bit and Byte come back from the dead just to get a taste of Zero's saber. It saves one frame to fight Bit on this stage since the post-fight dialogue turns you around backwards during the door transition, and you have to immediately jump on the other side of the door anyway(it doesn't waste a frame to dash jump from facing the wrong direction, but it does waste a frame if you have to dash for more than 1 frame after turning around).

[ul

		" Interestingly enough, I've never seen Buffalo's stage have these effects on it before because no other category or route does the bosses in this order. I'm assuming that it is caused by defeating Volt Catfish before Blizzard Buffalo, similarly to how Eagle's airship crashes into Spark Mandrill's stage and takes out the power generator after you defeat him in X1. The differences here are the street lamps flickering at the beginning of the stage, and in the underground room after Bit the lights are on and the ice is melted. Having no ice there actually sucks since I lose 2 pixels with every dash input, and can't do a neutral-dpad ice momentum slope jump up to the left wall before the first ladder and have to settle for a normal slope jump instead.

What he goes for is a somewhat delayed first saber swing, but is just delaying the actual attack animation by hopping in place and using that time to charge. This allows him to fire the next charged buster shot into the boss which allows you to use the saber much quicker than firing offscreen. As far as I can tell, it's not possible to delay the swing nearly long enough to make a large impact in that way, though it was slightly useful in the Buffalo refight.
