	"Zoboomafoo: Playtime in Zobooland was developed by Vicarious Visions and was released in October 2001 for the Game Boy Color. There are 3 difficulties in the game, with each adding one new level and rearranging the goals. In the easiest difficulty, there are 6 levels. The goal of the game is to collect Zoboomafoo's lost friend cards by completing each stage. The game ends after all friend cards have been unlocked. The objective of each level is to either reach one specific goal or to collect a certain number of items.

	"This is because while he is in the air, his speed value is constantly at 2, as opposed to while he is on the ground, where it alternates between 1 and 2.
	$LF
	"We can use this mechanic to our advantage by doing max jumps whenever possible. However, the timing of the jump is important as well. Because Zoboomafoo's speed value alternates between 1 and 2 while walking along the ground, the best time to input a jump is as soon as the speed value reaches 2. The value alternates very rapidly, so there is only one frame to input the jump. Because it's so rapid, it's quite common to do this by mistake. When a jump is input on the ground while the speed value is 2, Zoboomafoo will keep his speed value at 2 for the initial animation of the jump, causing him to slide along the ground a bit before jumping and get alot more horizontal movement.

	"Stages 5 and 6 are the collectible stages, wherein you must collect a certain number of items in order to complete the level. Each time you collect an item a thought bubble will appear, indicating you have collected the item. This bubble stops all movement for 30 frames (0.5 seconds). If you collect the item in midair, upon landing there are 2 frames where Zoboomafoo's speed value is 1. If a jump is input on one of these 2 frames, the jump will come out before the bubble has a chance to load. You can continue to jump during this two frame window for the remainder of the level and skip all of the bubbles from appearing. The tricky part of this is that you must continue to jump for the rest of the stage while collecting all the rest of the items. If you miss the 2 frame window, only one bubble will appear regardless of how many items you've collected. There are 4 collectibles in each stage, but only the first 3 cause a bubble to appear. The final collectible will always end the stage. The total number of bubble skips possible is 6, which saves 3 seconds alone.
