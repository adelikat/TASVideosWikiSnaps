	"Super Mario Bros. 3Mix (SMB3Mix (conventional) or SM3Mix (SB internal) or more simple, 3Mix) is a highly technical hack made by Captain SouthBird (SB) through his own SMB3 disassembly. Developed around the Nintendo Wii era, SMB3Mix is a "3mix" / "remix" of past and relative future Mario platforming titles. Levels remade from Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 2 (USA), Super Mario Land, Super Mario World, Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins, Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels, Super Mario Bros. 3, inspired by Super Mario Sunshine, Super Mario Galaxy, elements from New Super Mario Bros. and New Super Mario Bros. Wii. Yep it missed out Super Mario 64. With the levels remade and gathered in this game, playing through the game is like embarking the Super Mario journey once again. It resonates a wide range of audience from fans who played SMB as a kid to fans who played SMG, being extremely nostalgic. Evident by over 100,000 downloads on Romhacking.net!

	"In vanilla 100%, players couldn't go back in worlds to encounter Hammer Bros in previous worlds. Beating them is required. In this hack, "Hammer Bros" can be encountered as long as the player hasn't beaten Bowser in World 8. But take this situation: a runner going for 100% decides to leave the "Hammer Bros" to be fought along with clearing comet levels, but it isn't possible. The run would be invalidated if the rules explicitly specified all "Hammer Bros" are required. Considering the shear amount of run an unofficial game gets, such a rule would reduce the amount of verified runs on the site. Therefore, they are not required. But another thing is, they are required in individual world 100%. In this case, it should be intuitive that every level and "Hammer Bros" must be cleared before the finishing the world with the last stage. It may seem like a double standard, but it is, and I can't do much about it. This movie encounters all "Hammer Bros" before leaving the world for the sake of completion, to match the public standard of "completion", 
	[del 
		"and to avoid redoing everything as I am deep in the movie by the time this is clarified.

There aren't any Penguin Suits available between 4-F1 and 4-F3. Therefore, after playing 4-F1, a Penguin Suit is brought all the way from 3-F1 to 4-F3.

For doors on the lower deck, have full speed. For doors at top left, ideally have high upwards and low leftwards velocity. The key is to do a 48jump on the last frame. But that means horizontal velocity would be very high. But if Toad rubs the left boarder of the screen, it drops to 16 or lower so I had it set up to have -48 which becomes -16 when the screen rub kicks in. For top right, it is trickier. 48 becomes 0 instead of 16 so I had to make the jump 1f earlier.

	"My bad time management skills add to the already long "working" hours, causing me to be sick - messing up sleep schedules and made eyes allergic and redden. But man I want to get this done in no time. It is so motivating to see myself closer and closer to the finish line. It is difficult to strike a balance between health, studies and TASing, thus my nickname in Discord server, formerly "yes homework no tas". I tried to archive this project until I finish the public exam 9 months later, but the break only lasted for 3 months. I even halted in an autoscroller to try to give myself reluctance to resume. But I believe someone is waiting for this to be done. I want it to be done soon as well. And here I am, having TAS and other parts of my life in parallel. I considered inviting others to contribute inputs. But then I want to ensure everything is in my control - I would go through them, modify undesired parts. Therefore, it is not practical for me. Maybe it isn't that bad? I don't know. Seriously why did I chose such a bad time to work on this? I am soon taking the most important examination in my life. It determines my career. Still I prioritise this over revision. On 19th March 2022, I rushed through 0-2 through 0-BC and finally finished! It took less than a year - to make the first draft...

I entered a community college, which is better than nothing. I made my last push during the summer vacation, made it to World 7. Progress drastically slowed down after. I have only completed 1 World in 6 months, leading to my nickname "3mix procrastination". With other projects joining in, 3mix is not going anywhere.

To me, the most annoying section is World 5 Comet, where everything is influenced by RNG (Albatoss, Angry Sun) and they affect lag as well. And when I reached 3-4P I just realised it is impossible to have a good start (get P speed and not take damage) without using a penguin. Because of this, I had to change back to getting a penguin instead of a boomerang, which means I am entering a mushroom house of a different world. I had to do extra resync from World 6 to 3.
