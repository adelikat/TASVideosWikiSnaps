	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"The game is based on the 1940 Walt Disney's animated musical fantasy film, based on the children's novel The Adventures of Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi. It is story about anthropomorphic piece of wood which dreamed to become a real boy.

	"I never played this game earlier, but when i saw it in workbench two weeks ago i immediately loved it. After few days of research/testing i found that many things can be improved and soon decided do my own TAS instead of helping to previous author.

	"This movie is 1 minute and 33 seconds (5598 frames) faster over last (rejected) 
	[a class=intlink href=/4458S 
		"submission
	]a
	" by gamerretro2. Improvements come thanks to better routes planning, sequence breaks, small shortcuts, usage of damage boots and heavy luck manipulation (a lot of luck manipulation), besides many time was saved just thanks to more precise optimization.

[p 
	"Unfortunately in this game still there are two long sections - dancing sequence, and auto scroller level at the end, these two sections nearly identical unassisted gameplay. But despite of these disadvantages, i hope this run still can be entertaining enough, because all others levels are quite interesting for speed run (particularly for tas), at least i enjoyed optimise them.

	"All butterflies have random generated starting position. I focused on the first butterfly. (How soon you be able to do first hit). Between best and worst first butterfly pattern about 40 frames difference. I used input of first level to set up the best pattern.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"After getting damage butterfly become invulnerable for some time and fly fast in opposite direction. Butterflies choose fly to right/left (depend from which side you strike them) usually with negligibly small vertical component ~+/-15 degrees. However possible to manipulate and force butterfly to fly up/down, it allowed to kill the first 2HP butterfly faster.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Second butterfly 3HP is enough straightforward. Level have fixed end point, no matter where you finish level, shortly after you kill last butterfly you lost control and game will auto-walking to this point. So at fight with the last 4HP butterfly is significant to finish as close to end point to minimise time of traveling to it.

	"At railway i found two time saving shortcuts one big = 13 seconds and one small about 2 seconds. Small shortcut is easy to execute, but big one is enough tricky. Problem is that if Pinocchio is fall down during some, soon time dark screen will kill him even if he reach another wagon. But if while falling Pinocchio will collide with obstacle Deadline of "dark screen of death" will be extended and it this extended time is enough to reach another wagon before dark screen and to do sequence break.
	$LF
	"At firework i saved a lot of time (even more than on railway). Goal of battle at firework is to collect 6 items as soon as possible. After each fireworks exploded item can appear or not appear. Obviously with luck manipulation 100% result with 6/6 success can be done, it not hard for TAS; Real problems start when you try to choose WHICH 6/6 pattern is the best? Between ultra-super-mega-lucky 6/6 pattern and average 6/6 pattern a few hundreds of frames difference. It was real nightmare to choose best one. Besides guy below also can't be ignored, his behavior is random as well and this bastard can extend end of level up to 100 frames if he decide to start new animation cycle when all 6 items was collected (do not be worry, he not did it).

	"New route to reach the top faster. Last hit to boss should be done while standing not while jump ~10 frames to decrease auto walk distance to the precipice. (During rotation while standing on the ground Pinocchio is moving forward without input when control on him is lost.)
