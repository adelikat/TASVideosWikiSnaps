	"Beauty and the Beast is a 1982 Donkey Kong like game made for the Intellivision.  Despite what you may be wondering, this game predates the 1991 Disney film of the same name.  It instead stars the player who's girlfriend was kidnapped by Horrible Hank, who I can only assume is the beast.

	"In this game the goal is to reach Horrible Hank at the end of each level, to climb up you must go to windows that are open.  Hank will throw barrels at you (where have I seen this before) and your girlfriend will send you hearts that make you invincible for about 3 seconds.  Rats will also randomly spawn in places.  if you walk too far off the edge of the building you will start at the very beginning of the game.

	"This game has some brutal RNG to it. I had done 2 run-throughs of this game before any other attempts I made did not save any time.  I would save like 5 frames in one stage but would end up losing 30 frames by the time I got to the end of the game, so I believe the RNG that I got in this movie is as good as it's going to get.  I am also certain that there are no difficulty loops in this game, the speed is not noticeably faster and the stages do not differ depending on how far you are, the spawn of the windows and of falling objects are only dependent on RNG.  If anyone can prove this to be wrong then I will happily play the game until it can be completed, but as far as I could tell, nothing was different.
