	"As one would expect from an RPG, luck is involved with this TAS. However, it is limited to these 4 specific cases:
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" Blocking an attack : There are 3 types of physical attacks : front attack, side attack and back attack. The odds of blocking these attacks are respectively of 10%, 5% and 0%, and these odds may slightly vary depending on the attacker's and defender's Agl stat. Magic attacks can't be blocked.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Characters' stats boosts : The base stats of a character (HP, MP, Atk, Def and Agl) are all solely based on his current level and class, then a "boost" to each stat is applied and can increase or decrease it by up to 3%. These boosts are only updated when leveling up and so they were manipulated as often as necessary.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Status inducing attacks : Some enemies (all bats and chapter 2-2 enemies) have a decent chance of paralysing or poisoning their target, which should always be avoided.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Mages with 2 spells : Later in the game (starting with chapter 4-5), some mages will have 2 usable spells. Each enemy phase, the game will first randomly choose one of these 2 spell, and then act accordingly to this choice (if there is only 1 of the spell that the mage can cast on my units, the game may still choose the other one and thus not make any action at all).
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"Apart from these, there is no luck involved. In particular, the A.I. will always react the same way to the same situation, and the damage done by an attack will always be the same (there is no critical hit mechanic).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The game use the "default" PSX RNG, and the only way to manipulate an action is to wait.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Every unit has 1 out of the 7 classes of the game : Knight - Archer - Airman - Armor - Mage - Priest - Monk
	$LF
	"The rules are basically that Knight > Archer > Airman > Knight, Armor has high defense and HP but low magic resistance and movement, Mage and Priest have high magic resistance but low defense, and Monk is an hybrid class with average stats and no strength or weakness in particular (decent mobility though)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There are 12 recruitable units (you can't miss any), and each of them can be promoted 2 times when visiting a dojo in any city, when they reach level 10 and 20 (Ash can also be promoted a third time after doing a serie of side quests).
	$LF
	"All characters but Ash have 2 paths choice when promoting for the first time : knights can choose Knight or Armor, archers can choose Archer or Airman, mages and priests can choose to keep their class or to go for Monk.
	$LF
	"Even with the same stats, a promoted unit is far stronger than an unpromoted one.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Damage dealt with a physical attack depends on the attacker's class and Atk and the defender's class and Def. 
	$LF
	"It is increased when doing a side attack or (better yet) a back attack, attacking from a higher height (decreased if attacking from a lower height), and if you have allies next to the target (the more the better).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Damage dealt with a spell depends on the attacker's level and the defender's class and level (no other stat involved). Unlike a physical attack, you can't increase or decrease the damage with any other factor.
	$LF
	"The calculation is a little weird as the higher the attacker's level, the less damage he will deal (so you are encouraged to use the latest spells you learnt, also apply for healing spells)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"You need 100 experience points to gain a level, and the amount you gain depends on the amount of damage you dealt (one of the strong point of the mages with AoE spells) and on your current level compared to the expected level for the chapter (when attacking an enemy) or the target's level (when using a spell/item on an ally).
	$LF
	"There is no limit to how much experience you can get at one go, and an underleveled unit can easily catch up with the rest of the army any time by doing cheap damage or healing an ally.
	$LF
]p
[h4 id=Level-upexploit(unused) 
	" Level-up exploit (unused)
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"As said before, the more overleveled you are in regard to a given chapter, the less attacking an enemy will give you experience, but using a spell/item gives experience based only on the difference between the user's and the target's level, and a unit can target himself.
	$LF
	"However you can only do so as long as you have items to use (limited by money and inventory space) or enough MP to cast spells.
	$LF
	"The trick is that in some chapters (the earliest and most convenient one being chapter 2-4), there are magic circles which restore some HP and MP every turn, so a priest can stand on one of them and cast on himself a spell like Mystic Shield and gain a non-marginal amout of experience.
	$LF
	"Here is a video of what it looks like : https://youtu.be/AnyA7PHNV4w
	$LF
	"So you can get 16~17 xp every 20~25 seconds
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The main purpose of getting overleveled would be to get Eleni and Zohar to Lv25 to learn the strongest black magic spell and kill large group of enemies with it in the mid game (more or less from chapter 2-5 to chapter 5-3, though it would arguably be useful only for 10 of these chapters). Now I didn't use this exploit first because I don't think it's faster than the normal way, especially for a TAS. Sara would need to spam Mystic Shield for 34~42 minutes (and also the chapter would need to be done differently, costing some extra minutes) to get 17 level-ups, and I doubt it could be compensated later on. The second reason is obviously because it would be extremely boring to watch (in fact all the numbers I gave previously are estimates because nobodyhas ever speedrun this game using this exploit, that's how lame it is).

The RNG manipulation in conjunction with the appropriate strategies result in very fast victories that can't be rivaled by RTA attempts, which is satisfying to see. It also helps that the game features diversity in the battle situations and the relative approaches adopted. The game does also feature a deep plot, which helps with keeping interest towards the development of the events, even if having breaks while watching.
