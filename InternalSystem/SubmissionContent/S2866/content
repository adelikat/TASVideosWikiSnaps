	"This run uses (J) version ROM. The reason that is 9th stage "Fantasia" difficult is very different between (J) and (U). In (U) version's this stage, there are many guardrails that prevents sliding off the track. So (J) version is more difficult than (U).

	" Spin Turbo
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This is very important technique for saving time. If player keep on doing drift a certain amount of time, it would spin as a penalty. In the second time of spinning, player can get high speed by pressing acceleration button. But acceleration direction is decided player's direction at timing pressing button, so it is difficult to efficient use this by human power.

	"Normally in this game, player is attacked about five times at least by Magic Stone or Ability in 1 race. (excluding earlier courses) In this run, I minimalize opponent's attack by Luck Manipulation.

[p 
	"In 9th stage rival is Bahamut. His ability "Mega Flare" gives terrible damage to all opponents. It is impossible to prevent using this ability, and opponents  can't guard or avoid this attack. So in this run, I relieved this damage by absorbing smaller damage instead at the last minute.
