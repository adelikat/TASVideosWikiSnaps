	"First off, I want to give credit where it's due. CPADOLF's 100% Super Metroid TAS is the basis of my script until the skipping of the E-Tank. My submission of this TAS was to satisfy my curiosity of a TAS time for the human ran category of Spore Spawn RTA. To date, Ivan holds the record with 6:28. This TAS demonstrates a 41 second improvement over the human record effort. It includes the Bomb Torizo skip, which saves roughly 20 seconds...leaving me with 27 seconds shaved off due to my own scripting.
	$LF
	"The timing for the RTA starts with Samus on Zebes. By the time Samus steps off of the platform of her ship, the timing will be 12 (or 4:26 from start of console) seconds. This is confirmed by observing the timing rules for the human ran event. Ending this off, the timer is stopped once the item acquisition is completed on picking up the Super Missile (10:01). 10:01 - 4:26 + 0:12 equals a TAS record of 5:47.
	$LF
	"To date, I have never found a TAS for this category on any website. Even though my TAS skills are not as strong as other runners of this game, I believe I have written one that should attract attention and bring forward more writers of this category. This entire effort has taught me a lot and will most likely "spawn" another revision to reach a sub 5:30.

	"Some items that I include was super fast wall jumping, falling wall jumping, and stationary wall jumping. Speed techniques include arm pumping (advances Samus 1 pixel each time she pumps), damage boosting, Bomb Torizo Skip, pixel manipulation to collect needed items.

[p 
	"One thing that I want to improve on is frame manipulation so that I can get items without having to "farm" for missiles. Another thing that I see will be a huge improvement, is the discovery of a one round kill on the Spore Spawn.

	": Hi nymx, and welcome to TASVideos! This run is a neat concept demo (with nice execution), and it's worth attention, but we can't publish it here officially, because it doesn't beat the game, and the entertainment value it has because of that is too low to publish it as a new Super Metroid branch (while there are 
	[a href=/Game/snes-super-metroid 
		"7 of them
	]a
	" already). However, to keep it public in a way, we'll put it in Gruefood Delight, and I also have added YouTube module and MediaFire link to the submission. Rejecting. Someone please add it to Gruefood Delight page!
