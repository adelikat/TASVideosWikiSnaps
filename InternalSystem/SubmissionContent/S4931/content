	"Liquid Kids came out in 1990 on the Arcade and was ported to the Pc Engine by Taito, in 1992. This colorful game, filled with huge sprites, stars the strangest animal in the kingdom. The platypus... Hipopo journeys through 7 stages to rescue his girl, Tamasun, while saving other friends at the end of each level. Armed with water bombs, he can soak enemies and ride waves to gain a bit of speed. Warps are used, in this run, in order to unite the couple as soon as possible.

	"This game is very straight forward. You can use waves caused by your own projectiles to gain speed. Holding the fire button creates bigger bombs that causes longer lasting waves. You will notice, when jumping down to a lower level you lose horizontal speed. The train item gives a speed boost for every one you find and will last the rest of the stage.
