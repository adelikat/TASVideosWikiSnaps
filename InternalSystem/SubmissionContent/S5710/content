This run skips learning about the data cartridge from the dying scientist. It skips obtaining and later reading said cartridge to get the self destruct code for the Star Generator. (Side Note-these actions were made necessary in the VGA remake via copy protection/RNG means.)  Thankfully, Roger only obtains the keycard necessary to access the lower levels of the ship and escape.

In this version of the game (v2.2) an in-game cheat was added to help players with the slots (The developers realized it was insanely hard/time consuming otherwise).  Typing "holy shit" while using the slot machine allows the player to select the next sequence of slot symbols, drastically reducing the number of spins necessary to reach 250 buckazoids.  If this would be deemed acceptable, it would drastically shorten the run by (mostly) eliminating a rather boring sequence and negating the need for RNG manipulation at this portion of the game.
