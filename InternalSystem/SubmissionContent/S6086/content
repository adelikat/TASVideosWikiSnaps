	"One of the biggest issues with C64 TASing is load times.  The first major chunk of any game from a disk or tape based media is going to be a long, very boring loading sequence.  This submission presents a method to minimize this loading time and shorten overall submission lengths.  Should this method be accepted by the staff/community, it will provide the potential for many future C64 TAS submissions to be shorter than they otherwise could be.

	"Background on how this submission came to be:
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"I had previously known of various programs in existence that convert C64 tape images to disk images.  
	$LF
	"I thought that doing this with any games which I could only find in tape image format would save some time, as tape loading typically takes longer than disk loading.  
	$LF
	"Then I thought 'Why stop there?' and wondered if there were any programs available to convert from tape/disk to cartridge format.  
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I found some.

	[a class=extlink href=https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/EasyFlash rel=nofollow 
		"EasyFlash
	]a
	" is a C64 compatible cartridge that can be flashed with .crt game/program images and then used in a real Commodore 64.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"A program called Disk2EasyFlash is able to convert some (but not all) disk based games into cartridge format.  For games where this is possible, doing so yields a cartridge image that can be flashed to the EasyFlash cartridge (or in our case, used in BizHawk).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"While normal cartridge games start instantly with no load time, games converted to cart format using Disk2EasyFlash still retain a loading phase before the game starts.  
	[em 
		"However, this load period is drastically reduced compared to loading the game from the original disk image.
	]em
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"To test the theory/method of converting disks to cart for use in BizHawk TASes, I contacted adelikat to find out exactly which disk version of 
	[em 
		"Batman
	]em
	" he used for his run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Using the same disk image, I confirmed that his original inputs (made in BizHawk 1.13.0) synced in BizHawk 1.13.2
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I then converted the disk image to EasyFlash cartridge format and loaded the new cart image up in TAStudio.  As expected, the load time was shorter, so I copy/pasted adelikat's inputs from where he first takes control of Batman.  The rest of the run synced perfectly without any necessary alterations.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"To me, this was proof of concept for converting from disk image to cart image.
