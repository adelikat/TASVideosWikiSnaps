	"So, a new Gex submission from me. Originally, I felt I should make an improvement of my Gex 64 run, but to be honest I only had enough motivation for one more Gex movie and I really wanted to do this. This has been a strange project for me; I recorded a test run over a year ago and just picked it up every couple of weeks and TASed for a few hours. Eventually I got so far into it that a few months ago I decided to take it all the way. Looking over the movie I like this more than the run of its predecesor. Technically it's considerably more optimised (due to some nice techniques, see below) and for the most part more entertaining. I managed to save some nice time on my first version (the test run) and finished comfortably under 55 minutes. If you know this game (which I hope a few of you do, it was reasonably popular in its day) then this is a very nice time. This is a long and difficult game so sub-1 hour was cool.

		" Note 2: There are a couple of differences between the N64 and PSX versions. Firstly, in the PSX version, after gaining the first remote in each level there is an FMV of Agent Xtra hsving a banterous two-way with Gex. The N64 can't handle these FMVs so after the first remote of four levels (mystery, tut, western, fairytale) Gex has a pixelated two-way with her in mission control. Unfortunately, this resets Gex's position to mission control meaning I have to get back to these levels to continue. Hopefully this doesn't affect the entertainment too much. Secondly, the Mythology Network is completely different (and better) in the PSX version. This project was already 70% complete before PSX TASing was possible so I continued using the N64 version. For the record, if anyone tries to improve this please do so using the PSX version, even if it is longer due to these changes. You have my blessing for that to obsolete this should this run be published and that run be made (the same goes for Gex 64).

	"Not quite defeated after his tool assisted ass-kicking in Gex 64, the evil Rez has returned. This time he has kidnapped the do-able Agent Xtra (played by Marliece Andrada) in order to pull Gex the gecko back into the media dimension to rescue her (personally I think she can do better). The media dimension is split into four areas (mission control, lake flaccid, slappy valley and funky town) and Gex must collect 30 remotes across the television channels in each of these areas in order to access the final confrontation with Rez. This game has huge amounts of variety and the different scenarios give Gex some nice new powers.

	"A quick word on the controls. One problem with Gex 64 was that it had only 16-direction control, it is slightly better in this game. At the beginning of the run, in the menu, I change the controls to 'precise', this is still not full analogue though, but by using this in combination with the manual camera (C-directions) I can get pseudo-analogue control. The gameplay should look a lot smoother than in the Gex 64 run, but it is still looks slightly jagged in places, especially in parts of the game where I don't have full control of the camera.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"For example, if I want to move up I would press R + A on the first possible frame upon landing. If I want to go diagonally upper left I would hold the joystick in this direction from the frame I leave the ground on the previous flying kick and then press R + A on the frame I hit the ground. To get somewhere in between these two directions i would hold up until the frame prior to that I hit the ground and on the subsequent frame hold the joystick to upper left and press R + A. To get even tighter the C-directions can be held in the required direction for two or three frames prior to the penultamate frame in order to skew Gex's position that way. Watching the input during the run may be helpful to understand how this works.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"As in the previous run I regularly use a trick that allows me to use a higher tail jump without jumping first. This can be done by interupting a flying kick by coming into contact with scenery or an enemy. In this run I found another use of this trick. When using a flying kick to get on top of a ledge, if you flying kick on the earliest frame and Gex just grabs the ledge, this for a single frame will interupt the kick allowing you to initiate a tail jump immeadiately.
