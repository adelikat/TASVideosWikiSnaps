	"Every 5:th, 15:th, 25:th, etc., coin you pick up, will turn into three milkbottles. These will give you some extra points. Every 10:th coin you pick up, will turn into a heart. If you pick up this heart, you will transform. Each new transformation has a better attack power than the previous.

	$LF
]h3
[div class=p 
	"The normal levels (non-boss level) were very hard to improve. The only thing you can do to cut of some time, is to reduce lag, which there really isn't much of. On most levels, I'm probably exactly as fast, or just 1-5 frames, faster than Walker Boh. This is because there isn't anything you can do to move faster. So the real timesaver in this run is the boss fights.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The bosses, on the other hand, were improve quite a lot. By transforming myself once before the boss, and once in the boss' room, I was able to kill all the bosses in less hits. This saved about 2-3 second for every boss, besides the last boss, who was killed about 10 seconds faster than in the current run.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The reason why I get hit before the boss dies, is because if you're still transformed after beating a boss, your hearts (in the top left corner) will count down, wasting several frames.

		"In the flying levels, the airplane movies slightly faster than the other forms. This is why I transform into the airplane on the flying levels, even if there's no boss on that level.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Another optimization thing, is to walk on platforms when they're moving in your direction. This was used as much as possible in this run.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"You can actually become invulnerable to enemy attacks if you attack in mid-air right before you're about to get hit by the enemy. This doesn't save any time, but is quite a nice trick. This is why I sometimes attack without hitting anything, because if I didn't attack, I would get hit by the enemy and die.     
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Sometimes the game lag's when a heart turns into three milkbottles. I try to avoid this as much as I can in this run. The lag is usually only 3-4 frames, and it can be avoided by getting the milkbottles of the screen as soon as they appear.
