		"(B)
	]b
	" released in 1995 by Tectoy for the Genesis/Mega Drive and for the Master System. There are 2 modes on the game: Fácil/Easy (this movies', 5 levels) and Difícil/Hard (Enemies act differently, there are more levels and some levels have another layout). The game has no known Warps/Passwords/game ending glitches, and the Easy mode is the fastest, due to having less levels.

		"The Smedley Crit

	" (by beaking him, and quickly beaking the squirrel on the tree to drop a hazelnut on him, Smedley's damage animation doesn't play, saving some seconds and letting you beak him again, so you can do that over and over), and the 
	[b 
		"Wally Early Damage

	" (the game didn't intend you to beak Wally from behind before he stops in a barrel, unless you're inside a barrel just behind him. Sadly, it's only possible to do it once).

	[b 
		"Damage Cancelling
	]b
	" (While you're about to get damage from an enemy, you can press B to beak it, even if the enemy isn't affected by your beak, you doesn't get any damage), 
	[b 
		"Invencibility Abuse
	]b
	" (the game was programmed to let you have some few seconds of invencibility after being damaged, and if you time it right, you can get damaged on purpose to just breeze through some enemies and not get damaged at all) and 
	[b 
		"Beak Deaceleration
	]b
	" (After jumping, Woody plays a 10-15 frame animation of him getting up after the jump, but if you beak the air right before you land, that animation doesn't play).
