The game accepts some inputs on every frame (for example in nickname menus), some (in the overworld) every other frame, and some (primarily in textboxes) every 3 frames. GB/GBC games play back at approximately 59.7275 Frames Per Second.

	"(Current HP * 48 / Max HP) < 10).  Being in red bar cancels level up jingles when in trainer battles (worth 2.5 seconds per level up) cancels death cries (40 frames per death) and cancels text box clear jingles (timesave unknown, around a frame per clear).  In Pokemon Blue it has the additional benefit of canceling pokemon cries when sent into battle, which changes many routing decisions including the Gastly fight after the heal pad.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Gen 1 Miss = An oversight in the code for the accuracy check causes moves with 100% accuracy to still have a 1 in 256 chance to miss/fail.  This means that we can cause an enemy to miss even if they're locked into using a theoretically deadly move, or miss our own moves if we need to.

	"DSUM = A label for the predictable outcomes caused by deterministic behavior of the random number generator.  This behavior leads to an encounter cycle which constantly loops through the ten encounter slots in order.

[div class=p 
	"Consecutive Input Delay = In Gen 1 Pokemon, if you press a button it needs to be released for a frame in order for it to be pressed again, otherwise the game will just see the button as being held the whole time.  This can be counteracted via a trick to reapply the relevant button press.  The key is to press a different button (typically a directional button) on the same frame that you want to press the initial button again, it will register a 2nd press of the initial button and not a hold of the initial button.  This is done when a directional input is used to reapply B while exiting shops (which can be done in RTA) and to reapply up/down in the item bag.  The Fly menu does not have this trick available as it does in Yellow.  The trick is also useful when B reapplies A to get on the Bike (also used in RTA), to deposit pokemon (not useful in RTA), and to throw a poke ball from slot 1 (used in RTA).  In general it could be used to select any slot 1 bag item in the overworld or in battle, but the relevant ones are the poke ball throws and the bike.  In Blue unlike in Yellow, some A presses to use items can be applied the same frame as an up or down press.

[div class=p 
	"Ranges = The damage formula in Pokemon Gen 1 is modified by a random number, rerolled until it lands between 217 and 255 inclusive. The move is multiplied by this number and divided by 255 to obtain a range of possible damage between ~85% and 100%.  Because we manipulate random number generation, we can manipulate these damage ranges to our liking.  Also, because of the way much of the 8 bit math rounds down calculations, the full calculated damage is only a 1/39 chance (217 to 255 inclusive is 39 possible rolls).

[div class=p 
	"Glitchless = the category this TAS was written for.  I followed the RTA Pokemon Speedrunning community's ruleset for Glitchless, so while arbitrary code execution glitches like Brock Through Walls and Trainer Fly are disallowed, certain glitches that are not avoidable in RTA such as Gen 1 Misses are allowed, as well as oversights such as using Poke Doll on the Marowak ghost in Lavender Tower.  The Instant Text obtained from talking to the Bike Shop owner without a Bike Voucher falls under the allowed oversight category.  This ruleset is uncontroversial in the RTA community at this point.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Note: This TAS came about from the result of two previous efforts.  First there is a somewhat improvable TAS of the JPN release, whose times are not easily comparable due to the text differences and the major route changes from not using instant text or the poke doll on Marowak.  Last year I adapted the strategies from that TAS into the ENG release using current category definitions and game knowledge.

	"I'm very proud of the Alakazam fight here.  The fight requires manipulating a 4 turn thrash on Kadabra (1 in 2), 2 crits on Mr Mime and Venemoth (1 in 6 each), Psywave use from Alakazam (1 in 4), Psywave exact damage (1 in 64 because damage is from 0 to 1.5x level), and then another thrash crit (1 in 6).  Getting all this means you never need to take damage again for red bar through the rest of the run.

	"The frame count of this TAS will make it appear to run longer than it actually does.  You can see this in the commentary/console verification playback, the TAS actually runs at 1:29:35 from bootup to last input.  How is this possible without the TAS desyncing?  It turns out that frames do not actually exist on the game boy while the LCD is disabled, and the emulator's counted frames during this time can last a shorter than usual number of CPU cycles.  For console playback we sync the inputs by CPU cycle count, and using the total executed cycle count obtained from the emulator instead of frame count we get the same time as the console playback at 1:29:35.
