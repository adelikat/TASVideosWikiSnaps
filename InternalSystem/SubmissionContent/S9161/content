	" on each hit and the nerfs on some of Kirby's abilities in the US version would make it initially seem slower. However, the fact that there are no regional changes in Kirby's movements thanks to better understanding of regional differences, the more aggressive opponent AI in the US version leading to faster strats in most cases, the use of intentional deaths to cut down time across the run by removing the No Miss bonus, and general optimization improvements throughout makes incredibly impressive. It also helps that there's a better understanding of the regional differences that make this more understandable.
