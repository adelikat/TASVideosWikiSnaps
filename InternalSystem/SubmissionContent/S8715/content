	"I don't have time to check every input of every game...otherwise, the queue will be out of control. Instead, I watch the movie to see if anything looks obviously wrong. The first submission had issues, because I saw that Player 2 wasn't being position for a faster knock out. This was quickly fixed by LGR and thus satisfied my requirements for acceptance. On the other hand, the menuing didn't pop out at me, as it looked fine. Depending on how short a TAS is, menuing may become one of the more important optimizations...but certainly not a factor for killing a submission that is quite long and RNG dependent...due to landing on different frames.
