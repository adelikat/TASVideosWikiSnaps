		"Umihara Kawase Shun

	" (1997) is the little known sequel to the little known 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Umihara Kawase|href=/690M)
	" for the SNES. This run plays through the game using the shortest possible (as far as I could see) path: Fields 00, 11, 23, 14, 15, 35, 36, 31, 30. There are a few feasible routes through the game; the next closest route that I could find was to go to Field 24 after 35 then 29, 30.

	"Note: We have been somewhat spoiled by Flagitous' awesome run. The SNES version is more action based, whereas its sequel is more puzzle based. As a result the slick, sexy UK playing isn't possible in every field (Field 00 being the most obvious example), but it should, for the most part, be reminiscent of the SNES run.

	" in places. I went with the gamefaqs data. Also, there are several editions of this game. I'm  sure that this is the original, but I haven't been able to find the second (other) edition to compare to be sure.
