	"Road Fighter is a simple racing game, which was only released in Japan, and this is the first tool-assisted speed run of it. It aims for the fastest, shortest and highest-scoring route, and thus makes the game look really easy. Konamiman also makes an appearance in the game.

	"The main menu of the game contains the options "LEVEL 1" and "LEVEL 2" to select from. Despite their misleading names they're not levels in the traditional sense, but difficulty levels. Since playing games on easy is lame and boring (and against the guidelines) "LEVEL 2" is selected. The game is still quite easy though (having completed it manually before taking out the tools).

	"All of the levels are quite straightforward, but there are minor differences in them. The playing style differs from rest of the levels only during the first dodge, because of style and straighter route. Also note that the cars in the beginning are only decoration; they disappear before leaving the screen.
