	"Road Fighter is a simple racing game, which was only released in Japan, and this is the first tool-assisted speed run of it. It aims for the fastest, shortest and highest-scoring route, and thus makes the game look really easy. Konamiman also makes an appearance in the game.

Since playing games on easy is lame and boring (and against the guidelines) "LEVEL 2" is selected. The game is still quite easy though (having completed it manually before taking out the tools).
