	"I started this when I read that Kyman thought his 
	[a class=intlink href=/2048M 
		"run
	]a
	" couldn't be improved. So I improved it by 30 frames, mostly because of lag reduction and a better strategy in the boss battle. Instead of jumping, I fire a knife. This causes him to jump, which allows me to get under him before he wastes time throwing a knife and kill him earlier.
