	" This TAS does not take advantage of lag clipping, a major glitch that would save several minutes off of this time, because there is no emulator that can faithfully recreate this glitch. While this time is several minutes ahead of the fastest real time speedrun, there are a few points where I uncontrollably lose time to RTA (examples being the levels Final Outpost, Watch Your Step, and Breakdown.) Ultimately, it is up to a judge to decide whether this invalidates the run from being publishable.

	"Doom 64 is a spiritual successor to Doom 2 on the Nintendo 64, made by Midway Games and published by id Software. It features 32 new maps, as well as new graphics and sounds on a modified version of the Doom engine (which is built around the Atari Jaguar port's codebase.) It is also the only Doom game to feature the Unmaker weapon. While monsters such as the archvile and the chaingunner have been removed due to low memory capacity, there are also two new monsters: The Motherdemon and the Nightmare Imp.

A seperate category exists for the lowest difficulty, Be Gentle, but I believe that this category is not different enough, nor entertaining enough in a TAS setting to warrant its own TAS. The only notable differences in Be Gentle are less monsters, slightly different routing in certain maps, and double ammo.

[p 
	"Doom 64 is not designed to be played on a mouse and keyboard, but the weird octopus-styled Nintendo 64 controller we all love to hate. Unlike most games, however, the further you're pushing up on the control stick, the faster you move forward. The same can be said for backwards movement as well. However, the N64 analog stick has ranges far greater than the physical stick can allow (the normal limit is approximately 90, -90 for both the X and Y axes, where the real limit is 127, -128). As a result the console allows inputs greater than what is supposed to be possible on the analog stick. This allows us to get to speeds far greater than expected. In RTA, this involves abusing the calibration of the controller on startup, or manually calibrating using a set of inputs. Setting the neutral position to 90 forward allows access to inputs beyond the standard range while still using a standard N64 controller. In a TAS, however, this is irrelevant as we have access to the full analog range at all times. Therefore, it is important to categorize this trick differently for TAS.

	"Essentially, we get the full benefits of Neutral Reset but even greater. To make things easier to understand, I will be defining strafe running the same way you would with PC Doom. Holding fully up on the control stick and strafing gives a speed boost equivalent to SR40 speed. Additionally, holding down the button bound to "strafe on" (default: down C) locks your turn speeds, allowing the equivalent of SR50 speeds. As far as I know, there is no way to maintain this while turning, so I frequently have to default to SR40 again to make corners.

They offer far less flexibility than other Doom engine based languages such as ACS, but more flexibility than any other original Doom title. Only one MACRO script can be run at a time, which is important because this means that we may be temporarily unable to progress through a level until the MACRO runs out (example: end of MAP05). MACROs are used to call basic and advanced actions, sometimes in a designated sequence in order to change the layout of a level, spawn enemies, operate bridges and more. Sometimes the level will offer triggers that will terminate the MACRO that is currently functioning (example: MAP15), but this is often not the case.

	$LF

[p

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There are two types of triggers that can activate events: LINEDEF based triggers and THING based triggers. The former kind can be skipped when passing through the line at the proper speed and angle. Not only can horizontal and vertical lines have skippable triggers, but using SR50, I can also skip triggers on diagonal lines, which is impossible with SR40 speed. This comes into play on MAP05, and saves some time. Most line-based triggers however you will want to activate, such as those for lifts, doors and other important events to progress the map. THING based triggers cannot be skipped as they possess a length and width bigger than possibly skippable, however there are no instances where skipping those triggers would help anyway.

	"Doom, no matter what version you play, is a game that's heavy on RNG. RNG decides enemy movement and damage ranges, along with shotgun and SSG spread patterns.

Therefore, we want to be able to manipulate RNG without losing time as much as the game allows us to. Also, in non-time sensitive moments such as autoscrollers, moving differently allows us to manipulate the RNG without using ammo.

]p
[p 
	"Emulation for the Nintendo 64 is not cycle accurate, and therefore, no functional emulator in this present time emulates lag properly. While in some cases this isn't a major problem, in this game lag can be used in order to clip through impassable linedefs (and given the map design, even walls, making voidwalking possible!) This TAS loses several minutes to not being able to abuse any sort of lag.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Here is how lag clipping would work if it was used in this TAS: If we run into anything that allows us to build speed on it, such as a fence or a bar, the SSG can be used to generate lag if we're close enough to the wall. This lag somehow increases our speed beyond normal limits about a half second later. Having this increased speed can allow you to bypass nearly anything as long as you have enough. This currently allows us to bypass any impassable linedef, any 16-unit bar, as well as any 32-unit bar. There are also a huge number of theoretical uses that a TAS might be able to take advantage of, so the full scope of what's possible with this glitch is still not fully known.

We keygrab the blue and yellow keys to get them far more quickly than the intended route. Grabbing the blue key skips a puzzle that takes more than 20 seconds to set up, while the yellow key skips having to press a switch that isn't too far away, but wastes a few seconds to go towards.

Incidentally, I abuse a previously unknown bug in the mapping that displays a missing texture (missing textures in this game display the message "I suck at making maps"). The yellow key room is one of the most complex rooms in the entire game. It consists of me having to spawn prevent two cacodemons as well as two nightmare imps. I have to manipulate the RNG so that three of the cacodemons already present in the room were able to spawn prevent them. This leaves six lost souls to kill, which takes two SSG shots. Additionally, I had to redo this multiple times due to having bad luck with the way the cacodemons in the room moved around.

After this, I head into another thin hallway with a bunch of crushers inside, but I skip the trigger that activates them, saving about a second. Shortly after this, I turn around and press a switch, then proceed to use the lift on my way to the red key through the wall. Using the lift early saves 2 seconds.

I'm actually able to avoid using a lift simply by moving fast enough, saving a couple seconds, which is really nice. Moving in the caverns at this point was a chore, not just because of monsters blocking you, but because there's a nightmare imp that's stuck in the map geometry, which really changes the jump to get the yellow key. Fortunately, it saves more time to just leave it there than to kill it.

The red key door can be opened from the opposite side through a wall, saving a second. The IL record is 0:18.

After moving through the first set of hallways, I make it to the red key room, where I have to use 2 BFG shots to kill 18 demons. After this, I head back and go to the maze portion of the level. There are a couple bars that block our way, but there's enough space to get past them by running along the side rail.

It's harder to get past monsters in this area, because the maze is built diagonally. This means I have to shoot most of them to progress. I can make a jump to get to a switch that lowers a wall early, while avoiding a cacodemon below to save a few seconds. I also keygrab the blue key, saving a few seconds. After getting the red key, I had to manipulate RNG so that I could get the best possible distribution of the zombies after teleporting, making it so that I'm not blocked for too long.

	"This level has some of the strangest movement in the entire TAS, not only having to deal with very constrained spaces that are filled with monsters, but also requiring a lot of RNG manipulation on top of that. When I press the first switch, I go out of my way to rocket a cacodemon from below. I have to do this again, because both cacodemons completely block your path. I can get the blue key while the MACRO I just activated is still running, saving a few seconds. I am also able to activate the rocket launcher trap just before the MACRO is about to end, enabling me to not only run over the trap entirely, but to stand on top of the walls that surround it. Shortly after teleporting, I use a BFG shot against the demons, just so I can clear my path ahead. After I get the yellow key, I make my only real detour to get some ammo in this TAS, which wasted around 1.5 seconds, but will save me much more later on. I am also able to skip the trap that activates when you grab the red key, saving me more than 10 seconds. Luckily, the monsters didn't block me at all on the way to the exit.

	"This is the longest level in the entire game. It starts with some arachnotrons and spectres that we need to kill to proceed. After that, we gain access to the lift that allows us to reach the barons, who we have to kill next. After that, we take a shortcut by standing on the switch that raises from the ground, and going over the border after we press the switch. We then go to the blue key area, skipping a trigger that spawns several sets of monsters, losing about 20 seconds. We'll have to go here again later. After getting the red key, we enter the room where we get the yellow key. Normally, we have to trigger a couple of MACROs and follow the key around in a convoluted fashion, but we can skip that. We need to trigger these MACROs later, but we need the yellow key immediately. We now go up so that we can do the puzzle, which gives us access to three switches that we need to press to exit the level. After the first switch, we have to go back to the lowest level to press the second one. We need to kill 3 arachnotrons with a BFG shot, and after that, we have to press two switches on the top of the room. Then, I press the lift so that I can make a quick exit from this room. Now, we have to trigger the aforementioned MACROs to get to the exit. For some reason, doing this as quick as I did causes one of the yellow keys that spawn to get in this weird state in between being spawned and being despawned (you can actually see it briefly in the TAS; you can tell because the key stays translucent the whole time.)

I have to go around part of the level twice, as I don't have lag clips, so I have to damage the first cyber with a BFG shot and 3 rockets. Once I get to the other two cyberdemons, I made it so that I kill two of them at the same time for entertainment purposes, although the level ended much earlier than normal, so I think doing this saved time as well.

	"For some reason, this level is MAP28 despite being the 25th required level. I can only assume they wanted the player to wonder about MAP25-27, the "fun" levels. Anyway, this level has three gates that monsters come out of. Getting the three demon artifacts would close all the gates, but it takes less time to deal with the level normally. I need to manipulate RNG so that I don't need to wait between the time that any of the monsters spawn, which is easier said than done, because the monsters have to physically teleport into the arena, and the monsters' movement patterns vary a lot, especially when dealing with a lot of them.
	$LF

[p 
	"The Motherdemon (known internally as the Resurrector) is the final thing we have to kill in order to finish the run! It has only 5,000 health, which means that with proper manipulation, it can be killed in two BFG shots. I shoot the first shot just after it becomes vulnerable, then set up the second shot in such a way where I get a height boost from the Motherdemon's attack. The result is that I die before the Motherdemon does, but the BFG tracers are still close enough so that I can kill it as early as possible.

	"This is my first attempt at TASing a full game. I have always appreciated TASes from a distance, but never thought I would end up making one until I realized that if I wanted a TAS of this game to exist, I had to make it myself. It took over two years, but I'm extremely happy with the resulting TAS.

[p 
	"Unfortunately, it simply can't be ignored that this TAS is unable to utilize the most broken and notable glitch in the entire game due to emulation issues that are out of my control. Some in-game times are significantly slower than what they could possibly be, occasionally being slower than even what real time runs have done. If this TAS isn't publishable for this reason, I fully understand.
