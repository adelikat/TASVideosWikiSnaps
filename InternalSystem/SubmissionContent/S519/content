	"Cybernator is a platfor shooter from the allmighty Konami. You control a mecha and scoot through stages destroying stuff in the process. There's some flying autoscrolling action in there aswell. And a bundle of different weapons you can use.

	"Stage2, I try to dodge all the bullets in the autoscrolling stage then just fly to boss and kill it in 3 hits.

	"Stage3, dash away and shoot the obstacles. I kill the midboss (the laser turrets) before they can change places. At the boss I destroy the Mecha without losing any time destroying the engines. The engines can only be harmed if they are on screen.

	"Stage4, I try to levelup weapons as I go. nothing more. I try to get Genmark to highest altitude possible when I finally "destroy" the boss.

	"Stage5, I skip the Laser because I don't really have time firing it... so.. Midboss is destroyed as fast you can shoot the Napalm at it. The Shuttle was pain in the ***. First u must destroy the side-engine-thingies and then cockpit. I also destroy 3 of those flying mechas and one turret without losing any time.

	"Stage6, First I destroy the "bunny-mechs" as they appear. The "worm" was just laughable. 3 hits and it's over. Then navigate through the tunnels (I think the way is fastest what I'm using). The "bosses" are destroyed as fast as possible, due the slow recharge rate of Napalm. Changing weapons is useless because they are just weaker than slow firing Napalm.

	"Stage7, I hated this stage. I just tried to dash around until health gave up and then dodge and destroy mechas as I go. The midboss was weird. if you killed it too fast the General wouldn't evacuate from the mech and then the game woulnd't progress. The mecha at the "speedway" took damage only when the scrolling stopped. The final battle was easy. I destroyed all the "parts" before going for the head.

	"I think I could improve this somewhat but I don't have any freespace in the net so I must upload my WIP time attacks here :T This time attack is 6mins faster than my previous attempt without Napalm so.. it's a good start at least.
