	"Catz - Your Virtual Petz Palz is a virtual pet game that was released on multiple platforms back in the days. There isn't much of a goal to it: just keeping a cat happy until your GB batteries run out (I guess). However, there is a possibility to unlock more cats, which in this case serves as a meagre justification for doing a TAS.

	"The game mentions that you must retire happy cats in order to unlock new cats, but due to programmer laziness, you can simply return the cat you just bought to keep unlocking the next one and the next one. So... I began planning this run just as a simple endeavor to unlock all the different cats (62 total, 59 of which are palette swaps), but in the process thought of something else, and this was the result.

	"When watching the run, don't mind the fast pace of it all. Just relax, and it will all become clear in the end. Peace!
