	]a
	" was; this is the NES port. While many of the mechanics were changed, the overall flow and openness of the world is quite well preserved. A good balance between faithful adaptation and simplification makes this one of the best console adaptations in the series. Though many elements from the earlier games are present this is the defining game of the series in many respects. In later games the hero is almost always known by his title of Avatar, the world of Britannia has similar geography and culture and the characters of this game reappear in later games.

If you give away less than all of your gold you only gain Compassion and the only other way to improve Sacrifice is by giving blood. To speed this up we can visit beggars as we go through towns we need to stop by anyway. Fill out the rest with the beggar in Serpent's Hold who is fastest because he is right near the entrance.

	"Valor is most troublesome. The only thing that raises it is winning a random fight, a fight vs pirates or a fight vs daemons near the shrine of Humility. Each fight only raises it by one point, so 49 are needed. This becomes a major factor in the routing and execution of the run. The route uses random fights for an initial gold and experience grind and to get the gold for beggars. Traveling overland to a dungeon entrance ends up being preferred in some cases because it means more random fights. At sea the encounter rate is low so again overland travel is preferable.

				" Weaker enemies will go down to a single shot from my bow.

			]li
			[li 
				" Energy is great for certain stronger enemies - daemons, ettins, skulls. The initial hit delivers some damage. Then they get finished off when they step on the lava field created around them. Energy does take 22 MP so I can't do it until reaching level 4.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				" Other enemies go down to the Ice spell. Even if fire works, Ice saves a few frames in the menu and the five extra MP never makes a difference. Ice also doesn't use ash, reducing pressure on my herb supply. Ice takes 17 MP and requires manroot, so I can't use it until I visit the herb shop in Buccaneer's Den.
				$LF
			]li
		]ul
		" The placement of heroes and enemies on the battlefield has two possibilities. One is across and the other is scattered. The scattered formation puts the enemy much closer to me, saving about 25 frames because my shot does not need to travel so far to hit it.
		$LF

		" The bow is preferred to magic. Using magic takes about 25 more frames of menuing to select the spell and some extra text on use. Energy is preferred to Ice because the lava death saves time on text display.

		" I want to manipulate the random battles to come faster. It is worth using magic or getting the further enemy placement if I can get the battle a few steps earlier.

Note that stepping on lava uses the RNG to determine damage while otherwise the RNG advances once per frame. So each time I step on lava it basically saves a frame. I'll be trading off the rest of my HP to save a little time that way. Otherwise I can manipulate luck by trading off how much MP I regain in cleared rooms vs dungeon halls, using time that I would need to get MP anyway.

Luckily there are only a couple rooms where I need to deal with a full pack of eight. The odds are still pretty low for six and seven though. So while it might look like I just stroll through and take down every enemy easily, it actually took quite a bit of work to make Tremor kill all the enemies every time I use it.

[p 
	"On the second floor I need to do four rooms in a row. The 16-frame rule is a major problem because the fastest strategy in each room has a rather low probability of success. The chance for an ideal fight is actually lowest in the room with the reaper and wisps. The wisps have 15 HP which happens to be the maximum damage that the lava can do. Additionally, each time the reaper takes damage needs to be at the higher end of the range as well. With great luck they could all die with one step on lava. Unfortunately I not only need to line that up with the reaper's behavior and damage but also hit a good spot with respect to the 16-frame rule for Tremor in the next two rooms. So while not perfect the result is pretty close and quite lucky.

	"On the seventh floor there are four rooms to fight through. Stepping into the hall after each room means that I don't need to worry about the 16-frame rule. However, when there is only enough room to turn around there is no room there is no room to pace for MP. The second room is another fight with reapers and wisps where getting perfect lava damage on the wisps saves some time.

	"Finally we get to the bottom floor where a gauntlet of rooms with strong monsters awaits. First we have four rooms in a row ending with a room of eight dinosaurs. Then the famous fight against clones of all eight heroes followed by the final room with seven strong enemies. Tremor clears all of them.

	"With that we can continue on to the Codex and the ending! Input continues through most of the ending to advance a long speech from Lord British and congratulations from each of the heroes.
