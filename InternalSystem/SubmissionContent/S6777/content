	"Neutopia is similar to Zelda 1, I hope this TAS brings more attention to the game. This TAS beats the current WR by 7:32. Frame 1200 is a good screenshot of the title screen. I only used a gamepad and Recording mode for the crab fight and the puma head fight, everything else I did with mouse clicks. Making this was a lot of fun, but took a lot longer than I imagined.

	"My aim was to see how much time could be saved with the bell glitch and efficient combat. Normally the bell freezes the game and plays a melody for 2+ seconds, then opens any locked doors. The speedrun uses the bell 13 times in the final 2 dungeons. Frame 113923 is the first use of the bell glitch. All you do is run into a wall and press 2 on the right frame.

	"On frame 37574 there is an attack through the screen transition, for fun. I use item drop and enemy movement manipulation in several places in the run. I used the same strategies for the boss fights that I use in RTA, except Dirth, the final boss. Attacking Dirth while standing in inside his hitbox as he appears made it possible to kill him in only 4 cycles.

	"However, I still have to reject this movie even after removing (most of) the intro delay, because there's a lot of optimization potential in this game that's not fully used in this submission. See some notes and example movies here:
