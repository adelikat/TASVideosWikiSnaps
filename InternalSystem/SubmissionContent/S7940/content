	"The improvement started from the 2-4 Boss battle, and there was no change in the level before 2-4, because I couldn't find any improvement.

	"Because the randomness of some enemies is controlled by the global time, controlling luck becomes the most important part of this improvement.

[div class=p 
	"The way to control luck is mainly to control Lag, because the Lag of this game will affect the luck of the global time, which leads to a large amount of work for this improvement, because I need to make two or three TASs simultaneously to compare the best luck.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The workload of this improvement is still large. As long as there are levels generated by Lag, I need to do multiple TAS synchronously to get different Lags, so as to control the randomness of the enemy in the next level. However, this is not an easy task, because it is difficult to ensure that different Lags are generated at the same speed.

	"4-3: This level lost 1 frame, and the second Flaming chariot was suspended for 4 times due to less luck than last time. However, since the first Boss of the 4-4 level has 8 frame rules and the second Boss has 4 frame rules, it will not waste time if the 4-3 level loses one frame....... I tried to find a way not to lose frames, but it will generate Lag, which will also affect the luck of the 4-4 Boss fight. Therefore, I made several TASs to compare the best fighting luck of Boss and kept this TAS. ( 1 frame lost )
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"4-4: As I said above, the reason for keeping this TAS is that the Boss has better luck control in battle, because the Boss has frame rules (get 6 frames)
