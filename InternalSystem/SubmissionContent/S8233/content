Only one round of Wordle is played in this TAS as there doesn't seem to be any unique content afterwards, resulting in the actual gameplay section lasting roughly 16 frames.

	"The word used in the TAS is 'kitty' which is the word when starting the game on frame 106 (the first possible frame is 102). One trick I did find was the ability for the hand to move at incredible speeds. This can be done by holding a vertical and horizontal direction at the same time, though the horizontal direction needs to be pressed second and there were only certain frames it worked but other times, it'd always work. I don't fully understand it but trial and error worked in the end. Going at these fast speeds also skips the animation when pressing keys which stops the hand. To get to Y as fast as possible, I select a letter then press B to delete it, warping the hand to the backspace which is close to the Y. This doesn't lose any time over just moving the hand but it makes it a more slightly interesting choice of movement.
