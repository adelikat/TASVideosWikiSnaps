	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"TOCA Touring Car Championship is a racing simulation game, developed by Codemasters and released in November 1997 in Europe and August 1998 in North America (there titled "TOCA Championship Racing" on the box-art, although the in-game screens still say TOCA Touring Car Championship). It is the first game of the TOCA series of racing games, which later evolved into the 
	[em 
		"Race Driver
	]em
	" series and later on the 
	[em 
		"Grid
	]em
	" series.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The game is modeled after the 1997 British Touring Car Championship season, featuring the car manufacturers, cars and drivers of that season (excluding the independent drivers), and featuring all the racing circuits that were driven in that season. This totals out to 8 cars from 8 different manufacturers/teams, 16 drivers/racers (2 per car manufacturer/team), and 8 circuits (9 if counting two different track layouts of Donington Park as separate circuits).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Besides the usual single race and time trial modes, the game features a championship mode which, depending on the length setting, involves going through all the races of the BTCC season, in the original order, and with the original lap counts. This movie plays through the "long" championship setting, which includes all 24 races from 12 weekends across all 8 venues with their original lap counts - in other words, it clears the same amount of road as an entire year's worth of a British Touring Car Championship season (although outside of the actual races, the movie only does a single qualifying lap per race). This means that this movie does 24 races that are realistically scheduled to last around a half hour or more. The TAS brings this down by several minutes per race - suffice to say, opposing cars get lapped a lot.
	$LF

[h2 
	" Tricks/Notes
	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"There's really not much for tricks in this movie, other than just plain driving fast, taking corners optimally, braking where necessary, etc., so I'll mostly put my notes about the game here.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Delta timing
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Driving physics and controls are absurdly inconsistent. What this means is that sometimes the same steering input can have significantly different results even under very similar or even seemingly identical circumstances, leading to a lot of random undercutting corners, overcutting corners, or other such issues.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"What also plays into this is that the game does not run at a consistent framerate, and uses delta timing for its physics. What this means is that if the game lags more, it will speed up the in-game physics to compensate. (Most modern games also do this). This normally helps to get a consistent gameplay experience without experiencing lag or slowdown as in older games when the framerate drops.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"However, this game has a wildly inconsistent framerate, so the delta time also shakes about a lot. This depends on such things as what track you're on, how many cars are in the race, how many cars are in the race 
	[em 
		"in proximity of the player
	]em
	", how many cars are on camera, how close or far they are on camera, where you are on the track, how much of the track is visible, what camera mode is used, and besides all that, a lot of sheer unpredictability.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This not only affects the controls as above, but also affects the physics in weird and inconsistent ways. This means that if you try to take the exact same turn the exact same way between laps, you can get completely different results, and suddenly spin out where a turn previously was possible, or the other way around. Because of this, it's practically impossible to get consistent lap times.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Weather
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The weather of a track is preset before a race starts - either by the player (in single race or time trial modes), or pre-determined by the game (in championship modes). Various different weather types exist.

	" Storm
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Storm weather places dark clouds over the track, has the player cars turn their light on, and has light rainfall fall over the track. Due to the rainfall, the track is more slippery, and makes cars more prone to spinning out. Extra careful braking is required.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Also, in this (as well as other weathers with precipitation), AI Audi cars do much better at qualifying. Interestingly, that doesn't actually convert to better racing results - AI Audis sometimes still actually struggle with the rain conditions, maybe due to an overly confident AI that makes mistakes.

	" AI notes
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The AI of this game is sort of known for actually 
	[em 
		"averting
	]em
	" rubber-band AI. Based on limited tests I've done, I'm actually not sure if that's completely true or not, but at least even if it does exist, the effect is relatively minimal. This is actually a kind of double-edged sword; it's beneficial to the player when they get ahead, because they can then open up a very substantial lead that allows them more room for error. It's also relatively easy to force the AI to slip up, and get a very significant lead that way. On the other hand, it means that if the player themself makes a mistake, the AI will take off forward instead, and the player may be left unable to catch up. With tool-assistance thrown into the mix, the best case scenario happens for the playe, in that they can get ahead 
	[em 
		"very far
	]em
	". In races that average at about 25 minutes, the player gets ahead by at least 5 minutes in most of them. This means that the AIs will get lapped a lot.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The AI does get upgraded or downgraded depending on a few difficulty settings. Single race mode has Easy, Normal or Hard options for the opposing AIs, and Championship mode has Standard and Expert options (don't ask me why different game modes have different ways of measuring difficulty). The TAS runs Championship Mode on Expert mode, naturally. Besides the setting, AIs also gradually improve as the championship goes on
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"AIs function generally the same as player cars, although they do cheat quite a bit, especially at higher difficulties. They don't reach impossibly high top speeds, but do sometimes have better than normal acceleration, have significantly better traction, and sometimes are able to use impossible motions to stay on the track. Most notably, the Audi AIs are the biggest cheaters in the game - if one starts in 1st or 2nd in a race, they get a massive acceleration boost at the start, significantly faster than is normally possible, even compared to a player using the same car. This means that even in the TAS, if an Audi gets second place in qualifying, it will speed up ahead at the start of the race, leaving the player second (until overtaking him, usually in the first turn). This is most visible in the second set of Thruxton races.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The AIs also cheat at qualification times, in that the given times are simply random times within a certain range for each driver, and are not actually simulated. This is most clear with the fact that most AI racers do not even come close to their qualification times for finishing any lap.
	$LF
]p
[h2 
	" Pre-race setup
	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"Before starting the championship mode, the movie goes to the controller settings mode, to set up analog controls and set controller sensitivity to high. This is done to allow a greater range in steering, at the cost of finer precision control - but a TAS can get fine precision control anyway, because, well, TAS. (Do 
	[em 
		"not
	]em
	" try racing with these settings in real-time, as the slightest flick of the stick will send the car spinning to a halt or careening off to the side). Analog acceleration is optional but is not set, because there is no need for it and it does not provide an advantage. The rest of the button layout is left at default.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When starting up championship mode, the setting is set to Long Championship (for full completion) and difficulty is set to Expert (the highest available difficulty for this mode). These should all be straightforward.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"On the name selection screen, I figured I'd go with the title of a popular tame racing driver. It fits well with the idea of a mysterious driver who nobody knows or refers to by name, and who has no personality or emotion other than being a badass racing driver who would clean sweep a whole racing season, by 
	[em 
		"large
	]em
	", if he felt like it.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"While selecting the car, the gear shift setting is set to manual. It doesn't actually provide much over the default auto gear shift, but the extra control is nice, and a perfectly controlled TAS has no problem with the added difficulty in controlling the vehicle anyway.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Lastly, before the start of the first venue introduction, I pause the game to put the game music volume at maximum. This costs barely any time as the game is still busy loading things anyway, and being able to listen to the game's soundtrack more clearly is a worthwhile entertainment boost.
	$LF

[h2 
	" Car selection
	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"Like was said before, there are 8 cars in the game (9 or 10 (depending on the game version) if counting cheat vehicles, but those cannot be used in Championship mode anyway). There are also 16 cars in a race, two for every manufacturer.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The cars are as follows, in the order they appear in the car selection screen (and how they are also ordered internally). The racers that drive them are listed besides them, also in internal order. When selecting a car, the player will replace the first listed racer.

[p 
	"The Audi A4 is a special kind of car (and the only one in its own tier). This is due to its four-wheel drive, and its 95kg weight penalty (the weight penalty was introduced for the 1997 season after Audi entered the BTCC scene in 1996 with their star driver Frank Biela immediately dominating the competition). The four-wheel drive provides its advantages in traction and handling, especially in rainy or other poor-grip conditions (emphasised in the game by the Audis getting greatly boosted qualifying times, usually 1-2ing the qualification rounds if not counting the player). However, the weight penalty makes the car more sluggish-feeling than the others. Conveniently though, the AI Audis in this game compensate for this by 
	[em 
		"cheating like hell with acceleration
	]em
	" at higher difficulties, the effects of which are clearly visible even in this TAS.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Ultimately, the handling may give the Audi a slight edge in rainy tracks, but overall across a whole championship the advantages are not big enough to make up for the disadvantages compared to the higher set of cars.

	"These are the Big Three cars of the game. They accelerate faster than the others and reach the peak speed of 146 MPH faster than the other cars.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The differences between these cars themselves are minor, and it's hard to get a consistent read on them (due to the generally inconsistent nature of the game). The differences that I have been able to locate are that the Honda Accord is consistently very slightly faster at acceleration, while the Renault Laguna has better cornering abilities (and the Volvo S40 has the Laguna's speed but slightly worse cornering). Ultimately, the cornering is more important to retain speed throughout the race tracks - especially those with tough corners or hairpins - so the Renault Laguna wins out between the three. The Honda Accord might provide a slight performance gain at Thruxton (it being the fastest track), but overall it loses out.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"It's also of note that the Renault Laguna is driven by Alain Menu, who won the 1997 British Touring Car Championship in a dominant fashion (after getting 2nd place for three successive seasons in 1994, 1995 and 1996), and is also consistently the strongest AI in the game (followed by Jason Plato and James Thompson). This also makes Alain Menu's Renault Laguna a logical choice for being considered the best option, while selecting it also puts him out of the competition.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Ultimately, the Renault Laguna is the best overall option for the championship; the Audi might have a slight advantage in the rainy courses, and the Honda could make a case at Thruxton, but overall taking into account all the races, the best option is the Renault Laguna, so that is what is picked for this run.

	"It's the first race of the game, and already we're thrown into the longest circuit of the season with some of the trickiest turns of all the tracks.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The most striking part of the track layout is the hairpin shape near the end of the track (which is known as the Melbourne Hairpin). While most of the track can be passed reasonably well without having to brake a lot (or at all, in some positive circumstances), the hairpin is a very definite pace killer.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Right before the hairpin though, there's a little skip at the esses, where rather than weaving through the track (which requires significant braking/slowdown), one instead passes the dirt patch from the left side instead, through the grass. This saves a good amount of time every lap.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This track does include an unique pit stop trick which no other track in the game features; the pit stop in this track allows you to cut the corner here, avoiding the final sharp turn (Goddards) and, despite the pit stop slowing the car down, reducing distance enough to save a few seconds on reaching the finish line. Note that this is only beneficial to finish a qualifying lap or finishing a race; otherwise, the pit stop keeps you driving at reduced speed for a far too long time to be worth it.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"At the start of the race, Frank Biela (who starts out in second place) overtakes me. This happens because the Audis, and Biela in particular, are cheating bastards in this game who actually inch ahead on the starting grid as long as you're not looking, and accelerate significantly faster than the player is capable of. This gets even worse in later races as the AI advances. This is a recurring trend, but at least the AI is overtaken by the first turn anyway.

	"We're back to Donington Park again - now in the rain. The good news is that at least we don't have to do the hairpins again, and the new esses can still be cut through. The bad news is that every other turn is still there, and the rain makes it significantly worse. Rain is actually surprisingly even worse than the storm at Silverstone, as there's even less traction on the road now. This makes turns such as the first one (Redgate) significantly harder, and more braking is required at some places now.

	"Croft was a newly revamped circuit and was newly added to the BTCC schedule in 1997. I assume this debuting factor is the reason why the lap count is out of line comparatively with the lap length, resulting in a race that's a fair few miles longer than all the others (53 miles, as opposed to the usual ~45 miles), and that ends up lasting five minutes longer than the average of the other races.

[p 
	"At the first semi-hairpin turn, I make use of the fact that an old part of the circuit is still there on the outer side of the turn, and it still counts as tarmac, so I make use of it to make the turn much smoother for myself so that I can pass it at a significantly higher speed than is otherwise supposed to be possible.
