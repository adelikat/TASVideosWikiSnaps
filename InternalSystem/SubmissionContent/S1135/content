	"This is a 45 seconds improvement over Frenom's Tiny Toon run. All levels have been improved, as well as all boss-fights.

	"A lot of improvement comes from using better routes, but a lot of the improvement is simply because of much better and more precise movements.

		"About Superspeed:
	]b
	" This technique is used in every stage. As you'll notice when watching the movie, all stages start with me running for a few frames, and then when I've reached a certain speed, I press down+A. Doing this makes you perform a superjump, and this gives you maximum forward movement, I call this "Superspeed" from now on. Pretty cool name, huh? :) You want to keep this superfast forward movement as long as possible, and to do this, simply perform another superjump as soon as you land.
	$LF

[p 
	"Another way to keep your superspeed is to dash when you have reached superspeed. The optimal way to dash is to dash every 2 frames, you'll see me doing this a lot in the water-level.

		"Climbing walls:
	]b
	" In this game, the cat can climb walls, similiar to the Mega Man X games. The best way to climb walls is to jump on the wall every 31 frames.

		"Number of carrots:
	]b
	" If your number of carrots is divisible by 11 when you have completed a world, you'll get to a bonuslevel. This is why I avoid getting 99 carrots, (99 is indeed divisible by 11, believe it or not). On the first level, I avoid as many carrots as possible in order to not have 99 carrots in the end. This was a minor miscalculation from my part, since I only ended up with 83 carrots anyway, but you'll have to accept this. I won't redo this run simply to get 98 carrots if that's what you think! ;)  
	$LF

[p 
	"Other than these things, there's not so much more to add. This game is really similiar to Super Mario, with carrots instead of coins,  and also a timer, just like in Super Mario. With this being such a simple platformer, you really don't have to have played this game to enjoy the run. Just think of this as Super Mario, but with a bunny.

	"This run took me a long time to finish. I've been away from making TAS for about 4 months or so now, but a lot of people have motivated me lately to finish this run, so here it is! :)
	$LF

[p 
	"I would personally like to thank everyone who motivated me to finish this run, even though I'm really laze... Sami, Shinryuu, Guybrush, adelikat, Vatchern... I probably forgot a few people here, but you'll have to forgive me for that.

	"That's about it, enjoy the run! I'm really happy with the result myself.
