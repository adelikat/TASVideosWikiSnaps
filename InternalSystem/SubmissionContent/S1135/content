		"About Superspeed:
	]b
	" This technique is used in every stage. As you'll notice when watching the movie, all stages start with me running for a few frames, and then when I've reached a certain speed, I press down+A. Doing this makes you perform a superjump, and this gives you maximum forward movement, I call this "Superspeed" from now on. Pretty cool name, huh? :) You want to keep this superfast forward movement as long as possible, and to do this, simply perform another superjump as soon as you land.

	"Another way to keep your superspeed is to dash when you have reached superspeed. The optimal way to dash is to dash every 2 frames, you'll see me doing this a lot in the water-level.

	]b
	" In this game, the cat can climb walls, similiar to the Mega Man X games. The best way to climb walls is to jump on the wall every 31 frames.

		"Number of carrots:
	]b
	" If your number of carrots is divisible by 11 when you have completed a world, you'll get to a bonuslevel. This is why I avoid getting 99 carrots, (99 is indeed divisible by 11, believe it or not). On the first level, I avoid as many carrots as possible in order to not have 99 carrots in the end. This was a minor miscalculation from my part, since I only ended up with 83 carrots anyway, but you'll have to accept this. I won't redo this run simply to get 98 carrots if that's what you think! ;)

	"Other than these things, there's not so much more to add. This game is really similiar to Super Mario, with carrots instead of coins,  and also a timer, just like in Super Mario. With this being such a simple platformer, you really don't have to have played this game to enjoy the run. Just think of this as Super Mario, but with a bunny.
