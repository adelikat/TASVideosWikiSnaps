	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Pim's Pawn Shop Mirror Glitch is triggered when the player buys a mirror (there's only one for sale), attempts to buy it at least two more times, and then leaves the store. The game will usually crash, though sometimes it will also soft reset, hard reset (which forces BizHawk to reboot the core), jump to a random glitched room, or warp to the credits.

	"I start out by pressing 1 to start the game. 1 and 2 start the game equally fast.
	$LF

[p 
	"Walking controls are very responsive. Pressing any D-Pad button for one frame will move Adol one pixel in that direction on the same frame you pressed it.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"You can do "corner boosts", but they will only move Adol out of an object at his normal walking speed, so they aren't any faster or slower to perform. I do them anyway because I think they look cool.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"For the glitch to warp to the credits, the overworld screen needs to be in a certain position. Specifically, it needs to be within a one-tile (8-pixel) range both horizontally and vertically. I move the screen to the edge of that range. Not moving the screen down far enough usually causes a soft or hard reset, and not moving it left far enough warps you to a small blue room.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Opening the menu is also necessary for the credits warp. It can be opened anytime before you enter the shop, but the frame you open it on can affect the outcome of the glitch.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Selection arrows in this game don't have the "wraparound" behavior of arrows in newer RPGs like Pok√©mon and Paper Mario, so I have to move down to every option.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Inside the shop, the 2 button selects and the 1 button goes back a page. You can press 1 instead of 2 on some screens to change the outcome of the glitch. Like with 
	[a class=intlink href=/2406M 
		"Kirby's Adventure
	]a
	", different input causes different outcomes.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Like how you can only walk in 4 directions, you unfortunately can't speed up the shop menuing with diagonal input. However, you can press 2 at the same time as a directional button to select options as you're scrolling to them.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Attempting to buy a mirror the third time is what specifically causes the warp to the credits. I found that I didn't need to waste any frames with the glitch setup I had, since it would've ended up slower.
