		"Overall, I am proud of this Tool-Assisted speedrun but many improvements can be made as the player camera wobbles a lot sometimes due to me jumping forward while hesitating with the arrow keys on where to land on a platform. This is wobble is very imminent throughout the TAS and a large portion of it featuring the wobble can probably be smoother, and I feel as if I was not exactly precise on a little bit of this run since for some savestates the difficulty of me advancing from one platform to another was somewhat overshadowed from then retrying and loading those same savestates many times to be completely sure they are as perfect as theoretically possible.

	": This is an interesting little indie game for a TAS, however, there are some obvious optimization issues, as outlined already in the thread. Be sure to avoid unnecessary direction changes and always take the most direct path between two points - you have savestates, use them to their fullest potential! Also, pre-plan your jumping sequences and try several different options to see which one is the fastest. As always, if you are new to TASing and aren't sure if your movie is up to par, be sure to ask for feedback.
