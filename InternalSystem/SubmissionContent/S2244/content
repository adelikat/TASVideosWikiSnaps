	"This run beats the current one by Deign by precisely 2000 frames (33.33 seconds). Improvements come from a new glitch abuse, better precision for the star shots and controlling the character; and using lots of new strategies.

	"If you shoot a star on the top of a block it will naturally bounch upwards. Same simplicity with shooting it on a side of the block or under it - it will just bounch in the opposite direction as it has when it hits the block. But what about hitting it exactly at one of it edges? In this game the result of this is that the star enters the edge and start bounching on the vertical sides inside the block. What you want is to have at least one block under the one you're "edge-shooting" (or a block at least 32 pixels high, what ever you want to call it), let the star bounch between the walls inside that block and then bounch up by the block below, then have the block leave the block it entered - and depending on what angle and speed you shot it with it will either bounce forward or backward where forward is usually the wanted direction. This trick will let you travel on stars where you couldn't before since the bounching inside the block takes the time just to make you catch up with the star. Check for yourself in frameadvance if this was unclear (It's used in the first star shot).

	"Actually, in this game the "enemy drop" RNG can easily be followed without memory watch (so you can see if you like). The only thing that affects it is the score. To get something from an enemy the second and third last numbers in the score has to be the same(see table below). I get quite a lot items this way throughout the run.
