	"I was thinking why no one has ever done Gunsmoke before. One reason is 
	$LF
	"pretty obvious, itŽs not really a timeattack game. However I think itŽs one 
	$LF
	"of the coolest games ever and that it would make a good aesthic movie. So 
	$LF
	"here I am, avoiding bullets, shooting "very little" and also makes cool 
	$LF
	"drive by's! I discovered a cool glitch ;) If you press left + down + right 
	$LF
	"at the same time the character gets an incredible speed, running to the 
	$LF
	"right of the screen. This results in some cool drive by's ;)

	"Hmm. ItŽs a pretty long game but itŽs basically completed as fast as 
	$LF
	"possible. I could have bought some weapons maybe to kill some bosses faster 
	$LF
	"but wth, IMO itŽs cooler to just humilate them with the 2 guns you have from 
	$LF
	"start ;)

	"Also, this is not Gradius. The gunman doesnŽt move as fast or precise as the 
	$LF
	"Gradius ship. But I think I made it look pretty cool. Also I got a high 
	$LF
	"score.

	"I think this game does not have the same potential

	"You did do what you claimed, but it doesn't look like
	$LF
	"the game is difficult enough to keep a savestate user
	$LF
	"busy. Also, your "humiliation" was mostly consisted
	$LF
	"of "killing enemies now" and "killing enemies later".
	$LF
	"Sometimes it was even "letting them go".
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"There were lots of excess movements which weren't cool
	$LF
	"in the same way as in Gradius.

	$LF
	"Despite the fact that this could be the last NES Gunsmoke
	$LF
	"movie the world ever will see, I'm not positive about
	$LF
	"publishing this one.
