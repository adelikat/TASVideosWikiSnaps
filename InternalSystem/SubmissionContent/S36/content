	"pretty obvious, it's not really a timeattack game. However I think it's one 
	$LF
	"of the coolest games ever and that it would make a good aesthic movie. So

	"here I am, avoiding bullets, shooting "very little" and also makes cool

	"at the same time the character gets an incredible speed, running to the

	"Hmm. It's a pretty long game but it's basically completed as fast as 
	$LF
	"possible. I could have bought some weapons maybe to kill some bosses faster 
	$LF
	"but wth, IMO it's cooler to just humilate them with the 2 guns you have from

	"Also, this is not Gradius. The gunman doesn't move as fast or precise as the
