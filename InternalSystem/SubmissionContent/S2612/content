	"Once again, speed is determined by alternately pressing A and B. However, you also have Stamina, which can be burned through in around 7 seconds if you maintain the maximum speed. Stamina also adds to the speed you travel at - therefore the fastest approach is to go as fast as possible WITHOUT burning into the stamina bar. Stamina does recharge slowly over time if you are going slow enough, but you will be going too slow then. Keeping within the narrow speed requirement that doesn't burn stamina but does move as fast as possible was tough to plan, and required very precise input at each frame. You may often see places where there are gaps in input - this is deliberate so the swimmer does not go fast enough to burn Stamina.

	"At the end of the race, I do burn through stamina to gain a final burst of speed. However, since the stamina does add to the speed you travel, not all of the Stamina is used since it would not achieve a faster time. In the end, I achieved a time of 1 minute 43.3 seconds
