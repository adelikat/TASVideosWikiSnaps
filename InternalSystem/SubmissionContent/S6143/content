		"Sewer Sam
	]em
	" is an Intellivision and ColecoVision game, developed and published by Interphase in 1983 featuring a guy named Sam going through a network of sewers. Sam is armed with a six-shot revolver and has to locate and destroy three enemy submarines that are hidden inside this maze of sewers. Along the way, plenty of sewer wildlife is out to get him, so those need to be shot or otherwise avoided as well.

	"The creation of this run is probably a lot more interesting than the run itself. Basically, most of this run is botted in order to deal with the inordinate amount of lag and luck manipulation this game has. A good 200k rerecords have been spent trying to find the fastest way to navigate through the first tunnel or to find the most optimal shooting frames in the sewer levels in order to pass through with as little lag as possible, manipulating the positions and appearances of enemies so they minimally get in the way of the player character and generate the least amount of lag possible.

		" Submarines - The goal of the game is to locate and destroy three of these. Submarines appear close to the end of a wet level (whether or not one appears is randomly decided when entering the level). Submarines have a fixed pattern of deploying a missile launcher, and then firing a missile at Sam. To destroy the submarine, Sam must shoot the missile launcher before the missile is fired, and do so three times. With tool-assisted timing, the missile launchers will barely have a few frames to start to become visible before being destroyed, so it might not be visible how they are being destroyed.

	"The maze consists of eight levels, each of which has six doors leading to the other levels.

	"The odd-numbered levels 1 (start), 3, 5, and 7 are dry floor levels, whereas the even-numbered 2, 4, 6, and 8 are wet floor levels. The submarines are randomly found on any of the wet levels - when entering a wet floor, the game randomly decides if a submarine is located in this area. If it is, the progress indicator at the top will be red instead of white.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Since the only requirement is to enter a wet level three times (with luck manipulation to ensure a submarine in each wet level), the route is as follows: start in level 1, take the first door to level 2 (submarine 1), take the final right door after beating the submarine to level 8 (submarine 2), and take the final right door again after beating the submarine to level 6 (submarine 3).

The RNG is in a pretty bad spot here, as most values that would trigger the submarine appearance in this level would also cause one or two spiders to appear at the start of the level, which would require Sam to go out of the way to shoot them or lose significant time stuck in webbing. The movement here does visibly waste time, but it is still the fastest way to set up for this level.

	"During the submarine battle, a few shots are wasted. Even though this causes extra lag, this is pretty much a necessity in order to force the gun to reload by the start of the next level - otherwise there would not be enough shots to manipulate all the mice, spiders, and other hazards out of the way.

Not that none exist, but those that I found would have other issues that didn't really make them suitable for TASing for me at least. So, I ended up with this game instead!
