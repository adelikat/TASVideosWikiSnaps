	"When any enemy is hit by two players at the exact same frame, it will take 2x-3x the normal amount of damage. This makes boss fights extremely efficient. Not sure if this was a programming glitch or intentional. 
	$LF
	"The double jump technique is used as often as possible to accelerate the run, including killing one player to gain extra height. 
	$LF
	"The lottery is actually the fastest way to make money in the game. The lottery must be played once to obtain the pass in level 6 and the dictionary in level 8. 
	$LF
	"This movie is 2:28 faster than the single player. This is due to the boss fights, the lottery vs. the dice game, and also slight optimizations such as jumping ladders as oppose to climbing.
