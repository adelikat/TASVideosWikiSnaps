	"This submission is an improvement on a previously canceled submission from 2005. CtrlAtDestroy did a good job with this one, especially in the fighting sections. For my part, I was able to save 141 frames due to minor optimizations in some parts and reworking the Lunarian shooting part to get better/faster/cleaner patterns.

	"As for the boss glitch kill, you don't have to be crouching. My theory is that the boss occasionally (based on frame entry) spawns a third eye under the first one. I've seen the third eye come out by itself before. I think that shooting the first eye with the third eye underneath it makes the shot hit both, and the boss is probably coded to die in two eye shots as opposed to "all" eye shots.
