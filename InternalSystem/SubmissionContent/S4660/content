	"Although this movie is slower due to emulation differences in lag, it is in fact faster (by 13 frames) than the previous submission. This run is the product of 2 years of on-and-off work. Bahamete and Masterjun started and stopped the run in 2013, finishing at Star World 2. PangaeaPanga took the work-in-progress in February of 2015 and finished it. Unfortunately, there are not many differences between this run and the current submission, so there is not much to talk about.

	"So it's finally done, the first SMW "warps" run that should be console verifiable. It looks like this run isn't really much better than the previous movie judging from the comparison above, but that is not true. Keep in mind that you can't really compare emulation differences. For example in the level YI4, using hopping glitch in snes9x is no problem, as we can avoid lag, but in lsnes it's faster to 6/5 to slow down at places and avoid lag that way.
