	" run. The game is so damm long and because of this in some levels i had to go back on the map, especially in the final stages when the REMO's ran out.

	"Oh, just a thing. Already has a B.O.B speedrun, made in 2005 by Windeu. He made a wonderful tas! He chose a SNES version, and I chose the genesis one. I think the genesis version has a better physics. My version is 16min 4sec faster. I think it is because I took dmg.

	"Well, it was a little bit hard to make this speedrun. In part because is my first tas. I don't know so much good techniques, scripts... Only after a few levels I started to make backups! I done a few mistakes, like shot the nothing, but I tried to minimize them.
