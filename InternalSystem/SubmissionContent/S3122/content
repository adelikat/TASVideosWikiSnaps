[div class=p 
	"Key Teleportation-- When you have a bubble that goes off screen that has a key in it, you have 2 frames to blow a bubble and it will transfer the key from the bubble it was in to the bubble you just blown, but since the bubble you make is the small one it gives you the key instantly.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"This trick is used when normally the key would be grabbed by an enemy or if it's needed to enter the locked door at the end of a level faster. i,e. 4-3.

	"Fast killing off the Witch:
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Since the witch has such a small hit box. Normally the bubble bounces high into the air when you bounce it off of Spanky's hitbox. To make it faster, I waited for the bubble to be on the side of me and I would walk into the bubble allowing it to hit the witch much sooner than possible.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Also you may notice that the witch didn't turn into the "infamous" Raven that you have to kill as well. Killing the small witch quick enough prevents her from trannforming into the raven and skips that phase all-together.

	"Each take 5 hits from the Volleyball and 1 hit from the Soccerballs to kill. Order doesn't matter but I usually try to get the soccer ball hit when the boss is at a low point since it saves time from jumping up before blowing bubble.

	"When jumping, the longer you hold "B" the higher you will jump. For most jumps in levels this requires the smallest possible jump to reach ledges and platforms.

	"Bonus levels are used when I want to maintain extra keys for upcoming levels. 
	$LF
	"The way bonus levels work is that the cost to leave the bonus level is half of your keys rounded down. 
	$LF
	"So if you had 1 or no keys then it wont cost anything to leave.
	$LF
	"2 or 3 keys and you will lose 1 key on exiting. And so on...
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"What this means in a nutshell is that the most optimal route usually will have you always entering bonus levels with an odd number of keys, (usually 1 but not always)
	$LF
	"so that you lose the least amount of keys on exiting. 1 key and 2 keys entering will leave you with 1 key on exiting in either case, so getting that 2nd key would be pointless.
