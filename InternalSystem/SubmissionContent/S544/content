	"The game is surprisingly shorter than I remember. And there are a lot of loading times ins the game as well. Besides that, the game is a nice action jump'n'run. There seems to be no way to increase horizontal movement, so precise jumps, especially in vertical passages are the main concern in this game. The bosses can sometimes take quite some time, mostly caused by the rather long time that you cannot hit them. (Up to 60 frames for some of them)

	"I take a few hits to speed things up, mainly during boss fights. There are two unnecessairy hits in the first air stream in 3-1, but it's hard enough not grabbing those stalctites, and the hits don't slow me down, so I'm sorry that I did not spend more time in that area because it would not have payed off. The hit in 7-2 is 23 frames faster than not getting hit there.

	"I'm not using any warps, although quite a few of the shortcuts I take can only be done with frame exact jumping. I don't remember exploiting any programing errors, either.

	"There are a few mistakes here and there, but most of them are not noticable running the game full speed. The ones I know of probably sum up to about 60 or 70 frames, which in my opinion is no reason to redo the run without further discoveries.

	": This game has interesting physics and good action. Minus the boat levels, which aren't that long anyway.

	"Even though it is over-all well played, I doubt that the possible improvement for this movie is only 60 frames, or even only 120 frames. If I reject this, will the author make a new more polished version? Probably not, his last post here was about one year ago. Doing so, I doubt that this game would ever get any attention again, which would be a shame.

	"Therefore, I have actually decided to accept this submission (which I guess isn't a lot like me), in hope that someone will be interested in improving it in the near future.
