	"This movie is my 2nd movie. My first movie is failed. So this time, I used more time and energy to finish this movie. So I think, the evaluation of this movie will be much better than my first!

	"This game is an MD game:"Vapor Trail - Hyper Offence Formation". When you begin to see this game,you may think it is so easy to finish. But if you think about this movie carefully, you will find that it is not very easy to finish movie of this game, too.Because in this movie, if you want to save time, you must fight with Bosses as quickly as you can. So I think it is a little difficult to finish this movie.

	"In the stage 1, I used "S" weapon to fight with Bosses, and it seems to save some time. In the stage 2, I release the "S" weapon to fight with Bosses more quickly.In the stage 3, I used the initial weapon. Because this weapon is the strongest weapon except the "S" weapon.And in stage 3, there isn't the "S" weapon. So I have to use the initial weapon. In stage 4, I used the "S" again , in order to save time. In stage 5 and stage 6, I continue using the "S" weapon.

	"Also, in this movie, I didn't fight with the plane somewhere, like in stage 2 and stage 5.

	"I wish this movie will be successful!

	" for an example of what qualifies as an example run. This game, particularly, does not have anything that sets it out from the pack, and therefore my main judging decision is to reject this for game choice.

	"However, that said, as others said, you didn't appear to spend much time optimizing this movie. Examples of this include the initial plane-selection issue, and the choice of weapons for boss fights, and more. Soig, I would suggest you post Works In Progress (WIP) in the forums before submitting. That way, you can get feedback on game choice and your progress.
