	"Although this is not a real game for SNES, it is definitely the greatest hack I have ever played.  I chose this game because this is simply a great game made even better, and because the standard SMW 11-exit run opened my eyes to how great of a run this game could make.  I'm extremely happy with how this run turned out.

The only way to control the speed of this level is to switch between firepower and cape as little as possible.  Taking the upper path with the munchers allowed me to avoid a lot of that, and to get that first star, I couldn't take the upper path at the beginning with the flying koopas.

Although staying at the top of this level and flying over the bricks would have saved around 90 frames in lag, the entire level would have consisted of me flying at the top of the screen with less enemy stomping.

	"I don't know how or why the glitch at the beginning works, but it does.  Also, by jumping at the exact frames, the speed of flight is kept, even though I am not flying.  This trick is used in several other levels as well.  Running up to flight speed again is slower than completing the level in the way I did.  There is some avoidable lag at the expense of entertainment - spinning and stomping the bats caused around 90 frames of lag, as opposed to avoiding them.  I also had to wait one frame on one of the later jumps - this causes the screen to scroll up to me so that I am able to pass over the tallest columns.

Luckily, I can still fly through part of the level.

Unfortunately, because of the speed of the spiked pillars, flying through them is just not possible.

The layout of the game takes full advantage of both the mechanics of Super Mario World and the additions of Super Demo World, and the levels can get extremely complicated.
