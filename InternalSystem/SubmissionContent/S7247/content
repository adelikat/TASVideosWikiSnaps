	"The Final Fantasy Legend, also known as Makai Toushi SaGa in Japan, is a Game Boy RPG. It is the first entry in teh long running SaGa series and has a lot of strange and esoteric mechanics. You can form a team of up to four party members consisting of humans, mutants, and monsters. Each character type get stronger by wildly different means. The goal of this movie is to beat the game mostly as intended by getting the 4 Spheres and beat Ashura and the Creator, though there are still a few unintended skips done along the way.

	"I started making this movie when I saw the detailed RNG and run notes by catklaw on the game's SRC board. From there I decided on taking a monster raising approach to handle most of the major fights. Once I started the run I then discovered the TASVideos thread where FatRatKnight and Bobo the King were working on a run that just involves just mutants. Their efforts was what led to how most of the game's RNG works and is what I extensively used to verify if I hit the right RNG values. While their approach for the game involves just using mutants, I stuck with my strategy since there was less inventory and money management that I had to worry about.

	"When in-game, resetting on different frames gives different non-battle RNG values. This is frame dependent and might also be hardware dependent. The initial RNG values also differs between Game Boy, Game Boy Color / Game Boy Player, and Super Game Boy, as well as if the palette is changed in Game Boy Color mode. Either way this is abused to get RNG rolls to learn certain mutant abilities and force certain meat drops.

This can be controlled somewhat to get desirable abilities or stat ups, and can be sped up with multiple mutants in the party. The party order is important in how rolls are done. For example, if an ability is to come for the second mutant after battle, it's potentially advantageous to swap around party members so that the desired character gets the ability. This is used to give one mutant both the Telepor and death Gaze abilities.

To simplify it, the result type is dependent on the current monster's type and the drop meat's monster type. Then the level of monster is taken by the highest monster level between the two. If the result doesn't find a matching level the game will first check one level above for a valid monster before checking lower levels. This check is utilized as much as possible to get the useful monster abilities for the mandatory fights as soon as possible.

Once inside the cave there is another party swap after the 1st Zombie fight to move Buzz at the front to keep everyone alive again. After the 2nd Zombie fight the group interacts with the nearby NPC to initiate a fight with a Lizard group with various sizes. This is done 4 times.

Buzz's last transformation in this section of the game will be a Catwoman, done on the 2nd floor of Castle Sword. An RNG manipulation and swap between Fio and Jeff is used before the KingSwrd fight to get Fio some more Mana growth. KingSwrd falls immediately to a death gaze and the party gets the King sword.

While the 1st fight could have fewer enemies the fight was fast enough thanks to death gaze and Buzz's sheer strength. Another RNG manipulation is done right before the Steward for even more Mana growth. The Steward fight is incredibly easy since he didn't get a chance to use his gun before getting smacked once. Once the party receives the King shield from him, they move over to the Castle Town statue and use each piece of the armor to receive the 1st Sphere. The party then teleports back to Base Town for the last time which also skips the Gen-Bu fight that would otherwise be triggered by stepping on certain tiles. They heal up once more to recover death gaze charges and finally enter the Tower.

The Sea Palace introduces an incredibly annoying new RNG factor: NPC movement. I extensively use this to move the NPC away from the room with the Blue Key twice.
