	"Street Fighter 2010, is a side-scrolling action platform game released by Capcom for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1990. It was marketed as a science fiction-themed spin-off to the 1987 arcade game Street Fighter. The English localization of 2010 changed the name and backstory of the main character to imply that he was Ken from the original Street Fighter, whereas the protagonist in the Japanese version is a completely unrelated character named Kevin. 2010 is of a different genre from the traditional Street Fighter games, which are competitive fighting games.

	"Regarding full completion criteria, and comparing the published movie to the current one - I don't think there really are any good definitions of full completion for this game. There are no warps in this game, and this movie does not warp past stages (it just uses a trick to clear each stage significantly faster than intended), so stage count cannot be used to divide the two movies. There are also no permanent pickups to collect throughout the game for a 100% definition (all power-ups are lost on death). In any case, as long as there is no clear consensus on what would constitute a full completion movie, I cannot count any existing movie as one, and the published movie does not have sufficient entertainment ratings to justify a separate publication entirely on the basis of "containing more gameplay". As such, accepting this submission as an improvement to the
