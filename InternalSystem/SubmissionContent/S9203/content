	"Another World is an action platform game where you have to figure out how to solve environmental puzzles and engage in tactically tricky combat in order to progress through the game. The game was ported to many systems, and the GBA port is the version with the extra level.  The GBA port is a homebrew port (available here:

	"Overall I found the movie is very optimized, a satisfying watch for any casual audience member and more than enough for acceptance. However, since I know the same engine was used for this port too, I'd like to point to some parts of the movie I'm pretty sure could be improved:

[pre 
	"Frame 1164: It is possible to swim faster by tapping L/R and advancing diagonally
	$LF
	"Frame 6191: If done optimally, it is possible to drop the cage before the guard shoots
	$LF
	"Frame 6907: Pretty cool that you figured out you can skip the gun. In older ports, the game remembers you don't have it.
	$LF
	"Frame 8053: (Bot-only) it is possible to charge while running, saving some frames
	$LF
	"Frame 8684: It should be possible to force friendly alien to rush a bit more during this section
	$LF
	"Frame 11250: (Bot-only) it is possible to charge while running, saving some frames
	$LF
	"Frame 12578: It is possible to pass this section without shooting, or only shooting once
	$LF
	"Frame 13469: It is possible to pass this section without shooting, or only shooting once
	$LF
	"Frame 14000: It is possible to awaken the bat without turning around

	"Frame 15950: (Bot-only) it is possible to charge while running, saving some frames
	$LF
	"Frame 18330: You don't really need to kill this guard
	$LF
	"Frame 18861: Here a better execution allows for passing this guard without the first shield
	$LF
	"Frame 20725: (Bot-only) Here it is possible to kill the two guards with a running charged shot
	$LF
	"Frame 20934: If you shoot the skeleton, the friendly alien will finish his fight earlier and follow you closer
	$LF
	"Frame 21664: It is possible to pass these guards without killing them
	$LF
	"Frame 22880: It is possible to pass this whole section without pulling the level
	$LF
	"Frame 25988: This is a very complicated section, but you can pass it without kill so many enemies. Only a couple are really necessary.
