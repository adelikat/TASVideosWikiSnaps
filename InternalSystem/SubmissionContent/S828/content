	"The making of this movie, which is v6 in my personal numbering,
	$LF
	"started in February 2005 when Finalfighter contacted me and
	$LF
	"demonstrated a ceiling-jump-wrap trick, which you will see
	$LF
	"near the end of the Cutman stage.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Before that, I was making v5, very slowly, in hopes that I will
	$LF
	"somehow be able to improve v4 by about 5 seconds.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Soon thereafter, I found out that it's actually possible to get
	$LF
	"the Magnet Beam from the Elecman stage without possessing either
	$LF
	"the Hyper Arm (Gutsman's weapon) or the Elec Beam (Elecman's weapon).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I did some testing, and found out that despite the fact that Elecman's
	$LF
	"killing takes tons of time with the regular weapon, the gain gotten
	$LF
	"by using Magnet Beam in the Gutsman stage still outweighs this loss.

	" FAQ
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Q: Why did you shoot three elec beams in Wily1?
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"A: To dispose of obstacles ahead. There are three blocks that can be either picked up or electrocuted away.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Q: Can't you zip through <...>? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"A: Please read the 
	[a href=/GameResources/NES/Rockman 
		"Rockman Tricks
	]a
	" page in detail to analyze whether your idea is feasible. Although it's possible that I've overlooked some possibility, most ideas just don't work, and the reasons to that are explained on that page.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Q: About drops from killed enemies...
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"A: The type of the drop doesn't depend on the type of enemy killed. The only thing it depends on is the "random seed", which is a number that changes 60 times in second and is affected by the number of objects on screen at each moment, the screen scrolling position and other volatile factors. The statistical chance to get a big weapon refill from a killed enemy is 2:100, regardless of the enemy (unless the enemy never drops anything, like bosses).
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"In this movie, I delegated most of the weapon refill acquisitions to 
	[a href=/NesVideoAgent 
		"BisqBot
	]a
	". Details on this can be found 
	[a href=/forum/viewtopic.php?t=260&start=340 
		"at this forum discussion

]p
[p 
	"Q: A jump in the Cutman stage looks like it's not as fast as possible.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"A: There is delay. Rockman has to move 1 pixel to the right, or otherwise he'll miss the platform on the right when he jumps. Unfortunately Rockman starts walking slowly, and that the room is lagging heavily doesn't help at all. But it's still the fastest way in that place.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Q: What 
	[em 
		"is
	]em
	" that trick you use in Wily2, alternating between the screen edges?
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"A: Please read the 
	[a href=/GameResources/NES/Rockman 
		"Rockman Tricks
	]a
	" page in detail ― it explains everything you need to know. Particularly, this trick is the "horizontal screen wrapping" phenomenon. The wall is first entered using a magnet beam, later using the "grabbing the ladder too high" trick, by pressing up+down at the top of the ladder.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Q: Why do you pause during two jumps in the Cutman stages? You're not avoiding damage there...
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"A: Actually I am, but the point is that the room is lagging heavily (the game is handling many onscreen objects plus the one magnet beam from previous room). Pausing gives some lag-free movement (because some collision checks aren't done during pause) at the cost of two frames, and in that room it was worth it.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Q: Why is the graphics broken at...?
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"A: (At Gutsman stage) Because I zip so fast that a special object, that was supposed to remap the graphics of the enemies, never activated.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"A: (At Fireman stage) Because the game creators assumed that nobody will ever catch the boss's weapon while a ground flame is still active on the screen. The graphics used by the flame is remapped as the "CLEAR POINTS" text graphics.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"A: (Last battle) Because the game creators assumed that nobody will ever beat Wily while the plastic pieces are still on the screen. The graphics used by those pieces get remapped as Wily's graphics.
