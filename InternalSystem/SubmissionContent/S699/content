	"I want to thank Hoe for bringing to my attention the awesome power of the walljump in this game. Basically, if you press L near a left wall or R near a right wall, the game will sometimes think you're standing on ground. When this happens, Pugsley can jump from the wall. This allows for a huge amount of shortcuts, both big and small ones.

	"I selected the hardest difficulty so fast, it's almost impossible to see it. This means Pugsley gets only one heart, and if he gets hit even once, he's dead.
