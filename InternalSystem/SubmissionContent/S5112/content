	"Oh, and the game lags a lot. Like, a lot. Like it lags so much that 95% of rerecords are to make the game not lag. The other 5% are to make the game not lag as well. The last 50% are figuring out where in the lag you can jump. In total, 400% of the re-records are dedicated to lag.

	"The X, Y, and B buttons are used for manipulation. The X button is used in most cases due to being a dedicated Force/Thermal Detonator button, which means it's blank input most of the time, which allows for easy manipulation without losing any time. The two most common things to manipulate throughout the run are item drops and enemy spawns. There are two types of enemies in the game. Fixed encounters, and 'random' encounters. Generally speaking, every enemy you see in the run is a fixed encounter. If you don't see an enemy in the run, congratulations!

Enemies can be despawned via shooting in a specific part of the screen just before reaching their spawn point, allowing me to disable some laggy turret enemies. For the boss I manipulated a Thermal Detonator off a crate to skip his first phase, leaving him incredibly vulnerable.

[p 
	"Samsara Sidenote: I wanna talk about that tricky jump a little bit, since it's the last actual thing I can do to provide my usual snarky wit in this submission text of a run that technically isn't even mine. The jump in particular skips a long wait for a platform to slowly move back and forth a couple of times before going up. It looks like a normal, easy jump, but it's anything but: For some reason, under specific and not well understood circumstances, Han actually jumps much higher than normal to make that jump. Remember in my old submissions where I had a constant theme of figuring something out and then having no idea how it worked? Well, it's like that, except this isn't my submission technically. Welp.
