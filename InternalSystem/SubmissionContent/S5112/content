The jump in particular skips a long wait for a platform to slowly move back and forth a couple of times before going up. It looks like a normal, easy jump, but it's anything but: For some reason, under specific and not well understood circumstances, Han actually jumps much higher than normal to make that jump. Remember in my old submissions where I had a constant theme of figuring something out and then having no idea how it worked? Well, it's like that, except this isn't my submission technically. Welp.
