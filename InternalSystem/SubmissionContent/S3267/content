	"The finding of this trick is the reason that Aqfaq started making this movie. By having no input on the first input frame of a new level, and a straigh-up jump on the second input frame, Taz is teleported to the coordinates he had when the previous level ended. Taz also has to be on the ground when the previous level ends. In the previous movie, there were warps in Temple 1 and Temple 3. In those cases the warp was activated by taking damage on the second input frame.

If you teleport to coordinates which are outside the level boundaries, bad things (death) or not so bad things (walk into level from the right side) happen.

For one jump of 40 frames, that's 2^40=1,099,511,627,776 possible jumping patterns... not including the spin, which sets your upward speed to 1.5 pixels if it is greater than that. Have fun!
