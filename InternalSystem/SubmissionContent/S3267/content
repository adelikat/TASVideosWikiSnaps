	") faster than the previous episode.

	$LF

	"Since the previous movie also uses the warp glitch (although sparingly), this movie should replace that one. A new warp-less movie can be made if there is any interest (probably not...)

	$LF

[h3 
	"Warp
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The finding of this trick is the reason that Aqfaq started making this movie. By having no input on the first input frame of a new level, and a straigh-up jump on the second input frame, Taz is teleported to the coordinates he had when the previous level ended. Taz also has to be on the ground when the previous level ends. In the previous movie, there were warps in Temple 1 and Temple 3. In those cases the warp was activated by taking damage on the second input frame. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Depending on the layout of the previous level none, some or all of the next level can be skipped. If you teleport to coordinates which are outside the level boundaries, bad things (death) or not so bad things (walk into level from the right side) happen. If the ground hasn't been set as lethal you can drop through the bottom and wrap around to the top, but that takes a lot of time (65000 pixels to fall through). 
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Higher max speed
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The usual max speed is ~9 pixels/frame. If you turn around while still spinning, the max speed rises to ~12 pixels/frame. For this reason you will see us double back pretty often. If you exit the spin, or lose contact with the ground, the max speed will go back to ~9 pixels/frame.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Go through corners
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This is only used in Caves 2. You don't need to bring the level-operated elevators all the way down. If you build up some speed by revving you can go through corners that are impassable if walking or spinning at start-up speed.

[p 
	"Due to the cart-riding this level cannot be warped through and has to be played in full. If you are interested in improving this movie, here is where you should start: write a bot which tries the gazillions of combinations of jumping patterns for the second rubber elevator. Downward acceleration is 200 subpixels/frame^2 when not holding jump, and 76 subpixels/frame^2 when holding jump. For one jump of 40 frames, that's 2^40=1,099,511,627,776 possible jumping patterns... not including the spin, which sets your upward speed to 1.5 pixels if it is greater than that. Have fun!

	"The object at the start of the boss fight is to take damage as soon as possible, because Taz is locked in the "holding sign" pose for a good while when he lands. The fastest way to take damage was the bat. The boss does not give damage before he starts spinning, and the flame on the right has a very long damage animation.

I was also still a pretty new TASer at the time so I didnt understand all the concepts of TASing that much as I do now. As a result, I didnt really do that much work on the movie. Due to several other complications, we lost interest in mid 2010 and stopped all work.

The portions I can remember doing are the tree boss, the second half of Caves 2 (after the bat stomps), the end of River 2, the plant boss, and Temple 2 (together with Sonikkustar). I wrote most of the script for tracking movement (position, speed, acceleration) and identifying "real" lag frames.
