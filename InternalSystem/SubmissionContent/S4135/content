	"I decided to TAS the hardest difficulty of Push Mode, and it did go well! However, some luck manipulation was used to make the CPU act dumb at about second 18. Anyways the duration of the TAS would be about 17 seconds if we didn't count the time I was idling around. But meh, its just almost 20 seconds long.
