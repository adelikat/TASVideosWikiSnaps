	"It took me about 2 years to finish my MM4 run. However, It is not the few difficulties I met during the make process that took my lots of time but my work in the real life. I can finish my run successfully in this case because of those who helped me a lot. Thanks to:
	$LF
	"Glitchman, Finalfighter, Paosidufygth and Baxter for giving many glitches;
	$LF
	"mtvf1 and Pike for helping me to check;
	$LF

	"The re-record count of new MM4 run is about 80000(30000+ in this file and 40000+ in other experimental files). Although the number is not very large, I am confident with the quality.
	$LF

	"Compared with Glitchman's run made 5 years ago, there are few changes on route. Now the order is Pharaoh Man - Drill Man - Bright Man - Ring Man - Dust Man - Skull Man - Toad Man - Dive Man. This order is not necessary. For example, Drill Man can be placed in any position between Pharaoh Man and Skull Man. Toad Man and Dive Man can interchange. I took this order because it was with the best luck in all my experiments.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"5.Get scrolls in advance in the first 8 stages(In fact, it takes more time if including time the player spends switching weapons. However, it can help reduce lags. So it saves few frames in all). 
	$LF

[p

	"Restore the energy of balloon by 20 points instead of 28. Increase one time of attacking the second boss. The damages are 3+1+1+3+3+3.

	": This TAS has practically everything. Great action, a decent and consistent pace, good displays of ammo management and control over the game, and tons of little tricks and glitches that cut down repetitiveness, make boss battles fast, and make the whole run a joy to watch. The action is technically slick and the game's wide array of time-saving glitches and tricks is used masterfully.
