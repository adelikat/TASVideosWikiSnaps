	" is a 2009 Sega Genesis / Mega Drive homebrew platformer about... well, Pringles. It has 9 levels, which are split into 3 worlds, no music and only 3 sound effects. You play as the pre-simplicity era Pringles mascot who has to bounce on Pringles to reach the goal in every level.

	", as well as better lag reduction and a fixed movement error in Basil & Tomato 1.

[div class=p 
	"The other 31 frames saved are unnoticeable to the naked eye, mainly lag reduction. Tompa discovered a few months ago that when Mr Pringles' speed is 0, the game lags 1 frame less than if he's moving. This is used to save small amounts of time here and there during vertical sections.
