	"Azure Dreams is a random dungeon RPG (roguelike) where the floors are randomly generated. You control the main character, Koh, who trains monsters while obtaining riches while in the Monster Tower, and builds buildings and gets girlfriends while in the town of Monsbaiya. The ultimate goal though is to reach the top of Monster Tower, the 40th floor.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Due to the way the game works, it is extremely difficult (without cheating) to reach the top of Monster Tower on the first try unassisted. Extreme luck would be required, as monsters on the high floors kill an underleveled adventurer (and his trained but underleveled monsters) in one hit. Note that it's never game over when killed, you just lose all items you brought in the tower and have to start over from the first floor, if you want to try again.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Of course, with TAS, anything goes. Not only does this adventurer not pick up any items (except at the plot-driven ending), he sends his starter monster (Kewne) home right on the first floor, then scales the tower to the 40th floor armed with nothing but a Pita Fruit. Oh, and there is a way to get around the "final boss". It's required, actually.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"So, how does such an adventurer survive, when all enemies on floors 15 and above not named "Pulunpa" kill him in one hit? In a TAS, apparently by manipulating the location of the elevator to the next floor so it is close by. But that is not all.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Every stage has trap tiles, whether it is relatively harmless like Upheaval or Reversal, or ridiculously deadly like Monster Den (this is very rare, fortunately). The traps are randomly scattered and only occur in rooms rather than passageways, although occasionally a trap room is designated which contains about a dozen traps.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"One type of trap, Go Up, sends Koh or any enemy to the floor above; this is a useful substitute for the elevator, and is faster by about 100 frames. Koh can also run very fast (except when a non-sleeping enemy is nearby), so even if the Go Up trap is not close, he can run to it, and it may be faster than manipulating the elevator. Of course, you don't see traps before you run into them, so how do you know where they are?
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Using memory watch, of course. I found character coordinates, elevator coordinates, trap coordinates, and trap IDs (traps are dynamically allocated but are always seeded into one of about twelve slots, maybe more, all at increments of 24). Go Up, the important one, has a trap ID of 184.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"So to manipulate, I use waiting frames, and check if it places a Go Up trap (preferred) nearby, or the elevator nearby. Since there are many addresses involved, I only check the trap IDs, and see if any of them are 184 before checking trap coordinates. Note that if the current level has Go Up traps, the trap ID of 184 may remain; I can weed these out by seeing that the trap coordinates don't change. This of course assuming that the game is not evil enough to place Go Up traps in the same spot on two consecutive floors.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Of course manipulating the elevator or Go Up trap close by is of no use if there happens to be a non-sleeping enemy in the way.
