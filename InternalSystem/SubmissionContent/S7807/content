	"Started this TAS to learn more about the game when on my quest for WR. Not sure if there's much room for improvement. Even a minor change will require a rewrite of everything after the change because of the RNG system. I used a lot of arbitrary inputs to alter item and soldier positions so the routes could be clean.

	"In an attempt to discover what was the fastest possible last input that could coast to the end game screen, since that's how TAS length is measured, I discovered something interesting. If you truncate the movie from frame 315159, the last three buildings are destroyed by soldiers with dynamite while you stay safe from the police car. Destroying fewer buildings would allow too many soldiers to spawn and the grenades will kill you. Eventually a helicopter bomb will knock you down from your safe spot, but there's a strange glitch where you become immune to the police car's damage and push back. Without that glitch, I do not think a game over could be avoided without additional inputs.
