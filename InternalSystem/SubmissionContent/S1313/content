	" The Bonus Rounds
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"I said this game was almost perfect for TASing. Here's the main problem; in development the creators of this game must have thought "hmmm, we have to find out a way that the character can get stronger after each level" and rather than finding some normal way to do it they did something else. Throughout the levels, when you kill an enemy, you get a coin, and after the level you use these coins on a slot machine to play for more lives and a bigger health bar. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Now, when i first saw this i thought 'great, luck manipulation heaven' WRONG. From my testing i could'nt find out what stimulated different results; i took it from inside the previous level and played to that moment and still got the same results. My guess is that it is manipulated by the number of coins (i'll get back to this) or it is predetermined at the start of the level/game.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"However, i want to make this loud and clear;
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"THE AMOUNT OF TIME LOST THROUGH THIS IN VERY SMALL INDEED.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In total it is perhaps a few seconds. After winning a line on the slots the line flashes for about a second or so before playing your next line, if i were able to manipulate it i would win nothing to avoid this flashing time. However, the delay between when the slots stop spinning and being able to play the next line is longer than from the flashing to being able to play the next line. Therefore, time lost is probably no more than a few second over the course of the run, considering that only five of these bonus rounds are played.
