[ul

		" The game runs at 15 fps. I'll be using the term "movement frame" to describe the 4 frames involved in each action.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Because of the low fps, there is no lag in the game.
		$LF

	[li 
		" By keeping A and/or B pressed after exiting the helicopter, you'll continue flying in a straight line and are in an invincible state. You'll stop flying if A and B are released, but are then unable to interact with the environment. This means it can't be used in areas 3 and 4, since you need to kill a boss at the end to proceed. This can be fixed by dying, which resets to the initial state, but it doesn't save time to do so.
		$LF

		" Information about upgrades etc can be found here: https://kb.speeddemosarchive.com/Ikari_Warriors/Game_Mechanics

	[li 
		" The first frame of diagonal movement is more efficient than the subsequent ones (except for the helicopter, for which all diagonal movements are the same). Whenever possible, I therefore move in a "diagonal, up, diagonal, up, diagonal, up" pattern to exploit this behavior.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" The "cooldown" time for the default grenades are shorter than with the B-upgrade. The default grenades make the stages more challenging and slightly slower, but this is easily paid off by the time saved on the bosses of area 3 and 4.

	"After having speedrun this game on console, I thought it would be a fitting game to try my first TAS on. While the game has a well deserved reputation of being unplayably hard, it was a fairly straight-forward TAS. My goal throughout was to not lose any time due to random soldiers, which was also achieved. All detours/diagonal walking seen in the run was because of the environment or because of fixed spawns.

		" The second half is very unexciting because of the flying glitch. Unfortunately, you have no control over the character when flying, so there is not much to do in terms of entertainment.

It took almost half the stage before I was fully upgraded (the S on the bridge was the last upgrade). Once fully upgraded, I didn't have to worry about upgrades for the rest of the game.

		" The section leading up to the helicopter is extremely critical. The garbage sprites in the helicopter area are always spawned there, but their content depends on how you played from the barrel section and onwards. The fuel drop also needs to be in the right location. Because of the strict requirements, I had to sacrifice one movement frame here (possibly two).

		" I have some regrets with how the helicopter section in area 1 turned out. In my first iteration of the area, I managed to fly over the whole water section in the helicopter before entering the flying state. When redoing the area, I was unable to get this to work (the jump to the exit got messed up). If this could be overcome, half a minute of the flying could be done in the helicopter instead, with the possibility to practice some target shooting.
