	"At first, I thought there was a gameplay difference between Mario and Luigi. But now, I know that there really is no difference between Mario and Luigi in this game.

	"In an any% speedrun, you take a cannon from world 1 to world 5, another cannon from world 5 to world 8, and complete world 8. This run does that as quickly as possible.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In order to achieve fastest time, I relied a lot on watching the addresses of Luigi's speed.  That way, I can be assured that I gained speed for the most possible number of frames and lost speed for the least possible number of frames.  This is especially used in levels where you generally go from left to right.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Note: As long as the jump to the flag gives 1000 points or less, there is no time loss.  So I used the flag to aid in luck manipulation
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The most frustrating part of making this run was the manipulation of the movement of the Item Boxes and Hammer Bros.  I actually stopped the run for a few months because I couldn't figure it out. That is, until I learned how to use RAM watch.  Using RAM watch, I was able to narrow the addresses down to a few.  I used them to see what address values to avoid.  If certain combinations of values led to undesirable map movement, I would try to avoid that combination of values as I play the level.  Whether these results are just coincidence or not, I cannot be certain.  One thing I do know is that it helped me.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I used the following tricks/techniques in this run:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- Corner Boost: By pressing the jump for a certain number of frames at certain times, you would miss the block but get a small boost.  Usually this leads to .5-1.5 frame saved
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- Super Corner Boost: By ducking, you can jump at a block.  If done right, Mario/Luigi would straighten up just as he hits the block, doubling or tripling his speed for 1 to 2 frames.  This can lead to 1-3 frames saved per boost
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- Shell Jump: Similar to a trick involving Diddy Kong in Donkey Kong Country.  When you are in the shell and going off a cliff, you can let go of the dash button and jump. Even though you are not technically touching any solid ground, you can still jump.  This was done once in my run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- Rope Jump/Rope Boost: As Luigi grabs a rope, he gets a small boost in speed to anywhere between low 50 to high 80 depending on where on the rope.  However, when the rope is grabbed, Luigi loses most of his speed.  So, if you jump just as you are about to grab the rope, you would get the boost and jump off the rope without losing speed.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- Delayed Cliff Hanging: Throwing an item delays Luigi's cliff hanging.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- Second Wall Jump: This is usually possible after a normal wall jump as mini-Mario/Luigi.  After this, if you jump at a certain frame to do a second wall jump, you jump upwards.  This is useful in gaining vertical ground (especially if you cannot reach it normally with a wall jump).  One can tell that a second wall-jump is possible if Mario/Luigi's speed for one frame suddenly becomes a value in the 20s (this is the frame to jump at)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- Ducking Direction Change: When running in one direction, duck, then turn the other way.  You can change directions very quickly without sliding
