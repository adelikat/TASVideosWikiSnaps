	"In this game, lag is prevalent and can be caused by enemies, shooting, RNG, and other things. Through a specific style of play I created, where occasionally you shoot, spam shoot, or just don't shoot at all, I have crafted a run where the X movement is always maxed to the right constantly, and where the lag pattern never deviates from the "one on one off" style, by avoiding all lag throughout the entire run.

	"Additionally, the collision in this game is broken so a lot of the time I manipulate this to go under enemies that do not cause lag, while avoiding this strategy to be able to kill enemies that do cause lag.
