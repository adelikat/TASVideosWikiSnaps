	"This is it. Second version of Mega Man 4. There are a lot of things to mention but we would like to first thank Shinryuu for discovering how to skip the first Hippo in Ring Man and taking hits in Pharaoh Man in order to slide on the spikes. Also Finalfighter for finding that fine trick in Cossack 4 were he zipped through the wall. Everyone who cheered and supported us (you know who you are), it meant a lot. Special thanks goes out to Bisqwit who helped and guided me in Pharaoh Man and Cossack 4 and Baxter for making me always be sharp and keeping my motivation up.
