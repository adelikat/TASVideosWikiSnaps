	"so obviously there's alot I have to say about this run.  I started back in january where I asked GarbitheGlitcheress for help on this category.  She said that she had made a movie of this category before but didnt think it was optimal enough for submission.  I took that movie file to make it as optimal as I could possibly get it to.  I added a bunch of skips, learned how speed actually works in this game, and overall made everything alot smoother.  This wouldn't be possible without any of her help, so I thank her for that.

This item you lose if you take damage, and the developers never intended that you would be able to reach any of the bosses in the game with it, so they didnt bother to nuke the sword's ability to kill bosses almost instantly.  the sword seems to ignore i-frames after you do damage to a boss, which makes them die instantly.

	"the SNES run is used for this category because it allows you to stack 2 speedshoe powerups.  Gomez runs at a max speed of 2 pixels per frame, when he grabs a set of speedshoes, that increases to 3 pixels per frame.  You can then grab another set to get a maximum speed of 4 pixels per frame.  not only does this make Gomez move extremely fast, but it also allows us to do Zips.

	"when you jump at a wall at a specific angle while going either 3 or 4 pixels per frame, gomez will momentarily clip into the wall until the game corrects itself.  what we can do here is as soon as gomez clips into the wall, press the oposite direction button.  this makes gomez zip upwards until he reaches a ledge.  in some rooms, you can zip up so high that you can end up on the bottom of the room, but the camera wouldnt correct itself.  this can be seen when we enter the tree level.  some areas dont allow you to zip up easily, so I didnt bother with them.

	"the game has counters that determine when for example gomez will jump from a speed of 1 pixel per frame to 2 pixels per frame.  the counters go like this:

[ul

		" countdown to 2 pixels: 8 frames

[div class=p 
	"the thing to note here is if gomez for example is traveling at a speed of 1 pixel per frame, but not for 8 frames where he would jump to 2 pixels per frame, the counter doesnt reset itself.  so you will have instances where as soon as gomez starts moving again, it would only take one frame to jump to 2 pixels per frame.
