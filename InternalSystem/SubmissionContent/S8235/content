	"Essentially, Alyosha's work affected RNG in a way that allows for finishing the 2nd stage faster by 5 frames.  As an added bonus, this also manages to finish stage 2 fast enough to save what appears to be a frame rule.  Finishing Stage 2 one frame later than Alyosha (while still 4 frames faster than the original submission) yields starting the final stage at the same frame as the original submission.  So Alyosha saved a total of 11 frames via the RNG manipulation/frame rule by beginning of the 3rd Stage.

This can be mitigated by re-manipulating the final level enemy movements so that Mario's original movements still work and the total time for the final stage unchanged from the submission.
