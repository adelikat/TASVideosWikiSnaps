	"102 Dalmatians speedrunning history began at the end of 2013. There were only two runs available online at that time, so the exploration of the game had only just begun. For the next 3 years, the run of the All Levels category was based on movement optimization with the use of a single OoB trick.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Then 2016 came, when SephJul found a method of clipping OoB using objects such as a puppy crate or enemy. This was a massive discovery as we realized how many places it could be applied. The search for more skips continued, finding more and more as time went on. Today, as we are reaching the limits of usable objects for this method of clipping, we are getting more creative with our ideas, leading to interesting optimizations and speed boosts.

This can easily be prevented by continuously holding the jump button. Doing that allows the puppy to gradually stop falling and begin to float upwards again, staying OoB. To intentionally fall down again, we simply need to roll. This is very convenient, as it’s easy to navigate in any direction.

		" Usually simple to do, but important for optimization as we can increase speed significantly in many places. We can simply land on a sloped surface and have our vertical falling speed converted to horizontal speed. The downwards speed is more important than the height of the incline. Some slopes are too steep, and are slippery. We can gain speed by sliding down the slope, and maintain the speed from the bottom with a roll.

			"Crate/Enemy Clips:
		]b
		" The most common way to get out of bounds. We take advantage of the hitbox around an object which tries to push the puppy away. We can use this when certain objects are close enough to a wall. Certain crates are in a usable position for this trick, while enemies can sometimes be manipulated to move their position. To do this trick, we position the puppy between the object and the wall. If we pivot in place without actually moving, the object’s hitbox attempts to push us away, which puts us partially into the wall. We complete the turn as certain angles increase the chances of clipping. At this point, we just need to jump to be pushed the rest of the way out.

	"There is a reason we refer to this run as ‘All Levels’ and not ‘Any%’. At the very beginning of the game, there is a major skip called the ‘Menu Warp’. It allows access to level 17 from the start menu. The skip is possible due to the 6 gameplay demos programmed into the game, which appear in a certain order after 33 seconds of player inactivity. When the demo fades out to go back to the start menu, we can buffer a pause. Selecting ‘Exit Level’ in the pause menu takes us to the level select menu with all levels unlocked up to that point in the game. By forgoing this skip, we are forced to play through every level in the game in order, but it makes for a much more fulfilling and entertaining run.
