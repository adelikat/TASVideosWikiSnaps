	"Kirby's Dream Land is the first game featuring Kirby, released for the Gameboy but with a distinct palette for the Gameboy Color. Kirby can't gain any power ups from enemy's in this game like he can in later games, but the other familiar Kirby mechanics like floating and inhaling enemies are there.

	"This run is ~2 seconds faster than MUGG's original. Each of the 2 Kracko fights are ~30 frames faster thanks to better RNG. Level 3 has a slight gameplay change allowing for a couple extra damage boosts. The Kracko re-fight stage is much faster for some reason saving ~20 frames. The King DeDeDe fight is improved by ~20 frames. Otherwise the run is a resync of MUGG's original. Overall though the run is longer due to increased lag.
