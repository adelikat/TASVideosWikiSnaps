	"Developed by Animation F/X and published by Apogee, Mystic Towers is an isometric action RPG released in 1994. You play as Baron Baldric, a geriatric wizard who must rid the twelve Lazarine Towers of all of their monsters to release his village from a curse.

	" Glitches + mechanics
	$LF

[p 
	"There are three goals for each level: kill all the monsters, destroy the generator with a bomb, and exit the tower.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Door Glitch
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"There are some special switches in this game that open one door and then close another. If this process is interrupted in the middle by a save/load screen or the main menu, the game doesn't like this very much. It seems harmless at first: both doors stay open or closed and the switch becomes inoperable. However, once another tower is started, all hell breaks loose. The game runs through a glitched-out list of doors to open and close. Some of these doors don't exist, as you'll see doors appearing on walls where they shouldn't be, or doors appearing out of bounds. This glitch can also cause fatal errors and massive graphical corruption. If you're lucky, in some towers, the list of doors will include the exit door. Since you always start out a tower right next to an exit door, this glitch becomes extremely useful as you can exit a tower immediately after you start it. There are seven towers in which this glitch can be helpful, with the other five towers' exit doors being uncooperative.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There are some negative side effects, but these can be dealt with. The only way to stop the glitch is to let it run its course. Bringing up a menu in the middle of a door glitch will pause the effects, but they will still continue when you start the next tower. Letting the glitch run wild can result in random doors throughout the tower closing, making the tower impossible to complete. It can often be useful to save and then open a practice tower to waste the rest of the door glitch duration.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Bomb Glitch
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"When a bomb trap is stepped on, a bomb is supposed to fall from the ceiling and explode when it hits the ground. If a menu is brought up just before the bomb hits the ground, the bomb will stop and lay on the ground. This object can be interacted with like a regular item, but it's just a dummy bomb since your bomb count doesn't increase. However, if you push the dummy bomb while walking over the bomb trap tile, an item in the room will be converted to a real bomb. The way the game figures out which item to convert is by starting at 0,0 (generally in isometric games this is the topmost corner) and scanning the room until it finds something. The amount of bombs you "get" depends on the item that's converted. If it's a spell or gold, the amount is the number of these items you would have received. If it's food, it's 1. If it's treasure, it can be some ludicrously high amount. In any case, this amount is purely cosmetic, as it will go back down to zero once it's used on a generator.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" RNG Manipulation
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The main usage of RNG in this game is enemy movement and spawn locations. Each enemy has a specific set of rooms that they can be in, and within that room there's a known starting tile with a random initial direction. If you're in a room within an enemy's range and they aren't in that room, there's a certain chance that they will enter your room at any given time. It can often be useful to manipulate enemy locations and initial directions to optimize their destruction. The enemy can also randomly change direction mid-battle, and this can also be manipulated. The following actions can have an effect on the RNG:

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The sole purpose of this visit to Rimm Fortress is to set up the door glitch. Backing into the menu before the door opening/closing sequence is finished preserves the glitch until the next new tower is started. The switch has to be pressed twice because just pressing it once causes crashes in the first tower.

	"The first tower skip. The door glitch causes some weird effects, such as doors with no switches connected to them closing, and opening/closing some doors that aren't supposed to exist. It's necessary to wait for a later opening of the exit door because the glitch continues into the next tower and can have bad side effects, namely a door on the second floor closing, making the tower impossible to complete.

[p 
	"Weaponry is scarce to start off, so it's important to use traps to our advantage. The fireball trap in room 10 one-shots the Flip-Flop, while the other two enemies are taken care of with bomb traps. With the reveal spell that was picked up earlier, we can get an early teleport spell and warp to the next floor.

The first one quickly visits the western section that's closed off to the rest of the floor and takes care of the Puffer while picking up some nice fireball spells. In the second visit, we pick up a convenient bomb and use it on the generator. The exploding generator produces good splash damage, so of course we have to use that as a quick damage source to hurt a Flip-Flop.

	"The Crocojaw is an interesting enemy in that you can jump on top of it and deal nice damage. This floor features the first usage of the bomb glitch, which converts the sulfur in room 18 into a bomb. Technically this gives us "8", but all of these will be expended with one usage. The glitched bomb pickup will save some backtracking in the next floor. Also, room 15 is the first occurence of a room in the quest cycle with a switch that opens one door and closes another in the same room. A save is made in front of the button that does this, and this will be our method of door glitch setup from now on.

[p 
	"Another linear floor with the generator tucked away in the corner. Here's a really unorthodox bomb glitch: the crown has to be dragged further up in the room to be prioritized for conversion, otherwise the game will freak out and convert some unknown object out of bounds. It gives you "254" bombs, which kind of breaks the HUD, but the game is a good sport about it. There's another switch that controls two doors, and we replace the save from tower 5 because it doesn't work on the next tower. Room 25 is fairly unique in that the fireballs randomly fire instead of being switch-activated, and they can be manipulated as well. The heal spell will be absolutely necessary later on, especially in dealing with a poisonous monster on the top floor.

[p 
	"The outer ring of this room can only be accessed via a teleport pad on the 2nd floor, so we have to backtrack to get here. There are two goals here: kill all the monsters and get the blue key. Conserving ammo is important here, so we do some difficult manipulation on the Clawfoot to kill it with bombs and we also take a beating trying to bomb the Shrimpion.

[p 
	"All the preparation in the tower was for this floor. The enemies have a ton of health and the spells you get are inadequate, so you kind of have to let them eat your face and then heal. Hunger and thirst also become an issue for the first time. Healing becomes necessary when fighting the Shrimpion, as you will get poisoned and die fairly quickly otherwise. The only mercy we get is a Meta-Power that we can use on the last enemy. We teleport back down to the exit and escape on the brink of death.

[p 
	"This one can be skipped using our new save file. If we had tried to use the old setup, nothing would happen here. The annoying thing about this exit is that even if you leave on the latest possible frame, you still get doors closing in the next tower.

	"Tower 10 is a breath of fresh air, surprisingly. If you know exactly what you're doing, it's one of the quicker towers to complete. Weapons and traps are plentiful, the teleport pads are conveniently placed, and the bomb situation (with a bomb glitch) couldn't be much better.

The reveal spell is required to open a couple doors here. The levitate spell is also immensely useful here. To get the Meta-Power in room 43, normally you'd have to cast 4 levitates, but you can get away with 3 by levitating directly underneath it and bopping it with your head.
