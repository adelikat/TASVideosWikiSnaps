	"Metro-Cross is a 1985 arcade game by Namco about the Runner running and jumping to the right for what I assume is glory since there's not really a plot otherwise. Across 32 rounds, the runner must avoid obstacles littering Metro and Cross the finish line before time runs out.

	"Holding right accelerates the Runner until he hits top speed. Standard running faster than jumping so jumping is kept down to only when it's needed. Slip zones (the green pads) and mice will slow down the Runner significantly, although mice can be shaken off by alternating left & right 3 times with 2 consecutive input frames per left and right movement. Skateboards let the Runner maintain running speed while going over slip zones, although the board is lost if the Runner jumps or is hit by obstacles other than mice.

	"As most obstacles are aligned with the grid of the floor, it's possible to run right between them without getting hit. This avoids jumping and saves a bit of time. This tip is actually told to the player in the Tips section of Namco Museum Vol.5 so at this point it's an intended mechanic.

[div class=p 
	"While jumping is normally slower, it's used to get speed boost off the ramps and poppers (confetti shooters). The boost from a popper only applies if the Runner jumps and lands on it while holding jump. For normal play holding the jump button the entire time will guarantee a boost off of a ramp and when landing on a popper. Occasionally, it's better to delay a boost from a ramp and instead press jump later as it allows for better positioning later in a round. The boost from these is significant enough that in some rounds slowing down briefly while in the air is done to maintain chaining jump boosts when it's a faster option.

	"Every round has a time limit. This can be frozen for 2 seconds by jumping onto either the blue or green cans, although it's not advised to do this with the green cans as they're the super drinks. The timer is counted down at the end of every round and the time to end the countdown is based on the remaining time. For every 4th round it's possible to skip a countdown cycle by getting a 0 second or a 16 second time remaining. For the other rounds a time of 14 seconds or lower maintains the minimum 2 countdown cycles due to the blinking time remaining going for 18 seconds.

[div class=p 
	"What this means is if there's a round whose remaining time at the end is at most 160 frames, or ~2.667 seconds, above those thresholds then slowing down actually saves time. This is most notable in round 23 where I used a "slower" take for this input file. I do have a faster in-game time completion but it was at 16.5 seconds, which is still just enough remaining time that it's faster to intentionally slow down to save some frames.

[div class=p 
	"Difficulty changes the obstacle aggressiveness and the starting time per round. The second one is more significant in how it affects the TAS. Having less time makes it easier to keep end of round countdown cycles low, but some rounds end up requiring crushing cans as there's otherwise not enough time to complete a given round even with perfect play.
