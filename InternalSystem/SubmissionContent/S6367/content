	"I was trying to look for a game to TAS, because Super Pang II just got ridiculously hard to TAS because the shot distance got cut by a bunch after the first level, and C64 Doc Cosmos just didn't work at all. So, when I noticed there was wishlists for virtually all the systems, I started to take a look at them. I took a look and decided that the ZX Spectrum didn't have many TASes for it, and took a look at a few games. Came across Tapper by looking through the long list, was like "Hey, I know that game, and I've played it before."
