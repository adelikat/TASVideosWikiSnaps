	"Its been over a year since I TAS'ed this game, and I even forgot about it. Until I stumbled across this while checking my usbs for WIPS. The main reason for the long haitus is due to the insane difficulty to beat the first form of the final boss. I took over 20k rerecords, and still couldn't get it right. So, I gave up. But then, just earlier this week, I came across my old wip, and decided to investigate what causes the weird (and awfully boring) warp glitch. I found out that sometimes, certain values get "carried over". In this case, the balloon status got carried to the next demo.

	"How does this relate to the 3 minute improvement? Well, I tried saving the game, to see what else gets carried over. And yes, you can save the game - Simply pause the game, and turn it off. I found out boss damage, conversations, level layouts, etc get carried over if you interrupt the save. So I abused it to death in this run. BTW, I want to have this run obsolete the current run, as based on a earlier WIP I found, a glitchless, warpless run is really long and not worth doing considering the difficulty in it.

	"This is where the save file I made a

	" demo back becomes useful. I carried the entire stage/demo/whatever to the second room, and attacked moe. This confuses the game to start the conversation with the second form of the last boss, and I get warped to the battle. Interestingly, it's faster to have a legit fight than it is to fight using glitches.

	"The final form's "fireball" status is avoided entirely by carrying over Starfy's position and the boss's vulnerability to unfairly win. Yeah, it's cheap, but at least I don't have to wait for him to shoot his firey balls.
