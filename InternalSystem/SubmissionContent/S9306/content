Previous attempts required either an extra turn, a red candy used in turn 2 or a DK space to get their second star. To the best of my knowledge this is the first Star Battle Arena TAS with a board layout that has two King Boo rooms less than ten spaces away from the start (and with a coin block on the way). In 291 manually explored layouts, I have only found 8 of them which could be completed in two turns: 7 of them with a DK space, and only 1 with two King Boo rooms accessible in one turn and with a coin block on the way (which was the one used in this TAS). Although this layout was not perfect, it was enough to save at least eight seconds over all previous attempts, sometimes even more. See the

However, if you are able to throw each dice individually and lock their result, then the number of expected rerolls can be decreased dramatically. In this example you reroll one dice until you get a 10, lock it then roll another dice, and so on. Now you would expect 9 rerolls per dice, which totals 27 rerolls on average instead of the former 999 ones! This is what I call splitting pseudo-random events.

If you set a budget of 10 waiting frames max, the dice result only changes every other frame, so you only have access to at most 6 scenarios (by waiting 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 frames respectively). However, assuming waiting at the player turn banner has a completely different impact on the RNG, any waiting time at it will lead to a new branch of scenarios with at most 6 of them in it. For example if you wait exactly 2 frames at the player turn banner, you will have access to at most 5 additional scenarios within the same 10-frame budget (by waiting 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 frames at the dice roll respectively). If you do the math, this leads to at most 6+5+5+4+4+3+3+2+2+1+1 = 36 scenarios total, which makes it much more likely to get your desired result within a small number of waiting frames!

Instead of having your waiting spots one at a time in a sequence, you consider them “in parallel” when assigning your waiting frame budget. This allows you to branch as much as possible within the currently remaining budget at every waiting spot in your group which, even with a small budget, greatly increases the number of explorable scenarios before the next pseudo-random event happens.

So this explains why increasing the number of grouped waiting spots has such a dramatic effect on the number of explorable scenarios. For example, starting from a budget of 10 waiting frames, there are 11 explorable scenarios with a single waiting spot. With two grouped waiting spots, this is multiplied by (10+1+1)/2 = 6, so 66 explorable scenarios!

Then waiting 5 frames at the former should produce the same result as waiting 3 frames at the latter, with 15 RNG rerolls total. In practice I have not been able to tell that such a case is happening, at least within a frame budget of 20 or less. This is a good sign that grouping waiting spots has worked as expected for the most part. And, other than increasing the time you are spending on RNG manipulation, I feel that there is no downside in attempting these waiting spot groupings.

	"Instead of going first and dropping a Twice candy in turn 1, you can go second and drop a Bitsize candy. After using it in turn 2, it grants you 3 coins for each space crossed during the turn. So in turn 1 you roll a 4 or a 5 and drop a Bitsize candy. And in turn 2 you use the candy and aim for the DK space. Then you will be able to buy a first star at the middle-right spawn and a second star wherever it spawns. To the best of my knowledge this is the most RTA viable way to complete this board in two turns. On top of being one of my favorite strategies in the game, it would have been the opportunity to use a yellow candy in the TAS. Unfortunately the DK space animation was a bit too long and made this strategy slower by a few seconds. See

	"Previous strategies went second in order to drop the Thrice candy in turn 1 and have the COM player roll low numbers each turn. However, the board is just long enough to force a completion in at least three turns. While this “going second” strategy made COM player turns much shorter, it was not enough to compensate for an extra COM player turn. I experimented with the Dolphin event, which moves you twenty spaces further within a relatively short time. But it did not make a significant difference from the base “going second” strategy.

This triggers the Kamek event, which moves the cooking car next to the start. This allows you to drop a Thrice candy in turn 1, use it in turn 2 and roll a triple 7 to get 100 bonus coins and reach Holly Koopa directly. Unfortunately the happening cutscene is way too long to make this strategy faster in real time. See

In the best case scenario this allows you to win the board by only investing 13 coins: 1 in the top hotel, 1 in the right hotel and 11 in the left hotel in order to barely beat the 10 coins invested by the AI while upgrading this last hotel.

[div class=p 
	"Short term there are two improvements to my RNG manipulation route which are easy to implement. The first one is King Boo’s board layout manipulation. I realized late that RNG does not always reroll every frame you wait at the “Next” prompt at the end of Goomba’s board. So if I had to redo this board layout manipulation, I would try to wait at the bonus textboxes of the Thrice candy instead. This would make it more likely to find an ideal board layout, which could be up ten seconds faster with one less coin block animation (4s), two less branches (2 x 1.5s), no shop on the way (1s) and at least one King Boo place two rooms away from the start instead of three (1s). Though keep in mind that the board layout is entirely dictated by RNG, so there is no telling if such a layout could be found within a reasonable time, or if it is obtainable at all. Plus for now the board layout must be checked manually, which is quite time consuming.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The second improvement is better pseudo-random event splitting in Shy Guy’s board. Instead of rolling an 8 in turn 1 you aim for a 5. While you land on a red space instead of a blue one in turn 1, you compensate for it by landing on a blue space in turn 2, which can be done by rolling a 9. Not only do you pair the Thrice candy drop with a coin block result instead of a less likely dice roll result, you also double your Thrice drop rate by being ranked second when reaching the drop spot. So the worst odds of any group of pseudo-random events on this board go from 1 in 100 to 1 in 15. The only downside is that you need a triple 5 or higher in turn 3 instead of a triple 4 or higher.

This could lead to an RNG predictor script which would allow us to plan RNG manipulation in advance instead of brute-forcing our way locally to the desired outcomes.

	"Finally Mario Party 8 “Star Battle Arena” has a TAS with an available movie file. After a lot of time and effort spent on the Kuru Kuru Kururin 100% TAS, I wanted a change of pace with a completely different game and optimization philosophy. So I went back to one of my oldest and dearest projects. Unlike Kuru Kuru Kururin, Mario Party 8 is centered around RNG, resource management and lag reduction. Since I had little to no experience with all these things, I figured that it was a great way to complement my experience with TASing, especially with a game that I know very well. Although the highlight was definitely RNG manipulation, it also served as a nice introduction to resource management and lag reduction.

	"I got the game back in 2007, probably close to its release date. Along with Mario Party DS it was my first Mario Party game, so there is definitely a lot of nostalgia involved. This might explain why, after watching 360Chrism speedrun Star Battle Arena in late 2017, I felt like giving it a go and ignoring the absurdity behind such a RNG heavy run. With this game I can say that I had the most passionate and 
	[a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BTtHUTXzKk rel=noopener external nofollow 
		"stupidest
	]a
	" moments in my 8-year long speedrunning career. After my initial curiosity, what made me stick around were the inherent redeeming qualities of this game mode: a fairly short run which will never feel boring and with plenty of time for on-the-fly strategizing.

	"After stumbling upon the 2018 full TAS run by 豪華客船乗組員 on Nicovideo in February 2020, I was very curious about how RNG worked in this game. So I did my first experiments on Dolphin, notably about the DK board star spawn cycle and King Boo’s board generation. This was a year after my first Kuru Kuru Kururin publication here. So I was already a bit familiar with TASing, albeit quite inexperienced. After a few days I put the project on hold… only to return to it nearly five years later.

Although I was already familiar with pseudo-random event splitting, I thought about grouping waiting spots of different types only near the end of my first TAS attempt last month. The math nerd in me knew that this additional trick alone would greatly improve the quality of RNG manipulation in my second attempt. Being aware of the explosion it would induce on the number of scenarios to be explored, it also motivated me to learn Lua and write a script that would make performing this technique more enjoyable and less painful for my morale and my hands.

	": Wow...that was a lot of text to sift through. Out of the entire submission, I saw what I needed to confirm that you have done an extreme amount of studying and work to get the results of this outcome. When I first noticed this submission, I knew that RNG was going to be the primary focus of obtaining the best optimization possible.  Even though you have discovered potential improvements, this run is certainly beyond anything ever possible for a human. I too have finished TASes, where new strategies, techniques, and exploits were discovered. So I don't fault you for wanting to submit this, knowing that more can be done. Its painful to have to go back for a game of this length, especially where RNG would completely change all inputs after any improved area.

The fact that you have totally destroyed the human record by half (one of my metrics that I see can never be beaten by humans), really says something about your skills in building the tools necessary for this effort. Congratulations! You have certainly caught my attention for any future submission. The only other point I want to bring up, is your comment on lag. I learned a long time ago that lag reduction should certainly be considered and has the power to make notable improvements to a run. I can imagine that lag reduction can complicate your findings on the best RNG. In fact, lag may be the result of any discovered RNG.  In any case, it wouldn't matter for my analysis...yet I wanted to say that I'm glad that it caught your attention for optimization.
