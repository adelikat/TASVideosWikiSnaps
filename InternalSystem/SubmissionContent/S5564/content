	"VS Super Mario Bros is a modified version of the super popular NES game, Super Mario Bros. This modded version is for the arcade machines, and so it is slightly harder, but easier than Lost Levels. This movie completes it in a hair under 10 minutes and 15 seconds. This is my third attempt of a TAS, the first two were slow WIP's that didn't deserve the name TAS. It is near perfect, but I'd personally like to see what I thought was impossible by TASing, be done.

	"VS SMB is a slightly longer and harder version. There are no warps to worlds 7 and 8, pipe warp maps may have changes, and in my ROM, the game has a faster timer. Some surprising results were found. This TAS has been in the works for almost a year. With that there are a few things to note.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"1. Framerules are very screwy. They aren't always every 21 frames
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"2. Things that are usually faster, aren't always that way in this game.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"3. Pipe warp in 4-2 has moved one pipe to the right, thus making the Wrong Warp near impossible.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"4. Furthest warp in the game is 6-1.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"5. Flagpole skips aren't always possible.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"6. Physics engine is ever so slightly different. Not by much, but it can ruin your day.
	$LF

	"With all that in mind, let's get started on the stage commentary. If there isn't special to note, and is just what this community expects, I won't say anything.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Building on top of that, I also think that the 6-2 flag skip is impossible. I do know for 100% certainty that it is impossible to hit the top of the flag. I'll say that the biggest improvement is in 6-2.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"6-3's flag skip looks possible, but I am probably not a sophisticated enough TASer to do it. I'll be surprised if it can't be done. (By the way, does this ring a bell? Does this look like 5-2 in Lost Levels, or am I crazy?)
