	"VS Super Mario Bros is a modified version of the super popular NES game, Super Mario Bros. This modded version is for the arcade machines, and so it is slightly harder, but easier than Lost Levels. This movie completes it in a hair under 10 minutes and 15 seconds. This is my third attempt of a TAS, the first two were slow WIP's that didn't deserve the name TAS. It is near perfect, but I'd personally like to see what I thought was impossible by TASing, be done.
