Before entering the room of the death boost, it is better to have that time as close to 0 as possible, as the values of that address change every frame. I found out that shooting enemies make this value change significantly. I managed to get it at 4 by shooting the yellow mouse on the blue room (that has the helmet).

At first, I wondered if this should have been a 100% run, but after looking at other runs and Goonies II, I see that it is rightly classified as "all items". If this was 100%, then those secrets that show up should be collected. The only thing I wonder...should a 100% obsolete an "all item" run. hmmmm. That will be for another day.
