	"C-1's speed instantly goes to 400 in 1 frame, and then increases by 300 each frame until it caps at 2500. However, when the scythe is thrown and stops moving, her speed cap increases to 3900. This speed cap is lowered again when the scythe returns to C-1. This is a 56% speed increase, so she tries to keep the scythe out for as long as possible.

	"The main glitch this run uses is the "early scythe stop". Normally, the scythe will only stop when it hits a wall or spikes. But she can stop it earlier by facing right on one frame, left on the first/third frame the scythe leaves, then right on the next frame, or vice versa. This way she can get the speed boost without waiting for it to reach a wall. It's also useful to get the scythe's collision directly under her.

[div class=p 
	"The bug that prevents the scythe from being thrown is avoided entirely by recalling it the frame that she enter a door transition. This 1-2 frame loss is better than the 36 extra frames needed to sysreset. It's better to do it this way than run into a door with it still on the wall. The game recalls it automatically, however there is extra wait time this way (and you might have to sysreset after entering the next room anyway).

	": Firstly, sorry it took me so long to get to this.  Secondly, the run had a few areas that looked slow to me upon first watching through.  Just by more efficiently using the already known speed tech which was mentioned in the submission notes, I was able to improve the second and third rooms by 32 and 27 frames respectively for a total of 59 frames over the first three rooms.  Even these improvements may not be optimal as I didn't spend a ton of time on it.  I'm guessing that remaining rooms may be improvable as well.  Unfortunately, I don't currently have time to dig further into this game myself.  I'd encourage
