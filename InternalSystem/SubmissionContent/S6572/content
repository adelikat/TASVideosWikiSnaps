[div class=p 
	"To do the glitch, you need to have an enemy hit you onto the drum. I’m not exactly sure why this glitch works, but it’s always possible to manipulate it into happening on any bounce you have. You can achieve this by pausing for various amounts of time (about every 5 frames will work). But you can also achieve the glitch by shooting a bullet on different frames. Shooting doesn’t alter your position or speed, so this glitch likely has deeper underlying causes. I would like to understand it further, but this wouldn’t help to make the TAS faster, as you can always just try shooting on different frames.

	"This level has a total of 109 objects, meaning that I can skip 10 objects. A big decision is whether to get the super jump. This counts as 1 objects and allows you to jump higher. Usually this higher jump is slow, since ground movement is fast, but it has the benefit of allowing me to grab some of the high set of 12 objects from below (0:28). Since there are some objects later in the level which require the super jump, if I hadn’t got the super jump I would need to do 2 trips to that set of 12 from above (since you can’t get all of them with one jump). This made the super jump clearly the correct choice.

You can damage both circles at once, but I take it one at a time to avoid damage. This is mainly because the fight is capped by how many jumps you do. I do 2 short hops then one more to kill the bee body (there’s a time you have to wait between killing the green things and the bee). As far as I know, it’s impossible to kill both wings in jump, so this fight should be optimal.

	"My goal here is to end inputs as soon as possible. So it is possible to hold right into the violin, which makes you get hit down instead of up. Doing this means you have enough speed to make it back to the drum and the warp can be caused by experimenting with shooting on different frames. This would cause the actual warp to happen at an earlier frame.

[div class=p
