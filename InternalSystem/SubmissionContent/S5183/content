	"There is nothing complicated about the physics of this game. There is no acceleration in the x-direction and very little to speak of in the y-direction. The only movement gimmick is conveyer belts that appear in some levels, which double your movement speed when running along them and completely stopping you when running against them. Duke has a fixed jump height (3 tiles normally, 4 tiles with jump boots) with two ways to shorten it: bump your head on a ceiling or get hurt. The jump height is often a bottleneck while platforming so these jump shortening techniques are used as frequently as possible.

	"Duke can only take 8 hits and his health doesn't get reset when starting a level. There are health pickups scattered throughout the levels, with soda cans healing 1 unit, chicken healing 1 unit (2 if shot), and atomic health completely healing Duke. Planning which health to pick up and which damage to take is the most difficult part of this run.

	"By default, only one bullet can appear on the screen at a time, but more can be added by picking up extra guns for a maximum of 4 bullets. Again, the value of picking one of these up has to be weighed along with the amount of time it costs to pick up.

	"Despite the level looking maze-like, there really aren't too many routing options for this one. The Dr Proton text trigger can actually be skipped on the way to the boots, but once you have the boots it will trigger on the way back no matter what you do. The jump boots let you jump up 4 tiles instead of 3, but more importantly allow you to do sick flips.

	"This level has some fairly annoying backtracking that isn't avoidable. One of the most difficult parts of the run to optimize is the barrier at the end, which requires 10 shots to take down. A fan and some blocks also have to be busted to effectively destroy the barrier, which can be done from a distance. This is one place where picking up the extra bullet in level 2 really pays off.

There's an atomic health refill that's not too far out of the way, but we'll pass on that and try to squeak by on low health for now. Sacrificing time to take less damage still won't be necessary.

	"This level features an unusual shortcut. The section in the bottom right part of the level with the rockets looks like a dead end, but inexplicably one of the gray tiles directly above one of the rockets is passable, while the rest are solid. This puts you right under the access card, saving over 3 seconds and also serving as a less hazardous way than the conventional route. The boss is incredibly easy, just stand in front of him and spam bullets.

		" Foone: Did the Episode 1 run and a testrun for Episode 2 back in 2010 that unfortunately he never got around to polishing up and releasing. The testrun was a fantastic reference. I did make sure to compare each level and confirm that I at least matched or improved upon each one. This run beats the testrun by a little over 16 seconds (up to the final hit on the final boss, this run is a bit longer because the testrun doesn't go up through the ending).
