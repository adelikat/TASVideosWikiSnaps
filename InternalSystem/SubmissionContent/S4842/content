	"This is Donkey Kong on Atari 2600, before Nintendo got into NESes, Wii Us and AngryJoes. Conparing it to any other version, it only has 2 levels, and then it loops. A bunch of the strats used on the NES, Arcade or SNES ports don't work here, so I'm left with not much.
	$LF
	"This port is recognized very well for it's sound effects, that are used in a bunch and bunch of cartoons since the old days and sometimes still used up to this day.
	$LF
	"Also, the levels have a few changes in it's layout and enemy placement. And also DK looks like a gingerbread man.

	"This is my first time using BizHawk's TAS Studio, so this game was like a practice of that until I got around it and made a proper TAS.

	"I had to wait for the barrels to move so I could advance and not die, unlike other ports, this stage is smaller, and thus skipping them is not possible as far my knowledge goes.

	$LF

[p 
	"Yep, from 25m to 100m in a breeze. Unlike the other ports, the flame guys spawn instantly when the stage starts, meaning the route changes significantly and avoiding them is a must.
