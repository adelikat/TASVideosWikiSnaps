	"The most useful upgrade is engine, as it increases your top speed by 33%. A downside to engine is that it costs 10 points, which is difficult to achieve in a single race without heavy manipulation.
	$LF
	"Another theoretically useful upgrade is acceleration. This would save some time at the start of each race, but is overshadowed by engine’s usefulness.
	$LF
	"Another possible upgrade is suspension. This makes you leave ramps at full speed rather than having to time a down press to remain at full speed. This is useless for the vast majority of the run, but could be theoretically useful to end inputs early (as you could just ride a few ramps with no input to the end). Even though this is theoretically faster with TAS timing, it is once again overshadowed by the engine upgrade.

	$LF
	"Take for example level 1. My timer starts at 60 and ends at 29. This means that my total seconds is 31 for the level, which the game calculates correctly.
	$LF
	"However, the game flips the centiseconds incorrectly for the final calculations, and essentially takes my timer value of 29.xx and gives me a time of 31.xx (same centisecond value). This means that finishing with the clock reading a high 29, will give me a high 31 and finishing with a low 29 (slower race) will give me a low 31.
	$LF
	"As a result, for every race it is best to finish with the clock just about to tick over to the next second, giving you a race time of xx.01. So essentially every level’s in game time is on a frame rule of 60 frames.

	"0x372 tracks the number of opponents you have passed. 0x353 is a timer that will tick down 128 frames before another opponent can appear. The timer begins once opponent “n” leaves the screen and opponent “n+1” will not appear until the timer reaches 0. The timer for the first car will begin once the course is 6% complete, this then ticks down 128 frames until the first opponent appears. No opponents can appear after the course is 96% complete.
	$LF
	"The opponents spawn position depends on where you are in the track and it partially depends on RNG. The easiest way to manipulate RNG is to use up presses on player 1 as this has no in-game effect (apart from negating left and right presses). By using up to manipulate RNG, you can usually choose between 2 starting positions of the opponent. The only way to obtain more possible starting positions is to encounter your opponent on a different part of the track by getting the other RNG pattern on the previous opponent(s) or by sacrificing real time.
	$LF
	"As the engine upgrade costs 10 points, you need to have passed an average of 10 cars per level after every level. Some tracks (such as track 5) are very treacherous, which makes it easy to pass opponents quickly. As a result, it’s possible to pass 11 cars on track 5. Some other tracks have ramps cause the opponents to go in the air and stay on screen for longer. These tracks make it very difficult to reach the goal of 10 passes.

[div class=p 
	"Most of my time completing this TAS was spent attempting to get the engine upgrade ready for level 2. Unfortunately, I could not manipulate the cars to make this possible. I had it close to 10 points, but was having to lose too much real time slowing down to make it worth it. The way to squeeze out more cars is to slow down during the 128 frame cool down timer, then speed up for when you are actually trying to pass the car. This ended up being too slow, and didn’t quite reach 10 points anyway.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"I also messed with using an extra purchase of acceleration, but I decided to just stick to engine upgrades instead. This gives me a huge buffer, meaning I don’t have to pass as many cars. For the 8 engine upgrades I buy, I need 130 points in total. I make sure to get exactly 130 points throughout the game since each extra point you get costs 8 frames due to ticking down on the totals screen.

	"When jumping over a ramp you will lose 25% of your speed. You can avoid this by having a suspension upgrade or by pressing down while going over the ramp. If you are pressing down shortly after leaving the ramp, you will lose 25% of your speed. These 2 speed losses can compound to make your new speed (0.75)^2 = 0.5625 times your old speed (a low of 44% of your speed). Obviously keeping your full speed is desired in the majority of cases, unless you are slowing down to manipulate cars, or not pressing down due to ending inputs early.

]div
[div class=p 
	"Although this is difficult to pull off RTA, there’s a very easy method to optimize it in TAS. You should alternate mashing the 2 and 1 buttons. This will cause some periodic lag, which is speed dependant. At the full engine upgrade, the game will consistently lag every 4 frames at full speed. You can negate this lag by pressing down the frame beforehand. This means you can have a 1 or 2 press every frame, resulting in the slowest possible falling speed. You can often span over 20% of the course off a single ramp in this method, but it is only used to that extent in the game time TAS, as each ramp gives you a 1 frame boost in real time.

[div class=p 
	"The main method for manipulating IGT is ramps. After leaving a ramp optimally (by pressing down while going over it), you will retain your regular speed through the air. However, while in the air the game time runs half as fast. This essentially means that you should spend as much time as possible in the air to optimize game time. Using this strategy (as in my IGT TAS), allows you to get faster times than my real time TAS. The only reason that I don’t spend more time in the air in the real time TAS is that every ramp gives you a 1 frame time save in real time (but results in your IGT running at regular speed for a few frames).
