	" was too burnt out on this game to work on it further in order to create a submission. Since the winner of the contest (Team 4: pirate_sephiroth, Exonym, FatRatKnight, Bloopiero) had the fastest TAS for all but the last stage, it was suggested that their submission be grafted with the submission with the fastest final stage (Team ðŸ¦†: The8bitbeast, Mittenz, tjblakely, lapogne36). Then nothing happened for months until Memory, the host of the contest finally did exactly that because seriously somebody needed to do something with this.

	"Memory: I chose the game because I had seen some RTAs years ago and felt that the game would appear radically different in a TAS setting. I also felt that the movement options of the game (largely apple jumping) would lead to unique TASes for the contest, which was my primary reasoning for choosing the game.

	"My only direct contributions to this movie are strictly related to the grafting of Team 7's final stage to Team 4's submission. I had to modify the end of Team 4's Dark Forest World to get the subpixels close enough to what Team 7 had and then had to make some additional modifications to the screen with the floating hand boss thing of Team 7 in order to get the submission to sync the rest of the way.

	": Lots of action, going faster than the game can handle, and some nice other tricks and glitches (even though, as was mentioned in the thread, some of it might be easy to miss for the casual viewer). The users seems to like it as well. Overall I think it's a movie that deserves a place in the moons category.
