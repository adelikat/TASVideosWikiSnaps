	"This is simply Ferret Warlord's previous run of Wizards & Warriors III, Kuros: Visions of Power with a new glitch at the fight against Malkil. It was recorded using FCEU 0.98.12 (blip) and is about 25 seconds shorter than the previous TAS. Since everything except the final fight is exactly the same, I will just explain the new glitch.

	"This is the most useful of several glitches that result from levitating with the third-level wizard during the fight against Malkil. I am not sure of the cause of the glitches, but they seem to occur when Kuros levitates in certain locations. This instant death glitch also seems to require the firing of an upward shot with the third-level knight or first-level wizard before it works. In order to produce this glitch, Kuros must levitate so that the leftmost black pixel of the levitating sprite when facing to the right lines up with the leftmost black pixel of the lowest step of the throne. The corresponding position when standing on the floor and facing right is having the leftmost black pixel of his right foot directly above the first white pixel of the leftmost and uppermost white floor tile under the throne. For some unknown reason, levitating in this location causes the screen to shake and temporarily display some incorrect graphics in some spots. It also triggers Malkil's death animation and the appearance of the portal. It does not, however, award the player the points that he would usually get for destroying Malkil. The game does proceed to the end of the story, so the processor apparently considers Malkil to be dead.
