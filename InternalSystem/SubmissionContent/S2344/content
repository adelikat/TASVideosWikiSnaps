	"The improvement comes from 8-4 where damage is taken.  Instead of taking it from the plant, I get hit by a fish which causes the screen to scroll.  This means less backtracking to get to the pipe (in fact I never have to jump off the pipe).

	"The reason the submission time is longer is because I record until the axe.  Given the close competition this movie is receiving, I think it is the best for comparisons.

	"I also tried the idea of Lord Tom & andrewg of manipulating the plant to not appear.  However, this seems way slower because the plant will appear unless you are VERY close to the pipe.  Too close to get any kind of reasonable scrolling to happen.  (I'd love to be wrong about this, if anyone wants to try).
