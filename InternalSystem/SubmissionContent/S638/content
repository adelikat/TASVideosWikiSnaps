	"+ splatterhouse 2 is the sequel to splatterhouse; an infamous arcade game made by namco. one home version was made, on the pc engine. splatterhouse 2 is a genesis exclusive, as is the 3rd. the game was ahead of its time in the shock/horror/gore category.

	"+ a lot of trial and error went into this one. i used to play it all teh time as a kid, but doing a time attack on it is a whole different story. the game itself is very hard, with hit ranges that are totally bizarre. it's a cool game to watch though; if not just for the cinematics and early blood and gore.

	"edit: the little pause where rick stops moving in stage 7 is impossible to do anything about. it's something that the game makes you do before walking to jennifer. also, there are frames of animation in game that look like 2 attacks are done in succession; whereas the game was played at a crawl, and i'm sure of the number of hits thrown.
