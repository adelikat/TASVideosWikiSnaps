	"For this TAS, I tried to emulate how typical emulators like BizHawk work, and bound loading and saving of different replay slots to the F1 - F8 keys (which in turn necessitated moving the F1 and F2 keys, which are used by the game, to somewhere else).
	$LF
	"This was hugely beneficial for TASing, as having the ability to easily and quickly jump to a precise moment in time is massively helpful.

	$LF
	"By walking on a staircase for exactly 32 steps, or 512 frames, you can walk beyond the intended end of a staircase and keep going.

	"If there is a valid screen transition defined for the ceiling or the floor of the room, you can walk into the next room as normal.

	"If there is no screen transition for the ceiling, Simon will also lose a life, but then respawn in the same room without any of his items.
	$LF
	"In a similar way, hitting a horizontal screen edge will send Simon into the next room when a screen transition is active, otherwise, Simon will simply wrap around the current room.

	$LF
]div

	"It is necessary to manipulate the fleaman to be at the right position at the right time when you need to do the damage boost.
	$LF
	"For some reason, holding a diagonal direction on the arrow keys on the keyboard and pushing multiple buttons at the same time is very good at forcing him to do a large jump.

	"As mentioned earlier, the stopwatch glitch basically creates two radically different versions of the run.
	$LF
	"However, I am against creating a separate branch for this movie, as you still go through the same levels in largely the same way as before.
	$LF
	"The previous publication is at this point also severely outdated now and should be obsoleted.

]div
[ul 
	[li 
		" General route and strategy improvements. E.g., you might possibly grab a shield in Stage 17 to block Dracula's fireballs, which could allow you to finish his first phase with only one stopwatch usage. I didn't try this out, but it might be worthwhile.

	"As mentioned above, I also lose 6 frames from having to grab an extra big heart.

	"Their work on openMSX has been phenomenal.

	"The emulator now features a GUI that made working with it a lot easier.

	"I would also like to thank Burb and AgentWyvern for their findings on this game and their support.
	$LF
	"They did a huge part to (re-)vitalize the Vampire Killer speedrunning scene, and without them, I probably wouldn't have been making this run.
