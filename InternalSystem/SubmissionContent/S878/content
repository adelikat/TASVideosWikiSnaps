	"This is a raptor movie of the Genesis version of Jurassic Park, which is completely different from the SNES version.  In this game, you can choose between Grant and the raptor, each with his own set of levels.  Grant gets 7 levels, and his game is like Price of Persia except with dinosaurs and better weapons.  The raptor's game is only 5 levels long, and goes by much faster.  Especially here.

		"The doors suck.  I sometimes keep walking after bumping into doors.  The position I need to be in to kick them open is very precise, and any goofy walking I do is needed to get into that position.  There's one time (second-to-last room in the Visitor's Center) where I obviously walk into a door longer than necessary.  This is to avoid the spitter's goop.  You'll see why. ;)

		"If it looks like I take an unnecessary step, it's probably to avoid/get food.  Jumping too close to a drumstick will cause the raptor to duck and eat it instead of/while jumping.  If I get it by jumping on top of it or while it's offscreen, there's no time penalty.

It's not possible to jump through the pipe that I have to duck-walk over.  I've tried, but the raptor runs into the top of the pipe before I can exploit the jump-through-walls bug.  If you observe carefully, you'll notice the last guard change colors as he goes off the screen.  If I go back at that point, all the gaurds will have different-colored uniforms.

Fortunately, this level also has the biggest timesaver in the game, which I abuse with style.  I go through the same area twice.  This is because I'm not supposed to be there the first time, and the game assumes that any exit door I go through is the right one.
