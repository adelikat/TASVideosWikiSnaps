	"In this game, you are able to choose from 6 different characters. They all very different in their top speed, acceleration, steering, special moves, weapons and more, but the game is still balanced. You are able to play a championship mode (which I'm doing in this TAS), battle mode (where the goal is to kill your opponents) and practice mode (where you can choose any track you want). There are three difficulty settings, and after beating 'Hard', a fourth 'Super Hard' option will become available. The harder the difficulty, the more tracks need to be completed to finish the game. At 'Hard' and 'Super Hard', the championship consist of 6 rounds, each round having 5 tracks. Each of these five tracks has a different theme: City, Islands, Sewerage, Circuit and Fortress. Depending on how well you did in the race, you get some points, and some money. This money can be used to buy parts for your vehicle. There are 'Engine'-part, 'Tire'-parts. 'Armor'-parts and 'Shot'-parts. All parts do what you would expect them to, and they can be upgraded five times each. After the second lap, you can use your weapon (each character has a different weapon) three times. For each time you upgraded your weapon, you get one more shot per lap. After the second lap, you'll also get an item, which is much like the question marks at Super Mario Kart.

		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" I obtained it by playing the game normally. You get a password after each round (five tracks). The password saves the round you were at, the player you were playing with, the money you had and the parts you had upgraded. I checked the password I got for several amounts of money, in order to get a password which was very easy to type fast.
				$LF
			]li
		]ul
		" Why did you choose to play only the one round (five tracks), and not the entire championship?
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" An entire championship consists of 30 tracks. This would mean, the TAS would be 30 to 40 minutes long. That's very long, I think, for a racing game. It would also be a ridiculous amount of work, TASing 30 tracks. After each round, you get to see an ending movie. The points are reset. A round is perfectly comparable with a "cup" at Super Mario Kart. However, in this game, there are only five themes: City, Islands, Sewerage, Circuit and Fortress. Each of the 6 rounds features the exact same 5 themes.
				$LF
			]li
		]ul
		" Why did you pick this particular round?
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" This is the last round of the 'Super Hard' difficulty. It has by far the most complex and beautiful tracks, which make them the most suitable for a TAS. It's also the hardest round.
				$LF
			]li
		]ul
		" What are the upgraded parts you got from this password, and what do they do?
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" This password gives me fully upgraded Engine-parts. Engine parts give you a higher 'maximum speed' (by higher maximum speed, I mean the speed you obtain by pressing B, up to the point where the vehicle basically stops accelerating). The password also gives me fully upgraded Shot-parts. With the five shot-parts I can use my weapon 8 times in a lap, instead of only 3 times (you can't use your weapon in the first lap). The Tire-parts and armor-parts are of no use when doing a TAS.
				$LF
			]li
		]ul
		" Why did you use a password which gave you these upgraded parts?
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" Basically, I think it makes the movie a lot cooler and interesting to watch. Both parts I have upgraded allow me to be faster than if I didn't have them. A movie without these parts would, in my opinion, be a lot less entertaining. This way, I can truly show what is the fastest possible way to complete the laps. Besides, if you played the game normally, you would have gathered the money to buy these parts anyway (note that, like I said before, I obtained this password just by playing the game), so it's actually quite natural to have these parts in this stage of the game.
				$LF
			]li
		]ul
		" Don't the upgraded parts conflict with completing the hardest possible goal in the game?
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" For a normal speedrun, I would agree. For a TAS, it's not hard to beat the computer players anyway. Just look at the movie, and trust me when I say I could have beaten the computers too without these parts (in a TAS). As for the TASing itself, I think these upgraded parts make the TASing actually harder, since you have to consider a lot more things.
				$LF
			]li
		]ul
		" Why did you pick Vinnie as a character (doesn't he have the lowest maximum speed?)?
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" Vinnie may have the lowest maximum speed, but actually, I'm way above this maximum speed the entire time. The main reason why I choose Vinnie is because of his weapon. He jumps in the air by pressing Y, and attacks downwards by pressing Y again. For attacking others, it's a pretty bad weapon. However, it increases your speed, and more importantly, it enables you to manoeuvre in mid-air. More about this in the section "technique's".

It also allows you to make corners in the air, and have more control over your height

[p 
	"All of these thing will add to your speed. This is why eventually Vinnie moves ridiculously fast. There is however a maximum. If you go faster than this maximum, you will travel backwards instead of forward. This is why I can’t go any faster than 16384. When watching my speed at the TAS, you’ll notice (most of the time) the speed goes up to ~16300, then decreases to ~15000 and some form of speedup is used to go up to ~16300 again.

	"There are also things that slow you down. With slowing down, I mean that the speed is getting lower until it reaches you reach the maximum speed of 2675. There is a clear difference between slowing down before you use your weapon, and after (read after the first lap) it:

Like I stated before, the speed at maximum varies between ~14800 and ~16300, since it cannot exceed 16384 at all cost. Sometimes you have to wait with taking a speedup or something, so lap four and five are not exactly the same most of the time. Mostly lap 5 is a tiny bit faster than lap four since you don’t have to consider you have to keep racing. Only at the fourth track the fifth lap was slightly slower due to circumstances mentioned above (and note that 0.05 seconds is only 3 frames).
