	"So this is a Rockman Zero 4 TimeAttack, the newest series of megaman by Capcom adapted on GBA...
	$LF
	"It mixes all the ingredients of many other megaman games:
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		"8 Bosses
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"A bad and mean Vilain (Dr. Weil)
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"EX-Skills which are gained from bosses
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Parts improvement
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"8 Bosses you have to fight again in the last level... and so on
		$LF
	]li

[p 
	"Only one is missing : MEGAMAN??!!
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Yes, you play, ZERO in this game with his Z-Saber and you help Ms.Ciel, who hopes for a better world with no war...gnagnagna...
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I used VBA 1.7.2, but the rerecording-10 version (the one which is compulsory for this site)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I played the game at 15% of the real speed in order to improve my moves for this TimeAttack...
	$LF
	"I used no shortcut keys (for diagonals for example), and I play the japanese version of the game since the US or EU version are not out yet.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The sound is 44kHz and no filters were applied...
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I do not use warp (there isn't any to knowledge) nor passwords, nor cheats... (anyway there is no passwd for this game)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Here is a list of the hints I use :
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		"I don't know very much about programming errors in this game, i use a bug in Pulpula Cockapetri stage in which you can do a dash jump without touching the ground right after you went through a gate to acces the first "conveyors handles" room... 
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		"Also when you dash you can jump a very short time in the void before falling, i use it twice or thrice in the stage...
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		"Moreover at very low speed you're able to hit up to four (end even five) times when you do a jumping saber slash bit turning very rapidly to the opposite direction and then turning back to the original one... I use it all along the game to kill enemies.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		"However, it is possible to kill an enemy in one hit by using the very end of the jumping saber slash which would logically take two hits to kill, as it seems to deal double damage... I use it sometimes in the game mostly against the flamethrower enemy...
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		"It appears that jumping to kill enemies is faster than dash-slashing them, so I (almost) always jump to kill them...except when you will from a ledge a the end of your dash...
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		"Using the flameshooter in Fengli Lunaedge stage at the beginning when you stick the wall allows you to take the lower part which is faster than the higher route and which is usually block by snow...
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"I think that it sums up quite well the hints I use to do this...
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Here comes the goals of this TimeAttack : 
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		"Completed in 37min 20sec (game calculated... see the very end of the movie)
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"I played the game through hard mode (you cannot use the three saber slashes, nor charge your weapons, and the weather is always set to normal conditions which are the hardest ones and cannot be changed)
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"I take NO hits (not a single one)...it's more professionnal ;)
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"I DO NOT die... nor do I restart...
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"This is an (almost) Z-Saber only Run, what I mean is that I only use this weapon to defeat enemy as well as bosses... I do not deal damage with the Z-Knuckle, however i use it in some cases to make the game more interesting, i shall list afterwards the times I used it...
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"I use no cyber-elves (of course)
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"I use no recipe to upgrade ZERO's parts (of course as well)
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"All missions cleared at 100% (with S-rank of course)
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"All (except two) levels cleared in less than 2min.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"I aim for fastest time this way...
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"Here are the times i used the Z-knuckle : 
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		"To power down the very first boss
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"To pull out Tech Kraken out of his Yami (in which he is invicible)
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"To kill a flameshhoter enemy at the beginning of the stage to take the fastest route
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"To kill the waterthrower enemy in the first intermission to complete it at 100%
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"To pull out the plug in Pulpula Cockapetri stage
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"To power down the four generators in Randon Bandom stage
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"So I only kill two enemies with the Z-Knuckle...
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"To sum-up, i think that you will like this movie because it's a "good" game (in my opinion) but it's mostly a megaman game, the legendary hero (even if he does nor appear in this one), so it's pretty popular...
	$LF
	"And When I watched it I thought that it was pretty nice to watch and quite speedy...
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"So I hope you'll enjoy it everyone, even if it's not perfect :)
