	": Hello PikaBlurTAS, and welcome to TASVideos. Unfortunately, I will have to reject this movie. The run appears to be suboptimal in many places, including character choice. Additionally, the TAS was not liked by the audience, because the run lacks entertainment value and does not look much different from real-time play.
