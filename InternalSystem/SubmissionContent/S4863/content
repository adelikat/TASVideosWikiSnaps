	"This TAS was my first try to get into TAS'es. The hack itself isn't based on flat levels and running, mostly there are big labyrinths with only 1 exit, so there was not so much fast running. I counted that "the end" is the time when the player finishes the last level and walks on the map to the first one, making a circle on the map. I tried to entertain the viewer as much as it was possible.
