[div class=p 
	"Probably the most interesting glitch in the whole DKC-series. The trick basically crashes the game and seems to scramble the memory adresses.
	$LF
	"It's actually just a part of the hold-air trick that I will begin with explaining.
	$LF
	"Holding "air" is when Diddy or Dixie picks up a barrel just after it breaks. This will result D.  picking up nothing or "air". And then I think
	$LF
	"it works something like that when you're holding nothing, the game will force something that you will hold and that is often the newest spawned
	$LF
	"object. When you are holding that object and you throw it, weird things can happen to it. If it's just an enemy, it's speed often just gets
	$LF
	"very high and it will zoom away. It also depends on where and how you throw it, if you throw up or left, diffrent things will happen. I think
	$LF
	"the object just gets the value that is supposed to be the barrels speed and that often works for enemies and such but for other object it can
	$LF
	"happen obscure things. 
	$LF
	"So far, I only know two ways to do this, drop a barrel against the wall in Castle crush and using the no-barrel cheat and go to mud-hole marsh.
	$LF
	"So how is this trick useful? Well when in Castle Crush, pick up the first DK-barrel you see and hold it against the wall, now put it down and
	$LF
	"pick it up right after. You will now hold "air" and if you timed it right, you will hold the Rambi Barrel. If you throw upwards, you will probably
	$LF
	"be transformed into Klubba and you can move sideway but if you touch any wall, the game will crash. Other things can happen like that you will
	$LF
	"go to the title screen or just watch the special ending. If you throw left/right, the game will often crash. But if you get hurt before jumping
	$LF
	"inside the barrel and jump into as dixie, you will probably be transformed to Rambi but he will be yellow and his vertical speed will the maximum
	$LF
	"possible that he can have. The game will also get really unstable and you will probably not be able to control Rambi where you want him.
	$LF
	"If you hurt an enemy, you will see Diddy piggyride Dixie and you will be able to throw but you will still have the same speed.
	$LF
	"I know this is confusingly explained but you should try it out yourself. And I do not know any way to activate the goal switch but I've been
	$LF
	"very close but it seems very impossible.

I was looking into how the fast climbing would be done but I didn't really found anything, sometimes it was faster to jump as short as possible and sometimes a bit longer. I think you need to vary it a bit and I did so. Not much to say really, I used the left way with the hooks instead of the shooting barrels because it was a lot of faster and there was a lot of lag that was hard to avoid fully. The first backwardsswitch was quite trivial to do, I had to test a lot of diffrent tactics and that was the fastest way I could find even though it may look slow. If you wonder how it's done, look at the trick section. The zip wasn't that much faster actually but because I have to do another switch right after that one so it doesn't really matter, it's just a positive thing. You may also notice that I do a piggyride while in the wall and the answer is that I have to get Diddy's speed down to 0 and that's the fastest way to do it, it only wastes some few frames.
