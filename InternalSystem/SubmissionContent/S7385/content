I was able to escape every killscreen and achieve an... alivescreen. That is, a situation where the player doesn't need to provide any more input in order to avoid dying, while the score points will still keep growing until maximum.

	"In cases like these, you would demand the player to commit suicide in order to manually cause a game over and thus displaying the final score on screen, however... That would defeat the purpose of the TASing record. What makes this game mode TASable is the fact that you can truncate the inputs as soon as you manage to achieve a situation from which the score is guaranteed to reach its maximum. On the other hand, committing suicide after reaching the maximum score would result in having a movie of fixed length, regardless of how fast you reached the "alivescreen".
