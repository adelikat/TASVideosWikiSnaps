		" Rolling is available from the start and is very useful for passing through enemies without hitting them, but it has a long lag time at the end of the animation. Before getting charge, the best way to move is to roll, then jump and attack to cancel the landing animation. After getting charge, rolling into it saves a few frames if Spyro is already facing away.
		$LF

	[li 
		" Soon after starting, Double Jump and Glide are unlocked. They're pretty standard in implementation, the only notable part is holding and releasing Glide after a jump sets Spyro's downward velocity to max, which came in handy a few times.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Charging is unlocked soon after, and is the fastest form of movement. However, charging comes with the caveat of freeze frames every time an enemy is hit, which pauses the game for about 7 frames each time. This needs to be avoided whenever possible, thus in many situations it's faster to jump, attack, or roll over enemies rather then charge into them.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Wall jumping is unlocked right after Charge, and lets Spyro, well, jump on walls. There's actually two subtle variants to wall jumps, with a fast version that is lower in height being possible by holding away from a wall as you approach it. This is used when applicable to save time when height is not important.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Air dive is also unlocked in the tutorial, and lets Spyro do a downwards-angled attack while in the air, which is pretty strong and fast outside of the startup animation. This saves some time in movement in the air, but is mostly obsoleted by Mid-Air Charge.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Mid-Air Charge is unlocked in Outer Grove, and lets Spyro charge while still in the air. This is extremely useful when getting over tall enemies. There's also a useful bug when landing on a specific frame when initiating a mid-air charge that skips the freeze frame animation, which comes in handy a few times.

		" The bread and butter is Spyro's ground and air combos, which are 3 hits each at the start with a finisher that deals more damage then the preceding hits. It's also possible with the first part of the air combo (Spyro's tail spin) to cancel the landing animation, which saves time in attacking and in platforming. Spyro also has access to a backflip attack from the start, which propels him into the air.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Unlocked soon after starting is Air Launch, an upwards swing that lets Spyro knock an enemy into the air. This is highly useful for smaller enemies to prevent them from going into invincibility.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Breath attacks come soon after, with Fire, Earth, Ice, and Lightning being accessible once their corresponding temple is complete. The unique properties of each attack are generally useful through the run for both movement and combat, such as using Ice on water to create a platform, Fire's larger hitbox, and Earth's ability to chain into tail spin to deal more damage then usual. Lightning casually is useful to draw enemies towards Spyro, but its longer animation made it so it only saw minimal usage in this run. Another useful property of any breath attack is being able to preserve momentum which freezing height, which I exploit through the run either to take care of enemies, or to wall jump faster. Breaths can even be used to cancel landing animations, which while useful has to be managed carefully so mana doesn't run out when it'd be useful in combat.
