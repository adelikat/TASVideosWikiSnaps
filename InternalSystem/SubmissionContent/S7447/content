	"It's a game which is based on scores, so the difficulty of this TAS is to stay fast while making points, winning a race gives you 1000 points but for example, in the last track of the run, you need 2600 points to success. So you have to hit others cars to gain points. It's a bit of strategy, not only going fast.

	"Some tweaks only affect how long the loading times last (like in this submission). Other tweaks may introduce impossible mechanics leading to unfair speed advantages (which may not even be known at the time of movie creation). But it's impossible to clearly differentiate one from the other, and it's unrealistic to expect TASers or judges to be able to tell how exactly game image corruption affects a given game. So I don't think that it's a good path forward to allow "some" corruption as long as it's not obvious what exactly it breaks. Even comparing two movies, one done on good dump and one done on bad dump, can be a nightmare, because you also have to know which time difference is from less optimal input, and which is from inherent results of image corruption, in every instance.
