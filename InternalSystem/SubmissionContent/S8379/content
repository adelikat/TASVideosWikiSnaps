Two nearby inhabited systems, Daertes and Gliphos, had been mining the planets of Quolerus for eons. Last year, previously unknown race called the Knarbots erected force field around Quolerus so that they might mine the system alone.

When I saw the screen of this game, it became first on my list to type in. I was not disappointed, as this became one of my top favorites on the Commodore 64. This is a game that I would continue to play today, as it is a classic and resembles the game "Yar's Revenge".
