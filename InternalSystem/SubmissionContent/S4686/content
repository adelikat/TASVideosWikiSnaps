	", let me just remind everyone about that. Paul is slow and sluggish and he doesn't have the fastest kill in Tekken 2/3 leave that for Yoshimitsu.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"What has improved greatly is how to get these low in-game times. The original method was using AI manipulation with movement, but when NK and I were working on 
	[a href=/forum/p/378563#378563 
		"Tekken 2 + 3
	]a
	" we found out the Start button manipulated the AI in Tekken 3 but not in 2, so we experimented a bit with it and found out that 48 fights are possible to do.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"So that's pretty much it. Instead of focusing on movements to create the luck the Start button was used to change the luck instead.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Note: The mucking around when Paused does not change the luck in any way. It's done for entertainment. I know right, entertainment in a thing which is focusing solely on speed and not the entertainment, it's a real shock.
	$LF

[p 
	"The one fight which will always have the problem is the second fight against Ogre, lag frames will occur there no matter what making the fight a little more annoying to deal with.
