	"The most important thing is to beat a level by using least birds possible, since moving the cursor back to the left side of the screen eats a lot of time. For this reason, sometimes it's faster to perform some slower throws if it allows to reach specific places. Also, using your bird's power at very specific timings can give interesting outcomes, especially the white bird, which in some situations can blast through whole buildings by triggering her ability at the right frame.

	"After figuring out the smallest amount of birds necessary for beating a level, you have to figure out which are the least time-consuming trajectories. Common sense would suggest that throwing a bird to the closest distance is the best idea, but sometimes it's faster to throw it offscreen or have it bounce back, because it avoid the explosion animation of your bird. Construction blocks also take some time when they fall to the ground, so this has also to be taken in consideration.

	"), but others pointed out that these games aren't as similar as versions of the same game. Indeed, this game is based on the Genesis Angry Birds game (which, in turn, has little to no to do with the PC original), and the "low quality" AB game looks like a different set of levels, sometimes closer to the PC original in how it operates.
