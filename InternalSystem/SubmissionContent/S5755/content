	": I'm going to reject this game from the Vault. While it is technically an official release, it's still a hack of Super Mario Bros. 2 (J) with level design elements merely copied from Super Mario Bros. There is no unique game content in this game that is not already covered by the runs of the far more popular games it is based on, with its only unique content being graphical changes and sprite edits. This movie also shows it, with all but one level of the TAS being functionally identical to the Super Mario Bros. TAS, and the last one being functionally identical to the Super Mario Bros. 2 (J) TAS - with only very minor changes, such as SMB2j fireworks mechanics meaning it doesn't need to be avoided in 8-3, and no Fire Flower being used in 8-4. But these are all very minor differences, and it overall highlights the lack of unique content from the game.

	"I think this game can get better audience feedback and be potentially publishable to a higher tier if a different category is done (like using Luigi, warpless, showing off worlds A-D), but this movie really just highlights the lack of changes compared to its base games. As such, I'm rejecting this movie due to poor audience reception for an unvaultable game.

	"Mothrayas pointed out that if parts of the game are shown off that are not seen elsewhere it can be acceptable. However, if the game also has some noticeable differences that were present, it could also be accepted. Meaning if there was a brand new level, or a level had some significant changes to it that required it to be played differently, or the enemies differed or had different placement or the powerups did, and this changed how the TAS would need to play the game, then it could be acceptable. Official games which are similar are acceptable, identical content is not. It appears this just copies and pastes together levels from two other games, uses the sprites from one of those for all of it, but has no functional uniqueness to speak of. If unique content is demonstrated, either from a significant noticeable in-game change affecting the actual game-play, or unique modes or levels are demonstrated, then in either case it can be accepted. It seems this game does not qualify, but other similar games such as Super Mario Advance or Metal Slug X do offer enough changes from the game they are based on.
