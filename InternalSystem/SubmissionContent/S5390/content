	"This hack of Megaman 4 is different from the original Megaman 4. Weapons have new attacking mode, more hiden tools hide in different enemies or places, and we can also read a more interesting story. The enemies in this hack are originated from all of Megaman games. In this movie, I would show more tips and performance.
