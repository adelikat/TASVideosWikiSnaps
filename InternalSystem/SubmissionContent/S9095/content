Definitive is a ROM hack of the original Super Mario Bros. but with Super Mario Bros. and the Lost Levels worlds both in Lost-Levels style (there are poison mushrooms, red piranha plants, upside-down red piranha plants, upside-down pipes, wind, a "Luigi Game" instead of a multiplayer mode, with Lost-Levels Luigi physics, and Lost-Levels style on 1-upping by flagpole or fireworks.

	"8-3 is the level that has another framerule save. Since fireworks are programmed Lost-Levels style, they only come out if your coin count's last digit matches the timer's last digit, making a 243 not necessarily producing fireworks. Therefore, a 243 FPG is possible. The slowdowns could be removed, but it would have a bad subpixel position for FPG. To get a D70, you must release B for 1 frame, land on the first pixel of the 3rd block without B held, hold B as you land, jump 2 frames later, and do the FPG by clipping in the block.

The first frame of 243 is 24 frames ahead of the first frame of 242, but an FPG with 243 finishes the timer on the sixth frame of 243, saving 19 frames. Normally, you finish the level with 13 frames to spare, but if you add 19 you save 32 frames, saving a framerule with 11 frames to spare.
