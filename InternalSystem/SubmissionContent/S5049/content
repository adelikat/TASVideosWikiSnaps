	"First off, Yabause doesn't have a frame display. Or input display. Luckily, Notepad++ exists so I could at least use that as a way to see how I'm doing. Unfortunately, the built-in AVI dumping causes desyncs in the actual movie, so a video can't be provided at this time. Yeah, it makes no sense. Elsewise it syncs just fine, amazingly enough.

	"This run is an improvement of about 9-10 seconds compared to arukAdo's original run, although I started input on the title screen instead of the opening logos, which makes it appear to be much slower then it actually is. The improvement comes from a few new tricks discovered in the years since his run, including a different Shaft fight and minor optimizations throughout.

I also saved a few frames doing two diagonal high jumps to the block button instead of two horizontal high jumps, which allows me to land directly on the button with the momentum from it.
