	"Before I talk about the actual run itself, let me talk about how broken Yabause and SaturnHawk are, since I had to deal with a lot of crap to get this thing done.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"First off, Yabause doesn't have a frame display. Or input display. Luckily, Notepad++ exists so I could at least use that as a way to see how I'm doing. Unfortunately, the built-in AVI dumping causes desyncs in the actual movie, so a video can't be provided at this time. Yeah, it makes no sense. Elsewise it syncs just fine, amazingly enough.
	$LF

[p 
	"SaturnHawk by comparison isn't quite as bad, but its crippling problem is that savestates completely break loading zones, which means it's completely worthless for TASing unfortunately.
	$LF

[p 
	"Anyway, on to the actual run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This run is an improvement of about 9-10 seconds compared to arukAdo's original run, although I started input on the title screen instead of the opening logos, which makes it appear to be much slower then it actually is. The improvement comes from a few new tricks discovered in the years since his run, including a different Shaft fight and minor optimizations throughout.

	"A few frames were saved in the opening by canceling kicks on enemies, which allows me to avoid some minor downtime at the end of them. I also saved a few frames doing two diagonal high jumps to the block button instead of two horizontal high jumps, which allows me to land directly on the button with the momentum from it.

	"Minor timesaves climbing thanks to finding a way to get some diagonal high jumps in the long rooms, which allow me to avoid hitting the ceiling/dive kicking to the opening. Another minor timesave is doing a backdash out of the magic door instead of a jump.

	"Minor timesave at the beginning doing a diagonal jump into the staircase instead of a horizontal one, allowing me to get a head start into it. The Griffon fight is slightly slower due to not being able to manipulate a critical high jump. Last minor timesave at the very end of the area by ending an air kick early and instead using the momentum from a dive kick into the door, saving about 7-8 frames or so.
