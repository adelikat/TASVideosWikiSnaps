	"Some backstory first: Spikestuff (politely) goaded me into doing this run after standard runs of bowling became acceptable on the site.  As I have recently begun to investigate RNG maniplation a bit more while TASing in general; I used 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=my old Pick-up Spares run|href=/4398M)
	" as a test canvas to see if I could use the Player 2 controller to manipulate RNG on the various spare layouts.  While messing around with P2 inputs, I discovered that pressing multiple number buttons on the P2 controller had various effects on the run that weren't possible while only using the P1 controller.  The following are the 4 effects that I discovered.

		"Pressing either

				"These glitched curve controlls don't seem to be drastically impacted by the lane slickness setting with the slight differences noted possibly being attributable to RNG changes.  I don't even know how to go about testing which is actually the case. But as the difference in viewing is essentially negligible, I chose the less slick lanes in the game settings as mentioned above.
