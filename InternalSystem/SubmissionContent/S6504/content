	"Super Monkey Ball Touch & Roll is the third Super Monkey Ball game featured on a handheld console, and the first for the Nintendo DS. The goal of the game is to roll a monkey in a ball around various stages, collecting bananas for extra lives and overcoming tons of crazy obstacles to reach the finish line on each level. It uses the DS touch screen as the primary controls for maneuvering the monkey around the level, although D-pad control is also supported.

	"The game carries some legacy, as it’s considered the last “mainline” Super Monkey Ball game by the community, bringing old SMB1 and SMB2 levels to the handheld and adding its own. After more than 4 years since the start of our TASing efforts, we are proud to bring you the first complete TAS of Touch & Roll, finishing all 120 stages of the game.

We wanted to show off all of the levels in the game, so we opted to use an almost-completed save file to make things easier. Why not just unlock worlds 11 and 12 during the run? Well... World 1 is unlocked by default. Completing World 1 unlocks World 2, etc. up

	"until World 11 (Studio One). To unlock Studio One, there are two special red goals in the game. One is on 8-1 Hollow Diamond, the other is on 9-2 Converse. By reaching both of these red goals in Challenge mode as well as completing World 10 (Zero G Station), Studio One is unlocked. That part is easy enough, and realistically would only lose a couple seconds in a TAS.

	"The problematic part is unlocking World 12, Mesh Mosh. After completing Studio One, a counter will appear in the corner of the screen reading '0/2006'. To unlock Mesh Mosh you need to collect 2006 bananas in total in Challenge Mode. Even in a TAS, this would be over 20 minutes of doing nothing but banana collecting, which of course we decided was really boring and uninteresting for a TAS. This is the reason we did newgame+, it does nothing more than to allow us to skip 1 red goal (on 8-1 the red goal is already faster), as well as skipping a brutal amount of grinding for bananas.

	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Many of the movement rules are similar to Super Monkey Ball 1 & 2, so many of the techniques are the same. The T&R engine has two main differences: the ball is much smaller than in SMB1/2, and acceleration is much faster. These two differences account for significant strategy changes, even on stages that were ported from the previous games.

The edges where these polygons meet are not smooth, and with the right direction and speed we can get a bounce off of a seemingly flat area. We also speculate that there are 'misalignments' between these polygons, causing edges to stick out and make it even easier to get a bounce.

	"The first TASing efforts on this game were by xy2_, a complete newcomer at the time. Joined by Silverbawxer, they both quickly struggled upon realizing the difficulty of TASing a Super Monkey Ball game. After getting stuck on only the third level in the entire game, efforts stopped for a long time. The project lay dormant for more than 3 years, where xy2_ occasionally made some individual level TASes of later stages.

	"In August 2018, Taechuk made the first optimised full TAS of T&R in a month. Although it contained many mistakes and only beat a few human records, it showed lots of potential for the game as well as for Taechuk as a TASer.
	$LF
	"The team reformed with Taechuk, Silverbawxer and xy2_ all joining up, where almost all work was done in secret for more than a year. Gonquai later joined the team and helped knock down some of the harder levels to beat, and with that, all 120 levels had finally been optimized.

[div class=p 
	"That brings us to today. Thanks to the game being very hex-friendly, we had complete freedom over which order the stages could be done, and could easily come back to them later to check for possible improvements. Many stages have had many different strategies and improvements by different players, sometimes over the course of months.

Although this only affects the 3D graphics (stage geometry) we think it looks a lot better than the original resolution. We would prefer if you link to our encode in the description of the TASVideos encode in case viewers prefer to see it this way. We still want an encode on the TASVideos channel so that more people will see our movie. (Our channels are all tiny!)

	" for the Nintendo DS has our favorite team of monkeys rolling around in a huge mix of old familiar levels, as well as totally brand new stages. The monkeys are tasked with beating 120 levels, and they whip through these stages at higher break-neck speeds than ever before. Taechuk, Silverbawxer, xy2_, and Gonquai utilize every trick up their sleeves to grind, bounce, clip, and fly their way through any obstacle the game can throw at them. Many of the techniques are explained in the submission text because if you blink, you just might miss them.

	"The SRAM usage appears justified to me. The grind for 2006 bananas is incredibly boring and is worth skipping. However, SRAM usage does not mean the submission is "newgame+" as it was previously labelled. "Newgame+" implies starting from a new game with some sort of progress carried over, usually in a mode labelled as such. This submission merely starts from a file that has completed the grinding so it should not have that label. Additionally, "all worlds" would be implied by simply labeling it the mode name.
