	"This is a videogame adaptation of Disney's five Winnie the Pooh films from 1966-1983. It's basically a boardgame... videogame! The whole strategy of the game is how good you can roll dice to satisfy a certain condition, whether that be landing on a certain space, or running away from another character who's trying to land on your space.

	"The objective in this movie is to trigger the credits as fast as possible, which is defined by finding all nine storybooks, and beating six different dice-rolling boards. You're allowed to continue the game if you lose a board (and it is most optimal timewise to lose the 4th), but without credits, TASVideos classifies that as not truly beating the game. More info on that in my earlier rejected submission: http://tasvideos.org/5452S.html

[p 
	"For the player, there is absolutely no RNG in the dice rolls. Instead, it works as follows: when there is another AI playing on your board (as in the case of boards one, three, and five), the dice will give you a 1 on the first three frames you can press A to stop the dice, a 2 on the next three frames, a 3 on the next three, and so forth. After 6 runs its course, the cycle repeats. When it becomes your turn again, the dice will always start the sequence again at 1.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"For the AI, the number that is rolled is purely RNG with no discernible patterns as far as I can tell.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"For boards with no other AI, the first turn follows the same rules as before. On subsequent turns, however, the dice actually continues from what the previous turn selected, being preceded by a 1 for one frame in all circumstances. For example, if you selected a 4 the first frame it appears your first turn, the next turn will start with a 1 for the first frame, a 4 for the next two, and then a 5 for the next three. Alternatively, if the first turn selects the 4 on it's third frame, the next turn will start with a 1 on the first frame, and go directly to a 5 for the next three. Rolling the 1 on the first frame of any turn will not advance the sequence previously described.

	"When rolling to see who goes first, the fastest situation was Rabbit and I both rolling 1's, so by default... I go first? The rest is just me getting six's and manipulating Rabbit to get 1's to finish in the fastest possible time.

	"You have to land on 3 starred spaces, each at a different corner of the map. There's two ways to go: clockwise or counter-clockwise. Going clockwise happens to be the faster way because walking up/down a tile is about 16 frames shorter than walking left/right a tile. The puddles subtract the moves you have left by two each time you land on one. By getting a 5 on the second frame of my last three turns, I can get across them in minimal time.

	"A simple, linear board where the goal is to land on the same space as Piglet. He begins 10 spaces ahead of you, which means I need to move 11 spaces between my two turns, as Piglet will move 1 forward on his. Rolling the 5 on my first turn instead of the 6 saved a few frames in manipulating Piglet to roll a 1.

	"Puddles everywhere on this board!! So many in fact, landing on the spring-board thingy in this instance is actually faster than walking around.
	$LF
	"Due to the manner the dice behaves without an AI, I'm able to get three 5's and a 6 on the second frame the dice is rolled. I get 1's on the first frame for turns where it is needed. And yes, that 1 dice roll at the end is necessary. There is no other combination of rolls that can save this sixth turn.

	"To win this board, you have to avoid Tigger for ten turns. Though this is actually the only board where losing it would be faster than winning, we have to win it if we want to see the credits. You might think the process would be similar to the last three boards, but there's a catch: Tigger's AI is able use cards, and we must avoid that scenario to prevent major time losses.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Tigger will only use a card on his 8th-10th turns if Pooh is 1, 3, 5, 10, 11, or 12 spaces from Tigger. Now, just rolling 1's all the way around the board for 10 turns won't work because: 1) Tigger will always begin his turn an odd number of spaces away from Pooh (note the "bad" distances of 1,3,5). 2) If we try to stay 7 or 9 spaces away, we will inevitably land on an arrow space which allows us to hide in the background scenery, but that has a very time-costly animation. It's so time-costly, in fact, that rolling a 2 wastes less time. Therefore, rolling a single 2 before Tigger's 8th turn should sync the two to "good" even-numbered distances.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Of all the RNG patterns I tested (more than half the TAS's rerecords were spent here), the best occurred when I used the two on my second turn, such that Tigger would start his turn the maximum of 12 spaces away. As a result, I was able to keep him in lockstep for several turns, before having to let him get closer because of the "bad" 10,11,12 distances.

	"This one is very simple: you have to land on the same space as Rabbit. I couldn't manipulate Rabbit to get a 6 on his turn, as the highest number he can roll in this minigame is a 4 for whatever reason.
