	"when I started this run, I just wanna create a default playthrough and then came the ideas of wanting to add new stuff. One of the fights that you'll see, will be Sagat/Honda vs Balrog where  was being made a combo and at the end, happened a dizzy on enemy(intentional) . That was just to add the trick "multiple dizzy" with Honda. I did that to prove it's possible make a 100% combo without get dizzy the enemy.
	$LF
	"I used, dramatic battle , 1p to story/final battle mode and extra aditions which include some glitches and tricks found to become the run interesting and watchable.

[p 
	"that can be little known but to z3 players is old hat. You'll need to active the custom combo for the glitch works.
	$LF
	"Basically when you perform it, your fighter will be pushing at the toward you are. To a easy compression you can understand it, like if were a "march out" of the zero point till destination point. In each fighter this glitch act of diferent forms, and the singles fighters that have a different reaction to the glitch.

	" Multi-dizzy: 
	$LF

	"When your enemy is dizzied and before him getting stand up , if you perform some special move that catch , surely you'll can make it, this is the game glitch

	" Simultaneous Supers: 
	$LF

[p 
	"If you perform a supercancel with both characters at the same time they'll can both use the same level of the super bar. example: Ryu and Sakura 2 Hadouken at level 3.
