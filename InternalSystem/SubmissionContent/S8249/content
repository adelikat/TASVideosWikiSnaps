	"Theatre skips: at 0:53 it is crucial that after exiting the secret passage to the theatre, one does not go backstage via the entrance on the left, that costs like 400 unskippable frames. You need to go backstage twice, once each in chapters 5 and 7. In chapter 5, click the apparatus on stage instead, and go to the entrance from there, that skips the unskippable.

	"Furthermore, at 0:55 exit the backstage via the hitbox on the left hand side of the screen and NOT the bottom of the screen. Again, multiple hundred frames being saved here, thanks to Pazuzu.
