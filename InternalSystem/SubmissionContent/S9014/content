	"Gold from enemies and hidden locations is used to buy upgrades: boots for speed, armor for damage reduction, and shields to block projectiles. Sword upgrades are a reward for killing certain bosses. The TAS foregoes armors and shields altogether, because they're unnecessary.

	"There are two shoe (speed) upgrades that cost 460 gold total. The early focus is on acquiring that gold. Gold drops typically range from ~1-5, but if you change the direction Wonder Boy is facing 2 frames before a gold drop appears, the value will be ~65-67 instead. It's funny how this knowledge manifested back in the 80s in the arcades: we used to "wiggle" the joystick left and right furiously in an effort to get the big $$$.

	": Looks like solid effort. I never saw the original, so I don't know anything about the issues found. From my analysis, I saw many things that makes this run stand out. Damage boosting, HP management, clipping, precise jumping, etc.. As for the gold glitch, I find it an interesting outcome on how you obtained your upgrades. At the very beginning of your run, I did question your reason for stopping and getting gold...but know I understand. I also want to point out that this run is around 3 minutes faster than what a human can do...so this really has some fantastic strength. Great job!
