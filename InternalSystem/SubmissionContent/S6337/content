	"MARIO is a Super Mario World ROM hack created by a SMWcentral user by the name of M A R I O in 2014, which is also known as a Creepypasta hack. Oddly, here is what the description implies:

	[a class=extlink href=https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/MARIO rel=nofollow 
		"the Creepypasta wiki
	]a
	" on March 2011, in which it included information about the Creepypasta itself and the aftermath of its first publication (at SMWCentral). The hack, itself, eventually got uploaded by M A R I O in March 2014.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"MARIO features eight playable, yet mostly unedited, levels, three of which are automatically unlocked at start. The levels you start with, from left to right, are the following: never come back, YOSHI'S, and YOSHI'S HOUSE.

	" YOSHI'S HOUSE
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This level is basically the same as YOSHI'S ISLAND 2 in the original Super Mario World. The exception is that some blocks and/or objects, such as pipes, the midway point tape, or the Yoshi coins, have been removed in the process.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Other than that, I just simply zip through the course in record time.

[h4 
	" YOSHI'S ISLAND 7
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This level is simply just a blanket of blue overworld ground over black background with no other obstacles or objects present (other than the goal tape in the end).

	"The exception is that every coin, every Yoshi coin, and every sprite, except for the blue P-Switch, have been removed. To make up for its impossibility, the creator of the hack has put invisible blocks over the pits that are impossible to jump over, even at the maximum X speed.

	"In MARIO, the darker side of the goal point tape displays every few tiles over a line of message boxes which also displays every few tiles. In addition, there is upside-down lava with a color of blue-grey just three tiles above Mario.

	"In MARIO, you start on a three-block-wide platform next to what seems to be a pit that is impossible to jump over, even at the maximum X speed. To make up for its impossibility, the creator of the hack has put a line of invisible blocks crossing from the starting platform to the end platform, consisting of two blocks wide along with a door leading to the boss room.

As you travel through this room, you will find one-block-tall doors that can only be entered as Small Mario. In the end, you will find that there is a wall of cement blocks indicating that this is the end of the room. However, you will be able to find an invisible warp pipe on the bottom of the wall that will lead you to the next room.

There is a three-block-wide platform of cement blocks and a wall of cement blocks at the end of the room. To make up for its impossibility, the creator of the hack has added invisible blocks as the ground for the remainder of this room. There is an invisible warp pipe that you will be able to press down in that will lead you to the next room. It is about 3.5 tiles away from the starting platform.
