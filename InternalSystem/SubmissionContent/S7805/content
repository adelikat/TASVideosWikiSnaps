	"This is a "side-submission". I originally only intended to work on the U-version of Dragon's Lair, but noticed that some solutions could improve the TAS of the J-version. Since this game is easy and short to TAS, with (mostly) good synching properties, I decided to spend a little time with the J-version as well.

	"While implementing the improvements that were common to both versions, I also took the opportunity to investigate some of the areas that needed a version-specific approach and came up with a few additional improvements (mainly in the boss fights). The bulk of this TAS is however copied inputs from previous TASes. Comparing Kirkq's (KQ) and MESHUGGAH's (MH) previous efforts, I can see (non-trivial) traces of both in this submission and have therefore included them as co-authors.

	"This level is tricky to TAS optimally without external tools. The LK has a 1/816 chance to spawn every game frame (so every 3 actual frames), based on the game's RNG. Other than frame delays, the only way to impact RNG is by pressing R. The "Basic Bot" in Bizhawk was an excellent and invaluable tool for quickly finding suitable solutions. I'm guessing KQ and MH did not use any tools in this level and there were therefore a few delays from unoptimal manipulations in their respective TASes. 21 frames were saved from getting optimal spawns.
