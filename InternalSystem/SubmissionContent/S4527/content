Secondly, I really think the goal choice of this run is meant to be chanllenging so the higher difficulty of USA version becomes a pro here, and the sound track quality of U version isn't bad at all for an 8-bit game anyway. BTW, U version has better graphics than J version does.

Mummies can generate flying bandages in hardmode. It's a kind of annoying. Again, Samhain-Grim's strategy is used for the Alucard fight. Alucard doesn't ask Trevor to team up this time since he knows Trevor is going to the Sunken City. You know, vampires hate water.

Luckily, the stategy still works pretty well after some modifications.

I try to follow Scrimpeh's strategy for the final fight, but Trevor is obviously not as nimble as Grant. The sub-weapon triplelizer turns out to be useless for the second and third phase, but it actually can save some frames during the first phase, at least for Trevor. The total time used for this fight with axes seems to be more than that of the fight with crosses in Samhain-Grim's "Alucard path" run. I hope the slower fight is caused by more lagging. I hope.
