	": A nice arcade Shoot 'Em Up, Daioh features great graphics and some entertaining boss fights. The author achieves the maximum possible score, 999999999, by maximizing the amount of points obtained during the two runs and by getting an impressive bonus for each excess life accrued during the gameplay. The gameplay appears sufficiently optimized.

	"The original submission contained excess frames after the last necessary input to enter the "TAS" name in the hall of fame. I found none of these frames are actually necessary since Arcade games typically employ timers to limit gameplay (a money-making strategy unique to arcades). Therefore, both the credits and the hall of fame will pass if you wait long enough. Based on this, I replaced the original submission with a truncated one that saves 10622 frames.
