	"The game I infamously remember someone misquoting as Chuck Chuck Rock in a TV games preview show. It kind of caught onto me and so I prefer to call the game Chuck Chuck Rock instead of just Chuck Rock. After recently watching Dan's run, I thought by Todays standards his run a bit unoptimized and a mere 1200 rerecords simply isn't enough to produce an optimal run through this game. The overall improvement is 274 frames, but considering its very simple prehistoric physics and the fact that jumping,kicking and even clipping corners generally doesn't slow Chuck down. Also Chuck only jumps to a fixed amount, generally is simplied things but it did add a lot to the frustration of the game.

	"Level 1 - time is generally saved by using different jumping sequences and taking a additional damage, as well as that I used a damage boost that knocks Chuck up into the air giving him a little extra height in order to reach certain platforms, sadly I don't know if this was intended programming so I can't comment on whether its a programming error or not.

[div class=p 
	"Level 2 - Most of the time was saved here by luck manipulating the rockfall in the last level so I don't get hit by any of the large falling rocks, the upwards damage boost was partly how I managed to manipulate the rockfall, time is also saved in the second level with more optimal rock throwing

	"Level 3 - The easiest level to optimize in the whole game, I don't see how any of this could be potentially improved. The first whale can only be activated by landing on him, but the second whale can be activated a few frames earlier by falling short of him.

[div class=p 
	"Level 4 - by far the most frustrating level to do, but the biggest overall improvement to the run, I had to remodel part two several times in order to manipulate the dancing green guy whose situated just before the small who Mamouth blows Chuck partway across the level, I had to sacrifice 5 frames in order to produce a favourable result. The last part had the biggest improvement becuase I discovered that the blowing mamoth could be skipped entirely without the need to take any damage.
