	"Playing one player in this run was difficult to accomplish.  I used SNES9x v.1.43-dev.  The .smv file won't work in any other version.  Even in the finished version of v.1.43.  I didn't stop recording the demo until the "beat the game" message comes up.  So the ending time reads 15:39.

	"Some of the bosses were kind of annoying.  The wall climber boss was the boss I had most trouble with since he kept moving up and down.  I end up beating the Level 2 boss in around 2 seconds.
