	"This is the most action-packed TAS that ever existed. Screw Mario, Sonic, Legend of Zelda, Metroid, MegaMan, no, watch this instead. This makes those games look like shit.

	"McDonald's: Golden Arch Adventures is truly deserving of its title. In this TAS, you will experience the adventure of having to look at two yellow (not golden) arches.

	"This game also has the best music ever! These are some rockin' tunes! You know what, I'm gonna dance to it. Here you go! *stands still and does nothing*

	"This game is also far ahead of its time. The video game genre of still images being placed on screens to stare at was revolutionized by the extreme popularity of this game. All

	" lines of code used to make this game were spent with hard, meticulous work for an awesome product. This game is so complex, it couldn't be completely dissected. Never can one find meaning behind every pixel represented on that image. Nothing will ever replace this masterpiece; it will be in our memories forever.

	"Also, this submission text is by far the longest I've ever written. And this game totally has a completion goal. Very competitive game; I'm sure somebody will beat this tomorrow, with 0:00.01, so why even submit it? Awesome staring strats were used to make this.

		" This game could be replaced by the actual McDonald's logo. In the early 1980s, people didn't have Google Images, so I can't argue that they could've just looked up a better image than this, but hell, they could still just go to McDonald's and stare at the logo. Heck, wouldn't it be better to just go there to buy somethi- waaaaaaaaitttt a minute!!!

	"I GET IT! I TOTALLY GET IT NOW! That was the reason they made this game, wasn't it? To make it so bad, it sells. Clever sales trick.

	"If you look long enough, and say "I'm lovin' it" enough times, the M will move by one quarter of a pixel. But this is a 15-hour challenge. Who will be the unlucky person to say "dare" on truth or dare for this one?
