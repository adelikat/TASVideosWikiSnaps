	"See this is tool-assisting for real, bitchnazz. This is how the TAS was made. I set up the emulator, hardwired some cables so I could play it on an old piece of shit TV which R.O.B. reacted to (Finding a TV-set for this took one hell of a time). So whenever a level started, I calculated which way would be the fastest, then made R.O.B. do his moves, and then re-recorded from the beginning of the screen. Now, unfortunately, this took a lot of time, and I never bothered to shut R.O.B. off between the planning and executing, so during the making of level 39, the expected happened. R.O.B. died from loss of battery.

	"Also, the saddest part is that I didn't manage to complete this TAS before April 1st struck, and I'm not the one waiting to submit a TAS. Now, it just looks like a joke.
