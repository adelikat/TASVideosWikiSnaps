The game would be a real nightmare to TAS without this special help.

Several seconds were gained (for my surprise) despite the fact you still need to reach the finish line during the last lap. It’s slightly faster avoiding one of the jumping obstacles in order to achieve maximum speed asap.

		$LF
		"We found out about this glitch thanks to the bot, which exploited it to reach a target checkpoint faster, but then failed to proceed to the rest of the race. So then Challenger took the task of finding out how to fully exploit the bug for the rest of the race. So he found a way to create an "artificial" mini circuit that completes the race within this crazy glitched state. After this find, I used the bot again to refine the execution of the mini circuit.

		"Originally we worked on this race implementing a tricky lap glitch route from the RTA run. Since tank vehicles are slower, the strategy takes a while for each lap, but the super glitch discovery saved around 750 frames over the previous strategy by gaining a super speed during the first lap, then the tank will be towed to a random point, for the remaining laps you must trigger C12/13 and C52 or 53 so the lap glitch will work on some “invisible” places: somehow I managed to trigger both C13 and 53 at the same time during the second lap, adding extra impressive work while eien finished the last lap by respawning the tank on C12/13, triggering C52 and instantly finishing the race as soon as the player touches the “invisible lap glitch trigger” - this glitch is really unique and I like it too!
		$LF
		"As eien said: we don’t understand well about this glitch, and practically requires trial-and-error + TAS tools because not only the whole race becomes glitched but lots of “random barriers” can confuse the player, towing the tank to random points or even softlock the race.
