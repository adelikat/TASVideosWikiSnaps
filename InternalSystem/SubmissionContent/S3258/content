	"Here is my 7th submission. It’s Super Mario Bros 2 J on Super Famicom. This movie is a Luigi version run.
	$LF
	"When I finished my 6th submission, I decided to do another game run. So I choose Super Mario Games. I found that there are Mario and Luigi version run on Famicom. But there is only Mario version run on Super Famicom. So I do this run. 
	$LF
	"It’s unfortunately that Luigi run is slower than Mario run. But Luigi has his own skills which Mario doesn’t have. He can jump higher than Mario.

	"Here is a blank, you can see the different from 4 different run.
