This strategy is fastest for the first 2 laps. Ticking is done again, using a mushroom. The trick is named for the "ticking" engine noise due to the A button not being pressed. This track's walls disappear once hit, which is why only one banana glitch can be done, after which Peach falls off. Boo Lake also only has walls on the left, so the glitch will only work once.

	"Sky Garden is where we need Yoshi. With no walls along the finish line, the banana glitch cannot be used. So we boost around the line using a couple of mushrooms. Yoshi's sharp turning lets him turn around completely on lap 3, crossing the finish line in midair. No other character can do this.

This track, as many others in this TAS uses a lot of MTs, or Mini-Turbos, normally done by drifting for one second in a single direction, You can also trick the game by alternating left and right without letting the D-Pad go neutral. This lets you MT on a straight path and is known as ZZMT, or Zig-Zag Mini-Turbo. When an MT or ZZMT is used, you'll see blue sparks around the kart.

I spent a lot of time trying to figure out the optimal route, but after I was done I realized there was an obvious time loss, which demotivated me so much that I didn't work on the TAS for over a year. Even after I came back, I realized there was a mushroom I had at the end of GV1 that I didn't use. It would've saved a small amount of time to fix, but at that point I was already finished recording and I did not want to bother going back and changing it.

I tried to solve this by doing slightly different inputs during the race but nothing worked. I eventually had to go back and redo Vanilla Lake 2, so that the CPUs would finish in a different order, and therefore start the next race in a different order... this finally worked! But only barely, as you can see in the final product that Wario is still very close to us at the end. It also resulted in a slightly faster time on VL2!
