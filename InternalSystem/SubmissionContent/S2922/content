]h2
[p 
	"Mega Man ZX Advent for the Nintendo DS is the second game of the third spin-off series of the Mega Man franchise, Mega Man ZX. The Mega Man ZX series took away from the "select your level and beat boss there" setup and replaced it with a more Metroidvania-like setup, with one open world with all areas connected.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Both games of the series allow you to choose between two characters, a male and a female one (Vent and Aile respectively in the first game, Grey and Ashe in this game). Ashe is chosen in this game, because despite having a weaker charge shot she wins a significant amount of time by having shorter cutscenes and a shorter intro stage.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In ZX Advent, the user is given much less freedom to pick an order, with only three situations where you have different options to go with. These are choosing in which order to do Arctic Ice Floe and Tower of Verdure stages, choosing in which order to do Highway, Floating Ruins, Scrapyard and Control Center stages, and choosing in which order to do Mysterious Lab, Waterfall Ruins and Bio Lab stages. Everything else goes with a predetermined route.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Mega Man ZX Advent allows you to use Biometal Model A, which instead of copying boss weapons, allows you to copy the bosses you defeat completely. There are in total 15 forms available (disregarding post-game completion extras), way more than is practical: several are only used when the game specifically require you to use them.

I use Model A and Model F here, Model A for the stage parts and Model F for the minibosses and the main boss, Thetis (Model L).

Which of the other two stages to do first hardly matters, since I need to pick up the Waterfall Ruins warp point first anyway. But there's 10 pixels of difference from where the warp point can be collected and where you end up when you warp there, which makes doing Mysterious Lab first advantageous by 2-3 frames.

I use Model F for the second part because you need to shoot certain objects to move them to open doors, but they can be sent flying much further if you punch them - often right where you need them to be in one punch.

Instead of using Rospark and the poles to carefully maneuver through, like you're supposed to, I use Model H and use walls and airdashes to fall through the section quickly.

	"As for the boss refights in Ouroboros 2, I don't use elemental advantages but rather just use ZX to combo the heck out of all Pseudoroids except Queenbee. I used new tactics for Vulturon, Buckfire, Chronoforce and Rospark (because I didn't have ZX when I first fought them), and repeated the same tactics for Argoyle & Ugoyle, Bifrost, Hedgeshock (the latter mostly; I couldn't manipulate him to stand still like last time without severe delays for luck manipulation, so the end combo is a bit different) and Queenbee (the only one I don't use ZX on). Ouroboros 3 has the infamous regenerating blocks and spiked regenerating blocks, but these don't really form a hindrance to just moving forward using Model A.

	"The final boss consists of two phases, Albert's three-headed dragon and Albert himself. The dragon has 450 health but doesn't have invincibility, which means the battle is over pretty quickly with Model F. I wait for a short time in between the 60Hz autofiring to let it use another attack, because otherwise it would go into its desperation mode, which renders it invincible for several seconds.

	"Albert himself is finished surprisingly quickly. It has a shield, with 110 health (although it takes more damage than usual, especially from Model A's homing shot, and there are 10 targets that can be used to lower its HP), which regenerates fairly quickly (1 damage per 15 frames). I use Homing Shot twice, each time hitting enough targets to bring the shield's HP to 0. Then I must hit Albert before the shield regenerates itself, which I use Model ZX for. Then I combo him down using ZX pretty quickly. Enjoy the ending cutscenes and credits.

	": While the amount of cutscene and downtime was quite ridiculous in the earlier parts of the run, this became more balanced as the movie went on. I particularly enjoyed the usage of the various forms; one would expect overuse of the most powerful form, but as far as I could see there was decent variety here. Due to this I found this game more interesting to watch than the Zero series, despite the extra length. Accepting for publication.
