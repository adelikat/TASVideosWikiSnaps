	"I didn't think I would have been able to improve on xenos' run at the time he submitted it. At the time I created my walkathon, however, I learned about a lot of new tricks and glitches and since I had a lot of potential time-savers and stuff in my mind I went and tried to improve his run... and succeeded.

	"The bonus screens after each world are a big turn-off. If you save a few frames in a level, the bonus screen at the end of the world would ruin your save. In order to succeed with the bonus screens, you have to invest idle frames into the first two levels of a world. For example, you can only pass the bonus screen of the first world if you invest 1 idle frame in 1-1 and 3 idle frames in 1-2. Despite was xenos said, namely that 4 idle frames in the first two levels need to be put in, I didn't succeed when I put the 4 idle frames in 1-2. The matter with the bonus screens and the frame rule that seems to be linked to it still isn't very examined and needs to be looked into.

	"Most points were saved just by comboing enemies which weren't comboed before. In contrary to what most people might believe, you are allowed to touch the ground inbetween enemies when comboing them as the only thing that matters is a set amount of time in which you need to reach the next enemy for a combo to work. 4 Frames were saved in 2-3 by skipping the dragon instead of fighting it which unfortunately meant a 5000 points loss. 1 Frame in 3-1 was saved by lag reduction. Many frames were  saved in 3-3 by navigating through the passage faster.

However, the screen is very delayed. I couldn't do anything about it despite trying to put idle frames in the previous levels and trying a lot of strategies. The next person who runs this game should look into the mechanics of the bonus screens and hopefully succeed acquiring these 5000 points back! ._.
