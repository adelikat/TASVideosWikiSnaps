	"This TAS was made during my gain of interest in the subject of Chinese bootleg games. The game has a lot of original and interesting content and a few techniques that make it a worthy TAS to make and show. I abuse a few things like an incredible quantity of iframes to go through the level faster. The game is comprised of 8 levels that require you to collect a set number of items to finish them and a final boss which is probably the most boring part of the movie. Notice that the rom I used is the only one I could find that works online.

	"- The two main mechanics used are the broom and the spellcasting which are both bound to the B button. The broom allows Harry to go around 4 times faster than the normal walking speed, with a very quick acceleration.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"- The spellcasting is useful to kill ennemies and the last boss, but is also useful to cancel jumps which normally have a set height and can slow everything down. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- To be able to broom more often, I take a lot of damage, since taking a hit gives Harry more than a second of iframes, during which he cannot be hit again, which allows him to go through other ennemies.

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- When I get to the tire, I jump and cancel the jump a frame after with a spellcasting to be able to trigger the tire bounce, which gives me a higher jump than ordinary, without which I can't reach the first star.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- The roof surface is a very peculiar one and the only time we see it in effect in this run. While on it Harry slowly slids down up until he falls, which forces me to use jumping to go as fast as possible off of them. The broom can't be used either on those surfaces. This part was pretty annoying because in some spots Harry would just fall through the roof instead of being able to jump so I had to be careful. At the end of the roof section I use a spellcasting to go directly through the roof down to the ground and go on my broom again.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- When I get the last star I go back down by spellcasting which gives me a small horizontal movement to the left and subsequently allows me to not stop on any of the platform which would have lost me a few more frames.

[div class=p 
	"- This level is entirely vertical and requires me to go from one end to the other multiple times as i climb the building. However it also features the only skip of the game, around frame 3240: by taking damage from an enemy on the floor higher than the one I was on, the game automatically zips me to this level, saving a few seconds over going the whole way around that includes two staircases which are very slow.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p

	"- This level is once again a straight line but I do have to go to the end of the level first to pick up an item there then come back to get the last star because you cannot actually go down from a platform in this game. Otherwise I'm just abusing iframes through most of the level.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- At the end of the level, at frame 6860 onwards, I cut the momentum of my jump using a spellcasting to be able to have the maximum amount of time brooming on the platform, but sadly I cannot avoid getting hit by the bullet shot by the ennemy. It results in a few frames of apparent lag.

	"- This level is actually a loop in which the Snitches spawn one by one. The route I take follows what I found to be the fastest, by taking the first 4 snitches on the first loop on the level and then changing the loop to have snitches spawn again (around frame 9020 you'll see the tire on the right edge of the screen disappear, which from what I could gather meant I changed the loop of the level or at least the spawns of the Snitches).

I focused first on the right side before switching as quickly as possible to to the left side then coming back to the right side for the end. Nothing much to say apart from the fact that this level is hard to complete as fast as possible: there's not a lot of possibilities to use the broom and platforms are really far from one another.

	"This game is not too bad and I think I did an ok job tasing it. As it is still my first submission and my first completed TAS, I know there's probably some optimizations that can be done left and right to save a few dozens frames but I optimized it to the point I wanted it to be. I think it's a good thing to take a look at some of the "better" bootlegs made out of China and Russia that are games of their own and not just a title hack.
