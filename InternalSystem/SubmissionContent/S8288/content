The game made its debut in 2000 on Sega Dreamcast, Sony PlayStation, Microsoft Windows and Nintendo Game Boy Color, the last of which is a completely different 2D game. Cruella kidnapped our siblings to turn them into toys, and we have to rescue them (or not, as it turns out).

In order to beat the game, you need to complete 20 levels in their intended order by finding the shortest path to the '102' portal, and defeat Cruella De Vil in each of her 4 boss fights. The enemies you see throughout the levels are toys from Cruella's failed toy business, reprogrammed to kidnap puppies. Most of the time, any kind of collectibles (including puppy crates) are

The trickiest object clips manipulate the position of dying enemies, which despawn after only a second. The key to object clipping is positioning the puppy between the object and the wall, then pivoting in place so that the object’s hitbox pushes the puppy away and partially into the wall. Completing the turn increases the chances of clipping. Once partially clipped, we jump to be pushed the rest of the way out.

For this reason, we have to delay the 3rd melon hit just slightly so that the melon is done growing right at the end of the cutscene.

				" discovered how Cruella’s direction works while we were building the PS1 trainer. There are two relevant counters: a timer 0x0E46F8 and a direction counter 0x0E45EC. The timer counts down from 180 in the first phase and 150 in the other phases, and Cruella shoots when it reaches 0. The direction counter starts at a random value between 1 and 500 and decreases at the same rate as the timer. If the direction counter is 251 or less, Cruella moves clockwise. If it’s 252 or more, she moves counterclockwise. If it starts above 251 but goes below it while there’s still time left on the timer, Cruella will turn. Because the counters can only count down, this means that Cruella can never start off moving clockwise and then turn. Both the time and direction counter reset after each shooting phase.

It may look like nothing has changed in the route, but we discovered that triggering the first room transition in a certain way saves time. When you normally hit the trigger, the game takes control over the puppy and makes it walk to a very specific spot. Even though it looks very much like a cutscene, it's not. The transition to the next room only happens when the puppy reaches that exact spot, otherwise it will continuously try to get to it—the game softlocks in cases where there are any obstacles in the puppy’s way. Maintaining the speed from the mountain boost and bypassing the trigger by jumping into it shortens the distance that the puppy has to travel while under the game’s control, which saves 16 frames. Some other timesave comes from a faster slope boost at the end of the level.

The rooster’s only job is to crow each time you get a hen in the coop. However, the developers didn't expect us on top of the coop and made his model with the properties of an enemy toy. Rolling into him makes him die, which gets rid of the unskippable cutscenes every time we put a hen away. It also makes it so that we don't have to worry about softlocking by putting the hens away too quickly. Even though we knew about this by the first TAS, we didn't have a fast way to get to the rooster before putting the hens away.

Instead, we now use the outside Bulldozer once more, and the slope boost gets us to the silo faster even though it's a longer distance.

				"Without exaggeration, this level has the coolest trick in the game. Teleportation, when you have full control of the puppy, is Toy Factory exclusive movement tech. The bopper toy box is one of many obstacles in the level that move in a cycle: it first drops from the ceiling, goes along the conveyor belt, then lifts to the top and teleports back to the starting point in just a single frame. If the puppy is on top of the box, it goes to that point with the box. The teleport itself is useless until you change one minor thing—the puppy’s position relative to the box.

				"Normally, the puppy is not supposed to be on top of the bopper box. For a long time, there wasn’t a fast enough way to reach it. That is, until 2019, when 
				[code 
					"Custom

				" finally discovered one. It turned out the trick relies heavily on the crusher, moving platform, and box cycles.

			[div class=p 
				"It all starts in the first room of the factory, where we do a shortcut by clipping onto the upper platform with the help of the Punching Bag. That allows us to leave the room at the perfect time, and without taking any damage. Surprisingly, if you quit the room a frame later, the cycle for the second room breaks, and the teleportation trick won't be as fast as we want it to be. 
				$LF
			]div
			[div class=p 
				"In the second room, the main obstacles are crusher machines, which slam together from both sides to crush the puppy in the middle. We navigate to a very specific pair of crushers and get ready for a massive speed boost. It's important to be on the right side of the crushers because the left side always causes damage, which decreases the puppy’s speed and fails the trick. When the crushers slam together, it pushes the puppy towards the moving platform, which happens to be going up at the exact time the puppy lands on it. If you jump at the very edge of this platform, maintaining the crushers’ speed boost, the puppy gets just enough height to reach the top of the box.
				$LF
			]div
			[div class=p 
				"The next step is to jump off the box and be in front of it at the moment it teleports. The X axis displacement of the box converts into the puppy’s horizontal speed. Combined with rolling, that makes the puppy go at about 235,000 speed units, which is the fastest it can go with currently known strats. The game struggles to process collision with that much speed, so the puppy goes directly to the end of the level and through both walls of the upper room. Considering the trick relies on cycles, there's not much we can do about going any faster. However, the previous TAS switched puppies here in order to intentionally slow down and make navigation easier, and we found a way to reach the end without slowing down.

				"If the position of the puppy on top of the bopper box just before the teleportation is (-1205311, 174071, -670485) and the position of the puppy entering the '102' portal is (563929, 173068, -416210), then the distance that the puppy travels in just under a second is about 1787419 units. For reference, it would take roughly 22 seconds to travel that far by continuous rolling at 2730 speed.

				"We get a laser cannon this time! We just can’t hit Cruella with it. There are three phases where we have to destroy Cruella’s machines, and then we’ve beaten the game. Each cannon has a limited amount of energy, and shooting or shielding uses it up. Running out of energy or getting hit by Cruella while unshielded will destroy the cannon. We then have to move to the left to trigger the next cannon to spawn. This level saves time with the addition of analog, because the laser sight moves faster with it.

					"We have to destroy 8 boxes that circle Cruella’s platform. It’s possible to destroy them by getting OoB and barking at them, but we haven’t found a way to do that yet without using the trainer. Instead, we use a strategy similar to the one used in RTA runs: aiming to the bottom left. This destroys 7 of the 8 boxes, and to get the last one, we switch to the right and shoot where it will end up. By the time it gets there and is destroyed, we’ve already moved the laser to shoot at Cruella (which is useless, but fun).

					"In this phase, we have to destroy 6 robot heads that appear one at a time in 6 possible spots. Until March of this year, we didn’t realize that the robots seemed to take so many shots to kill because they’re invincible for approximately 1.5 seconds after they appear (discovered by 
					[code 
						"Chory
					]code
					"). As a result, all RTA runs and the previous TASes took many more shots than needed, wasting laser energy. Waiting until the robots are vulnerable and then taking a single shot will kill them. The position that the robot head appears in is determined by RNG. The worst patterns spawn a robot behind Cruella, where it’s invisible and impossible to shoot. Previous TASes did some small RNG manipulations to avoid the slowest patterns, but we decided to take it one step further by manipulating all the robots to spawn in the same spot in the very front. We got it to work through a combination of camera movement (which was used in previous TASes) and extra shots. But then, 
					[code 
						"Avouca
					]code
					" came up with an even faster idea: cannonless robots. In 2019, 
					[code 
						"Custom
					]code
					" discovered that the robots are vulnerable to the puppy’s bark, but they can only be reached if they spawn in the front position. In the previous TAS, barking was used only for the last robot. We now needed a way to get all 6 robots to spawn in front without using the RNG manipulation strategies from the cannon. We already knew that barking affects RNG (because each bark is a different pitch), but barking wasn’t enough to get the robots in front. We found two additional methods to manipulate the RNG: rolling and (only in this level, for some reason) moving. However, we had to be careful not to move too far, because entering the red areas would spawn the next cannon. Using these strategies, we got cannonless!

					"Once we’re done with the robot heads, we go to the left to spawn the second and last cannon of the fight. The goal is to destroy 3 energy orbs that seem to supply power to Cruella's machinery. There's plenty of time for us to mess around with the cannon on this phase as we wait for the orbs to appear. Again, we shoot Cruella as much as possible for fun, but there's another reason for using the cannon to its fullest. If you look closely, we barely run out of cannon energy by the time the last orb spawns to make the final shot and take damage at the same moment. That makes the level end faster than normal and saves us 48 frames. Done!
