	"This time around, I took the entire battle into MATLAB, and then found the entire optimal battle for each possible agility for characters. (For the most part, some assumptions were made) Using this, in addition to strategy changes and the discovery that character starting stats could be manipulated, I managed to save 4:13.7 off the previous run.

	"When you start a new game, the RNG levels all characters from their starting level to the level are when they join. This occurs 6 seconds into this run, and occurs in about 35 frames. Luckily, it can be manipulated using the controller, and enough characters don't join that there are gaps for manipulating the characters that do. Also, the game is hex-edit friendly, as long as the RNG matches on a given frame, and the # of frames remains consistent. However, the  code for this was too difficult to decompile and manipulate, so gia's brute force bot saved the day. About 80% of the 35 frames were made by the bot.

	"This was my fun discovery and massive time sink for this run. I also gained some savings by optimizing the entire battle, as oppose to each round individually. (Essentially, I ignored the distance to move from the end of one round to the start of the next.) My method is pretty cool to any algorithm geek as well.

	"The first step is to simulate the first round, and then pick the fastest order that ends in each character in a round. Thus, if we have 10 characters, we have 10 ending positions, and 10 rounds to consider. Next, we take the second round, and determine the fastest order given the character that starts that round, and ends that round, so now we have 100 possible rounds. We combine round 1 and 2, and compute the distance between those two, giving us 1000 possible orders. (This is the cool part!) Now, before we go on to round 3, we trim that 1000 different options down to the ten fastest, given each character at the end of a round. We can repeat forever, and it doesn't become an NP problem.
