	"Here is version 2 of “non-glitched” Dragon Warrior 3.  This TAS is over 23 minutes faster than the original!!  While I was making my first version of this game, a very well-known and respected TAS-er said “Personally, I think anything sub 3hrs would be publish-worthy.”  Well, here is the full run of Dragon Warrior 3, completed in less than TWO hours!!  If you haven’t watched the previous version of this movie, or if you don’t know much about Dragon Warrior 3, I recommend reading the submission novel that I wrote for version 1 of this game, see here 
	(__wikiLink|href=/1476S|implicitdisplaytext=1476S)
	".  Not all of this text applies directly to version 2, but many questions can still be answered there.

				"Party Choice – I used the default party here which of course gave me a soldier instead of two pilgrims.  While his RNG manipulation ability is limited, he made all the fights shorter, especially at lower levels due to his ability to inflict much higher damage than the pilgrim.  I was worried that he would have a “useless” first round in boss fights, but it turned out not to be the case.  He can parry, fight, use an herb (see the Baramos fight) or use a seed to manipulate the rest of the fight.  The soldier is the main reason why the fights are shorter, along with the “slow” message speed.

In many places, I was able to just slow down the emulator to 3% speed and press the button on the fastest frame on the first record instead of figuring out what the fastest frame was, then doing a re-record.

		"I still believe this game is popular enough to warrant two runs if someone decides to do a “glitched” version.  (Well, at least I think it’s more popular than some games with two movies, such as Rescue Rangers, M.C. Kids, and Gimmick…)  Also, if someone decides to do the glitched version, you may want to think very carefully about where and how you want to level up.  Manipulating metal babbles on the Samanao shrine island can be extremely difficult and time-consuming (in real time and in game time).
