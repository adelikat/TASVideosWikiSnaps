	"There are only two minor gameplay improvements in this submission. When trying to sync the rest of the run, there were also quite big swings in the "random" lag frames. Below is a summary of what has changed since the last submission, both in terms of the gameplay improvements, but also the "random" lag. "Random" lag and screen transition times between levels can vary significantly, but for reasons unknown to me. So it's essentially a source of randomness that I haven't been able to control other than through some far from non-exhaustive trial-and-error.
