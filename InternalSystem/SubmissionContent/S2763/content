	"A Link to the Past is a game about a boy who woke up in the night to throw bushes around. He also enjoys to take equipment from relatives, bump into guards and walk through stairs. He's apparently a hero.

	"Wobbling - You are able to speed up your movement when going up and left by changing direction every second frame.

	"Pixelporting - When being between two walls while going up/down, face the wall to either left or right and press <^> or <v>, depending on going up or down.

	"Faster walking in stairs - Holding <^> or <v> when walking in stairs speeds you up a bit. It also makes you walk through some of stairs.

	"This is probably the 10th, or so, time I have tried to improve this run. I keep on coming up with ideas that could save time, but it "never succeded". 
	$LF
	"When I did this version, it was actually supposed to be for the full run improvement I'm working on. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When comparing to my previous glitched run, I was suddenly one frame faster which I couldn't understand.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The reason to this is that the guard I damage boost off started to move one frame earlier, which resulted in getting a better angle when boosted. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In the previous submission text, I mentioned that "2 frames lost because two frames were saved" and something about the guard. The problem there is that I can only take damage every 4th frame. If I was able to take damage earlier from the guard, more time could be saved.

	"I also didn't include the beginning input animation, as I thought it "got old", so I did my own one at the end instead.
