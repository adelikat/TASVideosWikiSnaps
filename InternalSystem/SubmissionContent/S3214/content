	"Often these enemy buffs have a fairly trivial effect on my strategy. Seth is such an overpowered unit that increased enemy stats usually mean he 2HKOes an enemy with a relatively common weapon instead of 1HKO, and extra attacks cost around 40 frames. But occasionally tougher enemies have such an impact on my strategy that I have to take an altogether different approach from Cheetah’s run. This is most apparent in Chapter 9 where I have to handle a large portion of a rout map with weak unpromoted units. See my chapter-by-chapter comments for more on that.

	"Hard mode also introduces more enemies to contend with. I count 46 extra enemies that attack my units, but there’s bound to be more that use time just by moving on enemy phase. As enemy encounters cost around 300 frames, this accounts for approximately 13800 frames of time lost compared to normal mode. Thus, I estimate I would’ve saved at least 6464 frames (about 2 minutes) from the currently published run had I chosen normal mode, and that’s a very conservative estimate. I wouldn’t be surprised if the actual amount is closer to double that, but I have no way to be sure.

	"These improvements do come at a cost, though. One of the huge advantages of trading in -base is that you can have anyone trade with anyone, whereas in-chapter you have all sorts of limitations, such as if the character is deployed, or if one character’s within the movement range of another. Another problem is that I cannot access the convoy since that also costs a considerable amount of time, so any item I send away might as well not exist anymore. Basically, having to trade in-chapter is a planning nightmare, and I had to hex edit trades dozens of times to compensate for not having access to the base.

For some reason there’s a 1-frame window 4 to 5 frames before when you’re normally allowed to input commands, and by using this window, the command you input will come out 1 frame earlier than it’s supposed to. This probably sounds confusing, so let me provide an example.

[p 
	"Let’s say I want to press right + B on frame 150. Under normal circumstances the effect of this right + B input will come out 1 frame later, at frame 151. However, if I press right + B on frame 145, the effect of the input will come out on frame 150, hence the saved frame.

[p 
	"I’ll admit I really don’t like this trick because lag determines whether the 1-frame window is 4 or 5 frames early, which makes it a guessing game to actually find the window.

	"For the purposes of TASing, defensive stats like Hp/def/res are not very important because it’s usually pretty trivial to manipulate a dodge, resulting in the character receiving 0 damage. In almost all cases I am looking to force Seth and Vanessa to gain str/skl/spd on their level-up so that I can quickly turn them into offensive powerhouses. Even once these units become overkill I still push to manipulate these stats for a few reasons. First, a unit can never have enough strength, as a 1HKO is very hard to achieve with a common weapon like a steel lance, and 1HKOing saves 40 frames compared to 2HKOing, which is extremely significant over the course of long enemy phases. Second, a unit can never have enough skill because crits are manipulated constantly, and having a higher crit rate reduces manipulations in the long run. Moreover, some bosses have very high luck stats, so it’s important that my characters can even manage a crit rate on them. Speed isn’t such an important stat once you have enough of it, but it is helpful for a unit to be able to double while rescuing a unit. In case you didn’t know, when one character is carrying another, they suffer a stat penalty such that their spd and skl stat are halved until the unit they’re carrying is dropped.

	"One such case is when a unit begins to cap stats. All unpromoted units cap str/skl/spd/def/res at 20, while promotion caps vary slightly based on class, though are usually values in the mid 20s. For the purposes of the run, Vanessa caps str/skl/spd around the end of Chapter 12. At this point I have no reason to give her high-quality level-ups, so I put some effort into minimizing her stat gains. Another case where level-ups are minimized are for characters that see short-term usage. People like Garcia, Dozla and Innes are deliberately given poor level-ups to save those 21 frames/stat-up. Finally, I minimize level-ups from C14 onwards because I reason that Seth, Vanessa and Saleh have become such powerful units that str/skl/spd increases would not have any appreciable benefits. The most obvious application of me minimizing level-ups is in Chapter 18 (which I enjoy referring to as the “egg” chapter). Each gorgon egg kill gives a unit half a level-up, regardless of what their current level is, which means I have units levelling at a furious pace. This doesn’t stop me from limiting almost all egg kill level-ups to 1 stat-up (there is an exception when Tana kills an egg because she has to land a critical hit).

At times this can be very tricky because at an average of ~5 RNs/frame burned, it’s very easy to skip over the desired RNG state, and you have to experiment a lot with possible cursor movements before you can get lucky. In some cases you’re forced to burn a few extra RNs in the slowest way possible, which is to undo the last diagonal movement in the drawn path, then re-do it, which burns 1 RN every 2 frames.

You’ll see in Cheetah’s run he has no trouble having Kyle handle the enemies to the west. On hard mode, he takes an extra attack to kill enemies, fails to double all of them, and doesn’t even have a crit rate. For this reason I’m forced to have Vanessa handle the enemies Kyle was supposed to, and she even needs an extra attacker in Garcia to assist her. If that weren’t enough, the map has 6 extra starting enemies, which results in a 4 turn being impossible. This means having to face 8 additional reinforcements, for a total of 14 extra enemies.

	"This chapter could’ve been as bad as chapter 9 if it weren’t for the Excalibur tome. Thanks to this amazing weapon, I only have to manipulate 1 crit on turn 2 enemy phase instead of 3. Furthermore, the weapon’s so powerful that Saleh 1HKOes all the unpromoted enemies he faces, which saves a considerable amount of time. Miraculously, Saleh gets a required weapon rank increase on the last possible attack he can. I didn’t even plan for this.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Another slight change is in Saleh’s positioning on the first 2 turns. I move him farther on turn 1 so that he can move onto a forest and critkill an enemy nomad on turn 2. This is incredibly important for 2 reasons. First, he cannot 1RKO that nomad without a crit, so if he doesn’t kill him on player phase, he’ll have to do it on enemy phase, which is much harder to manipulate. More importantly, though, he faces a whopping 12 enemies on turn 2 enemy phase, and can only take 1 hit, 2 if he’s lucky (depends which enemy hits). Thus, the 20 avo boost from the forest is crucial.

	"In Cheetah’s run he had Tana kill 2 mercenaries here. Unfortunately, Tana cannot pull this off on hard mode because she has no crit rate with any weapon she uses except for a slim lance, but with that weapon she doesn’t do enough damage with a crit. However, I manage to find an elegant solution. I increase Vanessa’s role by having her take care of some enemies that Saleh doesn’t due to him moving too far South. The path she takes is beneficial because it allows me to promote her in-chapter instead of in the chapter 16 base. This still leaves 2 mercenaries on turn 1 and some pegasi reinforcements to take care of, but Dozla and Innes are up for the challenge. It’s unfortunate that I had to move Innes on the final turn, but I had no choice. Note that Dozla cannot critkill the berserker with the hatchet, and I only have a 1-use hand axe left, so using that would involve seeing a long “hand axe broken” message. This means I cannot remove Innes from the strategy.

[p 
	"On the last turn, Seth moves up to Caellach but doesn’t attack. I do this because there’s no way to 1RKO Caellach without stealing his hoplon guard (an item that prevents crits), and if you attack him on player phase, he will recover hp, which wastes a lot of frames. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"While I lose 184 frames, it costs around 1000 frames to promote Vanessa, so in the long run I’m actually saving about 816 frames, most of which I attribute to Saleh 1HKOing more often by using the Excalibur.

	"This is the only time in the run that I make a trade in-base. I have to give Vanessa the boots before the chapter starts because she’s busy with other actions the first 3 turns, and I can’t afford to have her 6 spaces behind where she’s supposed to be.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"On turn 1 I have Vanessa rescue Eirika instead of Seth, and Seth takes her back the first chance he gets on turn 3. I do this because Seth will fail to 1RKO the enemies he faces on turn 1 if he’s carrying Eirika. Vanessa can pull it off because she can 1HKO the mercenary besides her thanks to the silver lance, and no other enemies are in range of her. Another change is taking advantage of Dozla’s starting position to critkill some extra enemies on the first 2 turns.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"A lot of effort went into figuring out which spot to drop Eirika. I basically have 2 options: drop her above Seth, or to his right (as done in the run). The advantage of dropping her above Seth is that an extra enemy will attack her, meaning 1 less enemy will die on enemy phase. However, the heroes that attack her have such high hitrates that it takes too long to manipulate Eirika’s survival. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"While I do save 388 frames, it’s more realistic to say I lose about 612 frames because Cheetah promotes Vanessa here whereas I did it a chapter earlier. This loss is easily attributed to having to face 3 extra armors near the throne on hard mode.

	"I love this chapter, as it’s delightfully challenging to plan. Hard mode introduces 6 additional gorgon eggs, and 10 extra reinforcements, but I only trigger 8 of the 10 reinforcements thanks to clever use of Saleh’s purge (more on that later). Despite the additional enemies, particularly the eggs, I manage to match Cheetah’s turncount by adding Tana, Ephraim and Duessel to the mix. I would’ve preferred using Dozla instead of Duessel since he has much higher crit, but he’s so heavy (and awesome) that nobody can carry him.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"On turn 1 I make Saleh wait instead of obliterating an egg with a purge use because he needs to save some purging for later turns. The egg he normally dispatches is instead taken out by Syrene on turn 2.

	"On turn 3 I have Vanessa reposition herself in the range of both mogalls (eyeball enemies) after dropping Ephraim. This is important because I want Vanessa to stick to 1-range for the remainder of the map.

	"The white line you see is a reinforcement trigger point. The only way I can cross the trigger point without the reinforcements showing up is to beat the map the same turn the trigger is crossed. Therefore, in order to avoid these reinforcements, Saleh must kill 2 eggs without crossing the trigger point and must wait a turn before killing the final egg. 
	$LF
	"It is very important that Saleh kills egg 3 using purge instead of egg 1 because otherwise an egg will hatch. Egg 2 can be taken out at range without crossing the trigger point. All to say, the egg dispatch order has to be 3-2-1.

	"On turn 4 enemy phase a gargoyle attacks Duessel at range, and he doesn’t counter. There’s nothing I can do about this, as he can’t ORKO the baels he faces with a hatchet equipped, and he can’t critkill the gargoyle with a hatchet anyway.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Again, the significant frame loss in this chapter is unsurprising due to facing 14 additional enemies, and moving 3 extra characters. I’d reckon a huge amount of time was saved from minimizing level-ups, at any rate.

	"I save a lot of time by removing Tethys from the strategy. This means Vanessa is forced to attack Riev at 2-range, but this is fine because she can kill him with a javelin pierce critical. I didn’t even know you could land pierce at range until I planned this chapter.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The other significant savings are actually due to the higher difficulty setting I chose. On hard mode Vanessa can’t kill the general she faces without a crit, but she doesn’t need to either, so sparing him saves some time. I was lucky enough to have the general activate greatshield and negate one of Vanessa’s attacks, even though it wasn’t necessary. Another stroke of luck is that one of the enemy mercenaries critkills an NPC armor, which saves some time in combat animations. More generally, the stronger enemies kill almost all the NPC armors, which considerably shortens the length of the “other phase”.

	"Ironically, it’s crucial that Vanessa gets hit a lot on turn 1 because Riev will attack her instead of Eirika if he can 1HKO her. This hardly makes sense since he can also 1HKO Eirika, who has lower avoid and causes a game-over by dying. That’s some brilliant AI for you.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I’m sure this will be a monumental shocker, but I lose frames here because there’s an arch mogall (promoted eyeball enemy) that gets an opportunity to attack Vanessa twice at range. It’s also possible that more enemies moved on turn 2 enemy phase, though I didn’t check.

	"I find it poetic and heart warming that my biggest improvement to the run comes at the very end. By having Saleh purge the wight (promoted skeleton enemy) in front of Lyon, I can get Vanessa to annihilate Lyon 1 turn earlier, which spares the viewer from a painfully long enemy phase. In addition, I have Saleh and Vanessa trade weapons with each other so they can’t counter enemies on turn 1 enemy phase, which also saves an enormous amount of time.

Without your run I would’ve had to TAS this game from scratch, which would’ve taken many times longer and probably wouldn’t have reached the same level of optimization.
