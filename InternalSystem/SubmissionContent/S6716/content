It means that depending if it rounds up or rounds down, Lara's true speed will be a little bit higher or smaller than the RAM speed. It also allows to adjusting either the X speed or Y speed while keeping the other one the same. The biggest example of this is that for a X speed of -75, the Y speed can be anything from 12 to -13.

Normally, when Lara jumps, two things happen: her gravity status is set to TRUE, and in result her fallspeed changes (fallspeed is the speed of Lara when she's falling. *it* affects *her position*, meaning when fallspeed changes to, for example, 10, Lara's Y goes down 10 values.). When landing, the game simply resets her gravity status to FALSE. now QWOP is when Lara is on the floor, running, but her gravity status is TRUE. meaning the game thinks she's falling, meaning her fallspeed is on the rise. When the fallspeed reaches 128, Lara is going down 128 units, which is the height the game forces the "step up" animation on, which results in the infamous QWOP move. Now when the fallspeed reaches 384, the game thinks Lara is in front of a 2 click ledge, which she performs vaults on, Triggering the quicksand bug.
