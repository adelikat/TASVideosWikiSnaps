		"2:42 speedrun on Easy difficulty on YouTube
	]a
	" which I used heavily as a reference.  I am not sure what timing points are in use there; instead, here are some reference timing points for this run: first gameplay input to last moment gameplay is 2:38.533, and first input to triggering the action which eventually ends the game (setting off the mine; see level notes) is 2:36.133.  Either way, there's a clear improvement with this run, not to mention the difference in difficulty levels (which throw a lot of new enemies in the path)!

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Central to most of the maneuvering in this run is the 
	[b 
		"Impossible Pogo Trick
	]b
	".  Tapping the jump (CTRL) and pogo stick (ALT) keys near-simultaneously while running allows a higher-than-normal pogo jump.  On Easy mode Keen gets an extra unit of height out of this compared to some of the other two modes, so some of the maneuvers in the speed run are difficult if not impossible to replicate (Korath III comes to mind as a prime example of this).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There are two major glitches in use here:
	$LF
]p
[ol 
	[li 
		" 
		[b 
			"Warp glitch
		]b
		". Being pushed under certain conditions, including while hanging onto a pole, causes the end of the level to warp you to the game's secret level, Korath III.  This is useful as the exit from Korath III takes you to the segment of the overworld just prior to the second last level of the game (as the exit to the secret level is in that level), meaning, if it's done early enough, you can skip a considerable number of levels.  This glitch only works in v1.4 of the game.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 
		[b 
			"Death flag glitch
		]b
		".  Saving and reloading a game causes the "you are dying" flag to be reset, but Keen is still in the dying animation, allowing him to clip through walls.  This is most useful when done near the edge of a level, as touching the edge of a level while alive ends the level (which is never actually used in this game, and is a holdover from the other two games using the engine).  Since one actually never sees the "you didn't make it past[...]" screen, I don't consider this death per se, but Keen still takes damage!

	"Key to this entire run are the presence of poles and Little Amptons (the purple pushing enemies), as they enable the use of the warp glitch in the very first level of the game!  Keen shoots two of them to avoid slowing down or getting hit (he can only take damage from them if one of them slides into him on a pole), then hugs a pole and gets pushed off by the third, triggering the conditions for the warp glitch.  Several tricky jumps and a handful of dead Sparkies later (the first Impossible Pogo after getting pushed needs to be effectively frame-perfect to work as advertised), Keen reaches the exit and mysteriously warps to Korath III.

	"Frustratingly, Keen only has enough height to jump directly from the left platform to the hidden alcove on Easy mode.  Instead, I land as quickly as possible on the right platform and Impossible Pogo up to the alcove.  Two jumps later and Keen finds and breaks a fuse - doing so ends the level and also sets up the better ending later on.

	"The death flag glitch sees use here.  Keen needs to be standing almost as far to the right as possible in the alcove with the Volte-face in order to be close enough to the edge of the level after dying to get there without needing to save and reload more than once (given the time needed in loading the game, it is desirable to not have to reload more than once).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"(Note that in the YouTube run, the Volte-face is already in a position where Keen can jump down right away.  Here it starts off in the worst possible position for some reason, so I need to wait for a bit to jump down and wait a bit when it's down there...)

	"Here's the finale, and the longest of the four levels in this run.  Sadly this level can't be skipped - triggering the ending in that fashion dumps him back to the overworld with no way to complete the game.  The only way to trigger the ending is to reach and destroy the QED.  To get to the QED requires three keys, and to blow it up needs a fourth.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The red and green keys are straightforward enough to obtain, needing little more than good timing and a few well-placed jumps.  The blue key is a lot tricker thanks to the presence of a large number of Shockshunds.  There is a Shockshund sitting right next to the key that eventually needs to be lured away, so a direct bypass approach isn't feasible; instead Keen ducks below the bridge area similar to the speedrun, though takes a lot less time shooting everything he can until he runs out of ammo, leaving a sufficient opening to collect the key.  The remaining Shockshund moves slightly slower than Keen does, so just chasing it is out of the question; instead Keen ducks below and pulls off an impossible Impossible Pogo to escape.

[p 
	"The yellow key is en route to the doors, and the jump sequence Keen uses to get it and evade the Shikadi unscathed was the result of a lucky accident.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"After unlocking the doors, Keen arrives at the QED itself. He evades a Shikadi Master and its attack and unlocks the red door, behind which are a number of Shikadi Mines - the only thing which can damage the QED.  After painfully slowly luring it over to the QED, the mine explodes, taking down the QED, but also Keen?  (Having Keen die here is slightly shorter than letting him live.)

	"A note about the encode: it uses the resolution of the game, i.e. 640x400, though there is a short segment of DOS at the beginning which is normally 720x400.  Those images have been scaled to the appropriate resolution, similar to the norm of other runs which use multiple resolutions (such as 
	(__wikiLink|1384M|Shadow of the Beast 2)
	").  You probably won't even notice, as that segment is so short, but I thought I would note what I did for future PC games that need encodes.
