But enough about sad cool tricks with armor-piercing bullets finally enter the scene! - Destroying some robots thru the walls allow reduce route. Btw when unfinished clones or "zombies" explode this damage take away 50% of full health so trick with hitting yourself ricochet rubber bullet was really useful in one place (in some other levels it useful too).
