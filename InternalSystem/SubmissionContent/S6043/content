	"The bad ending can be achieved by failing certain vital missions. This run does this by ejecting in all of the missions.

	": In this game, there are two different endings that can be triggered, which depend from the amount of missions completed successfully during the play. The bad ending is triggered even if all missions are failed.

	"In the submitted movie, the player used the eject command at the beginning of every mission, which basically consists in giving up and failing the current mission right away.

	"Since there is no actual gameplay required in order to reach the bad ending, it can't be considered as beating the game. Rejecting for trivial gameplay and failing to beat the game.
