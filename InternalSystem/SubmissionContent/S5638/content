I'm tired of working on this TAS, and I feel like it's of a good quality, so I am submitting it. The Southside team is used to achieve the proper ending. Crash is used because there's never a reason to not use Crash, given the goals. FCEUX 2.20.20 was used for this movie. This movie improves upon

	"RNG is manipulated to face opponents with low defense in relevant events. It is further manipulated for CPU controlled characters to fail quickly in events. An item in the health food store known as "<!(&/&X!" reduces a random character's HP to single digits. RNG is manipulated so this always affects the CPU characters Crash must face. Attention is paid to the exact number of HP an opponent gets to reduce the number of hits they take as much as possible. An opponent that "wins" its previous match will regain half of its HP. It is not always possible to get the computer to select the characters with the lowest defense, and they don't seem to ever select a character with low HP, so <!(&/&X! is purchased before each event as required.

A combination of failing some long events, manipulating opponents to win events evenly, and making up medals elsewhere would make for a shorter movie. However, I wasn't interested in making that sort of movie. It is also possible that better RNG can be manipulated given this movie's goals. The RNG is very interconnected and it's often unclear what the perfect luck looks like.

The situation with the nicovideo TAS is dubious, as it does seem to point towards the run being improvable and not beating existing records, but I'm giving this TAS the benefit of the doubt - multiple TASers failed to reproduce the trick used there, so it currently is practically impossible to verify if the improvement really is possible. Maybe there will be a more clear answer later, but for now I think it's fine to publish this TAS. As such, accepting as an improvement to the
