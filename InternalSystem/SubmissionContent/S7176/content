	"Super Smash Bros. Brawl is a fighting game released for the Nintendo Wii in 2008. While its core mechanics are the same as its predecessors (Where the genre’s traditional health bar is replaced with a percent counter, with the goal of knocking opponents off the stage instead of reducing their HP to zero), Brawl changed many aspects of the game from Super Smash Bros. Melee, being generally considered the “slowest” game in the series as a result of some of them. Brawl is also the first game in the series to have a dedicated story mode, called “The Subspace Emissary”, and is the main focus of this TAS.

Pressing the A button in combination with the control stick allows characters to attack with a variety of moves (Including Jabs, Tilt attacks, and Smash attacks on the ground, and aerial attacks in the air), and pressing the B button in the same manner allows unique Special attacks to be used. The Z button is used to grab opponents, and the L/R buttons are used to shield against or dodge enemy attacks. The C-Stick allows Smash Attacks to be used on the ground, and aerial attacks in the air. The D-Pad is used to perform character exclusive taunts, but they don’t do anything meaningful aside from looking flashy.

	"RNG is a deceptively large factor in the process of TASing this game, ranging from individual characters’ randomness (Peach’s Turnips) to the entirety of the item drop system (Explained below). Enough about the RNG was known for me to make an RNG brute-forcing LUA Script - many of the spectacles in this TAS would have been considered impossible without it.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The RNG’s RAM address is 0x805A1E8C, with values taking the form of a 4-Byte Hexadecimal. New RNG values are almost always generated by taking the preexisting value, multiplying it by 0x41C64E6D, adding 0x3039, and using the last eight digits (The lone exception is during room transitions, where the RNG changes differently from this pattern and “jumps” from one RNG sequence to another). The RNG value changes many times in a single frame, with the exact amount depending on the amount of things calling it (Many enemies on the screen at once bring the call-per-frame number to over 40, for example). Numerous player actions also change the RNG (Generating dust from running, jumping, attacking, pausing and unpausing, etc.), which makes manipulating it a relatively quick process.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Thanks to RNG’s dominating presence in almost all rooms and its nearly nonexistent stability (Only remaining constant between level selection), it’s effectively impossible to hex inputs without RNG desyncing.

[h3 id=ItemDropSystem 
	"The Item Drop system:
	$LF
]h3
[div class=p 
	"On the frame an enemy is defeated, they drop a random item the character can use. The general item probabilities are dependant on the enemy itself (With specific enemies having their own individual item pools), the stage or room one is in (With some specific items not showing up at all, like Super Mushrooms in most of The Battlefield Fortress), and the game’s difficulty (With higher difficulties increasing the chances of Trophy Stands and Stickers dropping, for example). As RNG is called numerous times per frame, and that every value corresponds to its own item, many items are initially “trapped” in-between frames, requiring RNG manipulation to make them appear on a whole frame. Notably, pausing and unpausing the game up to three frames before an enemy dies prevents the RNG from moving up to six values (Two values per pause frame) in comparison to normal; this means a given frame of enemy death has four different item outcomes - one regular outcome, and three pause outcomes.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The brute-forcing LUA script I created takes a starting RNG value, generates a sequence of RNG values from it, and iterates through each value as an enemy dies - logging the items that appear from their respective RNG values. This simulates killing the enemy on different frames, and also highlights the items obtainable from surface-level or pause-level manipulation. Its only downside is that it 
	[b 
		"has
	]b
	" to go through every value one at a time (Since any other pattern would miss potentially useful items), making it inefficient when RNG is called a high enough amount every frame. The script also only properly predicts when items appear if the RNG changes the same amount in-between frames; deviations from this makes the script fail, and was a notable hassle to fix in several areas (Like near the end of the Great Maze, as the people who watched my progress on it can attest).

I also logged some data for other enemies and item drop situations (That don’t correspond with the regular item pools) that were used in the TAS, so I could get a complete set of data for the total item odds.

This includes increased attack power to a given type of move (Arm moves, Leg moves, etc.), increased defense, and so on. The holy grail of stickers for this TAS is the “Bullfrog” sticker, which has a character spawn with a Bob-Omb in every single room.

	"To prevent characters from being able to fly all over the place by taking ridiculous amounts of damage, the developers attempted (Key word: 
	[b 
		"attempted
	]b
	") to add safeguards related to the camera. In the free-roaming sections, the blastzones are tied to the camera’s boundaries; moving past them causes a character to be KO’d. When a character takes launching damage, the camera freezes in place for a time, with larger amounts of damage causing the camera to freeze for longer. This leads to an intended mechanic where attempting to damage boost all over the place is met with being KO’d from the camera’s frozen blastzones. However, the developers missed some important details that allowed me to do exactly what they wanted to prevent.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"At first, it was believed that only electric attacks were capable of unintended behavior: If one gets hit by an electric attack and SDIs into a wall or ceiling before hitstun ends, the camera doesn’t freeze, and the player flies through the level. I found out later that it works with all attack types, but that every type except for electric attacks has much tighter timing (Getting a wall or ceiling bounce on the first frame of hitstun, instead of any frame of hitstun like electric attacks). Non-electric attacks also have the added requirement of directly moving into a wall or ceiling in the instant the attack hits; the trick doesn’t work if the character is frozen in hitlag or not moving in general.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"This occurs because the game only explicitly freezes the camera if the character is in the neutral “taking damage” animation; immediately entering a wall or ceiling bounce (Or in the event of hitting a Jyk, air-dodging on the frame of impact) skips this animation, and doesn’t freeze the camera. Because this technique always (Except the rare Jyk scenario I mentioned) requires you to be in the wall or ceiling bounce animation, I’ve decided to name it “Bounce Boosting”, for a shorthand of “Wall-Bounce Damage Boost” or “Ceiling-Bounce Damage Boost”.

In the Timing Table at the bottom of the page, I’ll make note of these instances, and also tally entire level timings alongside individual room timings to weed out random loading variants that aren’t from actual strategies.

It also appears to slightly decrease loading times related to the map menu across the rest of the game as seen in the time table at the bottom (Where the time saved across the level is slightly greater than the time saved in the sum of rooms); I assume this is because the game doesn’t have to quietly autosave when it doesn’t have a save file.

	"Unlike the last TAS, there’s very little left in the way of guaranteed timesaves. The only absolute thing left I’m actually certain of is in Room 6 of Battleship Halberd Interior, where I could bounce boost to the Bombed and RNG manipulate another Bob-Omb like I did in the old TAS (Which I somehow only realized while TASing six entire levels after this one). By my estimate, it would save roughly 40 frames at best, assuming the extra damage doesn’t interfere with the launch. There’s also the ever-present horde fight differences spawned from single-frame item RNG deviations, alongside getting RNG that doesn’t require me to pause buffer for stickers and items (Which saves two frames per pause). I also apparently made some slight errors in marking the sticker route this time; there should be a tiny bit of timesave in that regard, but nothing like the timesave present between the old TAS and this one.

[div class=p 
	"There’s a glitch that allows you to use unintended characters in levels that don’t have you choose characters from a cutscene (The Plains, The Ruins, Bomb Factory 2, etc), and it was theorized that Yoshi might be faster than Lucas in The Ruins. However, I TASed through that level and all its RNG manipulation while completely forgetting to test that glitch; I suspect that the timesave present isn’t actually that much since The Ruins is almost entirely an autoscroller.

	"Aside from that, I think I’ve covered all bases with this one and truly pushed Subspace to its limits. It beats the old TAS by over 6.3 minutes (Which now makes it faster than the RTA counterpart by over 100 minutes), which was more than I ever considered when I first started the revised attempt.

I try to keep nostalgia to a minimum when I watch TASes but seeing the subspace tases brought all of it back for me. Even with all of Brawl's flaws, it will forever be my favorite smash game.

	"I loved the original TAS and this TAS is even better. A really great improvement is one where you can visibly notice the author having a stronger mastery of the game and that is definitely the case here. The movement as a whole is much cleaner. Even tho damage boosting is used for more of the TAS, new movement techniques shine through as well. A huge shoutout to the jet hammer glitch with dedede, that made me laugh. The TAS was received extremely well by the audience as well.
