	" Stage 2:
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"In order to get to this stage, I had to wait for the first demo to appear, then skip it. Starfy's X position must then be at 130, so when the second demo (the 2nd stage) starts, it'll desync and allow me to take control. I simply exit the stage and skip directly to the last stage.

	" Final Stage:
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The final stage takes place in Starfy's palace/castle. I optimized Tarby's run of this place and had some fun during the auto-scroller.

	" Ogura 1:
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This....This is the most painful boss battle ever. Not only does your position and his affect affect the battle, but also the rng. The rng is responsible for determining where he'll end up after taking damage, and our positions determine whether or not he'll retreat back to his own portal. Sorry for the lack of movement during this and the next two battles, as any input would've advanced the rng. I believe this could be improved, but I can't seem to as of now.

	" Ogura 2:
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This is another hard battle. Starfy has an one-frame oppertunity to attack the boss 
	[b 
		"immediately
	]b
	" after reflecting the cannonball. Starafy's subpixel has to be very precise, or it'll fail. Which is why I didn't move much, I had to manipulate Starfy's subpixels, as if it's not correct, even if his position is correct, he'll just bounce back after reflecting.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Ogura 3:
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"I had to manipulate the boss into shooting beams at me, so I could avoid hitting his eyes twice. This however, means I take damage, but that's ok, as the last attack doesn't kill Starfy. I glitched the boss's graphics during the battle.

[h4 
	" Recoil into Ogura 2
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Usually, the battle with Ogura 2 requires Starfy to reflect cannonballs back into his mouth. This will also cause Starfy to recoil. But with subpixel manipulation, there is a one-frame opppertunity to get knocked into Ogura 2 the frame after you hit the cannonball, thus saving time.

	" Suicidal Ogura
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Normally, Ogura will never retreat towards the purple portal he summons. But with careful positioning, you can trick him to doing so, which happens once in the run.

	": A nice first run of this game. I particularly enjoyed the autoscroller, which is a rare compliment from me. It's unfortunate that this is so boss-heavy as those battles don't do justice to the gameplay potential, perhaps we will get to see a more substantial run in future? In any case, it is great to finally have this series represented here. Accepting for publication.
