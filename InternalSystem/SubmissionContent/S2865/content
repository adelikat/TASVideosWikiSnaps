The rng is responsible for determining where he'll end up after taking damage, and our positions determine whether or not he'll retreat back to his own portal. Sorry for the lack of movement during this and the next two battles, as any input would've advanced the rng. I believe this could be improved, but I can't seem to as of now.

It's unfortunate that this is so boss-heavy as those battles don't do justice to the gameplay potential, perhaps we will get to see a more substantial run in future? In any case, it is great to finally have this series represented here. Accepting for publication.
