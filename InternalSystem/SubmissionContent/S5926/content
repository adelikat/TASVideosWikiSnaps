By getting the victory in the Walrus fight during fading out to the Game Over screen, the "game stage counter" will be set to 59 first, which means Game Over, then erroneously increased by 1 to become 60 ie. the beginning of the ending scene.

Instead of scratching on the boss, she has to pound the ice bridge for 6 times and wait for the boss to move "onto" (literally) the bottomless pit when the bridge has collapsed. With the Walrus glitch in mind, the goal addtionally requires Sia to fall into the pit at the same time.
	$LF

	"This fight is very difficult to optimize due to the fact that a pound doesn't count if it is interrupted, and its duration is randomized. I somehow manage to make a quick pound once and barely make a "pushed over by the boss" at the right edge of the stage so the boss retreats immediately, for me to do the rest 5 pounds before it launches snowballs that can easily interrupt the pounds. With some more camera manipulation to time the boss's action the Walrus glitch is done successfuly.
