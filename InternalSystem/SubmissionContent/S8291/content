	"The goal of S-Hard mode is the same as Normal or Hard mode - collect all the gem pieces and beat all the bosses. The catch though is that you start every level with only 1 heart. There are also way more/different enemies in every level, and chests have been moved to more difficult locations (frog switches have also been moved for a few levels). In terms of the routes for every level, S-Hard is similar to Hard, save for a few other exceptions which I will go over below. Although you have fewer hearts in boss fights, they're the same as the other modes.

	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Normal|href=/5096M)
	" and 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Hard|href=/1736M)
	" mode publications. The additional enemies (and usually more dangerous) enemies, the lower starting health, and changed chest locations seem to make approaches different compared to the other difficulties. In some cases the additional enemies and changed chest locations lead to faster room and level strats compared to other difficulties, making S. Hard mode distinct in practice with regards to optimization and routing. Also worth noting that the optimization is solid throughout including improvements to similar areas compared to the old Hard mode publication.
