I still find a way to get a superjump to get past annoying spikes which

Small raymans speed will oscillate every frame from 1 to 2 etc, but by jumping on the frame where it is 2 and locking that speed, i can go much faster.

	"The slippery on the first part of the screen has a lot of potential. I decided to fistboost and speedlock 6px/frame, even though the subpixel speed was high enough for a 7. I did this because if i were to go too fast then raymans fist wouldn't catch up to him in time for another fistboost. The 2nd fistboost reaches a value of 8px/frame and ~2000 subpixel speed, which is very close to 9.
	$LF
	"There is not enough space to fistboost to 9px/frame, but there is another slippery platform waiting for me to fistboost off of, and i do just that, for a value of 9 which also sets up 8px/frame speedstorage. This still makes no sense to me because the subpixel value is way too low for 9px/frame, but still it works. The speedstorage is setup for the jump over Mister Dark and the slippery section that comes after. If you were to jump on the 1st frame after landing on this slippery, then rayman will clip through the floor and die. I do precise jumps so rayman gets stuck in the 1 slope for instant turnaround, the same is done on the 2nd slope. Speedstorage is set up for the last time to get through a lot of clouds.
