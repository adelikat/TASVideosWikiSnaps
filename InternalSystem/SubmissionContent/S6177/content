	" was the first game in the series to be exclusively released on a non-Nintendo console. The game took a lot of elements from previous installments and spiced them up with even more dynamic combat, different playable characters, nonlinear plot and about twice the amount of boss fights.

	"J version choosed, because it allows player to take damage without dying. Fang is always the best character due to his strongest D gun. It takes 30 damage per frame, which is same as a bomb. Game balance that weapon by taking 90 frames to charge that weapon. But if you choose B, shoot, change to D,  then you will get charged D directly. That helps a lot to save time.

		"魂斗罗：铁血兵团

	"是第一款在非任天堂平台上发布的魂斗罗系列游戏。与以往魂斗罗系列不同，本作中共4个角色，每人拥有ABCD4种枪，而每个角色的子弹类型又跟其他角色的不同；拥有独特的滑铲动作，动作过程无敌，并可以造成伤害，移动速度也比正常走路要快；多结局，共4个正常结局，1个隐藏结局，1个恶搞（跟黑恶势力同流合污）结局；大量的boss战。

	"录像选择了日版，因为仅有日版拥有血槽系统，允许玩家在死亡之前受2次伤，死亡后当前激活的子弹会消失，但炸弹不会。狼人经常被选择用来进行速通，因为他的D弹是16种子弹里最强的，蓄力后每帧30点伤害，与炸弹的第一阶段伤害相同。游戏为了平衡，每次需要花90帧的时间来进行蓄力。但如果你切换到B，然后开枪，然后迅速切换到D，那么你可以直接发出蓄力D。这样就可以省掉很多时间。
