An extra rules is that I can't collect items in "parallel universes", which are accessible by entering one of the map's borders. This run achieves that goal roughly 6 minutes and 15 seconds faster than

	[del 
		"and not because I started the TAS by following the RTA route with some changes, but then realized that it would have been faster to end the run on the Moon Snail boss fight, but by the time I realized this, it was too late to make the changes, so I ended up just categorizing this as an in-game time run because, otherwise, the run category would be "All endings, 100% completion, NPU", which would look really dumb and really accentuate this blunder. If you're wondering, the in-game timer doesn't count during the first Moon Snail cutscene, and that's why it's faster when using IGT to sit through the cutscene.

	"Running the base game at 60fps caused some glitches to become impossible, and running it at 120fps caused desync issues, so that's why this mod is needed, it's the most accurate way of TASing this game.

		" When Snaily's shell is in contact with a ceiling (or floor if you reverse gravity), if you jump every frame by alternating the jump buttons and move in a direction, you'll start moving rapidly in the opposite direction. By using this trick, not only can I move extremely fast, but I can also clip through walls, which allows for many routing opportunities. This trick doesn't work when your gravity's sideways, for some reason. Also, when you're performing this trick with reversed gravity, you can only clip through walls if said wall is just a single block tall, for some unknown reason.

							" For almost every room in the game, the borders that you're not supposed to cross are usually blocked by blocks that instantly kill you upon contact. This can be avoided by being in hitstun when crossing these blocks, seeing as you don't get damaged and therefore you don't get instantly killed.

								" This is a really weird glitch I found. Basically, if you wiggle back and forth in the air by switching opposite gravities every frame, you might be able to jump in the air. This may seem useless (and it kinda is), but it allows me to almost instantly gain a lot of momentum when I switch gravity in the air, which is useful for optimization. I believe this happens due to the fact that Snaily can jump when his velocity is 0 units per frame on the gravity's direction, so, reducing his speed by constantly changing the gravity might cause that to happen and allow me to perform a jump.

								" If you've ever played this game casually before, you'd know that it's one of the least useful items in the game. If you're wondering, it just makes it so that you don't take damage while crouching. However, in this run, it is a very useful item, due to the fact that I can take damage on the borders without dying, which allows for many clips that would be impossible to perform otherwise. One problem is that the mechanics of border-crouching, as I call it, can be pretty finicky. If the crouch you're trying to perform is on the left or upwards, it's pretty simple and possible in almost every scenario, but, if the crouch in on the right or downwards, you need to be in the air (as in, not touching the "ground"), so if the crouch is far away from a jumpable position, it's impossible to perform.

Unfortunately, it gets little use in the run.
