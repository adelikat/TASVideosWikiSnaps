	"<For viewers, this movie has to overcome the game with shortcuts and jumps backwards. I know there are others like them, but I think they are being reversed with small jumps. Being my first TAS, I had no difficulty in doing so because the game is no longer playing time and has only 5:30. The shortcuts are in the 1-2 level noos leads to level 4-1 and then 4-2 is in the noos leads to level 8-1.>

	"Well, here I up my first TAS to this page. Is to complete levels how to jump backwards. Excuse my English regularly, because I speak Spanish and I practice English. Thanks for watching the video. The game was simple, but there were some delays with 8-4 level because carnivorous plants did not hide quickly.

	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" One, your run is much below the technical standards of the current runs on the site of Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario All-Stars. It is nearly a minute slower than the 
		[a class=intlink href=/1715M 
			"NES
		]a
		" Super Mario Bros. run, and most of the time loss isn't necessary.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" For Super Mario All-Stars, it is better to use the Super Mario All-Stars+Super Mario World ROM, as it loads the game faster.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" It is unwise to use Super Mario All-Stars to run Super Mario Bros. anyway. The NES version is preferred, as well as faster.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" The run loses time unnecessarily by doing things such as a wall-jump where it isn't needed.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" For a run that intends to jump backwards all the time, there is, in my mind, too much running forward involved.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" In addition, the movie breaks its own rule at the start of 8-4 by jumping forward. A movie that breaks its own category rules is unacceptable.
