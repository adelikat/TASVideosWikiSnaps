	"This is a "Space Invaders" clone, published on cartridge by Commodore in 1981 for the Vic-20. The game uses multi-color graphics and supports keyboard and/or joystick control. The player starts with 3 baes and gets a new base at 1500 points. A year later, the Commodore 64 would receive its release...on cartridge as well.

	"I finally had the nerve to take a stab at these "Space Invader" type games and I can really appreciate how much effort it takes to get an optimize movie. Hats off to all of you who were able to do so well with the Atari 2600 version. These kind of games have an ever changing strategy...meaning that you really need to come up with a higher plan of action (in terms of optimization), rather than just shooting things as quickly as possible.
