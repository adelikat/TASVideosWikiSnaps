	"The major glitches exploited here is the ability of going through gates and walls through precise jumps, as well as the ability to scroll around the screen when fighting a guard (thanks to an overflow glitch). These tricks, combined with perfect execution make for an entertaining solution (including moonwalking towards the princess!)

	": It's amazing how each port has interesting quirks to break them apart in their own ways. There's lots of solid optimized movement and fun glitches to be found in this TAS. The speed trick in this version I found the most amusing was just kind of slapping Jaffar once to convince him to give up and leave, I guess. There's no text at the end to say otherwise. Nice work!
