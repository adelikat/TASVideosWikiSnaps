	"Toy Story for SNES is a game developed by Traveller's Tales who would later go on to develop Sonic 3D blast, Sonic R, Crash Bandicoot the Wrath of Cortex, and the Lego universe series. The game is based off of the first of what would be many movies produced by Disney-Pixar and features many characters from the franchise.

[p 
	"The game loosely follows the same story line with a few differences here and there. You play as Woody, the rootinest tootinest cowboy in the wild wild west.  Woody's jealousy of the new toy in andy's room, Buzz Lightyear of Star Command, leads you to fighting for your life as you fall into the hands of Sid, the next door neighbor who loves to destroy toys for his enjoyment.  Help get Woody and Buzz back to Andy before they become lost toys.

[p 
	"Every single obstacle in this game does 1 damage to Woody, and when hit, Woody will have invincibility frames (i-frames) for almost 2 seconds. Because of this, most of the routing consists of taking damage at the right moment, so that you can take advantage of the i-frames as much as possible.
	$LF
	"Woody's max health is 5. Whenever the player loses a life, Woody will respawn with 5 health. However, although it gives the player a full health refill, it takes at the very least 5 seconds to respawn, and sometimes more depending on where you die in the level. Because of this, the ideal way is to refill health by collecting stars.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Every level in this game has 50 stars, with the exception for 'Run, Rex, Run!' which has 48 stars. Collecting 50 stars rewards 1 extra life. Collecting 49 stars rewards 4 health points. Collecting 48 stars rewards 3 health points and so on. The ideal solution is to collect 49 stars whenever it is possible to do so, and because some levels are auto-scrollers and platformers where the stars are placed right in the players way, it becomes rather easy to get a full health refill. However, collecting 50 stars only rewards 1 extra life but no health points, so in some cases, 1 star has to be skipped.

	"The choice to play on the NTSC-U version is very simple, because of The Claw skip and the Buzz Battle skip. Combined, they save roughly 1 minute and 30 seconds. The NTSC-J version and the PAL version of the game are basically the same, with the addition of languages on the PAL version.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The Claw is skipped by launching two aliens up in the air, both hitting the claw, and then scroll the screen a little bit by walking right and spawn as many aliens as possible. We believe this works because of the amount of sprites on the screen at the same time. That's why we're walking right here, because we get to see the Claw and the stars that spawn out of the Claw when it's hit by the two aliens. But we can't walk too far right or Buzz is not going to be on screen. In the NTSC-J version of the game, this was fixed by simply limiting the amount of aliens you can launch at the same time.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Buzz Battle is faster on NTSC-U because of how the tire works. Normally when you hit Buzz with the tire, he launches out of it and does a spin attack for around 8 seconds, and then he goes back to the right of the screen and begins charging at Woody again. When he initiates the spin attack after getting hit by the tire, the tire will launch up in the air, going out of bounds until Buzz is done with his spin attack sequence. The tire is supposed to be disabled when it's going up in the air, however, on the NTSC-U it is possible to hit the tire as it's going up in the air. This breaks the sequence so that the player can land the tire on Buzz again, getting another hit. On NTSC-J, the player is completely unable to hit the tire.

	"There is very little RNG in this game, almost everything is based on cycles. The few RNG elements in the game are the coin falling patterns in 'Inside the Claw Machine' and the fire crackers in 'Sid's Workbench' and 'Battle of the Mutant Toys'.
	$LF

	"The TAS run is not very different from the RTA run. Most of the routing is the same, with a few minor exceptions like 'Really Inside the Claw Machine' and jumps that require a 10 frame.
