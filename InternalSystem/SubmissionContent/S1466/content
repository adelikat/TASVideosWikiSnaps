	"This run of Mega Man II for Game Boy is about as close to the limit as I’m willing to take it.  I tried earnestly to find any time saving glitches and also a couple that Nach pointed out, but to no avail.

	"One thing I figured out about this game is luck manipulation.  I found that by standing still, I change the random number generator that affects what item the next series of enemies will drop.

	"In the published run, at the beginning, I neglected turning the opposite direction before getting hit.  By the time I learned of that trick, I was already in Hard Man’s stage.

	"It’s not always beneficial to use the slide to get rid of the damage animation, and sometimes its even costly.  One thing I always kept in mind this time around is that the slide lasts about as long as the damage animation so sometimes it’s better to get damaged as early as possible.  One example is the area where I take damage from the fire-breathing dog in Wood Man’s stage.
