	"It’s not always beneficial to use the slide to get rid of the damage animation, and sometimes its even costly.  One thing I always kept in mind this time around is that the slide lasts about as long as the damage animation so sometimes it’s better to get damaged as early as possible.  One example is the area where I take damage from the fire-breathing dog in Wood Man’s stage.
