	": This is a much better version, over the Actions 52 NES collection. As for your run, it is very solid; however, I did find some frames...but they were eaten on the "moving platform" levels. Any cuts will alter the timing of those platforms and you would have to wait anyway. I'm sure that something could be found, but considering the amount of work it would take to make those cuts hold...I don't see that they would contribute negatively towards this submission. Besides, this TAS definitely shines over the human runs that I watched.
