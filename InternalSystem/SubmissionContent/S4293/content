There is no RAM value that gives the time before the egg is dropped (there is one which start at 1000 when the bird appear, then decrease until the egg is dropped, then stop moving), and I don't have enough knowledge to try to understand how the rng works, so I used a lua script to make brute force searching, but there was no way I would have been able to test all possible outputs.

	"A proxy jump to reach the second part of the level faster, then what I like to call the "Divine Jump". Assuming you have the perfect proxy jump on the penguin (same x and y position, and a difference less than 400 with the z position), I am not sure you can reach a speed of 18000. To reach Ripto's Arena, your proxy jump must give you a speed of more than 17300 ! This is pretty much impossible to get as Spyro's x and y coordinates move by more than 100 every 2 frames (the game update the coordinates 30 times a second) when you are charging. For reference the difference between the coordinates (x and y) of Spyro and the penguin were 11 and 17 in this TAS, however a difference of 13 and 17 would not have give a good enough proxy jump. Also I waited before killing the penguin because I needed him to die on the left side of the ground, otherwise I would not have been able to make a z difference under 400.

	"However for some reasons the green powerup ends 38 frames sooner in the phase 2 than in the phase 1, and this prevents me from dealing more than 30 damage in a row to Mecha Gulp, so it was impossible to beat him with only 2 powerup.
