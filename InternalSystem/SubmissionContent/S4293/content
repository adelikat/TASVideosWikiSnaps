	"For most of the monsters you can kill with a charge attack, their body will take some seconds before disappearing. This body will not be a solid object if you try to go through it will charging, however it will be solid in all other cases. So if you stop charging while in the body, 2 solid object will be at the same place, and the game will eject Spyro (the closer you are from the monster "center", the the fastest you will be eject). You can use this game mechanic to reach REALLY HIGH heights.

	"The maximum speed you can get from a proxy with perfect position is a little bit more than 20000, which is just enough to go from the frogs in the plain to a part of the roof. However all monsters in the game (or at least all the ones I checked) have a "z position" under the ground, so it is impossible to get a "perfect" proxy jump.

	"The Gulp skip was found 6 month ago and require very accurate movements (even if it doesn't look like that here...), and it is the only know way to reach Gulp's Overlook without the 14 talismans.

	"While the second part of the luck manipulation wasn't really hard, the first one gives me a lot of troubles. There is no RAM value that gives the time before the egg is dropped (there is one which start at 1000 when the bird appear, then decrease until the egg is dropped, then stop moving), and I don't have enough knowledge to try to understand how the rng works, so I used a lua script to make brute force searching, but there was no way I would have been able to test all possible outputs. This fight was 10 seconds shorter than the one in my old TAS.

	"A proxy jump to reach the second part of the level faster, then what I like to call the "Divine Jump". Assuming you have the perfect proxy jump on the penguin (same x and y position, and a difference less than 400 with the z position), I am not sure you can reach a speed of 18000. To reach Ripto's Arena, your proxy jump must give you a speed of more than 17300 ! This is pretty much impossible to get as Spyro's x and y coordinates move by more than 100 every 2 frames (the game update the coordinates 30 times a second) when you are charging. For reference the difference between the coordinates (x and y) of Spyro and the penguin were 11 and 17 in this TAS, however a difference of 13 and 17 would not have give a good enough proxy jump. Also I waited before killing the penguin because I needed him to die on the left side of the ground, otherwise I would not have been able to make a z difference under 400.

	"For any powerup, the first hit deals 10 damage, then all others deal 4 damage. Ripto has 60 HP and Mecha Gulp has 80 HP.
	$LF
	"The "green powerup" allows me to deal 34 damage in a row to Ripto, so I was able to finish him with only 4 hits, plus dealing 2 hits to Mecha Gulp (which for some reasons deal 8 and 4 damage, so 68 HP left)
	$LF
	"However for some reasons the green powerup ends 38 frames sooner in the phase 2 than in the phase 1, and this prevents me from dealing more than 30 damage in a row to Mecha Gulp, so it was impossible to beat him with only 2 powerup.
	$LF

[p 
	"Also, usually RTAs first go to Dragon Shores to take infinite Fireball and then fight Ripto, but it would have cost time in the TAS as Ripto can be defeated really fast thanks to the green powerup.

	"By the Spyro 2 speedrunning community, the "1 talisman" run is already referred to as any%, not glitched%, so I think it deserves to go unlabeled here. And since 14 of them isn't an arbitrary number, but the exact minimum that the intended route allows, calling it "14 talisman" makes the best sense.
