	"I chose to do this TAS on normal difficulty instead of hard for a variety of reasons. The differences going from normal to hard are reduced zenny drops from enemies, significantly increased boss health, increased damage from enemies, a slight modification to one of Juno's attacks, and having to play on new game+. Reduced zenny would have simply resulted in having to take an extra wasp nest in Cardon Ruins, increased boss health would have resulted in having to slowly buster down bosses after running out of special weapon ammo, and increased damage from enemies would have made no difference since there are only 2 damage boosts in the entire run. The only thing that would have potentially been an entertainment bonus from hard mode would have been Juno's attacks, but I have a strong suspicion that wouldn't have been worth a Bruno fight with a health bar that extends well past the edge of the screen.

		" City Hall: The three flying carriers have to be taken out first before any of the ground units, otherwise they'll just grab new ones.

You want the first hatch opening to spawn birds since they're faster, and the second to spawn a servbot since he'll just die to collateral mine damage. Since there is a lot of down time at the start of and after this fight, you have ample time to manipulate maximum zenny drops from the two tanks.

You have to kill the first tank ASAP to get Roll to start moving in the beginning, so there isn't really much opportunity to manipulate zenny on that one, but the rest of the kills have more opportunity for manipulation.

This was a pain in the ass to manipulate since nothing in that room advances RNG on a frame by frame basis, and Mega Man is limited strictly to shooting walls to do the manipulation himself.

		" The Hyper Cartridge, which refills special weapon ammo and is usable mid-fight, is essential for maximizing DPS on the final boss as well as eliminating a rather lengthy dialogue right before it. You can only hold one of these at a time, so it's saved all the way up until then. The 4 buster parts which are purchased are heavily optimized around the attack and range stats, but the sniper unit has an added bonus of 1 energy, which increases Mega Man's maximum shot volley from 3 to 4. Rapid is completely ignored because it is heavily marginalized by the stutter step technique. Only two buster parts can be currently equipped at a a time, but that number will increase to 3 after obtaining the Adapter Plug from a later ruins.

With TAS-level precision on Grand Grenade tosses, the buster is marginalized enough in the late game to merit saving the Hyper Cartridge for the final boss and skipping these two buster upgrades(and the extra wasp nest that would have to be farmed to purchase Turbo Charger Omega).

		" Since the range stat is almost useless on Garudoriten(boss), the Sniper Unit is replaced in favorite of the Power Raiser Omega. Since his arms will still be covering his face after taking 3 shots before your next volley is off cooldown, you want to create a doppler effect with each volley to induce his immunity more quickly. Also, you cannot open the door after the fight until Roll's dialogue starts, so you want to position yourself for the last shot a specific distance between the boss and the door so that her dialogue starts right when you reach the door.

		" Quick Aim: By holding down to look up on all frames of an aim, your next aim will start at that place if you press down on the same frame you start the aim. Since there is a buffer period after entering the back door of the boat shop and exiting the Flutter for whatever reason, you can use this down time to set up a quick aim for this grenade toss. You can also set up quick aims any time you have to call Roll to pick up up in the car, and since quick aim is universally beneficially any time you have to aim a Grand Grenade, you want to set one up any time you can.

		" Karumuna Bash(boss): The 3 dogs will always run towards Mega Man if his back is turned to them, but their hitboxes are too large to fit in the doorway at the end of the room. The red one should be manipulated to use fire in order to group them all up as quicky as possible. It might look like I'm wasting frames turning around instead of quick turning after the first two grenade tosses, but Grand Grenade damage is very finnicky and deals significantly reduced damage without proper timing/aim.

		" The 5 servebots in the first phase of the fight can be kill slightly more quickly with 4 Grand Grenades instead of 3, but conserveing 1 allows me to eliminate a 3 second conversation with data to refill ammo. To kill them with 3 you have to throw the Grenades at specific times to make sure the first two tosses hit 2 each, then you finish off the one that takes less damage with buster.

		" Buster Stat Property Storing: By pausing and switching buster parts while a volley is still on screen, you can change some of the stats of the current volley while retaining others. At the end of this fight, I shoot a volley of 4 lower-damage shots, then switch to a higher damage layout that has a maximum volley of 3, and the 4 shots on screen receive the updated damage values. This is particuarly useful since it eliminates a having to shoot an extra volley, and I no longer need the Sniper Unit's range for any of the remaining bosses.

The now-upgraded Grand Grenades do ~1300 damage optimally compared to the buster's 90 damage, and the walkers only take 5 buster shots to kill, so using a Grand Grenade on them is a bit wasteful because of the massive overkill but it is still a bit faster. It was unclear whether or not I was going to be able to use every grenade I wanted to in Subsidy 3 without having to talk to data for an ammo refill before Juno, but I managed to luck out and guess the optimal grenade route on first try without needing to backtrack. The only enemy in Subsidy 3 which I didn't grenade is the far away antenna at the start, since I'm saving my quick aim for the one on top of the high building later on. You cannot do consecutive quick aims with grenade tosses unless the previous grenade toss is a maximum heigh toss(which I don't think any of them are), since a quick aim has to be set up by holding down for the entire duration of the aim period.

		" Juno 1 is effectively an auto-scroller where you simply have to manipulate the fastest possible patterns, since the fight phase does not end when Juno 1 reach zero hp, but rather when his final move finishes after reaching zero hp. The way his AI works is that he will either jump or dive at you 1-6 times, then do a more powerful attack. The fastest filler move is a jump, and the fastest powerful attack is spinning lasers. Therefor, the fastest fight you can possibly get is 1 jump>spinning lasers>1 jump>spinning lasers. Since the fight doesn't end until he finishes his last attack, I'm not wasting any time by shooting the wall mid-fight for manipulation.

[ul

		" Similarly to Juno 1, Juno 2 also alternates between some number of filler attacks(in this case 1-3) and one random, more powerful attack. Jumping is the faster filler move than flame dashing, so you want to manipulate 1 jump in between each powerful attack to reduce the amount of time between them. Fireball is the longest powerful attack, so it should be manipulated each time so you can pump more consecutive grenades into Juno without having to move and re-adjust your aim in between tosses.
