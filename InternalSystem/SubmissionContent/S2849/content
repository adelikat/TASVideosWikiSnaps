	]a
	". That submission was rejected due to bad game choice. A rerecord count this low is not a good indication for a TAS being either optimal or entertaining. Please carefully read 
	[a class=intlink href=/TASHowTo 
		"this page
	]a
	" and the pages linked from there on how to make a TAS that could be acceptable for this site. Also make sure to post a work in progress on the forum to get some tips before you submit another movie. Rejecting due to bad game choice (and being improvable).
