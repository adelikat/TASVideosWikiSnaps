	"dlroW oiraM repuS is a Super Mario World hack that basically reverses the entire game. Instead of starting in Yoshi's Island, we start in Valley of Bowser hahah crazy huh? And that's not all! In addition to the game being reversed, all the levels are also reversed. You start at the end of the level and have to get to the beginning!

		" Since the game is backwards and 90% of the levels are to the left, corner clips are essential! Super Mario World pulls the player to the left if they are inside a block, and so corner clips are always favorable, even if I have to lose a few pixels to be in the correct position.

	": I enjoyed this run more than I anticipated.  It was interesting seeing Mario going backwards through otherwise familiar levels.  In particular, I liked the idea of the switch palaces removing blocks instead of adding them to the stages.  Overall, the run seems well played; though I'd be curious if implementing improvements would bring the time closer to the comparable goal of the normal game.
