	"This is my SNES Inspector Gadget speed game. It uses no warps, only collects items that are in the way, and takes some damage to speed things up. Otherwise, this game basically focuses on reaching Claw in the simplest and/or quickest way possible.

	"We all know the story of Inspector Gadget, the absent minded pseudo-android that always seems to get himself in to trouble. In case you don't catch it in the rediculously slow cutscenes, this game focuses on Gadget's arch nemesis, Claw, kidnapping Gadget's niece Penny. Oddly enough, Brain plays no role in the movie, aside from a cameo in the intro screen and a few random and otherwise useless coins.
