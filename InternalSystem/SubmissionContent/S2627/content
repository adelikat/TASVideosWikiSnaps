	"I made the platform a little higher. This mainly saved time at the start, since Primo had to build up his blocks a little lower. This saved about a second. After this, Primo stayed at the top, so it didn't matter that much for the rest (maybe a little). During the rest of the run, I saved frames here and there which added up to the other 4.41 seconds. It's hard to really compare frames at tetris with other runs, but I tried to do it a little with Primo's run, to give myself an impression on how I was doing... so I thank Primo for his run.
	$LF

[p 
	"Funny note. You get 1 when holding down when dropping a piece. Roughly 1 point for each tile the block drops. Moving the block left or right, or manipulating will lose the points that block had 'gained' at that point for holding down. This run clears 164 lines, which means 41 tetrisses.34 tetrisses at level 19 for 24000 points each. 3 tetrisses at level 20 for 25200 each. 2 tetrisses at level 21 for 26400 each, and 2 tetrisses at level 22 for 27600 each. Add this up and you will get 999600 points. This means you need to get 399 points from holding down. This run gets exactly 399 points with holding down (not a single one more).

		"Input ends at the earliest posible frame when further input cannot prevent game over.
	]em
	"" This wasn't true however, since pausing the game prevents the game from ending. Instead of this, I stopped the input to create the shortest AVI time. If you look at when the ending starts, my run is 313 frames faster than Primo. If Primo had used the same way of ending his input, the input of this movie would have been 324 frames shorter.

	"The main improvement is a better strategy, where more lines are completed at once. Initially, I was about 10 seconds faster, but then I noticed the number of blocks the level started with was an odd number, so it wasn't possible to clear all lines. This was very frustrating. It did mean that the actual number of blocks that you start out with was also manipulatable, which could be used in my advantage too. This is why in this movie, the tetris at the end actually clears four lines. Due to this, my second attempt was faster than my first, ending up with a 11.65 second improvement.

It might look random at times, but every block is carefully planned and manipulated. The planning of this TAS might have been more work than the actual TASing itself.

	"I didn't randomly pick a pattern. I also considered drawing an imagine, but the width is only 10 blocks and there are also other limitations, like a hole being required on every line. In the pattern I picked, every block needs to be carefully planned. The pattern cannot be formed by repeating a certain sequence of blocks. After quite a few drawn out plans, amongst which were several failed attempts, where I noticed later that I had forgotten a tile somewhere, I got a final where relatively little lines were needed to create the pattern. When I came at the topic, I couldn't stick to my plan, as there were limitations in movement and pieces cut off. I was really happy to manage a 17th line. I didn't even consider the possibility of an 18th line until later. I was really surprised it was possible in the end, it also made the ending less arbitrary, as right after I complete it death is inevitable.
