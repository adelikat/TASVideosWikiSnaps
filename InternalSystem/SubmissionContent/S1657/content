	"Initially, the target was to break 15 mins, since the previous run had 12-13 seconds of known improvements, which would've taken it nicely below 15 minutes. Although with a little bit of messing around in the basement on a N64, and tossing away all the tiring and obvious lines of enquiry in the past, I began to get suspicious of possible BLJ locations, as I managed to get 3-4 BLJs in a row on a console, which made me want to fully TAS it, although it was not done on the one seen in the finished run as it later turned out to be impossible to gain any sort of infinite speed. In total, there are 5 BLJ locations in the basement, with another one or two locations being entirley unconfirmed. It seems that a banister, unlike an outer wall, is able to hold Mario and stop him sliding out of the BLJ location, which is why the previously mentioned ones don't work. Sadly, for the time being, DDD is not skippable, so there is no 0 star run. It's a shame that this makes the 16 star catagory obselete, since it wasn't quite perfected yet.

	"I had just came back from a holiday to find all the hype about new BLJ locations in the basement. Needless to say, I was keen to investigate these, as it meant a possible 1 or 0 star TAS. When I found out about them, I checked the TAS forums, and found that AKA had found something that might have been useful, so I contacted him about it and was informed that he was unable to gain enough speed to break the door. I suggested that we find a way to get Mario stuck against the banister, so AKA and I experimented with the stairs and eventually came to the conclusion that holding the analogue stick in the general direction of the nearby key door meant that Mario would not leave the BLJ area until he had a significantly higher amount of speed than in AKA's initial attempt, which happened to be enough to break the door. I'm satisfied with the final time of the run, after all, it is the first of its kind, but even then I feel that it's very optimal.
