	"Thought id start off another TAS game to hopefully see more submissions on. Here i have done Joe and Mac Caveman Ninja for the NES, USA version. Surprised there has not been a TAS video submitted for this game yet, so hope this one will start the ball rolling and hopefully see some more people exploit and beat this submission in the future.

	"Only way for a good speed run on this rom is to attack only when jumping, due to the unfortunate stopping of walking when Joe attacks whilst he is on the ground. Could have been improved in a few parts, but a tas nonetheless.
