	"I got the idea to do the run based off an improvement I thought I found late in Stage 6, though it turned out to actually waste time in the end. I started the run the day FCEUX 2.2.0 was released with the intention of learning TASEditor, not expecting to save more than maybe a second. Over the course of the run, I found a couple timesavers such as a way to reduce some of the lag and a way to bring up the end-of-level fadeout faster in Stages 2, 4, and 6 (the stages involving death), which was a nice motivation to actually finish the run. That's... really it. I've got nothin'.

	"Not much to say about this stage. Early on, you'll notice some random and seemingly unnecessary jumping: This is actually to reduce lag. For some reason, being in the air or swinging your sword at certain times will reduce lag frames. Occasionally there'll be a frame or two of lag that's completely unavoidable, but I do my best to remove every lag frame aside from those. For the most part, aside from some stylistic choices, the stage is the same as JXQ's, just less laggy.

Notable in that it's the only improved boss fight in the run. Died a few frames earlier, which brought up the fadeout earlier on its own, saving 4 frames, plus the usual 32 from bringing up the fadeout earlier with Start.

Saving time earlier in the level and arriving at the spikes earlier might work... Even then, it'd have to be a rather large gain on top of what I had already saved that I doubt is there.
