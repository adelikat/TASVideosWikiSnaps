		"Alfred n the Fettuc
	]em
	" (aka 
	[em 
		"Alfredo
	]em
	") is game 9/52 in the NES version of Action 52. You're a chef, and the kitchen is out to get you. You have to run, jump and use your magic ladle to bypass the ingredients and finish the 3 levels the game has to offer. If this game is selected on an unrevised cartridge, the ROM will crash. Luckily, the Rev A cartridge loads the game just fine.

All the spots that I thought could be improved, I couldn't figure them out. If there is anything obvious, then i don't see it...otherwise I would be dependent on an audience that never showed up.
