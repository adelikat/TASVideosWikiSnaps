[p 
	"I finally found a working ROM of Dragons Lair! This is the hardest game I've 
	$LF
	"ever played and that's because the control are the most stupid ever.
	$LF

[p 
	"Anyways, this time attack is flawless in the meaning not missing any 
	$LF
	"dagger/fire/axe. I take some hits but they are sort of unavoidable. This is 
	$LF
	"my second attempt at this game. First time was: 09:25 and it looked a bit 
	$LF
	"shabby. This is faster but I had less luck with the Lizard king this time. 
	$LF
	"This guy appear randomly and tries to steal my gold. However, when he 
	$LF
	"appears all enemies disappears. But it didn't happend when I wanted it too.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Anyways, this game wasn't as long as  thought it should be. But the 
	$LF
	"difficulty of the game makes it almost impossible to complete on a real NES. 
	$LF
	"At least I never managed to do it.

[p 
	"Enjoy
