	"So I found new time saving techniques and a better way to manipulate RNG, that's why I decided to make a new TAS.

	"This is an improvement of 70 frames, 45 frames from better gameplay and 25 frames from closing all the dialoge cutscenes quicker (by new technique).

	"The player must find out the grenade guy (who is captured in some random doors) in each level, without it the cutscene of blowing up the final blockade won't appear and you will not be able to finish that level.

[div class=p 
	"Some doors are in your way and don't need any extra distance to travel so you always want the grenade guy in those doors and that is the reason why you are not done after TASing a level in this game.

[div class=p 
	"So there is an extra jump in the end of level 1 in my current TAS and I was trying to find a way to reduce that jump and after trying different sorts of things I reduced that jump but as I said above that after TASing each level you will have to see which grenade guy door you are getting in the next level and here I was getting the wrong door so I TASed the 1st level multiple times and the dialoge cutscene after it too and there I observed that even after maintaining the same speed in level 1 the level 2 is starting a little late and sometimes a little early by few frames.

[div class=p 
	"This is the first new trick I found, in this trick you can be lucky and close the dialoge cutscenes few frames faster! What you do is first of all you simply optimise/TAS a level and then TAS the dialoge cutscenes too and note the the first frame of next level then go back and do some changes in the level while trying not to loose time then TAS the cutscenes again and note the first frame of next level again, Using this trick you can gain benefit of few frames.

	"Level 2 : no improvements but managed to start level 2 four frames faster by new trick 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Level 3 : found 4 frames of improvement here, In previous TAS I stopped for 1 frame in this level but now there is no need to stop anywhere because I reached this level even quicker so enemy behaviour has changed and that's why there is a different route taken in level 3, this route is equally fast as previous run but this time I had to take this route because of changed RNG or whatever it is.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Level 4 : here I again took different route which is equally fast as the route taken in previous TAS, the damage trick I used this time in level 4 was not applicable in my previous TAS but it is now so I used this trick, I also reduced two jumps here, also found 2 frames of improvement from better movement ( 12 frames of improvement).
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Level 5 : found 12 frames of improvement here too, 3 frames from better movement and 1 jump reduced in the end, also there is a lag intensive area in level 5 so I improved it too.

[div class=p 
	"Level 6 : no improvements here .
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Level 7 : found 11 frames of improvement here, 1 frame of improvement from better movment and later this one frame of improvement became 2 frames of improvement probably because of sub-pixel management then later gained few more frames from faster movement.

[div class=p 
	"Level 8 : 4 frames of improvement here, I completly changed the gameplay here because movement used in previous run was not applicable here.
