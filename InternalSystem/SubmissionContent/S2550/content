	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The evil wizard Abadon threatens to destroy Merlwood tomorrow, or something. And as usual, only one guy can stop him. You need to travel all the way deep into Abadon's domain in order to stop his plans, and to do so, you'll also need to master quite a number of spells that will surely be useful on your journey. Then again, there are a number of spells which are completely useless, but who's counting?
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"However, when entering a friggin' STORE gives you more max mana than what you start with, how did this guy even become a magician in the first place? Regardless of Paul's shortcomings and an unusual talent to learn from life's silly stuff, you still need to brave through the various monsters and traps along the way to defeat Abadon and become a true Magician.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"As for gameplay, you recover mana at a fairly slow pace. Sure, it may be 6 points per second, but when you consider that some spells takes a hundred, and others even more than that, it's quite a few seconds that gets added up. Then throw in the fact that you can go from 100% food to 0% in 4.25 minutes, and you'll find yourself hanging around a food shop while you charge up your shield spells, taking thousands of mana to get all four at 100%. Hey, it is an effective tactic! Additionally, bosses regenerate health, so you must deal damage quick enough to have hope, and if you're out of mana, the mana regen alone isn't fast enough.

[p 
	"Just a few random details I can think of that should be said:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Paul walks in specific increments. These increments are about 5 pixels, but I didn't exactly analyze this deeply. But I do know enough that Paul could very well walk 4 pixels farther than he needs to in order to enter a door. It is possible to "break" this 5-pixel step by casting a spell, even in failure. Paul will instantly hold out his hands in spell-casting form and this messes with his walking animation. Thus, you can adjust where these increments take place at.

	"A 60-frame timer at

[p 
	"First thing, I learn JUMP, set it to level 4, and hop away. This idea came from watching Slotermeyer's run, and why I didn't test it until now... Call it laziness.

[p 
	"For some strange reason, by visiting the wise man and doing stuff in there, I "forget" the JUMP spell. I still have the spell selected and can use it, I just need to relearn it later. The cost in frames for this loss is thankfully minimal.

[p 
	"Numerous optional max mana stuff around, which I do for "best ending". At some point, I cast the UNKNOWN... spell to heal myself. Since I'm finally using the UNKNOWN... spell, I shall introduce it. This spell will often kill Paul in many colorful ways. However, it has a chance to heal for 20% and remove all venom. In a TAS, a chance of anything good happening may as well be a guarantee, so needless to say, I get the needed healing. Unlike the previous run, it's not used to defeat the obnoxious hunger, but rather actual attacks from enemies for once!

[p 
	"While the mana fountain fully restores mana, I have no need for it in this run. Thus, the room is skipped. I go straight to the ULTIMATE POTION room, speed myself up and heal myself slightly. Since I'm not starving to death, just one shot of healing is enough.
