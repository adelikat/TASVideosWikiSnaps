	"I used the default setup of the GBA emulation from the downloaded file BizHawk-2.6.2-win-x64.

	"About this Any% run:
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"English is the fastest language. The run starts at frame 866 (selecting an empty save file) and ends at frame 200319 (last hit on the final Boss).
	$LF
	"So this run has a length of 200319 - 865 = 199454 frames.
	$LF
	"The frame rate is about 59.7275 fps according to this submission, so I estimate the final time to be 55:39.40 (manually timed it 55:39.4 with LiveSplit anyway).
	$LF
	"Both final dialogues and credits are skippable, but I kept them to show the end of the game. The A presses after frame 200319 do not count in the final time of this Any% run.

	"I've optimized this TAS the best way I could do. First, I used the best human strats known. Then I introduced many new frame perfect tricks such as:
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"- Single/double/triple frame jumps. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- Double hits on a single frame against Hoodlums and Pirates.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- Fast climbing.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- Fast walking and jumping recovery after laying on the floor.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"And TAS only strats discovered such as:
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- Tight shortcuts impossible for humans like in Void of Bones and Wretched Ruins.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- Fast damage boosting against Jano.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- Skipping all loops consistently in Prickly Passage.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- Zipping in The Mettleworks.

	"However, this TAS isn't optimal yet. Indeed, the RNG in the final level aren't the best. I found a seed that is 45 frames faster than the actual seed. Unfortunately I couldn't fell back on that seed despite many manipulations with free inputs. Else, I tried once to deoptimize a segment by 10 frames to get a better seed that was only 11 frames faster. Loosing my satisfaction in order to save 1 frame wasn't worth it. So I kept my fully optimized segment and slower seed.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Then, there are still two levels that aren't fully optimized: Magma Mayhem 1 and Magma Mayhem 2. I did my best to save frames by testing many routes. The actual result is the best route I could empirically find. Those two levels are designed like racetracks from Mario Kart, so very difficult to be optimized at full potential.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Finally, I didn't introduce many free inputs to entertain the audience during waiting segments because free inputs can lead to additional lag frames and change RNG seeds. I just did some stuff in Scaleman's Keep because I manipulated my best seed here.
