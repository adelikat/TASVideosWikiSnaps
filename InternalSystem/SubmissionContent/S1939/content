	"First of all, For those who don't know, Ms Pacman is a game in which you must play through different levels in the form of a maze, and collect all of the dots before the ghosts eat you. I chose Ms Pacman as a game because I like it alot, it isn't too complicated to TAS, and there were no submissions of it (aside from my previous one). I personally do not believe that it is one of those "boring to watch" games, though others might differ in opinion. Now, I know that there are actually about 139 levels total before the game bugs and erases the walls and makes it impossible to beat, but I believe that level 9 is the last intended level since it is the last level before the "junior" cutscene, which is the last one in the game. Besides, who would want to watch a 139-level Ms Pacman TAS?

	"I made this run as an attempt to beat out my previous TAS of it, which I admit wasn't too good. Fortunately, I not only beat it. I crushed it by 28 seconds. This was thanks to much better routes, being alot more careful, eating less ghosts, and, probably most of all, a glitch that allows you to pass through ghosts. This glitch is done by turning towards a ghost at frame perfect timing, so its very tricky in real time, and great for TAS. Well, that's all I have to say. Enjoy!
