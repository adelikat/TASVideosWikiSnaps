		"Karate Champ
	]em
	" is an arcade game released by Data East in 1984.  The game was developed for Data East by Technōs Japan.  Even in this early example, Technōs Japan's penchant and talent for designing "fighting" games is readily apparent.  While it was not the first fighting game (not even for Technōs Japan), it was the first to offer such a high degree of realism and sophistication, so much so that it has been identified as the defining game of the one-on-one fighting genre.  The game also features an early example of digitized speech.  The control scheme is atypical, featuring 2 4-way joysticks and no buttons.  The left joystick controls the player's movement and posture, while the right joystick controls the various attack techniques.  Using the 2 joysticks in combination allows for a fairly whopping total of 24 different controls.  Owing to the complexity of the controls, the learning curve is rather steep; a first-time player may be challenged to defeat even the first Opponent.  Considering the theme of the game, such as breaking objects and fighting a bull, it may be surmised that the game's protagonist is a student of the Kyokushin style of karate.  The founder of Kyokushin karate himself, Mas Oyama, is purported to have fought more than 50 bulls in his lifetime.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Rapid Advance:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Press Up on the Right Joystick for 1 Frame.  Delay for 2 Frames.  Repeat as needed.  This technique begins and then immediately cancels a Round Kick, which causes the Hero to move to the right much more quickly than walking or jumping.  Round Kick is the only move that does not immediately set the Posture Delay Timer, which allows it to be immediately cancelled.  Using this technique, the Hero can move to the right at a rate of 6 pixels per each 3 Frames, or 2 pixels per Frame.  Additionally, the Hero will be ready to attack within 2 Frames after making such a move.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Manipulate Opponent AI:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"By delaying for as little as just 1 Frame, the Opponent can be manipulated to take a different action.  A delay Frame must be used on a Frame when Hero Status is Ready and the Posture Delay Timer is not active.  Delay Frames can be used at the start of a Match or between Frames of movement (walking or Rapid Advance).  Delay Frames can not be used while an attack Technique is being used without interrupting the Technique.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The Opponent can also be manipulated to respond in a particular manner by beginning a Technique, but not fully executing it.  The Opponent's response to a Technique varies, depending on the Match, with 1 exception.  Using Front Foot Sweep on the first possible Frame will always cause the Opponent to Jump.
	$LF

[p 
	"On the Name Registration screen, the rousing Karate Champ theme music may be heard in its entirety.  This is the only opportunity the game affords to do so.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The transition from one Match to the next begins when the Technique score appears above the Hero.  The Technique score appears when the animation for the Technique that hit the Opponent has expired.  When the Technique animation expires, the Technique Score Display Timer is set to 90 and the Transition Timer is set to 40.  When the Transition Timer expires, judgment is rendered.  As such, the priority is not simply to hit the Opponent as quickly as possible, but to hit the Opponent as quickly as possible with the Technique that requires the fewest Frames overall to complete.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Time stops decrementing when the Opponent is hit.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The first Frame of input during Evade and Get The Bull is 2 Frames before the Hero spawns.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If the Hero uses an attack Technique that approaches within 16 pixels of an Opponent, and the Opponent uses Front Foot Sweep, the Hero is pushed away to a distance of around 30 pixels.  This can also occur when the Opponent uses Jumping Side Kick.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The RNG determines the Y location of objects during an Evade Bonus Interval.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"1 second of Time expires on the first Frame of a Round.  Thereafter, 1 second of Time expires per each 60 Frames.  Each second of Time remaining when an Opponent is defeated scores 100 points.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The first Frame of Hero input for a Round is 1 Frame before Posture Delay Timer is changed from 0 to 1.  During Practice and Dojo Matches, input can not be started on the same Frame on which Posture Delay Timer is changed from 0 to 1, but input can be started on the next Frame after that.  If input is not entered on the first possible Frame, the Opponent will take a step toward the Hero.  Note that during a Match, Time can also be observed as a visual cue, as it changes from 30 to 29 on the same Frame that the Posture Delay Timer is changed from 0 to 1.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The game lags for 1 Frame occasionally.  Get The Bull is particularly prone to lag.
	$LF

[p 
	"During Training, the playfield extends from X 48 on the left to X 175 on the right.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"During Match and Evade Bonus Interval, the playfield extends from X 32 on the left to X 223 on the right.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Using certain Techniques while in close proximity to the Opponent can cause the Hero to end up behind the Opponent.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"During Trial Chop, pressing the joystick on the earliest possible Frame saves 58 Frames compared to getting Perfect.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If the Opponent has an attack Technique in progress when the Hero's Technique hits the Opponent, the Hero generally scores double points.  If a Technique is capable, this will score a Full Point.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When the Opponent is hit, he stops at his current location.  If the Opponent is hit while he is jumping, the Opponent will appear to hover in midair after he has been hit.

	" The Techniques
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Note that the times listed for these Techniques is based on the neutral posture.  Depending on the Hero's posture when a Technique is started, the Technique may require more or fewer Frames.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Front Kick requires 20 Frames to execute and requires 54 Frames overall.  Front Kick is worth 100-200 Points.  Front Kick scores Half Point.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Middle Reverse Punch requires 9 Frames to execute and requires 34 Frames overall.  Middle Reverse Punch is worth 100-200 Points.  Middle Reverse Punch scores Half Point.  Middle Reverse Punch only occurs when the Opponent is within 62 pixels of the Hero.  If the Left Joystick is held to the Right while the Right Joystick Right is held to the Right, Middle Reverse Punch will be overridden by Front Kick. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Squatting Reverse Lunge Punch requires 21 Frames to execute and requires 57 Frames overall.  Squatting Reverse Lunge Punch is worth 400-800 Points.  Squatting Reverse Lunge Punch scores Half Point or Full Point.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Jumping Side Kick requires 25 Frames to execute and requires 62 Frames overall.  Jumping Side Kick is worth 500-1000 Points.  Jumping Side Kick scores Half Point or Full Point.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Low Kick requires 21 Frames to execute and requires 52 Frames overall.  Low Kick is worth 100-200 Points.  Low Kick scores Half Point.  Low Kick is the only Technique that has a 4-Frame Posture Delay Timer for its final posture.  All other Techniques require 8 Frames except Squat and Jumping Techniques.  In later Matches, starting a Low Kick on the first possible Frame will cause the Opponent to immediately use Jumping Side Kick.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Round Kick requires 18 Frames to execute and requires 44 Frames overall.  Round Kick is worth 300-600 Points.  Round Kick scores Half Point or Full Point.  Round Kick is the fastest Technique capable of scoring a Full Point.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Back Round Kick requires 25 Frames to execute and requires 51 Frames overall.  Back Round Kick is worth 500-1000 Points.  Back Round Kick scores Half Point or Full Point.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Turn Back Kick requires 31 Frames to execute and requires 57 Frames overall.  Turn Back Kick is worth 500-1000 Points.  Turn Back Kick scores Half Point or Full Point.  This Technique changes the direction that the Hero is facing.  Turn Back Kick is identical to Back Round Kick, except that the Hero begins by facing away from the Opponent.  When Turn Back Kick is started, the Hero turns to face the Opponent, requiring 5 Frames, and thereafter the Technique behaves the same as a Back Round Kick.  Unlike Jumping Back Kick, if input for Turn Back Kick is pressed for just 1 Frame, the Hero will be turned around.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Front Foot Sweep requires 28 Frames to execute and requires 78 Frames overall.  Front Foot Sweep is worth 200-400 Points.  Front Foot Sweep scores Half Point.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Back Foot Sweep requires 25 Frames to execute and requires 75 Frames overall.  Back Foot Sweep is worth 100-200 Points.  Back Foot Sweep scores Half Point.

	"Back Kick requires 19 Frames to execute and requires 49 Frames overall.  Back Kick is worth 200-400 Points.  Back Kick scores Half Point.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Middle Lunge Punch requires 21 Frames to execute and requires 55 Frames overall.  Middle Lunge Punch is worth 200-400 Points.  Middle Lunge Punch scores Half Point.  Note that if the Opponent is within 62 pixels of the Hero, Middle Lunge Punch can not occur.  Entering input for Middle Lunge Punch when the Opponent is within 62 pixels of the Hero will result in a Front Kick.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Upper Punch requires 19 Frames to execute and requires 53 Frames overall.  Upper Punch is worth 300-600 Points.  Upper Punch scores Half Point or Full Point.  Unlike other combination Techniques, the Left Joystick only needs to be pressed on the first Frame of input for an Upper Punch.  After the Left Joystick has been pressed, only the Right Joystick input is required to complete the Upper Punch.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Jumping Back Kick has a maximum range of  pixels.  Hold the Left Joystick Up and the Right Joystick Left.  Input must be held for a maximum of 25 Frames.  This Technique changes the direction that the Hero is facing.  Jumping Back Kick requires 52 Frames overall.   Jumping Back Kick is worth 500-1000 Points.  Jumping Back Kick scores 1/2 Point or 1 Point.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Upper Lunge Punch requires 21 Frames to execute and requires 55 Frames overall.  Upper Lunge Punch is worth 500-1000 Points.  Upper Lunge Punch scores Half Point or Full Point.  Note that if the Opponent is within 62 pixels of the Hero, Upper Lunge Punch can not occur.  Entering input for Upper Lunge Punch when the Opponent is within 62 pixels of the Hero will result in a Round Kick.  This is to prevent the Hero from being able to easily get behind the Opponent.  Starting from the neutral posture at X 79, Upper Lunge Punch can hit a target at X 154, 75 pixels distant.  It is the ultimate power in the universe.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Block requires 1 Frame to execute and requires 22 Frames overall.  Block only occurs when the Opponent uses certain attack Techniques within 62 pixels of the Hero.  There are 3 types of Block: Low, Middle, and High.  The specific type of Block that occurs is determined by the attack Technique that the Opponent is using when the Block begins.  Block defends against attack Techniques that target the defended area.  Block does not occur if the Hero is not facing the Opponent.  Block can be held indefinitely, but the type of Block will not change to reflect the Opponent's current attack Technique.  No Block will occur or can defend against Low Kick, Front Foot Sweep, or Back Foot Sweep.

	"The Hero scores points for correctly matching the senpai's Technique.  Practice does not need to be completed in any particular manner (or at all) in order to advance to the next phase of the game.  After the senpai demonstrates a Technique, there is a delay of 8 Frames, and then the Senpai Delay Timer is set to 50.  If the Hero matches the Technique within these 50 Frames, 200 points are awarded.  When the Hero matches the Technique, the Senpai Delay Timer is reset, and he immediately begins the next Technique.  As such, it is fastest to match the senpai's Technique on the earliest possible Frame.  Note that after the senpai demonstrates the final Technique, the sensei says "Very Good!" on a fixed Frame, regardless of how quickly the Hero matches the final Technique.  This applies only to the final Technique in Practice.

	"At 9th Dan and 10th Dan, the Opponent's posture delay is reduced by 1 Frame per posture.  This is a significantly different fight than anything yet encountered.  With this speed advantage, the Opponent can Block, evade, and counterattack with impunity.  If the Hero takes no attack action and remains 60 pixels or greater distant from the Opponent, the Opponent will move directly to the Hero and use Front Kick.  If the Hero approaches within 60 pixels of the Opponent, he will use Front Foot Sweep.  If the Hero attacks high, the Opponent will use Front Foot Sweep.  If the Hero attacks center, the Opponent will Block and then use Front Kick.  If the Hero attacks low, the Opponent will use Jumping Side Kick.  If the Hero uses Front Foot Sweep, the Opponent will walk out of range and then use Jump.

	"The situation with this neverending game resembles arcade Punch Outs, where once you obtain the champion rank, you see no new content in the game. But while Punch Outs keep increasing the difficulty, this game stops at some point too, and this run beats the first level of maximum difficulty. So it beats the game in a sensible way, and it got good feedback, accepting to Moons.
