		"Since there is such a gray area in defining what is or is not a "glitch" in this game, a group of OoT players voted to define a set of rules that they would all abide by. It is important that all players use the same rules, since it allows them to compare times with each other. These rules are not perfect, but they are the current standard. This category aims to ban things solely based on the techniques used, not the results of those techniques. To the extent that common sense allows, we may explain this as: "If the means are not a glitch, neither are the ends." So if you do not perform a glitch, you may skip any part of the game, regardless of how important. This category was originally the only Glitchless category. It now stands apart from Glitchless All Main Quests which aims to create a speedrun which feels more like a glitchless category, rather than aiming to be strictly logically glitchless like this one.

	"-	There’s no glitchless way to skip the Door of Time, so all three Spiritual Stones and the Ocarina/Song of Time are collected.

]div
[div class=p 
	"-	You need the Light Arrows to kill Ganondorf.  You only need the Shadow and Spirit Medallions to activate the Light Arrow cutscene, so these are the only ones obtained.  You still need the bow to actually fire the arrows, so part of the Forest Temple is also completed.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-	The route taken as a child is done so to manage the time of day, as you can only reach Zelda if you enter the castle during the day (guards block the path inside at night).  If this requirement wasn’t there, parts of the route would be different, such as only visiting Zora’s Domain once.  As it stands, the route taken is the most optimal.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-	The route taken as an adult (e.g. going to the Lost Woods and getting the song there after the Shadow Temple, then leaving for the Spirit Temple and returning later) is done because you can’t get to the bow in the Forest Temple without a strength upgrade to push the large blocks, in this case the Silver Gauntlets, and also to reduce the amount of traveling required on the overworld (the current route is quicker than completing Spirit Temple before going to the forest at all, due to the time saved traveling back to the forest across the field).

	" Shadow Temple
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"-	Although Din’s Fire is still required to obtain the boss key in the Shadow Temple, we can skip using it to enter the temple itself by getting onto the level boundary using bomb boosts, then jumping past the loading zone which loads the door to the temple.  As none of this movement constitutes a glitch, it is legal in this category. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-	In the 1.0 version of the game, you can kill Bongo Bongo quicker by dropping a bomb onto him from the room above.  This skips the cutscene at the start of the fight, however it constitutes a glitch per the category rules - "Abusing actors which have not had a chance to update after loading (such as 0,0,0 glitch and the deku b2 web)".  As such, the fight is done normally.  Credit to Danny B for providing me with the following explanation for why this is a glitch: "Bongo spawns very far below you in the room, basically the full fall distance of a bomb.  As such, Bongo spawns culled, meaning it never gets a chance to run its update function.  Therefore its hitboxes spawn at 0,0,0 and can be hit by a bomb or any other kind of damage to which it is susceptible."

[h4 id=MinuetOfForest 
	" Minuet of Forest
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"-	The Minuet of Forest cutscene is skipped by voiding out after it starts, which you can do by getting out of bounds and falling into the cutscene trigger from there.  This is achieved by combining a hover boost on the stairs with the small amount of vertical distance running directly into a bomb can give you on slopes, which results in Link coming off the stairs and becoming airborne.  From here, you can swing around the boundary and fall into the cutscene trigger.
	$LF
]div
[h4 id=SpiritTemple 
	" Spirit Temple
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"-	The Silver Gauntlets are needed to be able to push the large blocks in the Forest Temple (having the Goron’s Bracelet would also work, even though it’s ostensibly a child-only item, but getting that is much slower).  These can be reached from the outside using the magic bean we planted earlier combined with a hover boost to land on the seam of the statue.  You can then reach the Mirror Shield ledge by abusing bomb boosts.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-	You can prevent Twinrova from moving around the room in her second form by firing the hookshot at her after she fires her spell at you, which causes her to spin in place and means she can "move" to her existing position.

]div
[div class=p 
	"-	During the castle escape, we used to shoot a light arrow to prevent Zelda's magic from showing, which we thought saved time.  I tested this during this run and it didn't save any time.  However, pressing C-up before the cutscene starts lets you regain control of Link 3 frames (1 visual frame) earlier.  This is still slower in most cases than getting "the kiss", i.e. becoming wedged between Zelda and the door, as that leaves you closer to the loading zone after the cutscene.  I was unable to get the kiss on the first outside door at the start of the escape, so the C-up trick was used instead there.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-	After getting the Master Sword back in the Ganon fight, you can hit any part of him (not just his tail) to start the next part of the fight, however hitting anywhere other than the tail means he takes an extra hit to die after he’s up, so it's quicker to hit the tail.
