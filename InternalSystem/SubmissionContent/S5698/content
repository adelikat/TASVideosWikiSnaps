	"I'm sure i could shave maybe a few more secconds off but the project had already gone on to being a multi day thing, and I would need to start over in some levels.

		"published movie
	]a
	", this run needlessly loses time in most stages, particularly in the sewer levels. Movement in general is less optimized, and while this movie has been submitted with a "100%" branch, it does not appear to have any particular goal in mind, as several items are skipped along the way. In any case, since this movie is visibly slower and unoptimized compared to existing runs, rejecting.
