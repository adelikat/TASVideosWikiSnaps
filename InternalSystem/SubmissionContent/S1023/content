[div class=p 
	"One of the first things you may notice about this TAS is that I choose the normal mode over hard mode. In this game, hard mode doesn't add anything to the viewer entertainment side of things, and simply serves to make enemies/bosses take more hits to kill, which I dont think would be overly enjoyable to watch (a hard mode run killing an extra boss would still have a graham fight as long as the one present in this TAS).

[div class=p 
	"The overall goal of Julius mode is pretty much to kill Graham, and you can actually achieve this without even killing a single boss. However, doing so means you do a grand total of 1 damage per hit against him, which means it would take one hell of a long time to kill him.

[div class=p 
	"Each boss you kill (and orb you grab) as Julius adds to your overall power, and the more you kill the stronger you get. In this TAS I kill 2 bosses, Creaking Skull and Manticore, for a grand total of 2 powerups.

[div class=p 
	"I use a grand total of one glitch in this run, but I estimate it saves at least 35 seconds doing it. I use a Catoblepas to activate a zipping glitch which places me outside the Chapel walls, from where I can either head to a black screen, the Underground Reservoir (where i zip some more to a black screen), the previous room in the Chapel but inside the walls, or by the warp room. Going to the warp room is by far the best choice, as it links directly to the boss room.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"After that its pretty much direct to Graham, as deviating for a third boss, while decreasing the Graham fight time itself, adds up to be considerably longer (this is roughly 1:30 faster than a test I did where I also fought Death).

[div class=p 
	"This is a total of 251 frames faster than the previous submission, 176 of them coming from the graham 1 fight due to making him appear once less due to axe subweapon usage, and the rest coming from a slightly different strategy on graham 2.
