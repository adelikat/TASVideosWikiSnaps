	"I found a way to avoid stopping in the second last stage, so I started this run. On the way, I managed to slightly reduce the amount of lag, but it resulted in worse luck than klmz's run. I tried the last stage,  but it was shit compared to klmz's version, so I just copied his. klmz, if you're reading this, I hope you don't mind. If you do, I'll replace it with mine.

	"I managed to reduce 5 frames of lag somehow while TASing through this stage. I beleived there were a couple of frames also saved, but they were killed off by a frame rule. I redid the boss battle, because my improvement changed the behavior of the 3 enemies that appear from the helicopter. I hope the dancing was entertaining enough.

	"The frame saved here for no apparent reason. I redid the entire stage, and managed something the previous run failed to do - obtain health lost from taking damage. During the boss battle, I danced around a bit for a brief period of time just like the first boss battle.

	"I had worse luck than klmz on the first hook, causing me to lose 2 frames. The frames saved here were from better lag reduction and not taking damage from the semi-circular enemy. However, I lost a few frames due to the falling platforms mysteriously falling later than klmz's run. The boss batte couldn't be improved, so I just copied klmz's run.

	"Most of the frames were saved from using a glitch that prevents the camerea from moving to get further ahead so I can casually walk past the falling platforms unlike in klmz's run. The rest of the frames were saved from better lag reduction. Initially, the savings in this stage were ~11 frames due to losing 10 frames from the accursed frame rule, but a reduction of a single lag frame in the previous stage was enough to pass the frame rule. Somewhere in the middle of the stage, I found a minor graphical glitch that results in item sprites appearing under ground. The boss battle, like the previous one, was unimprovable, so I just copied klmz's.

	"Since it is an auto-scroller, no frames could be saved. I tried to redo this stage, but around the middle, I realized that my version was inferior to klmz's, so I just copied the entire stage from his run.
