	": Compared to its counter part, there's some engine differences, a tiny enemy difference, and more importantly, a different set of enemy waves. Contrasting to other games where the differences between regional ports consist of a miniscule percentage of their play, seeing as how little this game offers, I find the differences here significant enough to differentiate between the regional ports and give each their own TAS.
