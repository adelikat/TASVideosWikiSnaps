	" Battle 1
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Very similar to the non assisted strategy. But turning left just before landing the first down-stab means the Heninger Silver lands to the left instead of going off screen to the right where the player would have to wait a few frames longer after it's invisibility frames wear off for it to walk back on screen.

	" Battle 2
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Ideally the first down-stab would hit both Heningers but their surround pattern AI prevents this. Two back-stab attacks each is enough to kill them but it was one frame quicker to use 3 down stabs. using two attack swings in the air before going into the down stab helps manipulate the AI and prevent the Henigers dodging up or down.

	"Same strategy as Battle 1, but this Heninger takes 3 down stabs to defeat.

[h4 
	" Battle 4
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Similar strategy to Battle 2, however the skeletons can be baited into a longer attack combo by sprinting past them which sets up the down-stab on both skeletons.
	$LF

[h4 
	" Battle 5
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Same strategy as Battle 2, it's more or less a copy paste. These Heninger Reds take two down-stabs to defeat to back attacks are not optimal.
	$LF

[h4 
	" Battle 6
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The Lemanaya take two down-stabs and a jump attack each to defeat. By turning left just before landing the jump attack on the second Lemanaya I can position both ready to down stabs. The un-mounted Red Dragons cause the AI to prioritize mounting, and not dodge down stabs.
	$LF

[h4 
	" Battle 7
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Both the Heninger Darks and the Longmoan Dark each take either 2 down-stabs or 3 back attacks to defeat. The fastest strategy I could find was to kick the 2 lower Darks together to setup back attacks.

[h4 
	" Battle 8
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The Purple Shield Skeletons each take two down-stabs and a back attack to defeat. Because skeletons have a much longer stand up animation it is possible to setup down-stabs after positioning both on the ground together.
	$LF

[h4 
	" Battle 9
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The Bad Brothers can be easily baited into their charge attack which sets up easy down-stabs on both.
	$LF

[h4 
	" Battle 10
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Lt.Bitter has slow attacks so a well timed down stab can be used during this. Once downed, his stand up animation is extremely slow so down-stabs are easily landed.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Battle 11
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Unlike the Bad Brothers, the Gen.Heartlands cannot both be baited into a charge attack at the top of the screen, so instead are baited individually to setup down-stabs on both.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Battle 12
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The same trick in Battle 10 is used to land the first down-stabs on each Gen.Bitter and position them ontop of each other for easy down-stabs. Swapped direction every frame during the last down-stab just for style.

[p 
	"This run could be improved if a way to group packs of 2 and 3 together for a down-stab is found. In most cases, the theoretically fastest way to complete any stage is to land a down-stab on all enemies on the screen together every time. However the surround pattern AI makes this very difficult to do in a way that is faster than the strategies used in this submission.
