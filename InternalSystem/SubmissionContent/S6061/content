	"Very similar to the non assisted strategy. But turning left just before landing the first down-stab means the Heninger Silver lands to the left instead of going off screen to the right where the player would have to wait a few frames longer after it's invisibility frames wear off for it to walk back on screen.

Two back-stab attacks each is enough to kill them but it was one frame quicker to use 3 down stabs. using two attack swings in the air before going into the down stab helps manipulate the AI and prevent the Henigers dodging up or down.

In most cases, the theoretically fastest way to complete any stage is to land a down-stab on all enemies on the screen together every time. However the surround pattern AI makes this very difficult to do in a way that is faster than the strategies used in this submission.
