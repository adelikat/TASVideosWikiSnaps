	"I know many people out there probably won't like this TAS cause they think the game is bad. I can agree at some
	$LF
	"points, but I think you can become accustomed in the game like I did, cause I didn't find the game so funny before
	$LF
	"but now I think its ok. And I didn't make this TAS only because I thought it was fun, I wanted to give people a view over this rare game as well.
	$LF
	"Anyway I thought the game would be short if you only play to round 3 (which might be fun for those who didn't like it :P)
	$LF
	"so I played to round 6. Another thing I wanted to do was to play the game different. Like " high punches only" or "low punches only" but
	$LF
	"I found that so hard to manipulate so I didn't play in that way.

[p 
	""Welcome to the toughest brawler to ever come out on the NES.  Well, it 
	$LF
]p
[pre 
	" was the toughest fighter released in the 1980's at least, right?  Well, 
	$LF
	" ok, it had to be the GREATEST street fighting game released in 1984!  
	$LF
]pre
[pre 
	" In this game, you are a street tough who is out to prove that you have 
	$LF
	" the toughness to knock any opponent out.  You begin with three "lives" 
	$LF
	" in reserve, which means when you lose your third scuffle (a single round 
	$LF
	" of fighting), your game ends.  You can tell when you or an opponent is 
	$LF
	" close to stopping their fighting ways because of the open sewer (where a 
	$LF
	" vanquished street tough is tumbled into).  Keep going till your body can 
	$LF
	" not fight any longer.  Such is the call of the street!
	$LF
]pre
[pre 
	" However, to truly be considered the Urban Champion, you must get the 
	$LF
	" Round Counter to total 99.  From this point on, you will be the true 
	$LF
	" Urban Champion due to the Round Counter never surpassing the number
	$LF
	" ninety-nine."
