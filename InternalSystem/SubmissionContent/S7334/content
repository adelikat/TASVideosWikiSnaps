	"Scooby-Doo: Night of 100 Frights is an early 2000s, licensed, 3D platforming game.  Lots of Scooby Snacks, Powerups and Tokens to collect, many familiar foe from the classic "Scooby-Doo! Where are You?" cartoon to take down, and surprisingly metroidvania style progression.  Scooby and the gang visit this spooky mansion known as Mystic Manor, where Daphne's friend Holly, invites them to solve the mystery of the disappearance of her uncle.  As the gang enters the manor, they all mysteriously disappear, leaving Scooby-Doo all alone.  It's up to Scooby-Doo to find his friends and solve the Mystery behind the disappearance of the professor.

	"Scooby-Doo: Night of 100 Frights is primarily a third-person game with action elements. The player controls the title character Scooby-Doo. The primary goal of the game is to hunt for the gang after they go missing at the mysterious Mystic Manor. Scooby has several abilities in the game as well as many inventions he finds on the grounds of the mansion to aid him in his search.

	"This Tool Assisted Speedrun is a 100% run of the game.  The goal of 100% in this game is collecting every Scooby Snack (around 6,700ish), collecting all 20 monster tokens, obtaining all the inventions (the powerups of the game), defeating each boss, triggering the final cutscene after defeating Mastermind, and entering every room in the game at least once.

	"Throughout the run, you'll see Scooby walking on water, jump out of bounds, stand on hundreds of invisible walls, manipulate RNG from boss fights to his advantage, zoom through stages in a breeze, and warp anywhere he wishes from the menu.

	"This TAS was created by Harsh, played on USA Version 1.0 (Disc 00), run on a modified version of Dolphin Lua Core + TASStudio, with no specific emulator settings.  The modified version of the Dolphin I use is required to run the DTM file without breaking the TAS file.  You can download here:

	"This modified build contains support a trick heavily utilized in the run known as Pause Storage.  Pause storage is an exclusive glitch only possible in the GameCube version of the game that allows Scooby to warp from any level in the game, using the map, without the use of a warp gate. In this run, the trick saves roughly 3 minutes of backtracking, used over 14 times.  At first glance, it looks like I'm quitting the game, and then performing some strange menu stacking.  What's actually happening is that on console, if you disconnect your controller at the same time you press YES to quit the game, the game freaks out, plays a very loud noise, and then when you plug the controller back in and hold START, it opens the menu back.  One difference is that when you go into the Map, instead of taking you to the actual Map in the game, it opens up a Warp Gate version of the map, while the other menu is displayed on screen.  You've essentially performed menu stacking.

	"In the TAS, I ran a script made by HDBSD, to basically disconnect the controller and reconnect fast.  I then use the fast menu/mashing scripts to perform absurdly fast menu-ing.  One limitation to this trick is that you cannot go to ANY level you want, you can only warp to levels with a warp gate that you have previously activated.

	"While this trick works perfectly fine by normal gameplay means, the DTM file format unfortunately does not support controller unplug tricks such as this.  As a result, my friend modified that Dolphin build to support DTM Playback with the trick on it, using scripts.  All scripts, DTM file, movie, and specific Dolphin build are included in the zip file and must be used in order to run the movie file without it breaking.

	"With the major glitch out of the way, you'll often see me frame perfect hit enemies quite a lot.  A frame perfect hit is when I charge at an enemy and bash then, without triggering the stop animation, and keep moving.  I utilize this with enemies, bosses and even switches.  A few other TAS exclusive tricks can be seen within the first 2 minutes of the run.  I perform a trick known as Hedge Key Early, where I stand on specific collisions on a tree to obtain a key to enter the Hedge Levels without needing the double jump.  This trick is extraordinarily difficult to perform on consoles due to the lack of reaction time a human will have when landing on the collisions.  Afterward, I enter the Hedge Level and perform what is known as a Lag Clip.  This Lag Clip allows me to enter what is an in-game shortcut only accessible from the opposite side, early, and as a result, I can obtain the Helmet invention early.  Getting this invention early completely changes the routing from a normal run where we'd obtain the Double Jump, and then play through a series of levels to get the powerup.  The Lag Clip is performed by simply running at the gate at a specific angle, and then mashing Pause and A to lag the game, thus allowing Scooby to clip through.  This is the only instance of a Lag Clip utilized in the run.

	"Most of the other glitches are walking on water, jumping on invisible collisions, jumping through walls, and even utilized the skid move to attain extra jump height or sometimes lower the height.    Finally, a few death abuses are utilized in the run in order to skip cutscenes and reduce backtracking.  The most infamous death abuses in this game are at the Coffin Stage (Gloom & Doom Down in the Tomb Part 2), where getting snacks is entirely RNG dependent.  In order to get the other snacks, death abusing is required to rest the room, and hit the switches to collect other boxes.

Afterward, there is 8 minutes of cutscene and credits, and my verifying that I 100%'d the game by saving post credits and loading my save file on the title screen.
