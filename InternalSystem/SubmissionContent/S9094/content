	"Totally Spies! 3: Secret Agents is a 2007 Nintendo DS game based on the French Animated show of the same name which I have not seen. This is the 3rd game in the portable Totally Spies series and it is very different compared to its predecessors. This game had a completely different developer from the previous two games and it never made its way to the US. This game is a 2D platformer/beat em up with light puzzle elements. The game has a total of 5 levels with each level being fairly long. You play as the three spies: Sam (the 
	[del 
		"best
	]del
	" green one), Clover (the red one) and Alex (the yellow one) who each have their own gadgets. On paper, this game sounds a lot more promising than the previous 2 games but in reality, this game is not good. While the previous games suffered from having too much variety, this game has the exact opposite problem. The gameplay is more or less exactly the same throughout the entire game and by level 2, you've already seen all the gadgets you get to use. The game has forced, unnecessary touch screen controls and it has an extremely tedious combat system which I can best describe as glorified connect the dots. There are a lot of fights in this game and they take up a lot of time. On the positive side however, the soundtrack is really good (if you are experienced with ripping DS soundtracks, this game's soundtrack isn't available online and it really deserves to be preserved outside the game) and in this TAS, we do not have to engage with the combat system a single time. These girls have a ball to go to. They don't have time to fight bad guys.

As the game was only released in Europe/Australia, the game does have a language select with six options. I think Dutch might be marginally faster than English although I am not fully certain. I did check although I will admit that I did not check extremely thoroughly. Every other language seemed definitively slower from what I checked. I kept the game in English as it was the language I made the TAS in and I think it would be more entertaining for a majority of viewers.

	"All three spies play exactly the same with the only difference being the gadgets they possess. Whichever spy you will want to use will depend on what gadgets you need to use. Unfortunately, unnecessarily switching spies can lose time. More specifically, the first time you switch spies in a section, it will lose a frame. This means that for the most part, I avoid unnecessary character switching (if there were no consequences, you'd see Sam a lot more in the run). I do still sneak in a few unnecessary character switches in however.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"As the spies, you can play as them either in their disguises or their spy suits. The disguises are completely useless. You move significantly slower, you can't use gadgets and you can't attack. All you can do in the disguises is pose. The only time they are even "needed" is in the stealth sections but you always have other, faster ways to get through the stealth sections. The game forces you into Alex's disguise when you start a level or load the game and that is the only time the disguises are needed in the run Even the act of switching to the disguises loses time although despite this, I do still switch to Sam's disguise in a couple of levels for entertainment.

	"Attacking is normally useful for fighting enemies but in this TAS, it is almost useless. There is one room where attacking is useful and that's it. You have three attacks and whichever one you get is random. You have a quick roundhouse kick (which is active for a much shorter amount of time than the other two attacks) and you have a considerably longer slice kick and front flip. The attack you get can be manipulated by your timing and controller inputs. Attacking flat out loses time as it slightly lags the game but I do still sneak in a few extra attacks at points.

[div class=p 
	"This game has a lot of enemies you are supposed to fight. Normally, the only way you are supposed to skip a fight is by using certain gadgets (mainly Clover's Smoke Bombs or Alex's Ice Potion) but there is a way to skip fights without using any gadgets (at least if the enemy is facing forwards). If you run up to an enemy so they run at you, turn around and jump, you can squeeze in a full height jump. The game normally heavily reduces your jump height and prevents you from moving horizontally when you are close enough to an enemy but this radius is significantly smaller if you are facing away from the enemy. If you perform this correctly, you can run straight past the enemy after landing. This can be done against many enemies and it saves an astronomical amount of time throughout the run. It is often faster to do fight skips than it is to use gadgets to avoid the enemies which is great as it allows you to save the gadgets for when you really need them. It even works against the bosses as the devs just left the trigger to finish the bosses always active. When doing fight skips, I move backwards for one frame and then turnaround the next frame. Another thing to note about fight skips is that if Alex has her jet boots, you can jump and then immediately double jump the next frame (which works as you have 5 separate jump buttons) which allows you to perform fight skips 6 frames faster which is naturally beneficial. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The main downside with fight skips however is that it can only really be done if the enemy is facing forwards. If the enemy is facing backwards, it is either impossible or extremely finnicky and slow depending on how the back turned enemy behaves. I always use other methods to avoid back turned enemies.

	"OK, here we have the first insane glitch in the run. When you use Clover's Butterfly, you normally cannot move. The gadget is seemingly useless as all it does is that it lets you look around. However, if you crouch or crawl at any point while using it, the game lets you move while using the butterfly. Clover will amusingly just slide across the floor without actually moving, hence the name of the trick. This is very broken for a simple reason. If you look up while Clover sliding, it can completely remove the collision of various objects. This allows for cutscene skips, instant fight skips, stealth section skips, door clips and floor clips. This is naturally very powerful, allowing you to breeze through all sorts of normally slow sections as well as skip detours.

[div class=p 
	"The downside with Clover sliding however is that it does not work everywhere. Depending on the camera position and other potential factors, it will not work in some areas.

	"This is perhaps the most wild trick in this game and it is not RTA viable. This trick works with Sam's Scanner and Clover's butterfly. If you select one of the aforementioned gadgets and then on the very next frame, you drag the stylus to select one of the characters, you will select that character and it will instantly activate a gadget. If you select Sam, you will get the scanner, if you select Clover, you will get the butterfly and if you select Alex, that will also give you the butterfly. This glitch will not only activate the gadgets near instantly but you also gain full control over your character. You do have to use the needed gadgets at least once while the game is powered on however as if you try and do this bug when the gadgets are not loaded into RAM, it will crash the game. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"With Sam, the glitch is quite useful as it allows you to instantly use the scanner and have full control. The scanner normally has a chunk of startup but with this bug, almost all of the startup is eliminated, allowing you to activate switches from a distance immediately. Having full control also allows gives you leniency to start the scanner from a distance and do a few wild sequences. Amusingly, depending on what direction you are pointing the scanner, Sam will do a bunch of different animations. You can get the pushing animation, a kick animation, her disguise pose (which is avoided as it loses a bunch of time) and even what I believe is an otherwise unused teetering animation. It is quite a neat bug. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"With Clover/Alex, the bug may not seem too crazy at first. It cuts out the startup of the butterfly which can be helpful but it otherwise has the same effect as Clover sliding, just slightly less optimal (when the lower startup isn't needed) and with you being able to jump. What is crazy about this bug however is that if you do this bug in level 5 (using Sam's scanner and then switching to Clover/Alex), it will still give you the butterfly, even though you are not supposed to have the butterfly in level 5. This is very busted as you can use the butterfly to skip fights faster and clip through doors which you would normally not be able to do without this glitch.

This means that you could finish/quit after section 8 and it will basically be the same as just beating the game. For this TAS, I decided to play through the ending cutscene and then watch the credits to finish the run. I felt that was the most complete and entertaining way to end the run.

	"And that is my TAS for Totally Spies! 3: Secret Agents finished in 28:28 (27:37 RTA). This run was quite a ride. After TASing the first game, I wasn't sure if I wanted to TAS the 2nd game or 3rd game but I am glad I chose this game because this run ended up being wild, much more so than the second game. When I started, I had no idea just how busted this game was. I knew about a few things which I had found while routing an RTA speedrun but the crazier things in the run were things I did not know about until working on this TAS. I did not think a sub 30 minute time would happen but here we are.

	"I am very happy with how this run turned out. The time isn't as low as it can be. I alluded to this many times but there were a handful of speed/entertainment trade offs in the run. The total amount of time I lost to this is hard to say but my guess is maybe 20 frames at the most? It isn't a lot of time though. It is also possible that execution may not be 100% perfect in specific areas, there could potentially be more lag reduction and there could be more strats which I did not find but overall, I am very happy with how the run turned out. I know the game is not particularly fast paced and it isn't the craziest run out there but I was pleasantly surprised with what this game's run had to offer and it would be way, way more dull if the key exploits were not possible. The combat system in this game is terrible and it is a miracle that you do not have to do a single fight. This run would be so much longer if you had to do the fights and it would not be as enjoyable to watch. Still, I am hoping that this run will at least entertain fans of the show and those who have nostalgia for the game and possibly even those of you who don't fall into either category.

	"Anyway... Based on the submission notes, this run seems quite well planned and executed.  There's nothing in this run that visually stands out as blatantly sub-optimal, though I had two main curiosities (that I, frankly, don't have time to fully test): Firstly, I noticed that damage is sometimes taken, but the player's health was rarely decreased to 1 heart.  So, I am curious if taking damage elsewhere might provide opportunity for improvement.

	"Secondly, the inputs in some areas appear to be simply tapping a button/stylus every other frame in order to progress through a section (often dialogue/cutscene).  It's possible that an 'off' frame in some of these sections might actually be the ideal frame on which to actively push the button/tap the screen to progress; meaning that there theoretically may be a few more frames that could be saved over the course of the run.  I'd encourage SuperSqank to find the specific frame which most optimally progresses the game for future TAS submissions, instead of using auto-fire or chunks of alternating inputs.  Painting a section with alternating inputs in TAStudio can be useful to identify the region where the ideal frame is located, but it doesn't take much more effort to then find the specific ideal frame for the input.

	]em
	"  The unnecessary character swapping, disguise swapping, and extra attacks that add frames to the run sound relatively minimal; but there also isn't much viewer response to this run in the first place regarding entertainment.  So eliminating these things in a run with any future improvements could bring the time down even further (however minimally).  Regardless, these aren't enough of a slowdown to reject this run.
