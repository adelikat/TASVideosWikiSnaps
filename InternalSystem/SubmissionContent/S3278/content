	"In sfa1 the first four characters you fight are semi random, basically there are two different sets, I wanted to play with Rose and Guy, and the first three Rose fights on this path will skip three Guy fights.

	"In the second ken fight what happens is, Ken gets hit by a ground normal on the same frame he blocks a shadow. Because ground moves can't be air blocked, this makes him take full damage from the normal but still block the shadow.

	"The way redizzies works in this game is, once a character becomes dizzy the next thing that hits him won't cause any stun, but after that he takes stun like normal. So any combo that can stun and still do an extra hit can also redizzy.

	"In most street fighter games supers don't cause any stun, in sfa Guy's are an exception and do a very small amount of stun.

	"There is no damage scaling in this game, but damage and stun values are slightly random.

	"Guy's s.HK doesn't have a push box for part of it, so in some situations he can pass through the opponent.

	"The way Juggles work in this game is, a character can be hit by a move with juggle potential as long you hit them before they start falling. Roses shadows have a high juggle potential, Guy's punch super and his tatsu have some too.

	"Sodom has a detached crouching hit real when hit by a light attack.
	$LF
	"That's why I manipulate him into crouching at 5:23 and hit him with a bunch of jabs.

	": This is one of those videos which is ill suited for this audience. As demonstrated by error1 and Greenalink, there is a deep understanding for the game's fan base. However, it is hard for the general audience to see anything other than random hits and occasional combos. Good technical achievement (as far as I can understand, from the posts) but it is a poor game choice. Rejecting.
