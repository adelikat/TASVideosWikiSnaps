	": This is one of those videos which is ill suited for this audience. As demonstrated by error1 and Greenalink, there is a deep understanding for the game's fan base. However, it is hard for the general audience to see anything other than random hits and occasional combos. Good technical achievement (as far as I can understand, from the posts) but it is a poor game choice. Rejecting.
