	"Kirby: Canvas Curse is a 2005 Nintendo DS game where the player has to use a Nintendo DS stylus to draw rainbow lines as a main way to make Kirby move. Lines drawn around Kirby can increase the speed, while the copy abilities used in this game were mostly useless since the dashing and drawing of the line make the game go faster. In this glitchless run, this game was done without any glitches and did not use a line glitch or an out-of-bounds glitch. The second version of the submission improved this run by 38 seconds.

		"Kirby: Canvas Curse
	]em
	" is a spin-off game of the Kirby series where Kirby is turned into a ball and a Magical Paintbrush appears to draw a line to move Kirby using a Nintendo DS stylus. Although this game had more modes, the any% run only featured a story mode run of twenty-one levels, six bosses, and one final boss. No medals were collected in this run, nor were the big switches. The glitchless run eliminates all the time-saving glitches used on the main stages, although the Paint Roller stage contained invisible lines drawn to make a shape. After getting into the goal door of each stage, I restarted the game unless it was the last stage of the level (the stages can be played in any order in the level). The three boss stages take place after the three stages of the level are cleared, and can be played twice, with the second visit getting more difficult. Some parts of the run involve Kirby with copy abilities, like Ghost Grounds, where I must use Burning for 2/3 of the stage. The RTA timing is 54:54.56 and the in-game time is 49 minutes. After the epilogue plays after defeating Drawcia Soul, the credits roll out.

The second part of Growth Grasses is a fully vertical portion of the stage where I have to dash and use a line as well as tap on the clouds so Kirby can go through. Once he reaches the bottom, he grabs the Spark ability by drawing a line similar to the Ravine Road and defeats the mid-boss by both using the ability and tapping on bombs multiple times. The last part involved dashing and drawing the line to avoid the second portion of the gray zone, where I cannot draw in this area, and taking a shortcut near the goal door by grabbing a 1-up.

The second part is a short part where Kirby can navigate the door in darkness without lighting the lantern. The third part involves Kirby firing two different cannons: one to get the second cannon down, and the other to move on to the fourth part. This part is a vertical level, using the fan to go up and avoid the fires, then draw lines to get to the door leading to the final part. Fortunately, the final part is short, requiring a single line to be drawn.

	"I chose stage 3: Paletto Polis because of another auto scroller on the last part of the stage. The first part avoided the usage of a moving platform, so I drew Kirby multiple lines to get to the top. In the second part, I have to open three colored gates and several switches. The first two colored gates involve a gray zone, and the final colored gate is near the door to the last part. The first portion of the auto scroller is similar to GloriousLiar’s run. Note that during the auto scroller, the x position speed slows down at the halfway mark, so I have to draw a line to keep the auto scroller moving.

In the second part, I have to deliberately damage Kirby because there is a short cutscene when the tap block is moving in the direction, and the lasers are in the gray zone. The final part is a combination of tap cannons in a gray zone and the usage of a line to draw in a vertical section of this part.

In the second part, I was involved in a semi-auto scroller part where Kirby was in a gray zone and a stopping floor, separated by a secret part. After that, the right half of the stage has a bit more freedom, but the portion after the pipe contains a series of stopping floors, so I wait for one, and dash through the remaining stopping floors to avoid going back, and the final part has a series of colored switches to reach the goal door.

	"Mad Mechanism featured an auto scroller on the first part of the stage with the third-layer ground going up and down on some occasions, so I tried to avoid getting crushed. The second part is another semi-auto scroller because I have to pick the correct path in a gray zone before fighting the mini-boss, which is to put the bombs near the switches to open the door leading to the final part. The final part featured lasers I had to cover, then avoid the electrical blocks when going up, since this part looked like a spiral. In the final section, the goal door appeared and disappeared randomly, so I drew a line into the goal door with some RNG manipulation.
