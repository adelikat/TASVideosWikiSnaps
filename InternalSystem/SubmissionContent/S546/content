	"Here is my second attempt at a timeattack for Magical Quest Starring Mickey Mouse. This version is over three minutes faster than its predecessor, partly due to tighter routes and gameplay, but mostly due to the fact that you can skip all dialogue (which Kyrsimys reminded me of).  The game is a basic YB platformer where Mickey searches for his dog Pluto using an array of special suits. This game has the most pessimistic guide character in any game I have ever played. "You won't be able to get your dog back. Save yourself."  It's a good thing you won't have to listen to him this time.

	"For the most part, the levels are straightforward. Running is faster than walking (duh), and so using declines to gain speed is best. Jumping conserves speed, so whenever I'm on flat land or on an incline, I'll use this technique to save speed. I take the occasional hit to save time, but since every level only warrants two hits until death, you wont see much of that. Each boss fight was done differently/faster this time, and you'll notice it if you watched the first movie.

		" Level 6-2: Obviously faster to fall so many screens, take a hit, and walk to the exit.  The walls are instant kill, so they are no good, and the only well placed enemy was the one I hit.
