	"Pitfall II: The Lost Caverns (ピットフォールII) is the sequel to Pitfall and was released for a variety of systems during the mid-1980s including the SG-1000 in 1985. It was also ported to Sega System 1 arcade hardware by Sega. Gameplay is similar to the original game, but the levels are more maze-like.

	"Sega's version of Pitfall II was tweaked significantly from its western counterparts released for the Atari 2600, ColecoVision etc. The gameplay is largely the same, but there are many additions. These include a Lives system, mine-carts, balloons, and a final Demon boss. The increased specifications of System 1 hardware means the arcade version is much more detailed and allows the player to see more of the maze at one time. The SG-1000 version is directly inspired by the arcade game, and though cannot match the same level of graphical quality, it is arguably the nicest looking home port of the game.

	"This game is relatively simple, But based on SG1000, this should be regarded as an excellent game. There are few clearance videos related to this game. Compared with known customs clearance videos, this TAS uses a better route. In the whole game, we need to get the crown, ring and key to unlock the crystal ball. Since the position of the crown is the closest to the initial position of the game, this is the first prop that many players get. But for TAS, this is not the fastest choice. I choose to get the ring and key first, and finally get the crown, which allows me to walk less and save time. What's more, the control of luck also makes TAS faster. Stalactites falling from the sky have a certain randomness, and they can avoid being hit by stalactites through TAS. In the scene of getting the key, I controlled the fireball fired by the enemy, so that the fireball hit the balloon in the right position, making the character fall to the platform where the key is located faster, saving some time. Of course, there are some details to deal with, which will not be repeated here.
