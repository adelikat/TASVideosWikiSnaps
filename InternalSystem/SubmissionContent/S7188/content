This can be abused by doing a death abuse before the box tally finishes. Death abuse has to happen before the bonus box counter at the bottom reaches 1. The original box count is kept upon respawning from the death abuse, and the boxes continue to tally up when you respawn. Boxes that were broken after the last checkpoint will reappear. The only catch for this trick is collecting the exact number of boxes in the level; if you go over the maximum number of boxes, then the box gem does not appear at the end.
