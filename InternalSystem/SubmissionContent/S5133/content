	": After careful frame-by-frame review of the submission and some consultation with the author, I've determined that there is actually gameplay improvement in the run itself: If you pay attention to the in-game time just before the Heihachi fight, you'll see that it's 0.19 seconds lower (estimating 12 frames at 60fps) than what it is in the published run. This more than makes up for the 3-4 extra frames needed to disable the music in the first place.

It is a Vault movie, so these choices affecting entertainment is ultimately meaningless, and the choice of early input end for a real-time focused run does mesh more nicely.
