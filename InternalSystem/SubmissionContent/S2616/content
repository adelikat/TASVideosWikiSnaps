	"As my final ode to the apparently "unrealistic" era of accurate luck manipulation, I decided to do this little run as an April Fools sendoff.  Snood was a 
	[del 
		"total ripoff of Bust-A-Move
	]del
	" freeware PC game that bore a 
	[em 
		"very odd
	]em
	" resemblance to the arcade puzzle game Bust-A-Move.  This free PC game was ported to various other platforms, usually handhelds.  The Game Boy Advance version is a particularly butchered version of what was already a pretty mediocre game.

	"In this short demo, I complete eleven of the game's 24 stages in the puzzle mode in just over a minute.

[div class=p 
	"So why don't I finish all 24 levels?  Well, Level 12 is when the luck manipulator tends to glitch out and the "luck roulette" mentioned below will freeze on certain blocks for up to ten frames at a time (to get an idea of how glitched this is, there are so many blocks on screen that the number one block will move to the cannon, lag for a frame, jump back to the secondary block position and then to the cannon again, it's that bad).  Also, the puzzle layout for the rest of "Time Attack Mode" is so convoluted, it would make for an extremely boring TAS.  Besides, it's April Fools, the site's probably going to die, and I just want to get a run out there that doesn't involve Persian royalty.
