	"I'm glad this run is finally complete. Many people gave up their hope for a new Majora's Mask TAS months ago already, but after 2 years of slowly working on it, it eventually got finished. Overall, this TAS saves 44 minutes and 31 seconds over Mukki's run. This huge improvement comes from many new techniques and sequence breaks, a completely new route and better optimization.

	"For me, everything started in february 2009 when the new Majora's Mask hype started thanks to the newly discovered Fairy Fountain Wrong Warp Glitch (more information about this later on). After some months filled with even more discoveries and many long IRC conversations about route-planning with Slowking, Swordless Link told me he was burned out from TASing Majora's Mask (due to route changes he had to re-do the first 3-day cycle 3 or 4 times) and said that I should try to finish this project instead.

	"I also have to write some words about Abeshi's Majora's Mask TAS which wasn't submitted here. I'm very sorry for my reaction in the first place. Without him this TAS wouldn't be as good as it is. He finished his run at a time I was very unmotivated, I hadn't TASed anything for a few weeks so thanks to him I regained all my motivation again. But this is not just limited to the motivation, I was also able to compare times with his run which especially helped a lot at the Gyorg battle.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"In the end I ended up being 3:40 minutes quicker compared to Abeshi. I can't really tell how much time the Japanese ROM saves over the US one (the difference is less compared to Ocarina of Time) but due to the run containing many cutscenes it probably is quite a bit.

I didn't even manipulate Majora's Incarnation, it just happened on its own. I was simply damn lucky. Crouch Stab with the Broken Stick are much quicker than quick spins and can also prevent Incarnation from running away.

			"Slowking:

		" Although he didn't TAS a single input of this run, he is actually worth being mentioned as the co-author of this run. Slowking and I started planning the route together in early 2009 and kept discussing new strategies and route ideas almost on a daily basis until the day the TAS was finished. Many strategies I use in this TAS were his idea - A great example is the GBT Boss Key Skip. He checked all my WIPs, he kept motivating me all the time (this was damn necessary) and of course he has always been a cool guy to talk to. Without him, the TAS would have never been finished and would be far away from being as good as it is now.

Without him, I would have never been able to become as good at TASing this game as I am now. There are also many other reasons why I have to thank him. Whenever I needed a hex-editor, I knew he could help me and of course he also made a lot of good discoveries I made use of in this TAS such as the Infinite Superslide. On top of that the whole first 3-Day Cycle was done by him, so his huge influence on this project is still visible.
