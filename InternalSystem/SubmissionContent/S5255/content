	": There are noticeable issues with menuing all throughout the run and weird tradeoffs made for no particular reason. The game also appears to be trivial from what I've tested: Apart from going offroad or slamming into other cars/obstacles, nothing else you do seems to decrease your speed, making it easy to "optimize" each race by just steering occasionally. The upgrade "route" seems weird too, though I'm not sure if that's because said upgrades aren't able to be bought sooner or if it's actually just poor planning.

	"While there are some thoughtful steps taken to decrease the overall time, I.E intentionally disqualifying for secret bonuses, the other flaws are just too numerous to overlook. Rejecting.

	"Quick edit: If there IS anything to optimize, I doubt 4000 re-records are enough to have tested everything. For comparison: I used 1000 in my test file without even finishing the first lap of the first race.
