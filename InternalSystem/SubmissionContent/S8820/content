After running past a Technician, which makes him plant a landmine, we fire a Revenant shot that kills two Grunts, spawns a hidden Sergeant, and alerts the two Technicians on the roof. Letting the Sergeant speed up enough, we bait him right into a landmine, killing two birds with one stone. The other two are disposed of in a regular fashion. Using the two remaining Revenant bullets, we stall the Technicians just enough to get blown up with their own landmines.

	"The only truly suboptimal level in this movie at the time of writing. The main problem of this movie is that it prioritises the objective over killing all undead, while it would be far faster to do the inverse — kill as many enemies as possible first, and then go for the cargo container. Unfortunately, all attempts to implement that approach were brought to a halt by a lack of ammo, or an inconveniently positioned enemy/landmine, or some other RNG element beyond our control. Having brainstormed to no avail, I’ve decided to go with a slower but working approach. This will likely be revisited in a second revision — perhaps the RNG will be more favourable then.
