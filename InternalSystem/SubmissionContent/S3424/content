	"The battle system is pretty straight foreward. There protagonist is fairly weak, but you can summon some friends to help. There are quite a few summons available in the game, but I only get the required four. You can have multiple summons active concurrently. You can also keep recalling your summons after they lose their energy.

	"Encounters are a bit easier to manipulate, they seem to be running off and RNG that changes every 16 frames. On the world map and in early dungeons I was able to simply delay a few frames here and there to avoid encounters. In later dungeons I was able to avoid encounters by bringing up the menu.
