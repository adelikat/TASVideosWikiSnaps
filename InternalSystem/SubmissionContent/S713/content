	"Rad Racer is a racing game of the famous producer called "Square" who also made Chrono Trigger and many other top games later. The graphic is  pretty nice (for NES conditions) with changing backgrounds even during a race. It also has the best speed feeling like no other NES racing game and therefore requires extremely fast reactions. The opponent cars of each course are different, from Lamborghini, over Porsche till Mercedes (you drive the famous Ferrari or a F1-Machine). This game is extremely hard to beat on normal conditions, since there are no continues at all (if you lose in course 8 you will start in course 1 again) thats why many players couldn't beat this game completely.

	"In Course 3 and Course 8 I was exactly 1 frame to late to reach a 1 sec better time, in Course 8 I tried to redo everything as good as I could and spended the whole last day by trying to optimize this 1 stupid frame to reach a whole sec faster but without luck. But then I found out that I can manipulate the randomness a bit by pressing pause right before the finish and on this way I still managed to reach 43 sec instead of 42 in Course 8. I'm pretty sure that 44 sec is impossible (even theoretical) at least in the last course. Course 3 was to far away to redo everything afterwards so I let this one be.
