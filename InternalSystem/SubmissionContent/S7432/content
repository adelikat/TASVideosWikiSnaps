	"Based on the 3D action adventure game for PC and N64, Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine for the Game Boy Color is a top-down, "2.5D" puzzle platformer. Perhaps surprisingly given the simplicity of the target platform, the game is quite content-filled featuring 14 large levels that are rather punishing for human players as they have to complete every single one in one attempt. For that reason, I decided to examine TAS perfection for completing the game as quickly as possible.

	"The game has very simple mechanics - you can run, jump and use items on the environment. The game appears to be quite solidly programmed as I was unable to find any game-breaking glitches such as wall clipping, wrong warping, invincibility, etc. (perhaps someone in the future will have more luck). Thus, this run focuses on optimal routing and precise execution. The main sources of saving time are the following:
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		" Ladder sniping - Precise jumps from great heights that land onto ladders in order to skip climbing them down (very slow animation) and avoid fall damage.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Landing frames skip - Landing on a platform in a window of 2 frames around the apex of the apex of the jumping animation skips the landing animation frames and lets Indy to immediately continue moving after landing. This trick is used all around the game to quickly ascend upwards and every instance of it saves 13 frames.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Frame-perfect horizontal jump - By jumping at the very last possible frame, it is possible to jump across a gap that's two tiles wide while also landing on a platform that is one tile higher than the starting platform. However, this only applies to gaps in the horizontal direction (left->right or right->left). This sort of jump was clearly unintended by the developers and it some platforming sections to be simplified or skipped entirely.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Blind moving - Sometimes when a cutscene ends, you regain control Indy before the camera returns back to him. In those situations, you can save time by moving despite not being able to see where.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Minimal healing - Opening and navigating the game's inventory is very time consuming. Thus, great care was put into avoiding unnecessary damage so that healing items don't have to be used in order to finish the level. In the end, healing is used only twice during the run. In both cases, the medkit is used when the inventory is already open because a puzzle item needs to be used and the small time loss incurred is more than made up for by the time saved by using up the extra health bar (usually by skipping platforming sections by dropping straight down from great heights).

	"A template for future levels, Babylon features precise block pushing and fearless jumps. Indy has perfect air control which allows jumps around corners. Pressure plates only need to be stepped on for a single frame in order to activate. Puzzle pieces in the top part of the library can be collected mid-air which skips a landing animation and allows a perfect setup for whipping across the gaps. A ladder snipe saves time going back down from the library. In the final room, the puzzle pieces are placed down in such a way to minimize inventory navigation time.
