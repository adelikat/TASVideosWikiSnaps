Next is the section with trampolines and spiked posts; I found you can land on every spiked edge if done precisely. This cuts down on quite a bit of time alone. Then near the end I found exactly which frame to let go of the trapezes for maximum speed, letting me skip most of the following trapezes.

	"I found out here that whatever speed you jump into a ferris wheel car, you will maintain it when jumping out. This is why I do not drill into the first ferris wheel, as it would be slower than my running speed on exit. Also on this same ferris wheel, that pesky clown would NOT go away, so unfortunately I had to jump to avoid his... whatever he's throwing at me. On the section with the two ferris wheels separated by a spiked post, I drilled as early as possible as the collision for a ferris wheel car is pretty lenient in some respect. The game thinks I'm close enough to it and shoves me inside, giving me a frame that is much faster than the normal running speed.

	"Interesting level here; I remember the little trick I found at the end of the level last time, and I thought maybe I could somehow use it in other areas. I was right; at the right angle and speed, you can catch a ledge of the logs at the bottom. If running into the logs while doing this, the game seems to want to eject you out of the bottom. Since you can't drill coming off of a log, catching this ledge let's you drill, and in many areas it is faster to drill over some of the spikes. I also evaded every water pool in this same way.

On the first blade however, I somehow managed to jump under it. It worked out in the end so I decided to leave it that way. The real achievement in this level for me was the ending section. It took a while but I figured out a good way to save a lot of frames.

First of all, running and jumping on one of the wires was frustrating, as the third jump never seemed to want to land with the running animation. I had completed the level like this, but decided on a whim to start the entire level over, and thankfully I did. On the second time around I finally managed to get the running animation on the third jump. Secondly, the "walking spikes" at the end of the level are extremely hard to dodge, and unfortunately I had to slow down to drill over it. It still turns out quite a bit faster in the long run.

I have to point this out again because it was pretty odd; the final boss did not want to appear at the very top because apparently I was too fast. This is why I delay before reaching the last platform, so that he'll spawn.

It was revealed to me that drilling left and right are not the same speed (Right at 3+255/256, and left at -3+255/256 should explain why the speeds are not the same. This applies to any movement as well, as walking to the left at -3+0/256 is slower than walking to the right at 3+0/256. This is why the maximum speed to the left is set at -6 while to the right it is set at 5 (subspeeds vary).
