	"In the distant future of 1999, the human race is facing a great threat to its survival. Reports of violent human abductions and horrific experimentation have created a world-wide atmosphere of fear. Mass public hysteria has only served to expose Earth's impotence against a vastly superior technology. The decision was made to establish a covert independent body to combat, investigate and defeat the alien threat.

	"X-COM UFO Defense was released on multiple platforms upon its initial release, including: DOS, PSX, Amiga and CD32. An open-source clone of the game titled OpenXcom commenced in 2010 and continues to be maintained by volunteers. Although the modernised GUI allows for fastest completion time, the lack of a finished release version was a strong deterrent when other ports were readily available. The Amiga and CD32 ports are clearly the worst options as they suffer from abysmal loading times while adding nothing to gameplay.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"DOS and PSX each provide some good arguments to be considered the preferred TAS platform. Unfortunately the initial DOS release suffers from a bug that reverts the game difficulty to Beginner after the first Battlescape mission, which would result in less interesting gameplay and violate the guideline of playing on the hardest difficulty. Although this was fixed in rereleases and despite the DOS version playing much faster than its counterpart, I decided to use the PSX port as fewer arbitrary restrictions were required to set a standard for emulation. Furthermore, the PSX port introduced new glitches that enhance viewability, uses updated music and graphics, and also includes exclusive cutscenes which sets a more defined goal for completion.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Although the PSX port was compatible with the PlayStation Mouse, I placed an additional restriction on myself to exclusively use the standard gamepad for all game input. This was done primarily because BizHawk does not officially provide mouse-support, but also because there would not be a substantial difference in the time required to beat the game due to optimised navigation.

[div class=p 
	"The game difficulty has been set to Superhuman, which is the hardest of the five available difficulty settings. Easier difficulty settings would allow the game to be completed slightly quicker due to less time spent on alien movements but was ignored in order to conform to tasvideos guidelines on playing the most difficult setting, especially for a strategy game. Incidentally, Beginner would require the most time  of all, as the designated 'special' spawn locations reserved for higher ranked aliens would require both Floater Leaders to spawn in an inconvenient location.

It is also theoretically possible to capture the aliens needed for interrogation in fewer than four turns, but it should be noted that the board used in this TAS is much faster than any alternative I was able to find.
