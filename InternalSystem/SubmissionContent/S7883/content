Additionally, which set of three item wheels is available is dependent on the players position in the race (e.g. 2nd vs 6th) and the amount of laps (measured in half increments) the player has completed.

	"Arguably the most important time saving trick of this run is 
	[b 
		"Lap Skip
	]b
	". As the name implies, this is when a significant portion of the track is skipped such that when the player respawns the lap counter has incremented. The following is quick summary followed by a link to a more verbose explaination. The game tracks the players last physical location on the track which it uses when respawning the player. Separately, the game tracks the players progress along the track and, crucially, this will update even if the player isn't physically on the track (i.e. above it). Therefore, if the player can stay off the track for a significant portion (over 1/2) of a lap 
	[em 
		"and
	]em
	" cross over the track to update the players progress then a lap skip can occur. This happens when the players position updates over 1/2 of a lap in a single frame. A more in depth explanation with diagrams/examples can be found on my github here:
