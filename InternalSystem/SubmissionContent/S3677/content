	"The Goonies II (グーニーズ2 フラッテリー最後の挑戦 Gūnīzu Tsū: Furatterī Saigo no Chōsen?, The Goonies II: The Fratellis' Last Stand) is an adventure game developed and published by Konami for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was released on March 18, 1987 in Japan, November 1987 in North America, and on December 19, 1988 in Europe.It is a sequel to the first Famicom Goonies game, which was only available in North America on Nintendo Vs. System and PlayChoice-10 arcade units. This led some people to believe that it was supposed to be a sequel to a first Goonies videogame that was widely released. The game's story centers on Mikey. His friends, the Goonies, have been kidnapped by the Fratellis, an Italian family of small-time crooks and counterfeiters. Mikey must rescue all six of his friends and free a captured mermaid named Annie who did not appear in the film.

	"1-Raison for use J version: If i use the J version i can save more frames than using the U version.Why?. In the doors,the informations writing is faster in the J version.For exemple:the first door,when i get the Hammer,the time for writing information is about 1 seconde but in the U version is about 2 secondes.By changing the version I save 800 frame (comparing with the nicovideo run)
