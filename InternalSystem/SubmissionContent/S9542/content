	"This run aims at completing the normal ending (called Virus Ending) of the game. This run does not use an OOB glitch that could be used to finish the game by going from the first boss directly to the last boss by navigating OOB (best unassisted speedrun is 6 minutes). This run also uses the Easy difficulty, which gives more starting health, hence giving the player more possibilities to take damage to save time.

We can inscrease the size of the hook by shooting while falling, so that we are lower when the hook connects.

Some RNG manipulation was performed so that he starts swinging with the good angle and velocity to reach the top left when we reach it also.

	"Fun fact: in the early version of the game, the first terminal was randomly spawning on the left or right of the screen. If it were to spawn on the right, speedrunners would loose about 8 seconds because the fight would end on the right of the screen. After complains to the game developper, we modified the game so that the first terminal would always spawn on the left.

In the old (Multimedia Fusion) version of the game, getting this item was even easier, because the v-dash was reseting after a screen transition. This item will be useful as an extra source of damage against the remaining bosses.

There is just one possibility to speed it up: during the first phase, it may land weirdly, acting as if it was landing twice, so it skips a jump. It is not known exactly how it works, it is loosely tied to the landing position but has other unknown factors. I only managed to trigger it once during the fight, and nobody ever witnessed it happening twice.
