	"About that unknown skill, my English is not good, please name it for me. I got the idea before I saw andrewg and adelikat's Submission #2353, it's one of my original skill. It only can be use here, and it really works. It's a small bug that sometimes happends, I don't know why, but it made Mario walk on the ground with no movement. I found it about 5 months ago, but never used it before.
