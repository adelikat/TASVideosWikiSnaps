	"Buster Brothers, also known as Pang, is a well-known series of puzzle games. This is the first release of the series, ported to the Game Boy. I decided to pick the GB version for TASing because the levels are simpler, which makes the run shorter and easier to optimize.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The plot is rather simple. Some "bubbles" are attacking the Earth and you must travel across the world busting them. The game has 50 stages divided into 17 locations: Mt. Fuji, Mt. Keirin, Emerald Temple, Australia, Taj Mahal, Leningrad, Paris, London, Barcelona, Athens, Egypt, Kenya, New York, Maya, Antartica and Easter Island. It offers the option to start from Leningrad and thus skip 18 levels. However, I ignored this and went through all the levels to show the entire game.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Each stage can have breakable, unbreakable, icy or invisible platforms, ladders or frozen ground. There are always bubbles to be busted. When hit, they lose all momentum and break into two smaller parts, which go in opposite directions, getting hit by them will make you die. The bubble only disappears when you hit their smallest piece. Eventually, when hitting a larger bubble, an item may drop, it can be one of the following:

[h4 id=Tricks/glitchesusedinthemovie 
	" Tricks/glitches used in the movie
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The only way I found to manipulate item drops is by dying, which is out of question, since it wastes a lot of time. Because of this, drops in a stage occur when you separate a bubble and only if there's no item in the screen, the type of the item is the same no matter which bubble you bust.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"A lot of the time, I have no items on and can't shoot a second wire until the previous one has disappeared. The most immediate trick then is to move into position for the next shot while the previous one is on its way to the bubble and try to shoot bubbles at their lowest positions. Another trick is to get the wire to hit the bubble in its bottom since it makes it explode some frames sooner sometimes, this is useful when I need to get another shot really fast. However, it can't be applied when I need to move at the earliest possible moment because this trick often requires delaying the shot. I try to keep movement to a minimum, because it may cause lag.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Most strategies rely on getting the Dynamite fast because it reduces the number of shots to get rid of all bubbles. Another useful items are the Vulcan, that can be fired a lot faster; the Clock, which makes the bubbles stop making them easier to hit and gives Pang invincibility, so you don't need to worry about dodging bubbles; and the Shield, which allows killing a bubble without shooting and often saves time by running into a bubble instead of dodging it. The hourglass can actually waste time, grabbing it while having less than 100 seconds remaining makes me waste 30 frames on the score counting screen. Sometimes though, it was better to get it because it's necessary for other items to drop and/or because there wasn't other alternative.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There's also a glitch with the platforms, the collision detection is completely messed up, which makes the platform a lot wider than it looks. It may sometimes stop items from hitting the ground, making them unobtainable. It's possible to make an item stop over thin air because of this. Another trick also exists, if you hit a bubble when it's too close to the platform, the item will go through the platform. I use this a lot to receive item from bubbles that are trapped.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There's also an interesting trick with Pang's invincibility. Apparently, the game only runs collision checks on the edges of the hitbox. Because of this, when Pang is invincible from the shield or a level respawn and a bubble enters his body, he'll only die when the bubble gets out. I abuse this by grabbing a shield and moving Pang against two bubbles that are near. One of them is destroyed, while the other can be shot inside Pang's body. With this, I avoid dodging a bubble and save time.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Another nasty glitch exists. While in a ladder, you can shoot a wire, but can move freely after that without the knockback animation. However, when Pang gets out of the ladder and returns to his normal stance, he does the knockback animation, even long after the shot was done. A similar effect occurs in levels with frozen ground. When Pang is in the air and you move him to the side and do a shot just before hitting the ground, he shoots and stays still in his position. However, he conserves the gained momentum somehow, meaning that he'll slide back if you move him the opposite direction and accelerate a lot when going to the same side. I had to do an unoptimal shot at a level in Leningrad to avoid the effects of this bug.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"At 13-39, my first shot is glitched. It breaks a big bubble into one medium and one small. With this, that shot counted as three. This glitch could greatly improve other levels, but I failed to make it work in other occasions, so I ignored it.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"My entertainment trade-off is in the last level. Because there's no input after it to clear the game, it may be possible to lock the bubbles in the lower-left portion, leave the game with no input when a crab will eventually drop and kill all bubbles. However, I don't believe people would like to see Pang dying/waiting minutes for the bubbles to be killed and finished that level like all others.

	"With this, I hope to make an acceptable run of this great game. The game is quite hard to TAS and I won't be surprised if some levels can be done significantly faster with different strategies. I did my best to optimize the strategies I used though. I know that puzzle games have a great decrease in entertainment if they take too long, but I think this one was very varied and short. If it still drags on, it's possible to hex part of this run and make it start at Leningrad, doing only 32 levels. Enjoy!
