It's technically entertainment-focused but isn't getting good enough feedback to make Moons, doesn't go for max score, and due to the nature of the game it's also a toss-up as to whether or not it's non-trivial enough to even be published under our current ruleset. Given that there are more things that can be done for entertainment, I feel like a newer movie should be the one to challenge the site rules, so in the meantime, I'm rejecting this for poor feedback on an un-Vaultable run.
