				"It's possible to manipulate the monkey to not show up by delaying a jump one to two ropes before the monkey would otherwise appear.  This can (but not guaranteed to) make getting through vines faster.  This tactic is only needed once in this run.  The two monkeys that do arise are easily avoided with normal jumps.

				"On the last boulder of stage 3, I demonstrate an input glitch than allows instantaneous repositioning of the character further to the right of the screen.  Though not done here (as points weren't considered in this run), this glitch could be used to acquire a higher score by jumping/ducking a single boulder multiple times which is normally impossible.
