	"I always wanted to do a TAS of this amazing game, but I was taken aback for two reasons: (1) I would have to use libTAS+PCem to emulate its DOS version, and; (2) The RNG's effect and variability is too high to even come close to an optimal without serious manipulation.

	"The second obstacle (RNG), however, was still there. RNG determines every single important aspect of the game: how many enemies you find in each lair, its rewards, key locations, item locations and the moonstone phase. The variance in routing, and consequently the time taken to complete, is huge given two different RNG seeds. The task seemed impossible to fulfill at first.

[div class=p 
	"So I started TASing this game without a plan, trying to figure out how would I proceed with RNG manipulation. Turns out this wasn't needed in the end. The VERY FIRST seed I tried already contained a setup among THE MOST INSANEST and BESTEST possible (see explanation movie). The rest is history.

	": That was an amazingly lucky first seed found, with incredibly ideal rune placement and a fancy sword upgrade as a bonus. The video also helped show why using 4 players is faster than using any computer players, as the computer players will pick fights if someone has important items. The fighting is well executed and looked clean. Nice work, and congrats on the first accepted Amiga submission!
