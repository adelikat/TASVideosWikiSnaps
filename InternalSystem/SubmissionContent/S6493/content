	"The original run of this game has a house distribution that as far as I can tell is not achievable on console from a clean power on state (or even a first frame reset as that run has.) The reason for this is that FCEUX adds an extra power up frame that is not representative of an actual NES. This was my main motivation for making this run.

	"This game uses the DMC channel for various sound effects. Car horns, dog barks, crashes, and broken windows all produce DMC channel effects. Whenever the DMC channel is used, there is the possibility of the DMC hardware glitch being encountered. In order to give a higher chance of console verification, I avoided all of these effects whenever possible, except for car horns which are unavoidable. FCEUX does not emulate the DMC glitch.

	"However, this movie cannot be accepted to Vault either. The presence of the obstacle course prevents it from being any sort of vault category. The obstacle course can be done on any day of the week and every day of the week, it is not a one time achievement to be tracked, yet the game can still be completed without the obstacle course with essentially no difference. Either perfect deliveries every day or high score could be argued to be full completion but this run is not any of that.
