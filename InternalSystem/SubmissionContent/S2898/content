	": This game is pretty bad. They tried to make it rather detailed on a small screen with few colors, which ends up making everything hard to see and appreciate. Less detailed graphics would actually have more of a visual appeal in this case. The sound leaves much to be desired, it's almost like they ran the arcade's music and sound effects through a low quality resampler and left it at that. The speed of the game is so slow, it is annoying to watch without some sort of tempo control.

	"In terms of the run itself, it is rather repetitive, and doesn't offer much to redeem this abysmal game. The entertainment just isn't there like most of our other Mortal Kombat runs. Rejecting.
