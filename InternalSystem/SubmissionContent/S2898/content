	": This game is pretty bad. They tried to make it rather detailed on a small screen with few colors, which ends up making everything hard to see and appreciate. Less detailed graphics would actually have more of a visual appeal in this case. The sound leaves much to be desired, it's almost like they ran the arcade's music and sound effects through a low quality resampler and left it at that. The speed of the game is so slow, it is annoying to watch without some sort of tempo control.
