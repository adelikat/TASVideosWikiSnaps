	"I'm so glad that I finished this run, because I can remember thinking and feeling that it would never get done. I can remember starting it just about 6 months ago and being excited to  even be able to play it. I used to love this game when I was younger but hating to have to go through the entire game not knowing any way to go through it faster. Now that I revisited it with some tools, it was much more 
	[del 
		"excruciating
	]del
	" exciting. I know that it's improvable but only to a certain extent, with the current route at least. With the current route and tricks/glitches, runs will never sub 2 hours. They will get close, but there is only so much that can be done to reduce time lost. There is probably a relatively small timesaver in the beginning with the Whomping Willow or somewhere in another one of the spell chambers. When I come back to the game again or when it gets more attention, I'm hoping more useful glitches will be discovered. I was also a bit annoyed at a small emulation error (I'm assuming) where Harry would start "stuttering" as he was running. It happened frequently.

	"The only real techniques that I used in this run were a quick turn-like movement that I use to change directions in a matter of a few frames and skipping the dialogue boxes. The quick turn movement happens when Harry is running and I press the L-trigger and hold a different direction. It happens because pressing the L-trigger is supposed to center the camera behind Harry, but if he's running it'll make him instantly change directions. It can also be used when Harry runs and jumps off a ledge. Harry will still jump off the ledge, but pressing the L-trigger on the right frame and holding a different direction will make Harry jump in that direction but still face the same way as running off the ledge. Also, during the run, when a help box pops up, I press Z to open the menu and then close out of it to make the box go away instead of just waiting to press A. Opening and closing the menu saves time over waiting to press A.

I still think it looked neat just skipping almost all the enemies, not having to stop for them. The fight with Aragog was excellent. I was able to manipulate him so that I could attack 4 times in a row without waiting, which is very fast. I'm happy with the fight.

All the "stuttering" during the running animation didn't help either. I hope I can get some kind of early attack cycles later on.

Some parts, such as the TAS-optimized Quidditch matches and the executed sequence breaks, were especially nice to watch.  As stated in the thread though, the game is rather cutscene-heavy with considerable amounts of downtime.  Nonetheless, the effort put in here is certainly worthy of publication.
