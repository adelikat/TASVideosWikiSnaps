	"This is a movie of the strange Japanese game Lickle.  In it, you have a choice of 4 characters (human, mouse, dragon, golem) each with their own unique abilities.  The mouse is used almost constantly because of its speed and very powerful attack that can be used against some bosses.  The human form is rarely used because it has no real advantages, except being able to walk off ledges faster than the mouse.  I use the dragon to fly past almost all places where you'd normally have to wait for a platform or group of enemies to move.  I use the golem against many bosses and to walk on spikes when I have no other choice.

	"In this version, I take no damage.  A "takes damage" version could possibly be 1-2 min shorter.  I may do one of those soon.

	"If you've never played the game, you might not be too impressed with what goes on, but there are AT LEAST a dozen places where you know the game isn't supposed to be played that way (killing some bosses in just a few seconds, scaling walls with the mouse at max speed, etc. for example).
