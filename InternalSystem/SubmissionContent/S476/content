	": Even if there will be 100 people that vote yes, I am 100% sure it will not be published. At least, it's currently the fastest SMB1 run and people have seen a different way of playing this game without slowering the total time(I am talking about that 8-2 stage which in my thought was original but maybe too artistic for some serious guys). So I am gonna cancel it since it's pointless.
