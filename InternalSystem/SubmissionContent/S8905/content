My computer system had an advantage for running DDD, in that I already had some fairly large RAID arrays (with a fast hardware RAID controller) to store my DSLR photos and HDV videos, and in early 2010 was able to put my 9Ã— 750 GB drives in a RAID 0 (with 762 MB/s max transfer rate) for use exclusively by DDD, because I had moved their data onto my newer 10.5 TB RAID 5 array and hadn't yet run out of space on it (which, when that happened, would necessitate putting the older drives back into RAID 5 and returning to using their storage for its original primary purpose).

I implemented exporting of the full run of all levels to a .VBM replay file. As part of this project, I made "diagonal view / bird's-eye view" an option. At first, this was mainly because I found the "bird's-eye" view (a much more 2D view than the "diagonal" view) much more pleasant and comprehensible to watch... but unexpectedly, it turned out that "bird's-eye view" also made for an overall faster run; even though it adds 1 extra frame initially to move the selection down to this option, in the between-level screens, it results in slightly less overall lag than "diagonal view". The original TAS [and the two that followed it] used "diagonal view".

The new drives would make for a 160 TB array in RAID 6, but 200 TB in RAID 0. And I knew that once I started using it in RAID 6 for its primary purpose, it would be less optimal for DDD usage, not only due to the overhead of RAID 6, but due to the fastest area of the volume being filled up first.

Since there is no software that can convert an NTFS partition to ExFAT, this meant using PartitionGuru v4.9.5 to resize the existing partition from 200 TB to 100 TB and create a new ExFAT partition, then copy the files over to it, and use PartitionGuru to delete the NTFS partition and resize the ExFAT partition from 100 TB to 200 TB.

To migrate the DDD data, I compressed the 45.1 TiB "combined-25-223x.bin" file with 7-Zip (all the "closed-25-*.bin" files had already been compressed). I had to split the "combined-25-223x.bin" file into 6 pieces because Windows (at least Windows 7) can't memory-map files sized 16 TiB or larger, and 7-Zip relies on memory-mapping (also, this allowed rebooting / power cycling without losing all of the compression progress). Then after I'd already recombined the pieces in the new 280 TB partition, I realized that since I'd used "dd" in unbuffered I/O mode to do the splitting under Windows, the last 36184 bytes hadn't been properly carried over during the splitting process. Luckily I was able to recover the data, finding that the ending of the "combined-25-223x.bin" file from the pre-migration 200 TB RAID volume hadn't been overwritten yet (it hugely helped here that the file was only very lightly fragmented, thanks to my preallocation).
