	"Since April 1 happens to be Easter, it seemed appropriate to beat the best-selling Atari 2600 game as quickly as possible by finding an Easter egg. I play on the hardest difficulty level: Game 6 (Ultimate Yars) with Difficulty set to A.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"The bad guy is called the Qotile. The Qotile changes colour on a timer (it is not random) which counts down until the colour becomes 0x34, which turns it into the Swirl. That happens on frame 190. There is then a countdown until the Swirl attacks, which happens on frame 389. There is also a Destroyer Missile which tracks the Yar. In Difficulty A, the Zorlon Cannon destroys the Destroyer Missile (and is destroyed) instead of passing through it.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The Qotile/Swirl can only be killed by the Zorlon Cannon. In Game 6, you have to get 5 TRONs in order to fire the Zorlon Cannon, which are acquired at a rate of 1 for every piece of the shield eaten, or 2 for every frame in which Yar is touching the Qotile. You also have to touch the left side of the screen in order to load the cannon. If the Swirl is killed while it is in attack mode, an Easter Egg becomes available. During the explosion, there is a vertical line where the Qotile/Swirl died. If Yar is on that line, and in the bottom 1/3 of the screen, when the explosion disappears, the game ends and the score lists as the author's initials, forwards and backwards. (Howard Scott Warshaw = HSWWSH)

[div class=p 
	"In this run, I acquire 5 TRONs and destroy the bottom half of the shield so that I have a place to park the Yar. I rush to the left to load the cannon, then rush back to the right and get as close to the Swirl as I can. I fire on frame 313, which is the first frame where the Zorlon Cannon will hit the Swirl after it enters attack mode on frame 389. I then push down on 3 input frames to get the Yar out of the way of the Zorlon Cannon (which will otherwise kill the Yar instead of the Swirl). Since the Yar is already where it needs to be to activate the Easter egg, the Yar can then stand with its back to the Swirl like a badass and let it die 1 pixel behind it, with the Destroyer Missile 1 pixel away as well.

But for the viewer to enjoy even a full a TAS of this it takes a bit more than just watching it for the first time: you need to understand what's going on. And this game is quite complicated in that regard, so in most cases it ends up looking very impressive or incredibly boring, depending on your experience.

				" And even then, this run only plays through one level. Some years ago we decided that single-level movies shouldn't be accepted, because they don't beat the game. Why don't we want such movies? Because they don't feel like superplay anymore, and because they can be made in a proper, acceptable way instead. Single-level movies are generally not impressive, they feel abrupt and anti-climactic. So even this Easter-egg run feels like it's not showcasing anything enjoyable, just makes a point for the sake of it.
