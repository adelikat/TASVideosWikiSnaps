	"First off, I'd like to thank Hanzou, for finding a better strategy at Pro B. After shooting two enemies in pro B, the lag is virtually killed, and Hanzou's tactic shows that is actually 40 frames faster.

	"Of course I also knew about the lag, and the fact that it was stopped by shooting two enemies... but the route I had was pretty good, and first shooting 2 enemies would result in having to walk more squares. Also, the first two enemies would regenerate faster, causing trouble later on... these 2 things kept me from actually testing it. Fortunately Hanzou did, and he came to an improvement of 40 frames.
	$LF

[p 
	"I changed Hanzou's route a little, by shooting the first 2 enemies in a different order, and picking up the hearts faster. I also had to change the route in the upper part of the level a bit to luck manipulate the enemies movement. At the end, my final version of Pro B is 17 frames faster than Hanzou's, so the total improvement is 57 frames. All other levels are played equally fast as before.

	"After Randils Adventures of Lolo 2 run, he made a test movie of the pro levels. Hanzou pointed out a level that could be improved, which gave Randil the motivation to really make a pro levels run. Ever since Randil made his test movie I wanted to make a pro level run sometime, and Randils pro level run made me decide to start it.

		" 1605 frames on PROD, today, Hanzou improved Randils stategy on PROD significantly. After that, Randil made an even better improvement, and then Hanzou saved a few squares on that version. I knew a small improvement at the beginning, but after having done that small change, I realized the entire enemy movement and such were different. So basically, Randil's and Hanzou's tactics were very good, but useless to me, since the whole level had to be played different. At the end, I managed to save a whopping 1605 frames on this level alone, making this level about 300 frames faster than the latest version Hanzou posted.
