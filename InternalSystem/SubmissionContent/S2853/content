	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"After you touch the coin, there is a 1 frame window where you can perform some actions, just after the game unfreezes. Inside this window, one of the buttons you can press (if you have both kongs) is A, to team up. But if you're already in a team up formation, pressing the A Button will dismount the other kong, allowing you to keep control of the game, it's useful if the exit of the said bonus is far from you and you can suicide inside that bonus, otherwise it's useless as you get stuck after that. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If a stage is already cleared, you have 1 frame opportunity to collect the coin, and press Start then Select, while still collecting the bonus/DK coin. This is used to save time with some new routes.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"When rolling into a door, you’ll get caught at a certain distance, and your speed will become pretty slow as you enter the door. The left and right buttons are what activates this animation; by not holding either left or right, you can move into the doorway, and enter it faster. This is done when rolling, as the animals, etc. and it's used in all doors now.

	" The Camera

	" The Big Jump
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"If you have both kongs and take damage, the other kong will jump higher by just holding the B button. But, if you do some other things first it will jump really high: thrownig the kong upwards then taking damage before the other kong lands, or throwing it to a blast barrel then taking damage makes the other kong jump higher, but by entering a swimable water, switching the kongs and then taking damage, makes you go incredibly high!

And now that this run is completed, I guess I've achieved my goal. Though the rerecord count says otherwise, reusing the current run saved a lot of work.
