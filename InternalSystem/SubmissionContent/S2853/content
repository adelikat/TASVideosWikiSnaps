	"This run started as a concept some months ago, back then I was trying to help speed up the TAS process. By reusing an existing run, it would be possible to improve runs in weeks, with less effort. And now that this run is completed, I guess I've achieved my goal. Though the rerecord count says otherwise, reusing the current run saved a lot of work. If you already watched the current run, you can easily recognize where it's reused or redone, so, there's no need to explain what's done by me, Comicalflop or NxCy.
