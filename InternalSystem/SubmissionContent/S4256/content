	"Hello! It's me, Yushiro! I know I haven't actually submitted a movie like everyone else, but if my personal life weren't so busy I'd do a lot more with my time... Anyway, here it is, my first shot at a %100 TAS, with Kirby Super Star on the SNES! Now keep in mind, even though the Spring Breeze Kirby-sode is only four levels long, it STILL reaches the credits, which means it is a complete run, and it's the first complete one I've ever done! I'm not really going for a trophy or anything, so what you guys do with this run is up to you. Now, some explanations:

	"- I would have done this run without a CPU player at my side, but as I've found, bosses such as Krackle are done much faster if you let the Helper do some of the work and then wear him down a little yourself. Besides, the AI seems to "know" that I'm doing a TAS because it does a lot of 2P-TAS-like stuff sometimes, which is a little creepy...

	"- Dedede was the easiest with Bomb Kirby and my helper. Come on, who can survive a rush of bombs being thrown at their face?

	": This seems to be a test movie, because it doesn't beat any existing records, and has noticeable sub-optimality, showcased by the rerecord count. Rejecting.
