	"Stage 3: The previous run used Fire Viper to damage the boss during an otherwise-invulnerable period. This run uses the same strategy but can attack roughly twice as quickly due to the right-hand glitch mentioned above. This saves roughly 240 frames.

	"Stage 4: The Stage 4 boss fight has been entirely reworked, saving roughly 65 frames. The boss has 1,022 health. The boss can take increased damage depending on where he is hit by a projectile, I think due to overlapping hitboxes for his head, neck, and upper body. The previous strategy used the Wave attack, which deals 12 damage as frequently as every 10 frames. With the heightened damage from precise placement, 20 or more damage per shot is possible. The Fire Viper deals up to 120 damage every 13 frames. Unfortunately it lacks the range of the Wave projectile, but the increased damage more than compensates for this. It may be possible to use both for a quicker kill, but my initial testing indicated this was not actually worthwhile. The strategy present in my submission scores 30 damage from each hit while his head is out of range, then kills him in the minimal number of hits from that point (not always scoring the full 120 damage, but scoring enough that even if all the hits were 120 no hits could be eliminated from the fight). 2 frames are lost waiting for the boss to re-position his head.
