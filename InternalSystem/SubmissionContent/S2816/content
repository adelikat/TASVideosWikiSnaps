Some of the main reasons are, later in the TAS, I learned that you can cancel the wait that happens before your partner/an enemy attacks by pressing A... I'm also not sure if the route I chose (if I should manipulate certain TMs for moves or not, if I should go different paths in floors) was the fastest.
