As a result, I was able to save frames in practically every room of the game, even in places where the overal strategy did not change. If a stage comparison lists "more optimized movement" as an improvement, it is probably from utilizing one or more of these mechanics to save time in some way:

Since the desperation charged slash has much larger range and no preliminary slashes compared to the 3rd ground-combo slash, it is ideal to use it to start the fight if you can take damage throughout the stage without wasting much time. If unable to do 6 3rd ground combo slashes in a fight, it is faster to replace up to 2 of them with additional charged slashes before resorting to an 8 hit fight(same thing goes for going from an 8 hit to a 9 hit fight).

	"Boss fights do not initiate until Grolla has been on the ground of the boss room for 2 consecutive frames, at which point character control is lost. Jumping further into a boss room delays the start of the fight, but gets you closer to the boss at the same time, so the first hit of the fight will still occur on the same frame regardless if the boss stands still at the start. What this does do, however, is it displaces all of the boss' actions so they occur at different times relative to when you need to attack them as their iframes reset. One of the most difficult aspects of the run was finding the optimal distance to jump into the room on certain boss fights, since different strategies become possible/impossible when starting the fight at different times.

Input can be ended ~1s earlier right as you unleash the semi-final hit if you manipulate Iris to shoot lightning and trigger Grolla's desperation to kill her with the automatic charged slash, but this delays killing Iris and doesn't take into account Grolla's X-axis distance from her standing place during the cutscene nor Iris' Y-axis distance from the top of the screen before she flies off after the fight.

		" This Luste fight abuses 2 glitches to save 109 frames over the published run's fight. The first one uses the steps in the boss room to abuse the trigger that initiates the boss spawn while still allowing you to retain movement afterwards. This is done by landing on the edge of a step and walking on it for 2 frames, spawning Luste, and then falling off to retain movement in the air. Touching the ground again at any point will relinquish character control, so I need to wall jump on the steps to avoid this. The second glitch is an abuse of Luste's AI during her back and fourth jumping move. In her initial Lustatem attack, her left/right movements will mirror Grolla's exactly, but she will stop during the time that she is actually firing Lustatems. You can abuse this to position her right next to a step so that she jumps into it when she does her back and fourth jumping move. This causes her to jump straight up and down after she hits the wall of the step, and allows you to get consecutive triple slashes on her that would have been otherwise impossible if she was jumping across the room as intended.

By abusing the same fight trigger glitch of falling off the step as in Luste's fight, I can start the fight with an immediate charged slash and get 3 hits in before Schwer's first Geisterwand, which allows me to kill her before she even gets her 2nd one off.

I have to damage boost off the ground level spawns and get inside of them to make both hitboxes contact as soon as possible, and the final large clump takes 3 hits and moves very quickly, so I need to be in iframes in order to hit it with the 2nd slash and the 3rd slash double-hit.

This sequence of events is started right on the 2nd slash of the fight for 3 reasons: the first being the timing of the pink ball damage boost, the second being because it causes my second slash to hit the platform as it is oscillating upward(once it starts moving out it stops oscillating, and you can only hit Iris Machine with a triple slash if the platform is at a high position), and third because it causes Iris machine to be moving left when the platform is moving left, and moving back to the right when the platform is moving back right as well.

Pretty much every rerecord when optimizing these areas causes Hourglass to crash and then you have to re-watch the entire run up to that point each time since your savestates have gone stale.
