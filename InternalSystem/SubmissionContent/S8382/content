	": Watching this submission and the non-pacifist publication side-by-side, I could see that there are fundamental differences. The published movie is with 2 players, which makes it much harder to be pacifist because there aren't enough invincibility items for both players. Which also means that a "2 players, pacifist" movie would still be much different.

	"Pacifist goal is very popular for the Contra series. It's fun to do the opposite of what the plot and even the game genre itself is supposed to have doing. And it turns out to be weirdly feasible. I have to note that some piranha plant enemies do explode in this movie, while the player passes through them. This happens due to quirk of the game code itself, for which existing enemies de-spawn on their own when there are too many new enemies spawning on screen, so the player isn't killing anyone after all, except for the bosses.
