	"With over 10 different runs attempted at this game across 6 authors, Kung Fu is a simple platform game that has seen a lot of competition. This version uses a new random manipulation technique to beat the first level one time unit faster than Phil & Genisto's most recent record.

	"By using a backwards jump, the game's randomness can be manipulated without costing too much time. In fact, you can make certain enemies disappear. In level 2, I used a backwards jump to make the falling dragon capsule disappear from the right side of the screen; this avoids having to get hit by it. It was also used on the last boss to change his attack pattern. I did these things also to make the run look more entertaining because I was tired of seeing all the kung fu runs look like exact replicas of each other with only just one or two changes.

	"In terms of time units, this run is extremely difficult to improve upon. Even with extreme randomness abuse I found it very difficult to improve the time units of the later levels. This is perhaps the main reason why Phil and Genisto's version remained unchallenged for so long. In terms of frames, it did cost me some frames here and there to demonstrate things like the level 2 glitch, but I did it for the sake of variety. After 8 versions, one gets sick of a game easily :P.
