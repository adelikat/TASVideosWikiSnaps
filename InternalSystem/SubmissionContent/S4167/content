	": This run lacks finesse. As mentioned in other runs you previously submitted, you need to choose your moves more carefully. A Shoryuken using the strongest punch when the opponent has barely any energy left is slow for no reason. A weaker Shoryuken would get the same job done, and would be quick about it. Further, throws are a good way for a lot of damage for comparatively little time used, yet is underused in this run. This game allows for combos which is not used. See 
	(__wikiLink|href=/422M|implicitdisplaytext=422M)
	" which contains some entertainment trade-offs but is way faster with a similar character thanks to good combo use.
