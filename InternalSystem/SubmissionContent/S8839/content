However, if the ceiling is at least 2 tiles of terrain near the corner you can actually get two 4-pixel boosts instead. I think this is because those blocks are just a giant tile set or at least tied together, but I'm not 100% sure. It's very useful in most cases though. Also I'll mention here that the cannon in the pirate ship level will give you an 18 pixel boost to the right for some reason.

This applies to all ceilings you can bonk your head on. Unfortunately some of them are 1 block too high, meaning you can not get a reset unless you jump from a standstill with a very high up y subpixel value. I'm still not quite sure why this works but it's never really useful as you have to come to a full stop to make it work, I did not ever find a way to get it without stopping. This technique is very useful especially for vertical stages and since we can combine it with the double ceiling clips we can save a lot of time. Also, it was a while before I realised you could still do ceiling jumps after taking damage which saves time at the part where those wooden stakes are always in the way.

[div class=p 
	"I first discovered this trick in the underwater stages, and it is very important for those but also can be applied to other locations. So basically since since the hammer is only active on the last frame of animation, you can cancel it with a jump before hand. This means the hammer never finished and it's the last frame of the hammer which will cause you to come to a complete stop in the air if you aren't pressing a direction. If we let go of our direction at the exact frame our speed hits 1 pixel/frame and them keep combining it with the hammer jumps in this manner we can maintain 1 speed underwater, even though you're actually supposed to lose speed every few frames. But then I wondered if this worked on slopes as well by not pressing a direction. It turns out slopes are coded similarly in that not pressing a direction does not trigger the slowdown. This means I can take different routes in some places and actually save time because of it. This is also used in the graveyard stage later on combined with the speed boost item but I'll put that in it's own section.

Diamonds dropped by enemies are also affected by this RNG method.

You can either just press B and hurl the enemy straight ahead, or you can press B and then up 2 open frames later to chuck the enemy upwards. If you have no momentum it will simply toss the enemy straight up and down. If you have momentum it will lob them up and forward. You can pick up multiple enemies at once but doing so has no use and would only waste time. If you have 3 or more enemies in your hand you will actually move slower, there is no speed limit to just holding 1 or 2. Bosses only spawn throwable enemies at certain intervals and even if you could hit them with 2 at the same time, it does not deal more damage to the boss.

This also changes your jump pattern so that your jump heights are on these frames instead: frame 1, frame 3, frame 5, and frame 6.

Anyway, the way to set this up is to fire 9 shots so that you have 1 more shot remaining and then time your last shot to fire on the same frame you enter a door. The door will override your hammer cancelling and you will have unlimited shots with the magic staff. Unfortunately because this means I now can't manually get rid of it for the boss animation cancel, it currently has no use.

In this stage you must kill the moon with a projectile as that is the only way the door at the end of the stage opens. Initially it seemed just out of reach to get to the door fast enough, because when you kill the moon there is a strict timer before it resets again. But then I remembered the handy momentum preservation trick but I thought surely it wouldn't work for this. Turns out there is a frame where your speed is 1.5 pixels/frame very briefly and letting go of your direction at that exact moment has the same effect as preserving your momentum elsewhere. You can attack in this form but you can not pick anything up, you just automatically kill anything you run into. But it's good that you can attack as that is required to preserve your momentum in the same way as hammer hopping. This gives us just enough time to reach the door while the moon is still knocked out.

This is because your x coordinates are updated in this pattern: 1 1 2 0 1 1 2 0. So you can see if averages out to be the same as just walking on normal ground. However, if you use the handy momentum preservation by hammering just as you're about to land you can maintain some of those frames of 2 pixels/f for as long as your hammer animation is active. This is followed by a jump and repeated meaning it's faster to do a bunch of hammer hops that it is to just walk over the escalators.

	"The stage with the auto moving platforms seem to be loaded whenever you approach them with your camera position rather than be rng based. If you move your camera off to the side of their starting position and then back it will reset them, so that pretty much confirms it. I tried various things to change the cycles on them such as altering the camera positions, stopping at various points, and just changing jumps at various points but nothing seemed to have any affect. The platforms always load as you reach them so unfortunately this was a big time wasting section. Perhaps if you are better at reading the RAM and there might be something I overlooked, and it would actually really help the run. But for now I couldn't find anything.

	"I know that the blue icons that you can collect in just about every stage does sometimes affect the ending tally time extending the length of the game by a few frames. The only thing I noticed was that in the first world getting 2 icons was the same amount of time as not getting any, so I just left them in. Admittedly I didn't bother with any analysis afterwards as I felt it wasn't really that significant, but maybe I am wrong.
