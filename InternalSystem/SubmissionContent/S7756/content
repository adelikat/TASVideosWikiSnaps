	"In Chapter 2 there are 2 cages which each contain a set of Punies, the Red Cage contains the Puny Elder which is opened near the start of the chapter to have 10 Punies join Mario's party, and the Blue Cage which contains another 90 Punies. In order to acquire the Blue Cage Key we must traverse further into the Great Tree and solve a couple puzzles, then go back to the cages and free the 90 Punies. However, there is a glitch that we can do to open the Blue Cage without needing the key. Using an "EVT overflow", we can essentially trick the game into setting our EVT (event) sequence to when the door unlocks, so if I mash A when unpausing to activate the keyhole unlock cutscene, the game will let me open the door without the use of a key, saving a couple minutes.

	"Bookcase Jump is a sequence break in Glitzville that allows me to skip the majority of Chapter 3. Later in the chapter, there is a cutscene that occurs by entering Grubba's office through an air vent, setting the game's sequence to right before the chapter's boss fight. By denying Grubba's offer to sign up for the Glitzville tournament at the beginning of the chapter, Mario is able to move around Grubba's office freely. With that, I am able to make a precise jump up the bookcase, walk through and into the air vent, triggering the end of the chapter and effectively skipping all of the minor and major league battles, which saves a substantial amount of time.

	"In Chapter 4, Mario runs into a suspicious character named Doopliss at Creepy Steeple. Mario manages to beat him, but gets his body stolen mid fight, and now Mario's party is with this "fake" Mario, who is actually Doopliss. Mario is now just a purple shadow with no name, he ends up going back to Twilight Town and meets one of the Shadow Sirens; Vivian. She ends up joining Mario's party, and you use her ability to get past a few puzzles back at Creepy Steeple in order to progress the chapter further. This requires a fair amount of backtracking, and takes up a large chunk of time. However, SolidifiedGaming found a way to completely skip acquiring Vivian. In the video, you'll see that we can use a Super Jump to trigger the Doopliss cutscene while still being able to move around, this allows for some interesting cutscene interactions after the fight. But first, I need to obtain Jump Storage. By saving and copying the file back at Flurrie's House in Chapter 2, I'm able to use the Flurrie cutscene in order to acquire Jump Storage. Following that, I proceed to get a game over and that will allow me to carry over the Jump Storage state into the main Chapter 4 file. I then use a Super Jump to trigger the Doopliss cutscene and initiate the fight. Afterwards, I'm able to move around the room freely, this allows me to leave the room between when Mario's partners are taken from the menu, and the partner we have out is removed. With this newly obtained "fake partner" I can keep them out to do the previously mentioned puzzle at Creepy Steeple that normally requires Vivian by using a Double Jump to get past the door. I can then proceed through the chapter as normal until right before Doopliss 2, otherwise having a partner out other than Vivian will cause the game to crash. I first need to save and reload to remove them before Doopliss 2 since the partner will only be kept out on reload if we have them in our menu. As I trigger the cutscene, the game sets my sequence and puts Vivian in my party. This glitch skips talking to Vivian and her joining our party, as well as 1 full trip through the forest, saving around 3 minutes. In actuality, this trick saves about 5 minutes in Chapter 4 alone, but we have to take into account the time it takes to save and copy the file back in Chapter 2. As well as the 2 reloads that are required for the trick to work.

	"In Chapter 6, Mario is normally required to have the Ultra Boots in order to get the Garnet Star and complete the chapter. However, we don't have the Ultra Boots, which refrains us from completing the chapter. That's where "Ultra Boots Skip" comes in. First, I get Jump Storage using Yoshi from a nearby Inn Coupon item, then I do a Super Jump up to the blue switch at the top of Poshley Sanctum. I have now negated the need for Ultra Boots and I have full access to the Garnet Star. But there is still one more glitch I can do to skip the normally required Peach and Bowser intermissions, as well as a trip to the Thousand-Year Door, the "Star Shot". I first encounter an enemy and manipulate an item drop, then I use that item to get text storage and encounter another enemy, allowing me to move around with a textbox. I can then swap to Yoshi and use the item again to get Jump Storage, do a Super Jump up to the left edge of the sanctum, swap to Koops, shoot Koops towards the Garnet Star and close the textbox at the same time. This effectively allows me to grab the Garnet Star in an unintended way with Koops, which ultimately avoids setting the flag which tells the game that I've finished Chapter 6. This set of tricks skips getting the train ticket, doing the train mission, completing Riverside Station and the Smorg boss fight, saving a substantial amount of time.

	"There are a few things I'd like to mention. Firstly, this TAS was made solely by myself with no outside help (other than the discoveries of these glitches) and was just a fun little project that I wanted to do based on my own research and knowledge of the game. Secondly, this route is likely not the most optimal TAS route, what I do is heavily based on the RTA route just with some minor adjustments for things only a TAS can realistically achieve, like manipulating item and badge drops from enemies. Thirdly, there are a couple improvements that have come to my attention that can be made in certain areas of the game. Fence Skip to avoid talking to Frankly in the prologue. Kroop Skip in Petal Burg (which was discovered about a month ago, as I was nearing the end of the TAS). A faster method for Blue Key Skip in Chapter 2. Performing a Super Jump to get the Steeple Key early in Chapter 4, and so on. Overall, I am happy with the outcome of this TAS and I enjoyed creating it, and depending on the general reception of this TAS, as well as my motivation, I may or may not make an updated one in the future.
