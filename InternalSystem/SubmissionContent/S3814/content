		"The RNG:
	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Any TAS of an RPG revolves around manipulation of the RNG, and this one is no exception. The RNG happens to be very fixed and easy to manipulate, as not only are attacks and level ups used by the RNG, but also the path finding algorithm used whenever a unit is moved. By changing the path from one result to another, the RNG is shifted forward a number of places. Moving the cursor along a diagonal and the further distance away from the unit shifts the RNG much more. You will see the cursor movement happen throughout the entire run to shift the RNG to my favour and give me the unlikely results I need for a faster clear. Ideally, I want to get as many critical hits as I can in a combat, however that is not always practical given the limitations of the RNG, and how long it can take to shift the RNG to the required position - it can often be faster to take a double attack to kill an enemy rather than a critical hit, especially in the early game where unit Skill is relatively low. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There's a second RNG that comes into play in Chapter 14, which determines if non-thief units can find items in the Desert. When the item menu is opened this RNG moves along at a non-fixed rate, somewhere between 4 and 9 frames at a time from my observation, so just waiting long enough in the item menu shifts this RNG to the position you need to get the items you want. The normal odds are 1/11 in trying to get an item randomly. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Glitches and Exploits:
	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The main glitch used through this run is something I've dubbed DOG - Double Occupancy Glitch. Basically, you can make two or more units occupy the same square in a grid by certain movement of the cursor. You move into the occupying unit's space, and the very next frame you press a direction away + A to confirm the movement. DOG is used several times through the run, sometimes required, sometimes just because I could. Either way it is a very useful tool.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"DOG is not without its limits however. The game only allows you to move a certain unit from that space on subsequent turns, the last unit in the game's unit list. If you need to move units in a certain order then DOG might not always be the best option. Enemy phase interation for DOGed units is also not completely understood, as sometimes one unit is targeted and sometimes a second or third one is. However, DOG does allow for many time savers which are often not available without it. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There's a useful exploit when dropping a rescued unit. Normally, the screen manually scrolls to a place where that unit is to be dropped, but this can waste a lot of time (10 frames per square). By pressing away from that direction so the cursor is in a position where it won't cause the screen to scroll, and then pressing back into the direction + A, the unit is put into the position you want, and the game is tricked into not scrolling as it initially thinks the unit is being placed elsewhere. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Avoiding the game scrolling the screen is also important when targeting enemies to be killed. It is almost always better to manually scroll the screen yourself (as movement per square only takes 2 frames in one direction), and then scrolling back to the position you want to be in. I end up having to do this for a lot of enemies, mostly bosses. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There's a couple of visual glitches caused by scrolling the screen too fast when positioning units in the preparations screens. This changes nothing in the gameplay but looks like some of the terrain is in a different place to where it should be. This effect only tends to be temporary too and ends after the first turn of a chapter, but it's funny to see nevertheless. Chapter 12 has one such instance of this visual anomaly.

	]b
	$LF
	"After many starts, I found this approach to be the quickest. By not giving Alan and Lance (the cavaliers) any experience in this chapter, it avoids them levelling up later on and saves time that way. However, it will make Marcus level up once more, but 1 is better than 2. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Turn 1: Marcus picks up Roy and equips the Silver Lance. This weapon allows him to OHKO the three enemies he faces on enemy phase. Lance has to move back one space to avoid one of the fighters going for him. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Turn 2: Marcus equips the Iron Sword and critical hits one of the Fighters. The position of the terrain encourages the enemies to line up to the south and to Marcus' sides - normally the AI likes to attack from the north of a unit. I don't kill all the enemies here, even though they also move in the next turn, as it prevents some of the enemies from the south reaching Marcus and taking more time in combat.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"A new idea I thought of was to bypass the village in the south east corner, which gives 5000 gold. Since you also start off with 5000 g, for all the items I need to buy I would need to make up the rest I need by selling some items. This approach turns out to be quite a bit faster.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Turn 1: Roy kills one soldier and Marcus kills another in reach. Lance picks up Marcus and Alan drops him on the fort. I ensure Marcus is holding the Javelin, allowing him to kill all the enemies he can reach on the Enemy Phase (EP). 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Turn 2: Alan takes the Javelin off Marcus (he'll need it in the next chapter), and moves back to avoid Roy having to DOG or move more than 2 spaces. If Alan didn't move out of Roy's way, Marcus would not be able to pick Roy up - a limitation of the DOG. Anyway, Marcus scoops up Roy and moves his full distance. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Marcus is given the Hand Axe and Iron Axe and Roy is dropped. Roy is then rescued by Thany, who moves into range of a soldier on EP. Dieck, Lot and Ward move so they are out of range of the enemies that are moving along the south east edge of the map. Thany needs to gain as much exp as I can feed her. I determined she could save a lot of time by reaching Level 12 before promoting, as the Str she will have allows for several key boss OHKOs and make dealing with later RNG manipulations easier as she reaches stat caps much sooner and requires less stat growths. The extra combat over an earlier promotion also allowed her to reach B Lances just before promotion (going to A Lances after promotion) and able to use the Silver Lance to OHKO the very next boss she comes across, so it worked out perfectly. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Turn 3: Marcus only moves one square here - any more and he encourages more enemies to move from the pack. Thany moves forward over the mountains towards the boss. Marcus clears up the enemies with the Hand Axe. Marcus starts with E Axes, and he does need to reach D Axes before the Chapter 7 boss, but that's actually an easy target. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Turn 4: Roy is dropped in front of the boss. With his starting parameters, Roy is just able to kill the boss with the Rapier, pulling out a necessary double critical. The level up he gains is vitally important too - Roy need to reach a certain level of HP and Defence to change the AI behaviour in Chapter 14, preventing him from being blocked off to the boss there. He starts with 5 Def, and needs a minimum of 7 Def with about 27 HP to cause a Hero to attack Thany rather than him (and thus preventing other enemies from going for Roy and being blocked off as he won't have the combat to kill anyone).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Turn 5: Thany kills the highest level enemy here for more Exp. Roy seizes. 
	$LF

	"This is really the only chapter before Chapter 9 that really has an advantage granted from flight. The 2 turn of Chapter 5 also requires Thany to kill an enemy that no-one else can reach.

		"Chapter 3:
	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The approach here was adapted from the previous version where Alan was the main attacker, to feed Thany as much experience as I could get for her. She needs to reach a minimum of Level 6 to have the combat parameters to kill Soldiers in Chapter 6, and it was the most optimal approach I find to feed her a bunch of enemies here. Overall this is slower than using Alan, but her flight advantage more than makes up for the extra combat required for her. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Turn 1: Thany takes an Iron Lance and is rescue-dropped ahead. Roy ends up next to Alan so he can easily rescue him next turn. A bunch of units all DOG into one square so they avoid enemies targeting them on later turns. Thany doesn't quite have the Strength to 2HKO enemies yet, and a lot attack from range anyway. Alan also has to be so far back as the enemies seem to prefer to go for him over Thany for whatever reason, but he's still far enough ahead that he can reach the combats he is needed for. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Turn 2: Thany clears the way for Marcus and Alan to head thronewards. On EP Thany is deliberately hit to 1 HP by the archer (bows do triple damage to flying units), which will encourage enemies to go for her rather than other units. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Turn 3: I finally get rid of the pesky archer. Marcus takes Roy and equips the Silver Lance here, allowing him to kill the knight easily. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Turn 4: Alan kills the soldier that blocks the way, and Marcus drops Roy. He has to drop him here as the next two turns both require Marcus to have combat and Roy won't have time to be dropped otherwise. Thany gets into a position with the Javelin that she can kill one enemy on the EP, barely 2HKO one more enemy and level up to have the Strength to 2HKO the other on the EP. I don't have to touch Thany for the rest of the chapter now. Roy also levels up here but it wasn't possible to get Def on him as well as allow Thany to survive and get the required stats. He will need to get one more level to allow for this but the most optimal place happens to be in Chapter 12. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Turn 5: Alan and Marcus kills enemies, giving Roy the freedom to reach seize range. Roy kills the fighter here and Alan takes the cavalier that Roy damaged. This is the first example of the levels ups giving the minimal amount of stats needed, given that Alan's usefulness for combat purposes is now over. 
	$LF

	"Turn 1: This turn takes a bit of explanation. This is another Fog of War chapter, and Warp range is limited by FoW. Thieves have increased sight over other units, so I rescue drop Chad ahead to see the spot I need to warp Thany to. Both the paladins in the DOG have Javelins equipped, which makes all the pegasus knights and falcoknight go for Cecilia, who can OHKO all of the pegs with the Aircalibur. The Slim Sword had too low uses so I had to get an Iron Sword to get to D Swords. Getting hit to low health with Thany is important as it saves Roy from being attacked more than once next turn.

Lalum is warped and then dances Thany, who drops Roy in range of the throne. Thany is deliberately hit to make the enemies go for her, and kills the hero to make the bishop go for her and not Roy, and also open room for faster RNG shifting. Fa gained a Def point level last turn from the hero, so she can now just survive being hit by the General. All the remaining units near the reinforcements were moved out of range.
