[p 
	"There is a chance this may desynch due to the nature of Mupen record reset. To reduce the chances of this, deleting the Yoshi’s Story save file (called “Yoshi's Story (U) [!].eep”) or renaming it if you want to keep it may help. Also making a savestate in read-only mode before each reset helps in case it happens to desynch.

	" Speed manipulation
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"When Yoshi starts walking, its speed increased from 0 until it barely passes the value of 4 for a frame and is then maxed at 4. However, by releasing all left and right input at the correct time (similar to Super Mario World), the value can stay slightly higher than 4 speeding up general movement. During mid-jump, Yoshi’s speed can be maxed out at around 4.229, and when Yoshi falls to the ground and jumps, it maxes at around 4.449. Generally you need to slow Yoshi down a bit (a bit under 4) but this is made back by the added speed.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Licking repeatedly
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"When Yoshi starts a jump, by licking for 1 frame and then repeating by licking for 1 frame on the next possible frame, Yoshi gains extra height. This can also be used to make him fall a bit slower.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Reusing eggs
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"When an egg is thrown, there are a few frames that Yoshi can lick it and stop it from exploding. By positioning the eggs so that they break the bubbles by hitting them you can grab an egg just before it explodes and use it again.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Ground-pound tricks
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"If you ground-pound when Yoshi is just about to hit the ground, he won’t have the dust animation. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"An additional trick is by eating a fruit and pounding from higher, the dust animation will still occur (causing things like enemies to turn to fruit) but Yoshi will be able to jump/lick which saves time.

	"A straight forward level; reused an egg several times to save time and in general got Yoshi’s speed higher that the last run. Clipping the top of the spiderball’s line right before the happy fruit looks like it boosts Yoshi slightly. Right before grabbing the last 2 fruit, I had Yoshi duck-walk under the spiderball saving a little time and maintaining speed. Overall I saved 89 frames in this level.

	$LF
	"This route was entirely based off of an improvement “hero of the day” found. Instead of the usually entering 2 of the huts, it is possible to get a happy fruit right after exiting the first hut and then you could skip the other hut. Doing this was tricky. I grabbed all the fruit on the way to the first hut besides the apple and the grape for later use. Once inside the first hut, I needed to make an interesting route. Basically, there are 8 shyguys in there that can be turned into grapes, several bananas, and several melons. I had to figure out a combination where I would have all of the bananas/melons and 3 of the grapes with 1 banana/melon remaining so Yoshi could exit the hut with 5 grapes in a row. Another annoying factor was the ground-pound placement. If I ground-pounded in certain area’s, more shyguys than desired would change into fruit, and they often would go to far off screen while I collected other fruit causing them to disappear. After trying several methods, I came up with this and overall this hut was only 49 frames slower than Comicalflop’s run where he could collect the fruit in any order. Collecting the fruit from there was straightforward. Using the egg blast to get to the final few fruit proved slower than just climbing due to waiting time for the egg to get speed. In the end I saved a few more seconds than originally thought.

	$LF
	"Most of the time saved here was from a trick in Kagemitsu’s run where collecting 6 grapes allows a happy fruit to appear earlier. Actually collecting fruit after that is the tricky part. It may not look optimal, but I had to wait for the boo’s to be in the correct position and have Yoshi be in the correct position where I could ground-pound all the fruit in 1 go. His position after the ground-pound was also important because going too far to the left would cause some of the fruit to disappear.

	"Kyman – We initially started working on this game together years ago, but never got past the first stage. We learned a lot about Yoshi’s physics including how to jump higher, reuse eggs, and watch Yoshi’s speed. Wouldn’t have made this without that initial step.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Comicalflop – Comicalflop’s any% run was a great help for looking at what I had improved, and where I still needed to improve. There was also the use of a trick I didn’t know of before this run (ground-pounding while eating a fruit trick), so watching his run helped a lot.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Kagemitsu – His older TAS of the Japanese version showed the trick used in level 6 to get a happy fruit early and inspired making this run after I had dropped it several times.
