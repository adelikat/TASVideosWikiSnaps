When the timer hits zero, the next time your skater is in the "closed legs" animation, she will take a knee and finish the event. If you're mid-stride when time expires, you have to wait until the animation catches up to that point.

I couldn't even find a video of someone getting 6 at all on NES (though one exists for C64) so yeah. Have fun with that.
