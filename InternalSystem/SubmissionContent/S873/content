	"No, this is not a full run of the game, if anyone thinks that. I haven't pulled another "Link to the past" and completed the game this fast. This is the PRO levels on Adventures of Lolo 2 played as fast as I could manage. For those who don't know what the PRO levels are, they're secret levels that are accessible by typing in certain password in the PASSWORD option. There are a total of four PRO levels, PRO A, PRO B, PRO C and PRO D. I'll now give a brief explanation of the four PRO levels:

	"PRO A:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This level is very hard. The key to this PRO level is to figure out how and where the Gol (the pink enemy) appears. Once you have done this, you can manipulate him to respawn somewhere that benefits you. There are also a lot of techniques that you have to use on this PRO level that you haven't used before, such as letting another enemy block the statues' fire. 
	$LF

[p 
	"I manipulate where the Gol appears by moving the green blocks over the squares where he would normally appear. This way I can make him appear on squares where he normally wouldn't. That's why I move around the green blocks so much, in case you're wondering.

	"PRO B:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"On this level I use the technique that Slotermeyer told me about, slightly changed. Not much to comment on here, as you can see you have to be really fast with shooting the enemies if you want to beat this level. This level has been improve a lot (about 12 seconds)thanks to Slotermeyer's strategy. At the end of this stage you have to zig-zag between the Gol-fire. This level is also very hard.

[p 
	"PRO C:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The shortest of the PRO levels. I use a technique that hanzou told me about on this level. The only thing you have to think about when playing this level is to avoid the Gol fire. With savestates and slowdown, this isn't that hard, really :)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"PRO D:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In my opinion the hardest level. This level is really complex, and I'm not positive that the route I use is the fastest one. There is a waiting period of a few seconds on this level, but I try to move around in entertaining ways during this time.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"To sum things up, the PRO levels really are "pro" levels, if you can beat them on console you can consider yourself very good on this game. And for those of you who never beat these PRO levels, here's how it could be done!
