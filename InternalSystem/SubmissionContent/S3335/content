	"Final Fight (ファイナル ファイト - Fainaru Faito) is an electronic game beat-'em-up side-scrolling by Capcom originally released as a video game based on coin operated in 1989, one of the most popular games for this style of play. It was the seventh game released by Capcom for its system of CPS-1 arcade (Capcom System 1). The player takes one of three "good guys" to try to rescue a young woman captured by the street gang called "Mad Gear", which coincidentally is the daughter of Mike Haggar, one of the characters that the player can choose and who is also mayor of the city that the game takes place (Metro City). When the game was officially conceived he would be released as a sequel to the original Street Fighter game, and would be called Street Fighter '89, but the game had its title changed because of the large difference in style between the two games (Even so, the game has links with the Street Fighter series, and together with the first game was the precursor of Capcom's Street Fighter series), from a fighting game to a common set of side-scrolling action as Double Dragon or Golden Axe . Final Fight was ported to several platforms, such as the Super Nintendo and Sega CD game from its original base currency (in arcades). Final Fight was followed by a series of sequences that were produced primarily for the home console market (Super Nintendo) and some of the characters in the game would re-appear later in the game Street Fighter series.
