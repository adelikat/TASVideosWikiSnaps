]div
[div class=p 
	""Basically, there's 5 different successive kinds of roles the slot machine will give you each time you access it before it loops back to what you started with.
	$LF
	"Roll 2 gives you the chance for a catch 'em mode, whilst the 4th roll offers either a catch 'em session if you have no completed catches so far, or evolution mode if you have. The final roll (5) gives you the chance to land a boss from any catch count.
	$LF
	"Therefore what I did was grind the slots until I landed both a catch 'em mode and an evolution mode together, so that I trigger a boss stage before I use my 5th roll. This way I can then chain a subsequent boss right away from the next slot machine.
	$LF
	""But wait, comboing 3 boss stages together solely from the slots whilst avoiding all catches would be faster, right?" you might think. That's wrong.
	$LF
	"Here is where I introduce the 2nd key timesaver, a pretty big glitch I discovered.
	$LF
	"The basic premise is if you try to spawn a slot machine whilst a boss portal is open, but access the boss portal the instant before the slot portal appears, the game presumably tries to trigger it the instant after you complete the boss fight, which in turn forces you back into a boss room, and if you've already beaten one, it'll move you onto the subsequent boss.
	$LF
	"This, coupled with the remaining slot machine roll, allowed me to chain ALL THREE bosses back-to-back."

This game is similar to a real pinball table in that the ultimate goal is obtaining the higest score, and play can continue indefinitely (even after beating the bonus stages or collecting all Pokémon).  There is no endgame/credits triggered by doing some in-game task from what I can find.  So we can treat this game as an endless game.

	"For endless games, we allow stopping play at a point that makes sense; beating the last of the three boss/bonus stages makes sense as such an endpoint.  So, the goal of beaing Mewtwo is valid for Standard class publication.  Given that the game offers two different tables in which Mewtwo can be defeated (each presenting a unique path/challenge to do so), both can be considered valid modes for this given endpoint.
