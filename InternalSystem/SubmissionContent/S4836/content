	"The Second Reality Project Reloaded is one of the most well-known Super Mario World hacks in existence today. It is known for its intuitive and unique level design, as well as its lush visual appeal. This hack is a remake of the 2002 hack The Second Reality Project, which was created almost exclusively with vanilla resources. This new incarnation did not change much in terms of level design from the original game--The Second Reality Project was created before the days of custom music, sprites, and fancy ASM-hacks, so they were, for the most part, excluded in this remake.

	"Remember that the 1.43 version of Snes9x has the lowest lag. Therefore, if the previous TAS had been done in the version of 1.51 Snes9x, the time would be about 14 seconds to lag more, as the lag v1.51 is more like the actual SNES. Thus the actual time of the previous movie was 34:54 instead of 34:40.
