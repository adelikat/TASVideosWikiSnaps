	"Sonic the Hedgehog: Isle of Magnetic Artifacts (SHIMA) is a hack which aims to overhaul Sonic 1 using a Japanese-inspired aesthetic. The main feature of this demo is Blossom Gardens Zone, the resting area of the isolated, star-god worshipping Kuratranos tribe. BGZ is a fast-paced experience littered with swift-acting enemies, height-granting gimmicks, driving music, and advanced graphical effects. This new zone can be traversed with three playable characters: Sonic the Hedgehog, Miles "Tails" Prower, and Knuckles the Echidna. Sonic, in particular, features a set of unique sprites, the dropdash ability, and a new companion: Abbey the Flicky. Abbey can pick up nearby rings and circle potential targets for Sonic, including hidden monitors.

	"I initially intended to check optimality of this movie in BizHawk's TAStudio, so I converted it to bk2 in BizHawk 2.9.1. It mostly synced fine, and in places where it didn't I was tweaking inputs to resync it, and on every occasion I was getting more optimal movement than this movie originally has. I also started the game 100 frames faster. Then I discovered DarkShamilKhan's movie and decided not to continue.
