	"Armor: A gold breastplate (26 defense) and a leather hauberk converted to platinum through the Midas book (15 defense) gives us a total of 41 war defense, which is pretty much the minimum defense we could have when facing the Minotaur with 12 HP. Spiritual defense will not matter for the Minotaur fight, as explained later.

	"Minotaur: In Medium and Hard difficulty, the Minotaur will use either a war or spiritual weapon, crippling the player's war or spiritual staminas, whichever is lower. If they're equal, as in this case (spiritual stats need to be multiplied by two), the Minotaur will only use war weapons. Since we previously focused all our efforts on war defense, we can absorb the absolute minimum amount of damage. The Minotaur's stamina, defense, and attack level vary wildly from frame-to-frame; by carefully selecting the frames we attack on, we manipulate the Minotaur into a very weak attack, leaving us with only 1 HP to spare.

	"Definitely. This TAS is so dependent on luck manipulation that I can't conceivably try every scenario. I'm comfortable with stopping here because chambers 11 and 12 had extremely lucky layouts and outcomes compared to the majority which were plain crap. So feel free to take a look, cause I think this TAS still has much potential.

	"Treasure of Tarmin was the second licensed AD&D videogame on the Intellivision. The gameplay involves exploring a series of randomly generated mazes searching for weapons, armor, treasures, and magical items to battle a wide variety of monsters RPG-style. The game was released in 1982, meaning the 3D dungeon crawler perspective was very innovative for its time.
