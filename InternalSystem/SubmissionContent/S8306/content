	[em 
		"The Impossible Quiz Demo

	" is a flash demo of the full game 
	[em 
		"The Impossible Quiz
	]em
	". The game contains 30 unconventional questions, most of which with 4 answers, in contrast to the full game's 110 questions. Despite the entire game being only mouse clicking, this TAS does not beat the current RTA world record by a significant amount. This is because the game runs natively at a measly 12 frames per second with most high level speedruns running the game at 60 or 144 frames per second. Despite this, this TAS manages to beat the game in just 6.083 seconds, or 73 frames.

	"The goal is to complete all questions as fast as possible. The main strategy used by this TAS to do so is the moving of the mouse to the position of the correct answer before the next question even appears. This allows most questions to be completed in just 2 frames.

	"This TAS was created in LibTAS v1.4.4 in combination with the May 3rd 2022 nightly release of Ruffle. All LibTAS settings are default. The Vulkan backend was used for this TAS as other backends created errors with this version of Ruffle. There is, to my knowledge, only one release of this game which was obtained through BlueMaxima's flashpoint.

	"RTA using higher framerate is understandable because it makes the game poll input more frequently, giving more room for a human. But this is not accurate because Adobe Flash Player doesn't expose framerate controls, and it might give
