	"Apart from that, I have to make a couple of notes. The first one is that this game features a second loop, that starts right after the end of the credits. This isn't a problem for this submission though, as the ending is already reached with first loop, and a second loop would also add nothing beside the higher difficulty. Still, a second loop could be accepted as their own branch, just like 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Mario Land|href=/1607M)
	". Just remember to use this submission movie as a base, so that we can confirm the authenticity of the initial state!

[div class=p 
	"The other note is about branching. The amount of players allowed for 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=multiplayer|href=/MovieRules#Standard)
	" games is either the minimum or the maximum available for a game. We publish an additional branch only if it's faster than both of these. So since the published 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext="2 players"|href=/3891M)
	" movie is slower, it will be obsoleted by this submitted movie.
