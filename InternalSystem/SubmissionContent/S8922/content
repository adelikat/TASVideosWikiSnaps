	"The game has a few problems that you can see for yourself during TAS, the option to select a language version has a soft-lock bug that locks you in the language selection screen, getting to the 15th frame does not cause a problem, for this reason it is delayed by a few frames to avoid this problem, getting to the battle screens after turning off fast-forward causes graphics issues in fights with enemies, but I assure you that during video creation and TAS creation it will not cause this problem

		"Fights mechanics, you can attack enemies but a faster way is to avoid them although this is not always possible so TAS only goes into 2 fights, normal attack allows you to charge the combo to deal more damage but you can only hit the combo a maximum of 2 times so you can't charge indefinitely, Focus AT skill gives you extra damage which deals even more damage, you can increase the maximum by 2 times, but the disadvantage is that it lowers your defense, but TAS doesn't care about it.

		"There are 3 types of enemies, ghost, eye and BOSS, ghost and eye have a different speed in which they can get the player and enter fight with them, it performs skips to avoid fights because entering fights with them loss a few seconds, with video these are the only faster ways to avoid them, otherwise they would have caught me, the hitboxes of ghosts and eyes are a little wider than it may seem

		"During the section in which 2 enemies have to open a passage for us, I fight the eye because it is impossible to avoid, the ghost is, the fight with the eye did not need to wait for it to give faster attacks because the keyboard attacks it gives are faster, in fights the manipulation of the RNG is impossible, already at the beginning of the turn I run in the Ability Focus AT because it increases the amount of damage, so I can deal more damage, the damage of Theo is terribly small to finish the fight faster, I save a lot of frames thanks to this and defeat the eye in 3 turns.

		"Fighting with Scary Girl is difficult at the very beginning but not so much, at the beginning of the turn I use Focus AT to increase the damage to defeat her faster, during the damage reduction to 47 she casts confusion in which she turns into Louise by which we can't attack so we have to wait, during the confusion I use Focus AT again to increase the damage again, the rest is to use attack because we can't do anything else anyway, after the confusion I defeat her in 2 turns.
