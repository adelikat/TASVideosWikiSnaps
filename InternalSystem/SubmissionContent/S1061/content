	"This run is 1163 frames or 20 seconds faster than the current published run.  A lot of time saved came from the use of glitches.  In addition, all of the boss fights were improved at least slightly.

	"Only about 40 frames saved here, mostly from better precision.  In the boss fight I take 2 hits instead of 1.  This game is stingy with the health so I cannot take damage for the rest of the game!  I learn the invisibility power after this so I never need to.

	"WALL GLITCH.  If you get too far to the right edge of the screen you can pass an obstruction before it becomes solid.  This allows me to not have to jump down from ledges which costs time.  It also allows me to get inside a wall.  Once I am, I can jump up though it out of the sewer saving mega-time.

	"Also I got the kite quicker using different technique.

	"I was able to pass through things like level 2 but was not able to jump up inside the wall in this level.  Also, while in the auto scrolling section I exploit a glitch to pass through a wall but it doesn't save anytime, it is just for looks.

	"I wasn't able to get inside the wall with traditional means, but I discovered that if you go inside a door and come back, you will be slighter closer to the right side of the screen.  This allowed just enough be able to wall glitch.  The glitching saved more than enough time to make up for going through a door and coming back.
