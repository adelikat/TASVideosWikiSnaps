	"It’s important to note that the previous TAS aimed for game time, whereas this TAS aims for real time minus time bonus. I chose this because game time is less meaningful in this game, given you don’t see it on screen anywhere while playing. Game time also behaves strangely, for example stopping the timer not once you hit the signpost, but instead once the signpost is on screen.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The only practical difference when optimising for real time is that I jump high over the signpost in this run. Jumping over it causes the screen to scroll to it quickly, rather than slowly. If you approach the signpost on the ground the screen does a slow scroll to it, costing you a lot of time. This time is only a factor in real time since the in game time stops just as the screen starts doing the slow scroll, making it quicker in real time but not game time to do the jump to the sign from above.

After deciding to pick it up, it confirmed this thought as Challenger did a fantastic job optimising this game. While I did save some time on movement in some stages, the bulk of the time save comes from new routes in the water and red volcano levels.

	"The absolute speed cap is 0x500 and this can be reached usually by rolling down a hill. To get near this cap quickly, you can do a spindash as sonic, which puts you at 0x400. As soon as you spindash you begin losing speed, but this can be avoided by jumping. If you hold right while jumping you hover around the current speedcap. This current speedcap changes based on the speed you were going when you jumped. If you jump with a speed of 0x500 then the speedcap for that jump will be 0x500. Even if you slow down below that within the jump.
	$LF
	"You can retain your speed cap across multiple jumps by holding down to roll when you land, then immediately jumping. For that reason, you pretty much hold down and right always through most levels (unless going left).
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Every time you jump off the ground when holding down and right, you can increase your speed cap by a maximum of 0x00E above the previous value. This means you can do a spindash to get to 0x400 speed, then use many jumps to reach the actual maximum of 0x500 eventually. To always get the speed increase of 0x00E, you have to time out your jump spacing accurately. Sometimes you have to delay the next jump to get the full speed increase.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Of course, if there is a hill, it’s much faster to roll down this to gain speed. When you leave the holl you can briefly have a speed cap of 0x508, but this will wear off once you land. For that reason, any full speed jumps off hills should be held out for as long as possible, to keep that speed boost for longer. However if you have not yet reached the speed cap of 0x500, you should hold out your jumps for as short as possible, so that you can get more jumps in to increase your speedcap.

	"Turning around is painful in this game due to the slow deceleration. For that reason, I will often bonk walls to completely lose speed, then turn around from there. If I don’t have a wall available then the fastest way to decelerate is to be walking on ground and not holding any directions. This is counterintuitive, since normally holding the other direction would slow you down quicker.

	"Not sure on the exact speed you need for this, but it’s somewhere between 0x400 and 0x500. You can clip on sloped ground. When you clip, you fall into the floor by one tile. Most of the time, the ground is solid, so you briefly clip in but can’t do anything. However, on some thin sloped platforms like in Green Hill 1, you can clip entirely through and fall through it. I couldn’t find any useful clips for the TAS as having such a thin platform is very rare. If there was going to be an application, it would likely be in Red Volcano 2 to skip the spin dash elevators.
