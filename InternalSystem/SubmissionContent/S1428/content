[p 
	"I used mode b to play this run.  Mode b allows the two players to damage each other.  This allows for some creative shortcuts by using the flying knee attack on each other.  This accounts for several seconds of improvement time.  The rest comes from improved fighting strategies and death shortcuts.

	"I attempt the fastest possible time.  The conventional wisdom until now is that this would require too many flying knee attacks and would be more boring.  Mode B helps prove this false.  With the players attacking each other as well, there is plenty of action on the screen.  Also, I do other attacks whenever it doesn't costs any frames.  So this run is the best of both worlds; entertaining as possible while still completing the game as fast as possible.

[p 
	"While it could be argued that it should be published along side the other two double dragon 2 movies, I think it should obsolete both.

[p 
	"a) Strategically, this is the same run as the 2-player mode a run except for the occasional shortcuts.  Having both would be redundant.  Also this run is faster than a mode a run, and more entertaining.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"b) The one player run differed from Phil's because it aimed for fastest time and used the flying knee as much as possible.  It is no longer the fastest run (it is the slowestof the 3).  It is also the least entertaining.  Also, this run uses the flying knee as much as the 1 player run.  There is nothing that a 1 player run offers that is not represented in a 2 player mode b one.

	": Accepted for publication. My recommendation after checking the old runs is that this movie obsoletes both of them: It is a faster 2-player movie not only because it uses more knees, but also more tricks and death shortcuts. The 1-player movie does not offer anything special compared to this movie, and is also a whole minute slower.
