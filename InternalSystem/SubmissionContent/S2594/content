	"Kid Chameleon is lengthy and challenging platformer. In it you switch between a wide variety of different forms, each with its own moves and attributes, by collecting the helmets found in the various stages. You can also spend the diamonds you collect to generate powerful effects that depend on your helmet and how many diamonds you have.

[p 
	"Most of the tricks used in this run have already been detailed in the comments for the maximum levels run. However for this run I decided to aim purely for real time, I.E. minimising score tallies where appropriate, which took a bit more thought than it first seemed.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Fortunately (and, yes, I checked this before choosing this as my goal) delaying the end of a stage to avoid getting the speed bonus or to get less time bonus is always considerably slower (~8 seconds minimum for speed bonuses) than not doing so (one seconds worth of time bonus is less than the amount tallied in one frame). Bizarrely the score tallies actually lag, and skip tallying for a frame, a surprisingly large amount. This only really occurs when you get 4+ different types of points in a single stage, but in these cases can easily amount to 50+ additional frames lost in addition to the actual tallying. This was most problematic in levels that awarded Path Bonus just for finishing them, but only really resulted in one dubious looking item collection.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Additionally for every 50,000 points you collect you get awarded an extra life which costs three seconds (regardless of how far through the tally you are when you get it). In the end I got fairly lucky here and there are only two places where I loose time to avoid points for this purpose and only lost 13 frames for this purpose. Skipping another life would require missing multiple speed bonuses or taking a route with fewer flags neither of which are close to being fast enough to save time in this way.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"You can also save a few frames during the transition to grey boxes by minimising the number of blocks on screen. The best way to do this is usually to ensure that the edges of the screen line up exactly with the blocks instead of having a half block on both sides. This wasn't always faster though as it only saves ~3 frames per instance. Also the flags aren't as tall as they look and this prevented it form being used in some cases.

Collecting Eyeclops is ~25 frames faster than avoiding two of the hits (which is much more difficult than it looks). This method doesn't save time in the max levels run as Eyeclops is horrible in Sky Fortress and actually only saves about a ~70 frames here due to the long extra helmet animation.
