Eri is chosen because of her ability to aim grenades in 8 different directions and receive twice the number of grenades from the bomb/grenade item. The extra grenades become useful throughout the run and make her a lot faster than the other characters, especially in the final mission.

	"While crouching, when you attack, you can immediately turn around and do something else. For certain weapons, you can immediately turn back around and attack again. This cancels the delay between time you fire a weapon once and the time you can fire again, allowing you to fire at a much faster rate. This can also be done with grenades and melee attacks.

When you change from a weapon to pistol or vice versa while standing, the gun sprite immediately changes rather than the long animation that happens when you change while crouching (Of course, you can use Turnaround Cancel to cancel this long animation). Because the gun sprite immediately changes, you can instantly fire again. Super change takes advantage of this by continuously changing your weapon, which continuously changes the gun sprite, which allows you to fire again instantly again and again.

For melee attacks, switching weapons cancels the attack animation, allowing you to attack again. In the case of grenades, switching weapons after throwing one grenades allows you to throw a 2nd one instantly. For weapons like S and F, you can use Super Change to fire pistol or throw grenades during the time you have to wait before you can fire another shot. It also allows you to fire S and F again a few frames earlier. While it is better to use Turnaround Cancel whenever possible, when jumping or walking towards an enemy, Super Change allows more damage output by allowing you to fire bullets faster and fire pistol shots/throw grenades in between the bullets.

	"Here, you can see the "semi big 2H" trick being put to good use here. When fighting the second tank, don't advance up to the tank because it causes a 2nd robot to spawn. Instead, keep your distance and use "semi big 2H" to destroy it from afar. Then the screen will scroll without requiring you to destroy the 1st robot that was initially there. You can also throw grenades, but since I have to save them, I only throw 1 to damage the tank and destroy the force field of one the futuristic soldiers that started leaping towards me. Later on, I obtain L and keep it all the way to the first boss, "shuffling" 3 weapons all the way there. I actually managed to save about 30 frames in the area right before the first boss, but saving 16 grenades cost me more time in the end.

	"Sometimes walking instead of jumping can save time. At the beginning when I get more grenades and S, by walking a little and then jumping, I am able to save 25 frames. Unfortunately, I lost 20 frames at the part I have to destroy the beam. Perhaps it’s from lag, but I tried my best to reduce the number of frames lost. In my first attempt at this part, I lost around 40 frames. Moving on, mtvf1 found a way to jump through the falling structure earlier rather than waiting for it to fall completely, which saved about 22 frames (originally I thought it saved 14 from early testing). However, a little after that, I actually have to walk a few frames to avoid jumping on the small slopes, which would be slower. Doing that caused me to lose 8 frames.

	"46 frames were lost while fighting the tentacles from not dying for more grenades. The S and Z can hit multiple parts to do double or even triple damage. Despite this, having extra grenades can save time, but there is a limit to how many grenades I can save from the mission without losing too much time. 122 frames were saved from a new strategy against the head of the final boss. Instead of having it dive into the lava like mtvf1 did, I had it only come down halfway and shoot a missile diagonally. The advantage of doing that is that you can stay underneath the boss the whole time and continuously use Super Change to throw grenades at it. 40 frames were lost at the prisoner tally up from having 7 more prisoners than mtvf1.

		" It was originally believed that it wasn't possible to use Super Change when attacking downwards. However, I discovered that you can still use a sub-optimal version of Super Change when attacking downward. The catch is that you have wait 2 frames before attacking. This wasn't fully realized till mission 6 when I fought the two trucks/cars. As such, the boss fight in mission 4 can be improved by utilizing this to throw grenades downward faster.
