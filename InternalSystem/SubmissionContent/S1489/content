	$LF
	"Each Pokémon can only possess 4 moves. New moves must replace old ones.
	[br

	$LF
	"Each move has a limited number of PP. If PP runs out, it can't be used until PP is restored. Each use of a move costs 1 PP. Thrash is slightly different (see below).
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"An attack has damage variation ranging from 217/255 times max damage to max damage (in other words, R/255 times max damage, where R is a random number between 217 and 255). Since the game uses integer division, max damage occurs rarely (only if R is 255).

	$LF

[p 
	"Note that SE/NVE messages occur even if the type matchups cancel (one is SE and the other is NVE). This is only true in RBY, not in later-generation games.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Here is a review of the moves used:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Thundershock is one of Pikachu's first moves. 40 power, Electric type. Can cause paralysis.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Growl is another of Pikachu's first moves. Non-damaging move. Can lower opponent's Attack stat modifier. Used only with trainer-fly glitch to glitch a L1 Nidoking.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Poison Sting is one of Nidoking's first moves. 15 power, Poison type. It is a short-delay attack, unlike Tackle and Horn Attack, and that makes all the difference. Unfortunately, Poison moves create a lot of SE/NVE messages.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Thrash is one of Nidoking's first moves. 90 power, Normal type, attacks 3 or 4 times and user is confused at the end. It is a short-delay attack with a long first-move delay. Although the menu is skipped during the multiple attacks, the first-move delay unfortunately makes Thrash less useful than it should be, but it is still useful nonetheless, especially since it rarely creates SE/NVE messages, and an entire set of attacks counts just 1 PP.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Bubblebeam is Nidoking's third useful move. 60 power, Water type, 30% chance to drop opponent's Speed. Another short-delay attack, and useful to avoid SE/NVE messages which Poison Sting can't avoid.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Strength is Nidoking's fourth useful move. 80 power, Normal type. A long-delay attack which only comes into play near the end of the game as a last-resort power move when Bubblebeam fails and Thrash is inconvenient.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Surf is Nidoking's fifth useful move. 95 power, Water type. Same role as Strength.
