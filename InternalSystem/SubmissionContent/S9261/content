It is impossible to predict how much fire we need since in addition to bosses some normal enemies may be killed by fire to save time, or not. Since this is the first version I play it safe and take all fire spells that are directly on the route on account of it taking only 2 in-game frames to pick them up.

We now have 25 fire. The 4 somersaults under the dragon statue are a scripted cutscene. We get KWANTZU which is a special sword that is needed for the final boss.

We need to wait for the black ninja to follow us so that two other ninjas do not appear in the narrow wood corridor. We get 5 fire, so now we have 30 fire. Before the boss we throw a ninja away to make another ninja disappear and to make the boss appear faster. The boss has 90 HP, so we use 6 fire. We now have 24 fire.

If they are not on screen when they transform, then they reset to full health, so some delay is needed to not kill them too fast outside the screen. The tiger form has 30 HP and ninja form has 50 HP. That means a total of 160 HP, so we need to use 12 fire. After the fight we have 12 fire left.

We are left with 4 useless fire spells, but on account of the fire pickups always giving 5 units this means we actually never stopped to pick up any useless fire. Actually, no, we can use Zatch to end input early by 6 frames. Thanks, game! Zatch does 42 damage, so now we need to use only 6 fire. So now we have 6 useless fire in the end, and now we actually DID waste about 2 in-game frames somewhere while picking up fire that was never needed. LOL. I would like to redo it to save a few frames, but the game is just too quirky for me, so no thanks, never again...

	": The only issue I see here is that in the beginning you could start the game faster by holding start on that "Surf Ninjas Tm" logo to make it finish earlier that allows an earlier "start" to bypass it.  The tas optimization looks good for this very finicky game that has enemy randomness and a lot of lag.  Liked the trick with the long jumping by using Left to kind of interrupt the fall in order to kind of hover.
