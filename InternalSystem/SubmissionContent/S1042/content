	"Making this video was very challenging. I saw Blechy's comment in his submission: "I think it's safe to say we've pushed the game to its limits." This is what inspired me to do the run, because I knew that a game this crazy is never pushed to the limits. My version is still far from perfect (I don't know of any specific places to save frames, but they exist none the less).

	"It never ceased to amaze me how completely different methods could end up being so near in time, for instance, in the first level, I start completely different than Nitsuja does and it ends up only about 8 frames faster. Later, the level with the sea horses, is also done completely different and it saves only 10 frames (I was fortunate to discover that method because I was having a real hard time matching Blechy).
