	"I‚Äôll be honest, I know really nothing at all about this game‚Äôs story and didn‚Äôt learn any of the names except Benkei. It‚Äôs way too Japanese! Literally the first thing I had to do before even trying to play the game was create Lua to translate the HUD‚Äôs Japanese numerals into Arabic numerals. Then I tried playing the game and just kinda died a bunch. However, it was a very fun game to TAS, as it‚Äôs fast-paced and dripping with delightful knockback abuse.

Benkei 1 and 2 have 100 HP, and the final boss has 240. In our old TAS, we only had 12 sword power, so we needed 50 hits on them (and reached 22 power, for 80 hits on final boss). Now, we enter Benkei 1 with 35 sword power, needing to deal only 25 hits, and Benkei 2 and the final boss are done with 40 sword power, needing 20 hits and 48 hits.

Mid-level, RNG only advances when it‚Äôs called. Between levels, the RNG is set based on a global timer that advances every frame. So, there are only 256 possible starting RNGs for levels. Once you collect the sword upgrade in the dragon level, ‚Äòhard‚Äô hits do not advance RNG, so unfortunately that cannot be used to manipulate Benkei 1 and 2‚Äôs attacks.

	"You can see we take very little damage from the ninja. I wish I knew why it works, but if you face leftward for a frame now and then in just the right way, you can get knocked back by the ninja without taking damage. This allowed us to enter the level with the minimum of 39 health (each extra health costs 2 frames).

A couple up-slashes are used, the first one to help with hitting him when he‚Äôs above the ground (behind-the-back sword windup hits are very low to the ground), and the last one to help with timing a quicker input end (since up-slashes take less time in between them).

	"Overall the most potential is probably in Big Mode levels, as the mechanics are the most complex, your jump height has odd variance depending on your walk cycle and ducking, and it has the best hitbox ejections. Most of our late improvements came from improving knockbacks/ejections on Big Mode levels.

	"The beginning of the run hasn‚Äôt been touched much, mostly because of the frame rule. You‚Äôd need to save 10 frames just to even out with what we have now (then each frame saved, saves 3), and there isn‚Äôt much to work with, especially with needing as many coins as possible. Stage 2 is probably the most possible to get that kind of timesave on (again, by improving Big Mode ejections).

	"The game ended up being a lot of fun, and I think it was a good choice for the contest, as it‚Äôs easily editable/splicable since very few spots involve RNG. I also really like games where you have a clear max speed, with only some exceptions (knockbacks being the main one here). I‚Äôd also say it had simple routing to make for a linear path that‚Äôll make for a very close competition, but it wasn‚Äôt simple enough evidently‚Ä¶ We really thought every team would find the Pit route!

	"WarHippy did an insane job helping to finalize this run, both by frames and also by adding all the entertainment in the final movie. Two of his teammates dropped out, and Cyorter mostly contributed memory analysis and Lua. Their 2nd place finish is incredibly impressive, and I bet that with the 70-coin Pit route, they would have won. I highly suggest if you‚Äôre as passionate about participating in the DTC as he or I are, please invite him to your team next time! He deserves a tight-knit group ready to win!

	": Good game, great execution, and nice routing! The guide calls another route fastest and doesn't make it exceptionally obvious where the necessary items are, yet it only takes a bit of careful reading to figure out the guide is actually wrong. I followed the movie while reading the level descriptions and comparing this to DTC's second place, and it all looks reasonable. The "developer" levels aren't really hidden, so using them is perfectly fine. Accepting to Moons, will check the ratings after some time.
