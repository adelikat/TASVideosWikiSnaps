	"A Boy and His Blob (NES) was released in Janurary of 1989, developed by David Crane. The game features the boy, and his trusty blob friend. The blob transforms into different things when you gibe it different flavoured jelly beans. These transformations help you progress through the game in a normal playthrough...but of course, this is not a normal playthrough.

	"This run was started when we decided to take a look at this game because it was short and we wanted something to try. Lets just say, we found something big.

	"This is an improvement of 14.94 seconds (898 frames) over the previously 
	[a class=intlink href=/1514M 
		"published movie
	]a
	" by Aglar. All of the improvements come from the new route that we used, I won't spoil anything here though, watch and see for yourself! :)
