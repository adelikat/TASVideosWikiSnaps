	"A Boy and His Blob (NES) was released in Janurary of 1989, developed by David Crane. The game features the boy, and his trusty blob friend. The blob transforms into different things when you gibe it different flavoured jelly beans. These transformations help you progress through the game in a normal playthrough...but of course, this is not a normal playthrough.
