	"Alright so, since the actual UC2 is quite a long game I thought that would be too hard to TAS, so instead I decided to do a frame perfect RNG manipulated pixel perfect frame ruled tricked the game into thinking it's confused so that it would run the flash game by the same name instead. This trick is very complicated to explain so I just won't.

	"In this game, Nate loses significant speed in air, so I keep jumping to a minimum. In the first level you start with no weapons and are expected to perform a sneak melee kill on the first enemy to pick up his weapon, which is really slow. Luckily there are so few enemies in this level that I can just run through the whole thing not caring about the enemies at all, tanking all the damage.

	"Around 19s in I do the first glitch. When entering the incredibly immersive quick time event of opening the door, I can click on one of the options at the bottom to bring up a confirmation prompt. In this case I use the Home option, but any one of them works. Selecting "No" unpauses the game and lets me move while the QTE is on screen. Since the door gets opened the moment I enter the QTE, unpausing the game lets me run through it and continue on with the level.

	"Level 2 is where a ruffle inaccuracy starts to show its ugly head. For some reason Nate seems to jump just slightly lower compared to Flash Player, making jumping immediately to the ledge at the start impossible, so I had to take the intended way of shimmying along some ledges.

	"Nate loves grabbing those ledges, which you can see on the second one where I don't even jump and he still sticks to it. I'm able to avoid the third one by punching on the last frame before dropping down, but otherwise I just try to drop the shimmy as soon as possible, provided it doesn't cause an unnecessary ledge grab.

	"Once again there is a QTE and once again I abuse the menu glitch to gain control of Nate during it. While the screen is covered I make my way down to the bottom right, where a gate is closed and needs to be opened by that same QTE. After completing the QTE the game would normally point the camera at the gate being opened, which it still attempts to do while I continue on with the level. On the very next ledge climb animation I do another menu-reset to stop the camera animation and bring it back to normal. The ledge climb animation plays even when paused, meaning I lost no time resetting the camera there and it makes the action much easier to follow.
