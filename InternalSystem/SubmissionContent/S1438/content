	"Lufia 2 is the sequel of the Lufia 1 game, but actually takes place before that game. Since Lufia 1 was not released in Europe and Australia, Lufia 2 was simply called "Lufia" in those parts. Next to some fresh new graphics and sound, an improved interface and a cheesy storyline, this game introduces the new "IP system". Ikari Points (IP) represent how angry your character is, and allow for some devestating special attacks. These were abused alot in this movie.

	"The movie was recorded using the USA rom, due to the timing differences between NTSC and PAL. This almost saves half an hour on the total movie length. While the USA rom also introduces an interesting "level 0 glitch", it was not used in this movie.

	"Shooting the hook while standing against a wall has a really short animation, shorter that most other actions including the walking of monsters. This allows you to walk next to mosters while not getting into battle with them, since they're lagging behind. This is also used as a fast method to manipulate luck.

	"To determine randomness, the game used 55 pseudorandom numbers. Every time a random number is used, an internal counter increases. When this counter reaches 54, a new set of random numbers are generated through bitwise XOR operations.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"In other words, the randomness is completely deterministic. The only way to manipulate luck is through pulling different amount of numbers from the RNG, which translates in the game to bumbing into a wall, grabbing a chest or using a potion/healing spell. I tried to keep these manipulations as subtle as possible, but especially in the first 30 minutes of the run involve heavy luck manipulation which isn't always as subtle looking as it should be.
