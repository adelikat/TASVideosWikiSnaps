[ul 
	[li 
		"Write up submission details. Not having them will certainly repel an audience.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Make an effort to watch the discussion thread. In some case, a conversation can help you along the way to a publication. In this case, it won't...but it certainly is a habit that can turn an "Iffy" TAS into a successful acceptance.
		$LF

	[li 
		"Research your game for existing records. Our site actually is a good indication if something is already in existence. The "Quick" search, up in the top right, is the best place to start.

[div class=p 
	"I reviewed the file mentioned by 
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/Spikestuff 
		"Spikestuff
	]a
	". The work in that WIP, is substantially faster than this submission. Even if it wasn't for the clipping and other tricks, I was able to find simple problems with your inputs. I had found chunks of frames from normal types of movement that can be performed in any TAS.

[div class=p 
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/eladogGames 
		"eladogGames

	", please make use of our discord channel and/or site forums. I think it would be helpful for you to team up with a willing member to improve your abilities.  That way, your next submission can be more successful.

[div class=p 
	"As it stands, I cannot accept this work...since there is already a known WIP that is 1700+ frames ahead of yours.  Rejecting.
