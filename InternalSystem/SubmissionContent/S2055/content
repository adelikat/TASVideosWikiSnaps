	"Shadow of the Beast is a game with gorgeous graphics and awesome music. The gameplay is a little harsh, not giving you a lot of time to attack enemies before being attacked yourself, and having many different paths you could follow, most of them being the wrong ones.

	"I recorded this TAS over 2 years ago, and there still isn't a SotB run on here, so here it is. I don't know of any glitches in this game, so this is a straightforward speed run. This was fairly straightforward to make after looking at guides to plan the route, the main challenge was finding out where to save time by trading damage.

Fortunately the difference between these two positions is only 2-3 frames. Near the end of the fight I jump out and then run back in with the last shot. This actually saves time. Retreating before the fireball and then moving back in actually takes more frames to kill this guy.

However, the game itself is interesting, and a more optimized version would likely make a good addition to the TASvideos collection. Rejecting this, and good luck on your next try!
