	"I'm going to open up and say I tried to entertain the audience than the last run, also I tried to do things different to the last run.

[p 
	"One level I did worse compared to the previous run was the milk level. The reason being I received more input lag since I was TASsing as 2 player and overall my score became much lower... 71 to be exact the total could've been 72 but instead of taking milk I chose to sacrifice 1 for entertainment so I deliberately stuffed up.

[p 
	"I hate that microphone level to hell and back and then to hell again, the max score is 114 and the last run didn't even make it to that number, that level took the most time to finish (6 months to be exact (all the raging and other stuff) ), due to the fact that doing this perfect with player 1 and 2 is a pain in the butt, you need to make sure of all this stupid precise timing on going point A to point B then to C (NEVER AGAIN!).

	"The stamp level was so damn precise I'm glad I got that done quickly.

	"In the virus level the setup is different compared to the last TAS, my score is lower because of this... so I decided to show a 3-way tie.

	"The sliding Beer to that hot girl... I went for the first girl and manipulated player 3 to stuff up (I didn't notice the manipulation until I did player 2's one a frame later) or else I would've lost that.

	"The running for the train level isn't improvable I got the exact same time (10.62) using different methods... so I decided to do random points to jump.
