	"Burger time is a game for the Atari 2600 where you play as the chef trying to collect "burgers" (brown spinning square) before the enemies do, like the yellow square, the enemy in the top left, and the silver square.

	"I don't really know what to say. I found this game yesterday when I was looking for a game to TAS for April Fools, and stumbled upon this game. I thought it would be one of the regular crap Atari games that you just can't TAS at all, but turns out it was an actual game, and not something like brain games where you can't even do anything.

	"This game is....weird. You have some other squares that try and get the "burger" before you, and this weird enemy looking thing in the top left. I tested it out and the enemy doesn't really do anything to you, nor do the other squares, so honestly, I don't know their purpose.

	"This TAS beats all 5 loops of the game, but in each loop, the enemy in the top left gets very slightly faster.

	"I honestly don't have anything else to say about this game, except for the fact that the enemies don't even hurt you. It's very weird.

	"There are 5 loops in this game, but when you complete the 5th loop, the game gets stuck on that screen you see in the video. Since the game doesn't know what to do after the 5 loops, it just stays on that screen.

	"I originally thought that this game would be something like Brain Games or Basic Math (both for the A2600) where you can't even do anything, they are just stuck on 1 screen. But nope, it's an actual game, and it was fun to TAS. This TAS took me about 1 day, from 2pm on March 31 to around 5 am today.

	"This is my second ever non-april fools submission, so I still don't know what to write here, so all I'll say is, I understand if this gets rejected, it's kind of like C64 Snoopy where it's very repetitive.
