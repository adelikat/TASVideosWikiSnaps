	"The Legendary Axe is about a man, his axe, an evil cult leader, and its human sacrifice. your goal in this game is to rescue your childhood friend Flare from the evil Jagu.  In normal play this game requires careful strategy such as waiting for the right timing or jumping backwards over fireballs.  But in this video its more about hacking relentlessly at the enemies.

	"In this game you move slightly faster when jumping then when walking so I tried to stay in the air when moving, of course that wasn't always possible. At the end of every level there is a health count down and

I can usually prevent the damage stun by being in an upward motion of my jump when getting hit. Also by jumping off vines with the right timing I could get a lot of speed and keep it by jumping on the frame I land.

	"Nothing special, getting the wings and crown from the spider isn't worth the extra time it takes to kill him.  I emptied my life on the bears.  Could have been about 30 frames faster by avoiding some lengthy damage on the bears, but I couldn't get it to sync up.  I have to wait for the level complete music to finish before the level loads out so not being as far to the right as possible didn't waste any time.

	"Man this level is laggy as hell, I try and kill a lot of enemies to avoid some lag, I think I may have overestimated the usefulness of killing enemies in later levels though as it seems simply swinging your axe causes a frame of lag I didn't realize this until just at the end of the game though.  I let the first boulder hit me so that I can jump through it and attack the second one sooner. near the end of the level is the first time I use the vine swing glitch.  I probably could have taken some more damage earlier in the level.

	"After grabbing my second set of wings the fastest way to kill enemies is to attack as fast as possible. The reason why I took the lower path was to avoid the rock enemies above. I think I could have taken a bit of damage from the birds in 3A. In 3B there is a very impressive use of swinging vines.  I skip the lengthy scene that gives you a crown.

	"I waste a bit of time to manipulate an idol into being a crown giving me full power.  At 16 times the damage of an empty bar a full charge is very useful against bosses, but it causes a half second of freezetime so I have to avoid using it unnecesarily. I noticed destroying those three idols at the end caused the explosion to take longer.  The walk to the end of the level is so long that the music ends before I get there so I have to be on the far right side of the screen.

I don't have to worry about having high health at the end of the zone, but I'm already out of health by the entrance and have to do lower jumps to avoid the bats in 5A.  Jumping close to the doors means he doesn't have to walk as far for the door to start closing.
