	"The Legendary Axe is about a man, his axe, an evil cult leader, and its human sacrifice. your goal in this game is to rescue your childhood friend Flare from the evil Jagu.  In normal play this game requires careful strategy such as waiting for the right timing or jumping backwards over fireballs.  But in this video its more about hacking relentlessly at the enemies.

I can usually prevent the damage stun by being in an upward motion of my jump when getting hit. Also by jumping off vines with the right timing I could get a lot of speed and keep it by jumping on the frame I land.

Could have been about 30 frames faster by avoiding some lengthy damage on the bears, but I couldn't get it to sync up.  I have to wait for the level complete music to finish before the level loads out so not being as far to the right as possible didn't waste any time.

I let the first boulder hit me so that I can jump through it and attack the second one sooner. near the end of the level is the first time I use the vine swing glitch.  I probably could have taken some more damage earlier in the level.

At 16 times the damage of an empty bar a full charge is very useful against bosses, but it causes a half second of freezetime so I have to avoid using it unnecesarily.
