	"But anyway, it's pretty straight forward. First of all, all of the jumping is courtesy of thommy3 for finding the x-speed address (005E), and finding that regular rolling speed is 42, but in the air it fluctuates. He speculated that maximizing air time would be fastest, but I found that you gain a pixel or so by jumping again instead staying in the air, so I'd guess that it saves about a frame.
	$LF
	"The jumping looks clunky because the game doesn't even register that you've jumped until you've held the A button for 4 freaking frames, and you can only start jumping (at least again) the frame after you've begun your rolling animation. So that's 5 frames per jump on the ground.

	"The suburb and subway levels were all straight forward and simple. There might be some single frame optimization with pressing up to go through the door, but unless a new mechanic is found, that's probably all there is to it.

	"The sewer levels, however, gave me the biggest headache. It's easy to clip your head on the squares protruding out of the ceiling, and the platforms are spaced far enough that you need a high jump. So, I had to balance my jumps to get to the appropriate platform without clipping the ceiling or another platform. Because of all of this, sometimes I do wait to jump; this really can't be avoided if the aim is to jump (some enemies force this too).

	"There is one spot in level 9 where I slow down to grab a ledge. This is because the platforms are spaced so far apart that even at the last spot where I can jump, even the highest jump doesn't get me there, and my speed is massive, so I needed to press left for 10 frames to be able to grab the ledge on the ground.

	"But, all in all, for a "bad" game, it was a fun TAS, and as my first non-Atari TAS, I'll probably learn from it.
