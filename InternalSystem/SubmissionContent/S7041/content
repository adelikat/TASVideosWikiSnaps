	"The old strategy was to wait for the snake to let me into the tunnel and allow me to lose a heart on the second wall to explode.
	$LF
	"The new strategy is to take the damage directly from the snake and dodge the dynamite explosion field when the 2 walls are exploded.
	$LF
	"Still dashing to the left and putting the dynamite down at the first available frame to explode the wall, Lucky Luke would have taken damage, which would have killed me. But by stopping running for 2 frames and putting the dynamite on the next frame, it allows Lucky Luke to be positioned at a specific area on the x-axis that prevents me from taking damage from the explosion. and at the same time allows me to break the second wall. This allowed me to save ~50 frames.
