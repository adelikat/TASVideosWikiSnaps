		").I started making this run on Septembre 2012 and I completed it in 13m:48s due to following the all souls run route,however I abused all tricks that used in the curent run,but I wasn't happy with this time,so,I did a search to improve my first version and I found a new optimal route for Julius mode,including the warp glitch.All of that makes this version 2m:15s faster than the 1st version.Most of tricks can be found on CVAoS TAS Julius mode by mtbRc.

	": I find some strategies in this run a bit suspect - such as following the any% Julius route and executing the double orb glitch there, but not actually collecting the second orb, which seems like it should save time in further boss battles. Nevertheless, this run is well received, so accepting as a new branch of this game.

	"It should be noted that there's another run of this category in development by hellagels, KSeptuple and Pike which has a few different goal choices, namely choosing Hard mode and deciding to use glitches to reach the Julius boss battle and defeat him. The way I see it, these goal choices fit the guidelines about difficulty and the spirit of the category better, so a run with these goals should be able to obsolete this run (assuming it is a technical improvement on this run).
