	"This was supposed to be a practice run for me to get better at TASing. I then managed to improve it by 2 frames. I wasnt sure if I wanted to submit this because I was afraid it might have been too small of an improvement to warrant another publication. But some people have encouraged me tosubmit this, so I might as well.
