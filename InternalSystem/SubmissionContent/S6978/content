	"This unlicensed NES port of Earthworm Jim 2, known as the "Shin-Shin" version, was developed by the Ex-Sachen developer team, and was published by NT (also known as Ka-Sheng or Shin-Shin). Compared to the also unlicensed port by Super Game, this version feels more official, however this port's graphics seem to be confused about what perspective they're supposed to be.

	": For this submission, it was used a game version that is known to feature less levels than another known version. We usually allow to use any version of a game, with some exceptions. In this case, we're looking at an objectively inferior version, as it features less contents, so the version with more levels should be used instead. Since we can't consider an incomplete game version as a proper base for setting a TASing record, this submission has to be rejected for game version choice.
