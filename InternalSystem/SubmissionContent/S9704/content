[div class=p 
	"Another unorthodox championship fighting game with a steep learning curve. Here, the goal is to go up in rankings until you get invited to a special (underground) tournament where you fight increasingly difficult opponents. The final one, "the warrior", is a very strong, unknockoutable fighter. Upon beating him, you get the "best of the best" screen, which is the goal of this movie.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Between fights, you are able to train and improve your character to gain strength, speed, and endurance. In this movie, however, I forego this activity and try to kick and punch my way up while being as weak as a new player.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Instead of traditionals like Street Fighter, the pad buttons (except for left and right) do not refer to the direction to move, but a specific kickboxing technique. In total you can use a selection of 20 customizable techniques per fight.

[div class=p 
	"I started TASing this game manually, but quickly realized that, although I could find a win eventually, progress (and the movie itself) was painstakingly slow. Then I realized I could use 
	[a href=https://github.com/SergioMartin86/jaffarPlus rel=noopener external nofollow 
		"JaffarPlus
	]a
	" to brute force all possible moves until the opponent is kaputt.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"And so I did. The bot discovered ways to quickly and effectively disarm opponents, finding critical countermoves and bashing their skulls in record time. This allowed me to beat a single top-10  fighter in the rankings mode to get immediately invited to the tournament.
