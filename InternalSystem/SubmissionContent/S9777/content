				" Mouse Alley is an overworld mini-game not found in the professor's trunk about achieving high-scores by playing whack-a-mole with mice. It's ignored here because even though it does have a progression system in the form of ranks that get bestowed upon reaching arbitrary point totals on the total score counter, the final rank is given at 10,000,000 points. This would add near 30 hours, if not more, to the movie. That figure is only based on my own estimations though (based on how far I got within 10 minutes of playback), and may be over-exaggerated.

				" London Life is a completely separate game from Professor Layton and the Last Specter on the same cartridge. It's a social RPG in which you talk with and help the cast of all 4 Layton games that were released at the time. Help out different characters with their requests to earn money and happiness to decorate your own house with furniture, and accessorize your avatar with different clothing. That's all I really know about this game though, as I only played it once for about 30 minutes when the game came out. As such, I don't know what full completion of London Life looks like.
