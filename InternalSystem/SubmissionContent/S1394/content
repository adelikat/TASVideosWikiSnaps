	"In Puzzle League (Also known as Tetris Attack), you align blocks of certain colors and shapes into a row or column of 3 or more to clear them. Clearing them in a certain way can lead to chains which rack up lots of points depending on how many chains you accomplish. This is the best way to boost the score. My goal for this game was to hit the max score with a single massive combo as fast as possible.

	"This is a movie of the Puzzle League side of the Dr Mario/Puzzle League game. I knew this game better as Tetris Attack, which there is already a movie for on this site...but this game has a few differences. First off, you can move the stack while pieces are vanishing. Secondly, the max points is 999999 - which is one more 9 than the SNES version. Major props to everyone who has done anything in frame advance - thinking two moves ahead every step starts to mess with you head after a while.
