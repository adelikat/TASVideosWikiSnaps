	"Alright, so this one is faster than RTA most definitely. I didn't end on the final hit on Gum Monster, so that time still isn't accurate, but whatever it's still faster than RTA. This is a 22:41 according to RTA timing. 10 seconds ahead of the WR! So, yeah. Anyways, blerrrffff, copy paste the original submission text HAHA.

You can press Y to make him look up, backwards, down, and forwards. Pac-Man's mood changes in this game, too, based on your actions (or whatever happens to him). Happy, angry, wacky, and sad. Unfortunately, the latter two aren't seen in this movie.

	"The first objective of the game is to get some milk for Pac-Baby. This is quite a simple mission, as the milk is over to your right. However, the first trick comes right at the beginning here. You need to shoot the windmill so Pac-Man will run away. You have to wait until Pac-Man is a good distance away from the windmill. Then, you force him to look down. You have to shoot the windmill three times, so getting Pac to look down is just enough time for the windmill's blades to... fly off, somehow.

	"The next trick is the Cow Kill. See, when you hit the cow, it bellows an apparently scary moo. Normally, Pac-Man gets frightened by it, and runs away. However, if Pac-Man is standing right up close to the cow, it will swing its tail and whack Pac-Man. This kills him, and he'll respawn at the beginning of the area.

	"Pac-Man must climb the mountain to get flowers for Lucy. Why he doesn't just go to a flower shop or something is beyond me. Anyways, windmills are lame. So, I use bees instead. If you shoot the tree at a specific spot, a bee hive will fall out. These bees normally kill Pac-Man. Luckily, I make sure that Pac-Man notices the bees each time I do the trick. Pac-Man will run away until the next screen, making this section a lot faster.

	"After Pac goes for a quick fly in the hangglider, we come across the next trick. When Pac-Man is on the mountain, a balloon will fly up. If Pac-Man notices it, you lose time and potentially your run if Pac-Man gets sad. If Pac-Man gets super sad, he won't notice the flowers at the top of the mountain. So, the balloon spawns on screen, I make Pac-Man LOOK, LOOK to the left, he walks over and despawns the balloon, I turn him around. Now, the balloon won't cause any problems!
