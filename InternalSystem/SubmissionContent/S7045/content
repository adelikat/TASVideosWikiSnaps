Most of what was improved here was the ability to skip some eagles and better jumping around the cars.  The whole reason we're at the junkyard is to pick up a dog bone to use later.

So while I don't think this movie is any different from the existing ones, the feedback was Moons, and we can give this movie some Moons exposure so that more people could rate too, and then we'll see. Yes, it's a problem that we don't have a system that'd allow properly sharing the data between submission voting and publication rating (as people voting very often ignore rating afterwards). Yes, we're thinking about solving it someday.
