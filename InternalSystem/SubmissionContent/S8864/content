	"Since this game, among many other Action 52 games, is essentially an auto-scroller, optimisation is very trivial until we get to the boss fight. All we have to do is survive. Sometimes we have to move slightly up or down to avoid oncoming spaceships.

	"Each boss fight takes 94 frames starting from the first shot. The mothership takes 24 hits to kill, with 50 points gained for each hit. There's a 6 frame delay after the 1st hit because we're backing off from the mothership, but every hit after that has a 4 frame delay, as that's how fast the game allows us to press a button, due to it lagging every other frame. In Level 2, the mothership moves a bit faster, meaning we have to hold L for more frames, but it doesn't affect our shooting pattern.
