	"I have deduced from the comments in the discussion board that this game is not worth the second pass! As I feared, it's a bit too long and repetitive for most people's tastes. If it were 25 levels, I think it'd have gotten a more favorable response. 50 is pushing it. And 100

	"For the most part, the correct bubbles always come up, but there are rare cases where bubbles are wasted. As shooting a bubble does change which colors come up next, there are some moments where it consumes less frames to do so (particularly if I need two specific-color bubbles at the beginning of a stage). Along with that, there are times when certain-color bubbles won't appear at all until certain bubbles in the field are cleared out (this almost always happens in stages with water bubbles)

	"It's also worth noting that the collision angles on the right side of the screen are slightly different than the ones on the left. So a couple stages that have seemingly symmetrical solutions may end up having different strategies for each side. Don't be alarmed.

	"There's a chance I may make another pass at this run, but it will be a while before I'm able to do so. As it is, the run is pretty tight, so I thought I'd go ahead and submit this one to the Workbench, mainly to see if people find this game interesting in general. I know 100 stages is a lot. Is it too much? Let me know!
