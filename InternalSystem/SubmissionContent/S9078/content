	" is a biographical adventure game for the ZX Spectrum developed by Fran Kapilla (Sequentia Soft), about the late English entrepreneur and inventor behind the ZX Spectrum and many other products from Sinclair Radionics and Sinclair Research. It is a tribute to both Clive Sinclair and the creator's father. The game depicts the early years of Clive as he is about to start his career in electronics, with three different endings depending on the choices made. Initially released in 2021, it received an engine update for the ZX Spectrum 128K in 2024, featuring better graphics, additional content and AY music.

	": This game is certainly easy to confirm in terms of optimization, since there is hardly any non-log / non-input frames to apply inputs to. So input optimization can't be in question, but for the route...that is another story. Looking up some resources, I can't really say anything against your choice of route...since you seem to have done the homework and the plan worked well.
