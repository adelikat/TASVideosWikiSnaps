	"Overview of the Game:  Blaster Master follows Jason as he searches the underground for his lost pet Fred.  Game play is divided into 8 levels, and each level consists of the overworld and dungeons.  In the overworld you use your tank (and sometimes Jason) to find the correct dungeon entrance that leads to that level's boss.  After defeating the boss you collect a powerup for the tank that allows you reach the next level.  Here's an overview of the levels...

If you pause it while a grenade is hitting certain bosses the grenade will continue to hit the boss while the game is paused.  This makes defeating bosses 2, 4, 6, and 7 quite simple.
