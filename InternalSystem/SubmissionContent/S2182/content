	"As far as I can tell, it seems this movie is recorded in NTSC, but the game you are playing is in PAL. The result of this is a movie which plays faster than it should, and we do not allow that. Please see the

	"If you are going to redo it, make sure Graphics -> PAL is checked before starting to record. Also, I would check the boss fights, the corner cutting when exiting the swimming stage, and that you are well positioned when the screen starts autoscrolling.

	"I am not convinced that this game can be played entertainingly - nothing much unexpected happens, and the entertainment votes were low - but perhaps you can surprise me.
