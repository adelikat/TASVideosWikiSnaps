[p 
	"But you can't always reach the 65 frame limit. When you hit the enemy, it may start running away very fast, which prevents you from reaching it within the next 65 frames. So I intentionally waited for some frames, to make the sequential hits easier. The enemies in each stage have different AI, and their actions are not randomized. I included "manipulates luck" in the aims, although it is playing with AI rather than luck.
