	"While rewatching my run recently, I had an idea to improve Act 6 and in my quick test I managed to save 90 frames. So I started working on a new run on Bizhawk pretty much right away.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Because of timing differences between VBA-v23 and Bizhawk-Gambatte, this run ends up being 
	[b 
		"10 seconds
	]b
	" slower than the 
	(__wikiLink|1848M|previous run)
	". VBA skipped most of the screen transition lag that I ran into on Bizhawk, and also, the old 08:28.18 time was timed at 60FPS, whereas this new 8:38.04 time is timed at ~59.7FPS.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This run aimed to improve the remaining in-game time per level and I saved 
	[b 
		"170 frames
	]b
	" thanks to optimizations and new strategies. See the level comments below for details on the improvements.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I created a 
	[a class=extlink href=https://pastebin.com/H1qur9t6 rel=nofollow 
		"luascript
	]a
	" to keep a look at velocity and positioning, which helped squeeze some frames. I

[p

	"Sometimes I copy-pasted from the previous run. To do this, I dragged the

		".BK2

[h3 
	" Note about lag reduction
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Due to switching from VBA to Bizhawk, the in-game time became the main priority. But throughout the run I would run into lag frames that would freeze the in-game timer. At the Dragon boss, I could have gone for a strategy that had the fastest in-game time but it would also have produced tons of lag. So I decided to keep lag to a minimum at the cost of a few in-game frames, in order to have a better looking run. In other places of the game it wasn't a problem, because I would only run into single lag frames that already existed in the VBA run and were unavoidable anyway. Add these tags as you see fit:

		" Aims for in-game time instead of real-time

	]li
	[li

		" Fastest realtime (in levels only)
		$LF

I ran into this first in 2010 or so, when playing on VBA v19-22. Due to VBA versions prior to VBA-24m causing many emulation glitches at the time, especially in Gameboy games, and because I couldn't reproduce the bug on my real console, I was quick to conclude that this Dragon glitch must be an emulation glitch, too.
