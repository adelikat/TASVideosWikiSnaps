So I decided to keep lag to a minimum at the cost of a few in-game frames, in order to have a better looking run.

I tried quite a few things but didn't manage to reproduce this situation in Bizhawk, so I went through this level 1 frame behind. I optimized jumping up the slopes as best as I could, having the exact coordinates and velocity value in front of my eyes this time. But I still ended up equal to the previous run (I guess I did a good job at trial-and-erroring through this level in 2011). I saved back two frames at the end, however, for a net gain of 1 frame. I also used a new trick at the beginning to

The second present throw could be done like the subsequent throws, but the 1st fire doesn't despawn fast enough causing a ton of lag.
