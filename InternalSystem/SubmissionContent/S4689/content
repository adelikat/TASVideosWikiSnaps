	"This is a slight improvement of minor platforming optimizations and slight improvement to the Blue robot boss. However time was also lost in the re-syncing process, almost entirely due to slightly different timings of the teleporter glitch where Blublu's original inputs did not sync at all in the current version of FCEUX.

	"It really looks like the last boss (and maybe even the next to last boss) can be improved, but nothing I tried seemed to work. If anyone can improve it, you can be co-author. Or just submit it yourself, I won't mind, I was surprised how little I actually improved this run.
