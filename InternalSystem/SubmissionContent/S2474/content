	"The run is based on making big bombs and blowing them up. Some chain-reactions are used in several stages. I started from the stage 3 because I thought I could do nothing special on the stage 1 and 2.

	": A well executed TAS, but the game lacks enough variety to keep things interesting for over 9 minutes. The recent publication of 
	(__wikiLink|1399M|Tetris Blast)
	" might also have taken some of the novelty from this TAS. Rejecting this submission due to poor viewer feedback.
