	"The run is based on making big bombs and blowing them up. Some chain-reactions are used in several stages. I started from the stage 3 because I thought I could do nothing special on the stage 1 and 2.

	" might also have taken some of the novelty from this TAS. Rejecting this submission due to poor viewer feedback.
