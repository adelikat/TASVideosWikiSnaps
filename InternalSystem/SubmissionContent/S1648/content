	"If you watch the japanese version of this game for the first time, it seems quite different from the US version. But if you look closer, you'll notice they are almost exactly the same. The board where you play the game is the same, the background is the same, and the background music is the same. The only difference is the fact that the Yoshi's Island themed characters from the US version are replaced by a bunch of girls.

	"But I obviously didn't pick this version because of this difference. If you get a combo of 32 of higher in this game, you will gain about 33351 poins. This is roughly one third of the maximum score. This is somehow strange, since a combo of 31 (or lower) doesn't give you much points at all. This feature or glitch is not present in the US version of this game. In the US version of the game, the fastest way to reach the maximum score is by making long chains. In this version the fastest way to reach the maximum score is by making big combo's. Since both version have completely different ways of achieving the highest possible score as fast as possible, and because this japanese version can be completed faster than the US version ever possibly could, I think both versions of this game deserve their own movie.

	"This glitch/feature (obviously) wasn't discovered by me. I saw that someone pointed out a 
	[a class=extlink href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPcbVL2dTYI rel=nofollow 
		"youtube movie
	]a
	" in the US version movie thread, where the japanese version was TASed with combo's. It would surprise me if zvsp507 (the author of the youtube TAS) discovered this glitch (I guess it is just well known amongst japanese players of this game), but I did use the same strategy as zvsp507's TAS, so I thank him for his movie. His movie was rather good actually... I improved a little on randomness, some speed strategy and optimizations. The general stategy remained the same though. I don't have frame numbers, but his TAS ended up with an ingame time of 32 seconds, and this TAS completes it with an ingame time of 29 seconds. This movie aims for shortest AVI time.
