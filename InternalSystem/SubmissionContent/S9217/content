	"Bobbybob suggested a previously failed idea, to land in the door after clipping, which would remove the need for a ground pound to land on the seam. This requires clipping with a more specific angle and speed, but Migu found a way to do it with a backwards sideflip. Rupa and Migu also optimized the movement before starting the sideflip for both of the times 1 star door skip is performed. Rupa found that after the clip, it was possible and faster to jump to the railing and do an out-of-bounds midair double jump to the door. This was TASed by Migu with the new landing position from the clip.
