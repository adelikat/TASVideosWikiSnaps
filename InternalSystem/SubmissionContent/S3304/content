	"This game is Mega Man game which was rushed, with untranslated voices and bad translation. Some bosses were poorly designed and look like a mess as well. Some stages are also poorly designed, being impossible to pass with the wrong armor or character, or structure randomization. The difficulty of the game is

	"In fact, things in this game exist just to kill you, that's for sure. Not to mention that Xtreme mode turns entire stages into enemy soup. This game also introduced a new hazard enviroment system, wich means that a stage will have some enviroment variations depending on the stages that you went previously, some of these being incredibly annoying and some not being much of a problem. A Stage will only have 1 hazard at a time, meaning that if you went to 2 stages that would cause hazard in a stage, only the later one will take place. This game has 8 different hazards, and those are:

I also used the Invencibility Glitch wich is achieved by using Rainy Turtloid Power in a momment where you can't finish it because of an absent floor,in other words, i got a fast slide because of ice, used the technique, since i leave ground before it finishes, i end up being invincible.

The 2nd Area is an auto-scroller, this auto-scroller can be scrolled a bit faster when Ground Scaravich Power is used, wich is the reason why i used it a lot, also using this technique, you cancel your invencibility until you hit groud, so abusing this and Zero's BIG HP, i managed to use it a lot, i also used a full tank to replenish health and do it again.
