	"This is the most memorable stage to (almost) every gamer. I take the fourth pipe to the first star coin. I go in the pipe, get the checkpoint mushroom, get the second star coin, I kick the Koopa Shell to hit the Goombas, I do the slide-and-jump-while-ducking technique to break the blocks. I take damage before entering the first underground pipe. I time my jumps perfectly as I only need 2 jumps to get to the pipe on the left. The rest is a piece of cake.

	": As far as this hack goes, it seems to be well written, and there's plenty of rave reviews all around praising its technical feats and its play, making it acceptable. However it does introduce new things which aren't immediately obvious which should be mentioned in submission posts, as hacks are nowhere as well known as official games.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"For example, you should mention that you need to collect 3 stars in the levels, and only by doing so is certain content unlocked. As far as the run goes in this regard, there should also be an explanation on why certain levels were skipped, and what star road is, and why visit levels afterwords vs. the first time around. It's best if these things are documented, instead of forcing the audience to go hunting for manuals and walkthroughs, and trying to piece together tricky information on their own.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In terms of the run, the play does not appear to be as polished as it should be. A significant chunk of the audience found noticeable issues throughout the run. Therefore, I do not find this run meets minimum quality requirements for a first run of a game, rejecting.
