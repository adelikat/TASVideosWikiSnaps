As far as the run goes in this regard, there should also be an explanation on why certain levels were skipped, and what star road is, and why visit levels afterwords vs. the first time around. It's best if these things are documented, instead of forcing the audience to go hunting for manuals and walkthroughs, and trying to piece together tricky information on their own.
