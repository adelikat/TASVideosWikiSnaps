	"After pressing "0" to start the game and "4" to select difficulty (4 is the hardest difficulty, which is preferred for TASing), gameplay starts on frame 1. After pressing those buttons, the game starts a 5 second countdown before the race.

	"At the very start of the race, we move player 2 out of the way by holding L+F for 3 frames. This is to ensure that us (player 1) doesn't crash into it while approaching the first corner on laps 2 and 3. From there, all we have to do is navigate around the track 3 times while holding F. Holding this button makes our car travel twice as fast. Input ends on frame 1168 and we finish the final lap 3 frames later.
