	$LF
	"made.  Poor design, inane presentation, and a glitch that 
	$LF

	$LF
	"megalonia behind it as well:  The Cheetahmen were supposed

	"-There are many, many glitches in this game.  Unfortunately, 
	$LF
	"not many of them are useful in a speed run and would only 
	$LF

	[br

	$LF
	"--There are collision problems in this game.  I'm not

	"certain what triggers them (they seem to be connected to 
	$LF
	"recent enemy deaths) but on several occasions I walk 
	$LF
	"straight through an enemy without getting hit.  This glitch 
	$LF
	"doesn't seem to apply to the first level however.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"--Hercules (and the ordinarily inaccessable Aries) can jump 
	$LF
	"indefinately by jumping after attacking in midair.  I use 
	$LF
	"this on certain occassions.
	[br

	$LF
	"--This game cannot be completed.  Once the Ape Man is 
	$LF
	"defeated (or if you let him wander off the screen), you are 
	$LF
