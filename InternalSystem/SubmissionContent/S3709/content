	"When you land with a high downwards speed, Junior will make a small bounce/jump. During one frame, it is possible to make a normal jump instead, but only if the x-speed is zero. The bounce does not occur at all when riding an animal.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The current x-speed is frozen when standing on the club or holding a swinging rope. Only the position is changed, and when releasing the rope/club Junior continues with the previous speed. For this reason it can be beneficial to try to change your speed before grabbing a rope.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Lag works a bit differently than in most games. Gens built-in lag counter reports frames that no input is accepted on, but in this game the engine still advances one step. There are also frames where the game engine does not advance, but input is accepted (and not used). These have to be detected with a Lua script or by eye.

	"This game seems to save no global coordinate information of player in level, only position on screen in level and position in screen. In this regard it works the same as Castlevania Bloodlines.

[p 
	"When landing from a jump-attack with the club pointing down-forward, there is a frame where you can jump and continue with the club in that position instead of swinging again.

[p 
	"Junior has the same acceleration and max speed on the ground and in the air. This is true also for all the animals he can ride. There is no delay for jumping or landing. The only difference is that Junior does a small turnaround animation when on the ground, so it is better to change direction while airborne.

	"As in many games, Junior can attack without delay in the air, but has to stop to attack when he is on the ground. On the ground, the attack first hits objects behind Junior, then in front, above, and finally behind him again. Therefore it's possible to hit twice in one attack. In the air, the attack starts behind and goes overhead. If you turn around before the attack is complete (club pointing down), the attack restarts, again making it possible to hit more than once.
