	"The game is actually a direct sequel to the 2008 Prince of Persia reboot and the Epilogue DLC. Not exactly the most well known Prince of Persia game, it came into the limelight of the Prince of Persia speedrunning community when two gentleman who go by "Smathlax" and "CurlyJefferson" randomly decided to do a blind race of this game. While the latter understandably stopped playing after a few hours, the former was dedicated to completing the game and did so after a whopping 9 hours! Thus, the leaderboards were setup and Smath did a few more runs to push the time down. It was at this point that I decided to join the scene, the presence of more than 1 runner motivated both of us to find and document time-saving strategies. Smath holds the world records for both console and emulator categories at the time of writing this.

	"I knew I had to do a TAS of this game the moment I realised it had the necessary tools, but the deal winner for me was the discovery of what we call the ceiling clip glitch. I think it made the run much more interesting in the RTA scene, but most importantly, there were suddenly many many spots where there were timesaves that aren't really worth outside a TAS. The game almost exclusively uses stylus controls, other than the one button for magic powers. We often refer to it as being "potato" as it can be unresponsive and sometimes buffer unintended actions. Luckily it is not felt much in a TAS scene. The most exciting aspect of the TAS for me was to essentially to make a single player game look like a 2 player game by timing Zal's magic powers in the middle of the Prince's actions.

The prince cannot be controlled as long as there are these black bars on screen and any horizontal momentum he has is instantly killed. On solid ground the fastest way is to keep running whenever the game lets you. We see the crow enemies, which are essentially the same as rocks for the purpose of this run. Its worth noting that whenever we hang from an edge, we will do a frame perfect turnaround which lets the prince fall quickly skipping the hanging animation. Then we get to the first life upgrade door that the game forces you to get with 10 coins. I hope you liked it because we will never see these again in the run. We proceed further and we get to do the first "longfall", where the prince can fall any amount of distance as long as he has something to grab to at the end. Then we get the first actual combat. The game lags significantly in these sections. The fastest way I found to kill the yellow guys is to do the standard 2 hit combo and cancel the second hit by blocking. In the wall climb sections, constant jumping is slightly faster than wallrunning, but at the very end, its worth to just catch the edge by any means rather than doing an extra walljump.

On the floor, you can damage through them by rolling which cancels any kind of stagger. On the walls, there is no choice other than waiting for them to go in otherwise the prince falls to his doom.

Normally when 1 full HP is taken from him, he becomes invincible and goes to the next cycle. But by using a charge attack after a normal hit, he goes from losing 0.5 straight to 1.5 so the game doesnt register that it must be advanced. At 2 there is a hardcoded script to go to the next phase however so we cant skip more cycles by repeating this again and again.

Right now he has the ability to shoot magic balls that activate gems, and it is put to immediate use as we use one shot to activate all 3 at once to open a door blocking our path. An important thing to note about magic powers is that when they are use we immediately lose control of the prince, so to eliminate or atlest migitate that timeloss, we must try to use magic only when the prince is in the middle of an action. As we proceed, we meet the enemy who I would like to name "the most annoying enemy in the game". Currently the way to defeat him is slowly pushing him back with magic balls and then he will eventually be far enough that we can climb and finish him off. Spoilers, we will get our revenge against this guy. Remember when I said you need to kill all enemies in fights where barriers pop up? I lied. By carefully timing our position as the enemy spawns, it is possible to get pushed out of the barrier by the enemy which in this case just finishes the level. This trick requires a very specific requirement - the spawn point of the enemy and the barrier should be close to each other, hence unfortunately not possible everytime but luckily it is in a good fraction of fights. I will call this the barrier skip from now on.

We still manage to barely make it in the first cycle with some airstep shenanigans. At the end, when done from a specific height, we can directly reach the top enemy and finish the level.

There is a little ceiling clip later in the level and thats about it.

I am pretty sure every single soul who played the game would have found out about the glitch at this point because the intended way is actually so unintutive. Great level design and testing. There are also a couple of ceiling clips, and we unite with Zal again at the end of the level. I dont know if it is because we mash quickly but the render during the dialogue is hilariously broken.

	"This time Zal has returned with the power to activate portals, and that means some contraptions involving them. There is one part where we do a ceiling clip instead of making portals (which also saves time), I found it hilarious. At the end of the corrupted air segment, we shoot a magic ball towards a gem and switch to the Prince. This deloads everything near and Zal as the Prince is far. The cool thing is that every thing  including the magic ball reloads as the Prince nears the area and opens the door. And this leads to the end of the level.

	"This level start with one those annoying stonemen. We do our second intential death about at the first checkpoint for two reasons. The less important reason is that we get our health back. I would have tried to work around this if not for the more important reason - for some reason the boulders needed to proceed spawn much slower if we proceed without dying. I actually counted and overall dying actually saves about 100 frames here. By the way, Zal can stop and also control the direction of the rotating platforms which comes in very handy a lot of the time. Rest of the level is straightforward.

Great, seems like the game has run out of creatures to abduct Zal to force us replay levels. Atleast this time we can use Zal's powers to catch the cycles this time. At the first checkpoint, we do our third intentional death. And we have just performed the biggest skip in the game. Wait what? One may wonder. The game has put some boulders to force us through a different harder path through the level, but death abuse just despawns them and we can just take the normal path to finish the level.

The level starts with another troll cycle, but such is life. We see the flying goblin enemies. These take Zal's magic balls to take down and then its actually really hard to finish them off in one cycle, but if we start hitting them as soon as possible which is when they are airbound, its no problem. A very thematic level, but we finish it off.

	"Prince and Zal have merged into one being, who I will call 'dark prince'. and now we can eat ourself with elastic corruption and use it as a means of travel. And then comes combat. My God, despite doing 2x damage its so broken to fight as the dark prince. He has this cool combo that just doesnt hit properly when the enemies are at certain distances. So the best way to deal with them is to actually repeat the first hit of the combo. After every hit there is a small chance to be interrupted by the enemy, the best option for us is to just block it at that point. If the enemy has only one HP left though, its possible to do the second hit of the combo before he hits us and that will finish him faster. The enemies in this level were extra cocky and I had to block most of them once. Its actually painful how close it is to being a barrier skip, that would have saved so much time. And then come the moving platforms. The prince can randomly decide to jump off them sometimes, I am not even kidding. But there is some manipulation to avoid it and its not too bad. And thats basically the level.

	"Like I already said, I had a blast working on this. It made me appreciate this game more as I was forced to look at the little details it contains for being a mere spin-off. I have never casually played this game and hence didn't know the lore at all lol, but while frame advancing through the dialouges I thought it was a good idea to read it and I found it actually pretty interesting. There is definitely potential for improvement, the experience I gained and the technique I developed while making this will obviously help if I do a second round, but I will wait until a bigger skip is found. The ceiling clip I found and used in 5-8 was actually a new one that I found while making the TAS. So far I haven't found any big application of it in Worlds 1 and 2 but admittedly I have not looked at it extremely rigorously and there are 2 more worlds to test it on, so we will see.
