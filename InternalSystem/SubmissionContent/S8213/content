There are 3 areas of the palace, each with their own challenge. With each level increase, you find yourself battling even harder...as some things become more difficult to manage. With all the Ice, Fire, Roving Machines...you are certainly on a mission to prove your love! -NYMX (I had to write this, because I still can't find a manual or a page about this game!)

	"I do not know why, but this game was very painful to find any version. I eventually settled on a disk version, which was what I had in my youth. It is also the only source I could find. One problem...this is a "cracked" version, yet nothing is visible in terms of a title screen for the person responsible for breaking the disk copy prevention. Additionally, all my searches kept bringing up completely different game that shares the same name as this one.

	"In the beginning, I recognized that RNG was the key to getting the results that I wanted. I started writing a BOT to force that RNG, but it turned out that it was just easier to add the inputs...so this was all a manual effort. As I went through this game, I discovered some exploits that made this game lighting fast.

		"Ice Block: In the last scene of each level, building ice blocks gave me some options. I found that I didn't have to have a fully create a block to perform all the actions, as I worked my way up toward the goal; however, you can only do this to blocks that don't serve as a base for another to be stacked upon. Another point, is that during my turning animation...I was able to start building ice blocks a few frames earlier.
