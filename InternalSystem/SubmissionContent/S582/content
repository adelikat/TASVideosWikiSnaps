	"Emulator:snes9x-1.43, No Warps/Passwords, Dont take hit. Aim for Fastest time. The game is a game of memorization and quick relexes. The making of the movie was alot of work making ever hit/punch/jump percise. I think anyone would like this because if they have ever played the game without save state, it seems impossible.
