	"Easy Difficulty or better known as "Amateur" is used over Hard Difficulty due to the fact that there are no extra menus when selecting Hard difficulty. The menu selection costs a few frames of differences compared to selecting Hard, since the game already defaults too Easy upon boot up by saving these frames doesn't extrapolate the conditions laid out in the game's races, as each race has its own difficulty in a sense. The games ending is only a screenshot difference that says: "now try Professional" which doesn't degrade from actually beating the game since the credits still roll. Amateur difficulty (Easy) has the CPU cars way closer to me and way more in my way, which allows me to use different strategies that I wouldn't have had in Championship mode. This is why this movie uses it, as it goes for any% or (fastest possible route no restrictions).

	"Under normal TAS circumstances the majority of the movies here use the hardest difficulty also known as "Championship". With this, the game will automatically have the CPU cars far away from 1st and not being lapped right until the end of the race. By having this movie use Easy mode it not only shows that the game can still be broken with unintended glitches, which I think makes it more exciting and because having to adapt to unintended situations at a moment's notice can be a nice change of pace.
