	"Item duping requires having the item you want duped followed by a blank space in your right-hand menu. You charge up to throw the item with B, and the frame after you release B you hit R to switch items. This substracts 1 from the empty space, as opposed to the item, and thus, there is a newly created thrown item, as well as the item still in the right-hand menu.

	"While this wasn't the most difficult manipulation, it was still very important to the run. The random items the item seller has is decided right after the Book/intro disappears, so that means before the initial cutscene with Boken or the tournament. The need for the bomb is obvious, as this one bomb does the majority of the work of the run. The bomb does damage between 100-139, regardless of defense, and so it is extremely helpful during the entire run against high defense enemies.

[div class=p 
	"Initially, after I had read about the glitch, I thought the only way to get the Power Wine was to fight four rounds in the Colosseum, which I estimated would take 5 minutes. I questioned whether or not just using the bomb for the entire run would be worth it.

[div class=p 
	"To start, I the power wine drops exactly once in the 32,767 long RNG cycle. The RNG only executes 1-6 times a frame, with an average of about 1.3 times per frame. This means there are approximately 25,000 frames, or 7 minutes between each power wine drop, which I be killing an enemy on that exact frame, with no other RNG motion, to get the item to drop. I had to first figure out how the RNG worked, then, I had to record all the values the RNG took for 32K frames in advance (recorded on the title screen). Next, I fed those values into a script, and wrote all of those values back into the RNG while an enemy died, to watch it's drop. The first power wine drop is ~22000 RNG executions from booting the ROM. So, the final step was to track the progress of the RNG as I TAS'd, and watch for the power wine's RNG to come. I got lucky in the RNG loop progress, so it the power wine drop did not occur while I was in the castle, or in a boss battle. In the end, it looks like I only waste about 5 seconds to get the power water to drop, a far cry from the 5 minutes I had originally intended, which would have destroyed all the gains of the run.

I then manipulate the item seller to sell a Knapsack, which extends your right-hand menu by 1 row. This item allowed me to dupe both bombs and power wines at the same time. Also, I put the bomb in two places in the menu, to save time when flicking through items.

Later, Deatharte's green cloud kills me twice over, once for 83 damage, and once for 103 damage.
