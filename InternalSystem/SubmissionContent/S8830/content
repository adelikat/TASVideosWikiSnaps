	"I can tell you this...this style of the game was very interesting to me; however, the controls and game plays drove me nuts! Since this was written in BASIC, it was slow and not were near responsive as other games that would show up later in the series.

The magazine article shows that the last increase in difficulty, comes after you score 50 points. At 60, you get an clear cut ending...only to go back and do it all over again.

	"BOTing was the only thing that I could think of for this game. It was so painful to go through the entire round of 60 points, that I finally sat down to write a custom BOT for this. What it ended up doing was finding the right RNG seed, which I then modified manually in some places to use the "Smart Bombs" and/or shoot Up/Down over Left/Right (Due to the enemy distances being shorter). Well, after a number of days...the BOT never could get past its fastest spot...so I ended it there.

[div class=p 
	"There is something that is not so apparent, when TASing this game. When a human plays, they are holding the joystick and causing the game to run a bit slower. Because of that, the inputs have to be minimized so that the game can shoot ealier. This is one of the reasons why it was so hard to do this manually, so with the BOT...I designed it to apply 2 frames of a "shooting direction" until it actually fired.  In a lot of cases, the shot wouldn't fire, until it was cleared of any previous shots. Also, a frame or two was recovered when the "non-working" inputs were removed.
