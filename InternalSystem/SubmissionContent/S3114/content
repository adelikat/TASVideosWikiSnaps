	": While the autoscroller sections weren't particularly well done, they weren't horrible. Additionally, I checked, and sometimes the shots go through the enemies, and sometimes they don't, confounding what is a missed shot. For a first TAS from the author, I think this is a good job. An improved movie should focus on improving the autoscrollers, as well as the time. Accepting.
