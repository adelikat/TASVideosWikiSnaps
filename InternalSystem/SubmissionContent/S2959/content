	"This movie has been planned for almost 3 years,but it is hard to control 2 players with the bug.So some time I think to abandon finishing it.-

	"In the highway,I hit the last hammer robot 6 frames slowly to manipulate the appearance of the last robot so that saving 10 frames for this stage.

	"The fight against the snow boss looks a little worse than the others? 
	$LF
	"I have the same action and the same x/y position as the 1P movie.But no matter how I manipulate the luck.The snow boss and the red robot is the same motion.So the hitting method is different from the movie of 1P. 
	$LF
	"In the snow boss's stage I keep the boss in the right so that I can hit two times for 3 hits combo.It can be faster than let it walking left,even its attack will cost a little overwhelming time that I cannot hit.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Because I like the music of this game.Even though using 2 players may appear more enemies and it may cost more time.But for the entertaining battle style,I really have an interest in trying it.
	$LF
	"So watch the movie,and you may see all of the words I want to say.

	": The general consensus seems to be that this movie is sufficiently different from both the 4 player arcade version, and the 1-player NES version to warrant publication as a new category, without obsoleting the faster 1-player version, thus I am accepting this as a new "2-player" category.
