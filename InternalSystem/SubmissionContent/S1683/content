	"This run of Wizards & Warriors uses the re-use levels trick, where the player cuts through the forest in level 5 to return to level 1, and instead of playing the castle levels, re-plays level 1 - 3. Killing the level 3 boss makes the player complete the game. This also makes the player complete one level less than done in the full run, since level 6 does not have a boss.

[div class=p 
	"The 4 first levels are re-played, and eventually faster than they were in my full TAS, so they are NOT identical to my other run. The first 4 levels are about 500 frames faster than in the full TAS. The replayed levels looks different than the first time I went through them due to changed luck manipulation, or different routes (Such as the one in level 2, which could not be done the first time around, but was a lot faster).
