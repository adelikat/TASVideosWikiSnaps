	"The main improvement in this run over the existing published one is a new trick that preserves your horizontal velocity when jumping out of the river and off of conveyer belts. It also contains a neat little jump trick originally found by Diman that saves a few frames. The first level was played by Randil, who saved a few frames in it, the rest of the run is based off of Baxter's original.

	"Baxter's original run synced just fine on the latest FCEUX version. However, after I used Randil's WIP and patched in the rest of Baxter's run, there was a 3 frame loss at the end of the autoscrolling lava level. This was surprising since the level itself synced just fine with no added frames. Perhaps it was some kind of frame rule, but I couldn't fix it. A similar thing happened at the cloud boss, the first 6 shots synced just fine, but for some reason the 7th and 8th shots needed to be modified (although this didn't end up costing anything.) So maybe there is still something left undiscovered if someone were to dive deeper into this game. Diman also mentioned a way to hit one of the last bosses twice at once, but I'm not sure how.
