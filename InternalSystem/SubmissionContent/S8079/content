Runners OhNoes and CaneCraft figured out how to set up the hero to run right over the trap rug and gap, and how to run straight to the final door in Yorick’s room. Through running the randomizer we also discovered that it’s possible to unlock the hero’s movement and grab items off of Elsa’s desk before she is dispelled, which I did to grab the mirror.

I tested two ways here - NWNWN spawned a goblin that followed closely and required swinging further north to avoid a lock up. NNWWN spawned the goblin off screen enough that it was never seen.

	"Normally Baba Yaga will skip straight to her final script if you have the mirror in your inventory. We get around this by dropping the mirror when we enter, then “toss rock” + direction to enter the screen and start her scripts. This unlocks the parser and allows us to type commands. The full “get hand mirror” input is necessary to pick the mirror back up to avoid losing it, and we can then type “hut y of brown now sit down”. “Y” as the second word is necessary to give Baba Yaga the affirmations she needs and leaves us with most of the rhyme typed out so the only thing we need to do after being teleported out is to delete the “y” to say it.
