After acquiring the 10 bubbles, I pause on the frame the bubble counter reaches 10 (it does not update any faster, I tried) and purchase the shoes which automatically equip. As long as I don't die (guess what), the items purchased remain with me forever. Unpause and the run command (A Button) are pressed at once, so I can begin running immediately upon unpause. From this point on, bubbles are avoiding unless absolutely necessary, and upon several adjustments, the run is able to completed without collecting anymore bubbles. This does not include large bubbles, which spawn when mini-bosses are defeated and must be collected to trigger the level ending (each). This comes in handy as the large bubbles produce 10 bubbles which are not put to waste...

Various attempts were made at jumping into the boss door from two upwards diagonals (left and right respectively) to load into the zone before hitting the ground, however this was not even close from either direction and is impossible.

Different methods were used to attempt to make this frame perfect, however the bouncing from hitting the boss preventing reaching the ground and jumping back up in an efficient manner to where just staying on him and bouncing would not be the optimal route. I did get a pattern going this way by jumping on the floor and back up (difficult as the boss moves around as well even when hit and seems to be a bit more feisty as you move around ironically so), but ended up putting Louie in an upwards bump on a different frame as the boss died, creating a 20 frame negative deficit to collecting the bubble and ending the stage.

I figured out ladders could be abused by jumping on them as many times as you'd like, the level is laid out very cooly (is that a word?) and makes for a lot of awesome jumps. Damage is taken as needed until I run out of health and must ensure to finish the level without taking any damage, which at this point was fine anyways (besides the boss - holy hell). I also discovered you can jump off of ladders and did so as soon as I could (i.e. fall damage).

However this does require an extra jump, so if you're needing to run then jump shortly after, you won't be able to do this. (It'd have to be an instant jump) Note that this does not remove fall damage and only gives you a few extra vertical pixels of wiggle room.

It's probably my favorite thing I've ever TASed and the end result is nothing short of amazing. Between navigating the flying boomerangs and hitting the boss, I found a route that allowed me to hit the boss in as few frames as possible through lots of different combination attempts. Incase this part looks imperfect, remember that slight movements would alter my course into the boomerangs, and remember the millions of combinations not shown in the video but experienced in-person in save states. There's a reason for every movement.

Riding his back like the first boss is slower as you have tree branches to utilize instead of needing to fall up and then down to the ground, so a perfected route is used to get the battle as frame perfect as possible. At the end, I jump and run forward towards the exit, then turn back for a frame and boomerang him for the final hit before instantly proceeding. His death can't be seen but he falls into the pit and you can see the exact frame this happens on the USELESS score counter. His death spawns the loading zone at the end border of the level.

Those stupid platforms the monkeys sit on is super picky, and you have to jump on them at the right angle to use them (else they will not bounce), and avoiding them is impossible by a few frames of jump height. You also need to avoid jumping on the monkeys as this will cause you to bounce, preventing a real jump. Special movement and routing is used to avoid rubbing on the sides of wooden boxes which will slow you down. It's impossible (or useless) to do this completely, i.e. slowing your jumps to avoid rubbing them ends up costing even more time, so it's about jumping at full power at the opportune time to do it as little as possible instead.
