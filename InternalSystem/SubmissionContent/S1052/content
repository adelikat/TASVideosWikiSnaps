	"It is, in fact, actually slower than the single player run. This is the Japanese version of Contra (contraj.nes) in which there are added background animations (I won't spoil where, in case you haven't seen the game, but level 8 is creepy), a slightly better ending, and cut scenes and a map in between every stage, which you won't see. You won't see them because, in this version, they can be skipped, unlike the US version which takes a couple of extra seconds every stage. By skipping these, I saved about 22 seconds, and I don't want to sound modest, but it really wasn't that much work. Personally, I think it makes for a much faster paced movie.

	"I am troubled by some people in IRC's opinion that this run "gets a faster time by playing a different version".  This is not what is going on here.  The author has very conveniently given the exact frame comparsions, showing that it is comparaibly slower than genisto's run.  The choice of rom is because it is more entertaining with better graphics and less black screen time.
