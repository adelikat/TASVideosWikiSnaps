	[a class=intlink href=/Subs-List?user=eladogGames 
		"your submissions
	]a
	", not a single one of which has been accepted, with most of them being rejected for lack of optimization. Like, barely any optimization. I think there's a fundamental disconnect between what you naturally tend to do in TASes and what we expect on this site. Namely, this site isn't just for any TAS that you can cook up in an afternoon - this site is dedicated to TASes that excel in one or more aspects. And generally, we expect TASes to be the fastest or to be entertaining. If your goal is entertainment, then you should say so in the submission notes, but your notes are very barebones and barely contain anything besides the temporary encode. You should look at other submissions on the site to get a feel for what to write in them, because they are important in helping others get a good idea of your TAS and what your goals are. And even if a TAS's goal is to be entertaining, it still has to meet some optimization requirements.

	" We don't expect you to spend Herculean amounts of effort on a submission - just enough that you can't easily improve it within an hour. And if 
	[em 
		"you
	]em
	" can't improve it, but your submissions are still getting rejected, then you should show them to other people here on the Discord and forums to see if they can't improve it. And only then should you go ahead and submit. People here are friendly and are willing to help you improve your craft, if only you would be willing and able to talk to them.
