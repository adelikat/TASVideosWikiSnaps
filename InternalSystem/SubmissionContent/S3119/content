	"The jump attack to slide here saves quite a few frames. You can slide as soon as you hit the ground, and it immediately takes you to dashing speed, and as long as there's a ledge nearby, it saves time.

It also contains the first use of the "damage-cancel", where if you're hit in the right spot, it cancels the stun animation and puts you right on the ground, allowing you to jump immediately. It's mostly used to control jumps onto platforms when enemies are around, and it saves the time of having to land while overshooting, or having to slowly inch your way up to the apex of the jump.

Either way. The last hit being angled to the left is oddly the only way I could hit the boss without taking a hit myself.

	"I'm not *great* at being entertaining during scenes like this. It's much harder to do in frame advance, so this section was one at 25% speed, which oddly enough allows for more control. Game sound was also unmuted, which allowed for the musical slashing. The plane jump is one of my favorite parts. Any frame between 5900 and 5975 would be a good screenshot, I'd think. There's a weird warping thing that boct did in his WIP, but I wasn't near the right position to do it. Maybe version 2? :3

	$LF

[p 
	"The Orb Head miniboss... Way more fun unassisted. Aiming for time is a bitch because of his movement patterns and tendency to float out of reach. Your location manipulates him more effectively than anything, and this is the fastest pattern I could come up with. I like the last three hits, all as early as possible.

Kurtz himself is a dick, having variable inv.times (mostly when he's jumping), and casually refusing to be manipulated into a fast pattern (again, position matters here, but you don't get too much time to position yourself accordingly). His inv.time can be anywhere from 50 frames to 74 frames. Yeah. It's not fun.

The ceiling catch lets me go to the ground slightly faster than landing just before. I could travel along the ceiling but it's ultimately slower, as it's apparently not possible to ceiling dash there." That's what I wrote in the comments before going back and redoing the run from this point. It's actually quite a bit faster to land on the upper platform.

	"Jumping over the fire statue thing involves the screw attack, which has the honour of being one of the best moves in any game. I'm not entirely sure what it does aside from making you an invincible spinning beast. Well, not COMPLETELY invincible. Either way, my hitbox shrinks enough to make it through the top of the fire. Boct did it in his run, too, and no you can't just short jump through: You'll get hit. The screw attack isn't perfect, ya know.

[p 
	"Rock Tosser is boring, but that's the only position where I can hit twice per jump and not die to the rocks he tosses. I found out in my redux of this area that Rock Tosser only takes damage on certain frames of your attack. Utilizing this, I officially took him out as fast as possible and saved 10 frames.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I debated on sticking around and grabbing the blue health-up, but it doesn't seem like it'd save more time than it'd take to get it. I got a white one as a drop without losing time, that should suffice.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	""Had to kill the Cloud Runner to get the screen to advance." Another part of the old comments. Getting to the bridge earlier allowed a better set of enemies here, and there was no Cloud Runner to kill this time, so the screen scrolled immediately.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Also, I utilized the screw attack move here, most notably on the bridge. It shortens the height of your jump, allowing you to hit the ground earlier. It's also used instead of slashing, as it's much faster to do so on the upward slant.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	""Undead Princess is another boring battle that requires not a lot of movement. This is where speed/entertainment needs to be decided. The battle's more entertaining in boct's run, but it ends up slower due to needing to jump up to the head. This is the improved battle, which ended up 21 frames faster due to hitting earlier and not losing frames due to repeated swings. There's one point where I swing repeatedly, which costs me two frames, but it's necessary to avoid taking damage." The old battle was boring, I sacrifice 17 frames to make it much more interesting. The Undead Princess has a much bigger hitbox than her sprite details. It's kinda weird, but I don't mind one bit.

I delay the final hit, as it sends the boss to the ground slightly faster. That's one of two unskippable boss-defeat cutscenes in this stage. Yes, you need to see it for the lizard thing to take the eagle head. That is a really weird sentence.

	"Again, miniboss won't spawn unless the screen is clear of enemies. Not killing that fly thing (too lazy to look up the FAQ name) would've cost a few seconds, as it flies downward, into the miniboss screen, and takes a while to leave it. I'm sure sacrificing 7 frames or so to avoid at least 100 lost is fair, aye?

[p 
	"I... really don't like the minibosses here. They're pretty standard and easy enough to kill, but I just don't like how they are identical. They also both have their own boss-defeat poses, meaning I need to skip two. These two minibosses have no clear indication of when you hit them, so the head-bouncing is not only an "entertainment" thing, it's a security thing, since I know it'll always hit first frame. I originally used this strategy for the second one only (as it skips the first victory pose), but I figured it'd be faster to use it on the first one, too. And it was, by a couple frames, so yaaaaay.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If there's one thing that frustrated me about this stage, it's the mecha-lizards. They're hard to avoid, and screw attacking through them isn't an option considering they jump up in place when hit, meaning you have to overshoot your jump or risk getting hit (and in my case, dying). In the case of the second one, he just happened to be coming toward me, which allowed a good jump through.

	"Hate hate hate hate this miniboss. I attack him quite a bit earlier than you would normally expect, as he's vulnerable the frame the actual miniboss forms, which is a nice timesaver over the published run, but he has the Kurtz-like variable inv.times where it just randomly takes 6 more frames to damage him. It's annoying.

	"Welcome to the most frustrating part of the run. It looks relatively smooth, but I had a horrible bit of trouble with the mecha-lizards here, especially the one after the drop. Getting past him was a bitch and a half, but what I came up with was decently fast enough, I suppose.

	"The boss. It's boring, but it's the fastest way to kill it. A couple seconds were saved here due to shorter jumps, which saved 6 frames each time over a full jump. I call it the 7/3 jump, because why the hell not. B for 7 frames, idle for 3, then hold up. Hits the boss at the end of his invulnerability and lets you land sooner to boot.

I land about 27 hits on it before it starts moving, saving quite a bit of time. The boss has three points where you can hit it when it starts moving upward: Head, upper torso, lower torso. I hit these all as they were available, although I'm not sure which one actually affects the health of the boss, or if they all do.
