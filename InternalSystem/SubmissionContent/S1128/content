	"This is my timeattack attempt at X-men, a side-scroler of the most popular mutants of the Marvel Comics for SNES, and in my humble opinion, one of the best X-men game ever made. The storyline is typical: Magneto wants to destroy humanity, and the X-men, lead by Charles Xavier, need to stop him. The game is a simple beatâ€™em up, but most of the time you don't need to kill all the enemies to advance. Each X-man has some advantages over the others, and the choice for each stage isn't as hard as it appeared at first. Psylocke is the fastest, Beast is the strongest (highest damage rate), Gambit and Wolverine are in the middle of this. Cyclops is a good choice for a realtime game, but is much too slow for a TAS; however, you must use him at his starting stage.

And as soon as the second is destroyed, the fourth aircraft shows up. Therefore, i only need to kill as soon as possible the second and the fourth aircrafts, which leaves me free to just play around with the other two.In the bridge, i killed the aircraft while jumping, which made me fall at maximum speed.
