	"Finally we managed to squeeze last drops of bluebomber Rockman in our dry throats. Once again we feel great by rampaging and completing through this game. Everything started when FinalFighter discussed about Clashman's delay screen scrolling technique and I got excited by it. We began to find a solution how to save Item1s till the end of the stage. We advanced further and further and optimized Item1 rising speed in our way. I don't think this needs much more introduction than this because we stated many things out last time. Please read Techniques & glitches section and FinalFighter's comments if you're amused or wonder how few tricks works out. We began to understand new tricks fast because FinalFighter was able to gather much information beforehand about the whole mechanism.

		"Zipping with Item1, Item2 & Item3s
	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"These glitches are most known ones in Rockman 2. You can enter inside a wall by any of these items to start beging to zip throught walls. In my run first zipping happens in the Heatman's longest room, when I drop and place Item3 to left side of the wall and place Mega Man well before zipping. Rockman 2's engine thinks that you aren't supposed be in the wall and pulls you out, there exists few possibilities that may happen if you don't do they correctly like, you'll zip out of the wall because of the bad positioning, you got stuck in the offscreen because you didn't jump and press left in a correct time. Using Item1s for zippings are classic and they appears almost everywhere in our run. It is good to use 3xItem1 before zipping placing highest Item1 to a bit upper because you can jump on it to gain some time, optimized performation should save arond ~ 20 frames. Also it is possible to zip with Item2s and this only occurs in Bubbleman's stage last rooms when you've taken some damage and placed Item2 in a good position below the spikes and turn left when you are on Item2, it is good to find a good spot if you want to get your zipping longer with this technique. In the next room from the first Item2 zipping there is a corner and it means that if you place your Item2 up there you can zip throught the entire ceiling.

	"FinalFighter showed this trick a long time ago and demonstrated it in .mpg movie file. This trick was done in the second screen of Dr. Wily 2 stage which explained how to scroll/teleport to next screen by abusing lag. This was somewhat experimental progress back then but turning many years in the future these techniques are used almost everywhere. To get this trick to work it requires a glitch and good delay from soundcode. The original and most known founder of this technique is Terimakasih who found this from Heatman's boss room.

	"This is somewhat interesting glitch or a frame rule I found during my journey. When you hit your first shot be sure that it looks that it won't hit at the earliest possible frame (even it does) because it seem to make some kind of error or something in the game so you'll be able to hit Metalman few frames faster. This is a good technique if you want to break stage's frame rule. Also it seems that you can hit Flashman in the re-fight room by same technique.

After that you'll start in the uppest part of the screen when you select a stage. This is really helpful in Woodman's stage because you can't zip throught the first room really fast.

	"Our work is impossible to beat anymore in it's current situation, also there is no possibility to mimic Woodman's actions because we timed our actions beforehand to make it perfect so in a word everything is planned carefully from a scratch. Certain values are calculated from high ranges to find absolutely correct NMI aimings to sync with screenscrollings and delay screenscrollings. Item1 rising speed is corrected for their maximal states as possible and when needed to. If you want to improve this game you'll have to gain at least a bit over 10 frames between Flashman, Heatman, Airman, Clashman, Quickman, Metalman and Bubbleman stages to even think or imagine to succeed well in Woodman's screen and delay scrollings. In the Wily stages frame rules does exists, most extreme rule is in Dr. Wily Stage 3 because frame rule is 16 frames. In a word you'll have to improve 8 frames between Dr. Wily and Dr. Wily 2 to succeed to save 8 frames.
