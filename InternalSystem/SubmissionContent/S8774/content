	"34 seconds saved from the new route. On one of the platforms near the start, we can collect a few pipes. These can be used to jump off of to gain height. After jumping off of said platform, we use a precise item jump to land back on the platform and accelerate as fast as possible, saving about a second over the current RTA record. Then we jump onto the highest and leftmost platform and use an item jump to reach the platform above. Then we hit the control panel and head to the right. Here we find a hole in the ground to fall through. Down the hole and to the right is a staircase. Then we keep heading to the right until we find another platform with some pipes on. Above said platform is another hole. Here, we can use our new-found pipes to jump off of and tunnel through the hole to reach the end. Speedy’s TAS was 52 seconds, this is 18 seconds.

Then we use 2 objects to jump into the top corner of the wall and run straight through it. Then we head further to the right towards another wall to run (or hop) right through. Then we collect 4 more objects. To the right is a ladder, but we don’t go up the ladder - we use an object to jump onto the ledge. Going on the ladder would be slower because it stops all of our acceleration. Then, much further to the right, we collect Robyn’s backpack and go back left. Next up are a couple of vertical sections. We use an object to get onto the hat stand and then we jump onto the nearest platform. After this, we use 2 more objects to jump onto 2 cranes, then we jump off the 2nd crane onto a ladder. After going back and forth a bit on the ladder to gain height, we use another object to land on the windowsill. From the windowsill, we use another object to jump onto the ledge directly above us. Finally, we jump over the boxes and head left to return Robyn’s backpack. Speedy’s TAS was 58 seconds, this is 32 seconds.

The slight detour to get the first set of items loses about 2 seconds, but it actually ends up about 2 seconds faster than Speedy’s TAS after executing the new route. We also make another slight detour near the top to get another set of items. This saves about 3 seconds on the Aunt Figg fight as we can get in our first hits more quickly. The remainder of the time saved is from the better scrolling. I used Speedy’s TAS as a reference for the first half of the level, and the RTA record from getting the first set of items.
