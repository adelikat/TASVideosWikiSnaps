	"A Simple Platformer Game is a homebrew game that is exactly what the title implies. The game only features a single unique level design with the aim of the game being to reach the 'kill screen' after playing a series of variations of the same level that changes slightly, sometimes visually and sometimes the controls flip to make it more difficult.
