	"So today I woken up in my bed, except that I was Crash and Supreme Chicken called me and told me to TAS The Huge Adventure, so I picked up the huggest adventure I knew of, but it turned out very harsh because a pigeon tried to poop on my head but I killed it with a sword but in the end I won. But before I won, I had to do other stuff, in fact I also fought final boss, which was scary and interesting. But let's start from the beginning: So today I woken up in my bed and I was Crash and pigeon... Well, in order to fight final boss, I had reach him into space, because he was there, so I've gone in forest and in motorway and city and icy place and another place and in space place. I arrived on satellite which was like static housefly, I mean it was like house flying staticly. But I also walked below satellite, on Earth, or maybe was Moon, idk because I was busy fighting boss of final. He was scary and not interesting, but I was the one who gone to him so you could say I was interested, but I jumped on him many times but he walked right and left but I changed color but he shoot. But I won. Then THEEND but the movie kept going so it wasn't really, but then actually THEEND. But I also killed siren, sorry.

	": What we have here is an ingenious example of deception. A carefully constructed Tool-Assisted Superplay (referred to as 
	[em 
		"TAS
	]em
	") requires certain elements to be called truly exceptional. First we have 
	[em 
		"Tool
	]em
	" to be an important factor in deciding the quality of the content we're presented. "What exactly is 
	[em 
		"Tool
	]em
	"?", you may ask yourself or others. Do go ahead and collect answers to the question. To correctly define 
	[em 
		"Tool
	]em
	" we need to look no further than the next term in our initial statement. The importance of 
	[em 
		"Tool
	]em
	" is only given through the existence of 
	[em 
		"Assisted
	]em
	". The connection is thoroughly represented with 
	[em 
		"-
	]em
	". Notice how there is no 
	[em 
		"-
	]em
	" between the next two terms, showing a clear disconnection in the very nature of terms whenever spoken or written. Due to this interruption in the full expression of 
	[em 
		"TAS
	]em
	", we have a completely unique instance of 
	[em 
		"linked disconnect
	]em
	". These conflicting contexts in connection with creative craftsmanship can clearly construct a creation called 
	[em 
		"Cheat
	]em
	". There is nothing further apart than 
	[em 
		"TAS
	]em
	" and 
	[em 
		"Cheat
	]em
	", but the one link this disconnect has is 
	[em 
		"Deception
	]em
	". This submission reached the state of connecting 
	[em 
		"TAS
	]em
	" and 
	[em 
		"Cheat
	]em
	" by deceiving the viewer into thinking this to be a 
	[em 
		"GBA
	]em
	" game while simultaniously creating a disconnect by abusing the submission form in showing 
	[em 
		"GBC
	]em
	". With this in mind I will reject this run to 
	[em 
		[b 
			"Moons
		]b
	]em
	"!
