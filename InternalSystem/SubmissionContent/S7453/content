		$LF

		" Spindash release speed is controlled by how many times the buttons A, B, or C are pressed and how long the spindash is held before being released. The first button press sets the held spindash speed at 8 pixels per frame. Subsequent button presses raise the speed by 1.5 pixels per frame and each frame the spindash is held lowers the speed by 1/32 of the held speed value. The range for spindash speed is bounded to a minimum 8 pixels per frame and a maximum of 12 pixels per frame and the release speed only occurs in increments of 1/2 pixel per frame. Thus, it takes 6 button presses to release a maximum speed spindash.

This is nearly the fastest and most optimized route and ring planning I chosen. After getting the first emerald, I head towards the speed monitor to gain and maintain my speed. This route wasn't as optimized as it should but it is still the fastest way to get to the 2nd checkpoint. With that out of the way, we'll just slide our way to get the 2nd emerald. Now the 3rd checkpoint; this one was the most optimized route I have done. There are 2 routes, the loop de loop one and the above the loop one. The loop de loop one was 5 to 6 seconds slower due to the ring placement and not enough rings to get to the checkpoint. The other route that I choose here had a better ring placement(meaning it had few ring boxes). Now that the 3rd emerald has been collected; We can now finish the stage as normally.

	"The route I originally choose to begin with had less rings (about 3 to 2 rings). But by the power of 2 players, I managed to get Tails to get extra rings in the bottom path of the level, where the speed shoes monitor is placed. After getting the 4th emerald, I headed towards the left, where I was greeted with few rings and a ring monitor. After getting the monitor and passing the loops with great epic ness; I was once greeted with 2 pathways. If I chose the upper path, I would have more rings but reach the checkpoint late, but if I chose the bottom path I would have less rings but reach the checkpoint early. That being said, I choose the bottom path because yes. But wait; I am 3 rings less than to get the stars to appear. No problem, I'll use Tails to get the 3 rings that were floating where the ring monitor was. After getting the 4th emerald, I immediately took the top path as it had plenty of rings. After getting the required amount of rings, we get the checkpoint, enter the special stage and finish to get the sixth emerald. Now that we have 6 emeralds, we can know beat the bo- nope we have 1 last emerald to collect. After collecting the rings that had the same route as before, I managed to get over 50 rings, beat the special stage and collect the very last Emerald. Now Sonic can be

	"This zip was found by CubbyCubbyCat at the Classic Sonic Speedruns, they found out that it is possible to get a time save in this zone by going to the top path and using the blocks to make Sonic upwards and being at the very edge of it to get to the zip area. Forgot to mention, that part doesn't crush you. So after that investigation, Tee-n-Tee found an even better route and it was insane to begin with. There is a part of the level that is slightly open and that part, you need to make the game to think that you're on the top path instead of the downwards. With that in mind, the loop section would be open and you'll be able to go in that area without the wall stopping you. With that 2nd clip done, there is a 3rd clip that you have to do very precisely. Basically you have to go to the loop and make the angle where you're going to the right with sufficient speed, then you can or have to clip through the loop and meet in a ground where you'll find emptiness. With the right speed and subpixel (I believe subpixel is included), you can clip through the wall/block and reach the boss. This trick saves a lot of time. Done by Tee-n-Tee!

Whilst ducking down, make sure you jump at the right moment with the right subpixels. Other wise, you'll either die by the blue block, or you'll die at the bottom of the stage or you'll get stuck. This strat is pretty easy and tough at the same time. Me and Kaan55 got the same time :D.

And while the camera is moving in the Vertical Position, you now have slope glitch and you can now jump and go downwards to the path where the curve section is and zip through the level with great ease.
