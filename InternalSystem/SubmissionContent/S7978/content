The game was released in 1993 to a critical reception of some kind. AIM's other games include

The game stars Corque, or Kolk, or Colk, or Korque, or Cork, or Kork, or Colque, or Kolque, or Koruku, or コルク. Corque is a scantily clad woman with blue hair, a grappling hook, and pronouns of course, and she traverses through some stages in order to accomplish an objective of some sort.

I wanted a PCECD TAS under my belt and Castlevania: Rondo of Blood wasn't quite doing it for me, and this was the first game that jumped out at my while looking up some potential candidates. Turned out to be a fun project with a lot of reasonably interesting speedtech in it, and that's all I'm hoping for in a video-type game tool assisted speedrun project these days. As far as I looked, there is only

	"Corque normally moves at a blistering one pixel per frame, though there are a couple ways of speeding her up that are frequently used throughout the run, primarily through the use of her grappling hook thing that probably has a name that can also be transliterated a hundred different ways to mild comedic effect. The fastest overall method of movement under optimal conditions is swinging from grapple-able ceilings, however the key words there are "optimal conditions", which are not always available or even reasonable to obtain when they are.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The fastest consistent movement speed is something I'm just going to call the spin attack. This is done from a grapple, and as long as you don't hold down any direction you'll be moving at a consistent 1.5 pixels per frame. Holding a direction causes you to slow down, because that makes sense. The spin attack is usually optimal for vertical movement, allowing for much higher elevation, although only one stage really makes use of verticality. You are locked into a spin attack until landing, no breaking out in order to grapple again. However, you can bounce off of enemies in order to extend your spin attack time.

The closer Corque is to the hook upon contact, the less distance she will travel in the same amount of time. The game will still update her position every 8 frames, but instead of following the optimal pattern above, the first three can be negatively impacted by bad positioning.

[div class=p 
	"The main forms of attacking are normal hook attacks, spin attacks, and special attacks. Normal attacks are very quick and tend to be the best DPS against enemies and bosses with low invulnerability times. Spin attacks are only situationally useful, as they can't be done without a grapple spot. Special attacks are... interesting! They're performed by jumping and attacking while holding Down, causing Corque to swing her hook in a circle. If she's holding a powerup, then some projectiles will spawn based off which color she's using. Generally, this is slower DPS than well-timed normal attacks due to how long it takes for the circle move, but there's a property to the projectiles that makes special attacks a lot more viable than they sound. The spawned projectiles ignore enemy invulnerability, which helps significantly against bosses that stay invulnerable longer than they should.

If you happen to die after defeating the miniboss, the game will checkpoint you forward past the obstruction, potentially saving some seconds by not needing to wait. This ended up going unused in the run as I was unable to find any usage of it that would actually save time. I'm noting it here just for the sake of documentation.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"There are three main reasons why it didn't tend to work out for me: The first is that damage needs to be taken twice in order to die, and the first damage is fairly costly in terms of time. Either you lose a lot of movement speed by trying to take the damage during the stage, or you lose a lot of DPS by trying to take damage during the miniboss. Second, you need to set up the death so that you die before the miniboss does. This means you need to use a special attack projectile, and setting that up often costs a couple seconds on top of the first time loss from the damage. Third, you lose that powerup, and you might not be able to get anything back before the stage boss, and that often loses more time than the death would have saved.

Not having the ability to interrupt the spin attack probably hurts the most on this stage, as there are a lot of potential paths to take through all of the grapple-able platforms and that ends up getting limited by taking the half second or so to land, jump and grapple again after a spin attack.

	"At the end of every stage, Corque will automatically walk toward and jump onto a little platform. She will jump when she's a certain distance away from the platform, so whenever possible I want to land as close to that point as I can. Landing before it loses time from slow walking, and landing after it loses time because the automatic jump takes the same amount of time from when you land, so you're just spending extra frames in the air. Landing directly on the platform is not possible, as it only becomes tangible once the automatic control starts.
