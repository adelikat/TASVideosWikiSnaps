	"This is a fairly straightforward game to speedrun, as jump-kicking enemies 
	$LF
	"doesn't slow you down. I only take hits on the first boss, which makes the 
	$LF
	"fight go roughly twice as fast as it would if I didn't (because I'd only hit 
	$LF
	"him once per pass). All of Chuck's jumps are the same height, which can be 
	$LF
	"rather frustrating at times.
	$LF

[p 
	"This game has great music, especially levels 2 and 5. The sound effects can 
	$LF
	"get a bit annoying, namely Chuck's jump, but I suppose that's just me. And 
	$LF
	"any game that plays the final boss music through the credits (which repeats 
	$LF
	"once before returning you to the title screen) is a cool game in my book.
	$LF

[p 
	"The award for "most annoying enemy" is a tie between the mud-boogeymen in 
	$LF
	"level 2 and the snowball throwing *****es in level 4. The former always 
	$LF
	"killed me when I went through the game years ago, so I never saw levels 3-5 
	$LF
	"until I speedran them. The latter not only have invincible snowballs but 
	$LF
	"also tend to be situated right where they're the most likely to hit you. 
	$LF
	"Level 4 is a travesty because of them.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Normally, you get hit if you try to hit an enemy under you as you fall. With 
	$LF
	"a bit of luck, though, it's possible to not take damage. Chuck's range is 
	$LF
	"pathetic, too, making Simon Belmont look like a freaking sniper. Really, the 
	$LF
	"hard part of most bosses (and in fact, most enemies) is getting close enough 
	$LF
	"to hit them, but not so close as to get hit.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Possible improvements:
	$LF
	"Taking hits in certain areas (in level 1 and anywhere I wait a while), 
	$LF
	"though I'm one of those people that tries to avoid hits even if it takes a 
	$LF
	"little longer.
	$LF
	"Use of rocks. In level 1 I don't do nearly as well with this as I do later.
	$LF
	"Bosses. Some of them may be done slightly faster. The final boss is 
	$LF
	"especially weird; it seems to be random whether he bites me or gets hit.
	$LF
	"Timing of jumps: Early on there are times it may be better to jump earliy 
	$LF
	"and kick an enemy on the way down, since jumping later forces me to land on 
	$LF
	"the edge of the platform, inside my jump range.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Mistakes in the first two levels: 
	$LF
	"Level 1: Jumped off the big dinosaur too late; since I move faster than it I 
	$LF
	"should jump as soon as I can. There's also a bit where I jump when I 
	$LF
	"shouldn't (soon after riding the pterydactyl).
	$LF
	"Level 2: Snaaaake! The first snake I jump-kick could have been kicked a 
	$LF
	"little earler, so I wouldn't have to wait as I land on the far edge. I do it 
	$LF
	"right later in the level. The stairs leading up to the boss also could have 
	$LF
	"been done faster.
