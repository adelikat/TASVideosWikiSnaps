	"Pokémon Sapphire is a turn-based move game where stats (Level, HP, Attack, Defense, Speed, Special Attack, Special Defense), types, and type class (physical, special) are important. There are many items, such as TMs and HMs to teach moves, event-specific items, held items that influence battle (e.g. an item that gives you a chance to strike first even if slower), and the bike. Some of these items are necessary to complete the game.

	"The differences between Sapphire and Ruby are much greater than those for the first two prototypes of the first two generations of games. In Sapphire, you fight against Team Aqua, and in Ruby, you fight against Team Magma. Team Aqua is distinguished by the Water/Dark Pokémon Carvanha/Sharpedo, while Team Magma uses the Fire/Ground Pokémon Numel/Camerupt. Both have advantages and disadvantages; Carvanha/Sharpedo has low defensive stats compared to Numel/Camerupt, and is not as likely to cause SE/NVE messages, but has no double-weakness to Water (or anything) and has the aforementioned contact-move counter-damage ability, which may cause an extra message that wastes 1.5 seconds.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The other difference is the legendary, the Water Pokémon Kyogre in Sapphire and the Ground Pokémon Groudon in Ruby. Both have the constant weather-effect abilities listed above. Kyogre is more useful as it learns the Waterfall HM and has high Special Attack for its weather effect. Unfortunately for both legendaries, the weather effect causes extra messages.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Pokémon Emerald, on the other hand, is a mixture of Sapphire and Ruby in that you get to fight both Team Magma and Team Aqua in the same game. Also, double battles are often forced in this game, usually if you get two trainers to gang up on you. Why can't you pair up with someone? Well, you can in that game, but only on one occasion. The final champion in Emerald is a former gym leader in Ruby/Sapphire. Finally, you can get the legendary Rayquaza, but it requires a diversion from the normal route that takes time.

	"Luck manipulation is a huge factor in this game. It affects damage variation, critical hits, first-turn attack, hit accuracy if not 100%, the Magnitude attack, opponents' attacks (to some degree), opposing trainers' Pokémon order (to some degree), out-of-battle encounters, random trainers' looking direction, random walking people's movement, wild Pokémon's IVs, catching wild Pokémon, and others. Some opposing strategies can be luck-manipulated but opponents will play weaknesses when they can. In an opponent's Pokémon order, the first Pokémon is always fixed.

Because of this, Grass Pokémon are often sent out second as a priority (the first is fixed). Since Mudkip and evolutions are better used as a physical attacker, I choose the Naughty nature (+Attack, -SpDef) and its IVs happen to be very good as well.

The second Slaking always leads with Facade instead of Focus Punch for whatever reason, so I have to use a Super Potion there.
