	"Donkey Kong for the Uzebox was made in 2010 by Paul McPhee and Lee Weber. The Uzebox wiki says it tries to replicate the original as closely as possible. It seems they forgot a few things, however, as there are several things different between these versions.

	"The biggest difference is the ability to jump onto ladders, which saves time in this TAS on every available ladder, as jumping is faster than just climbing the whole way. Another difference is the ability to turn around in mid-air, but this isn't used in the TAS.

[div class=p 
	"Another difference is when removing a peg in the final level, simply stepping on them and immediately turning around is enough to get rid of them. This is very helpful in the TAS.

	"The reason it is three loops is because on the first loop you can only access two stages. At the third loop, all stages are available, thus exhausting all the unique content from this game.

	"This game is RNG reliant and I think I got it the best I could. There were points where I could do nothing but wait for fires to move out of the way, platforms etc. There were also unavoidable barrels and springs.
