	"A few days ago I submitted a movie 
	(__wikiLink|href=/8149S|implicitdisplaytext=8149S)
	" that solves a single level of Pac-Man, under the impression it was the fastest route. I was wrong since 
	[a href=https://tasvideos.org/HomePages/Randil rel=noopener external nofollow 
		"Randil
	]a
	" had already produced a much 
	[a href=https://tasvideos.org/Forum/Topics/5431?CurrentPage=2&Highlight=158406#158406 rel=noopener external nofollow 
		"faster movie
	]a
	" with a better route. Here I take that route and transcribe the pellet order into JaffarPlus to solve the level by having a reward function (r) with the following shape:

[div class=p 
	"r = #PelletsInPathEatenInOrder * 1000.0 + distanceToNextPellet
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The PelletsInPathEatenInOrder rewards the bot for every pellet eaten in the (reversed) optimal path, and not for any other pellet which is out of order in the optimal route. The distance to the next pellet is the manhattan distance from the center of pacman and the position of the next pellet in the route. The result is a movie that's 20 frames faster. I am in favor of adding Randil as co-author, if they and the judge considers it fair.

	"Regarding several comments my previous submission received regarding the unacceptability of the movie because it doesn't solve the entire game, I cite the recent 
	[a href=https://tasvideos.org/MovieRules?revision=58 rel=noopener external nofollow 
		"jurisprudence
	]a
	" on the acceptability of single-level submissions where the game does not have an ending. This case is debatable, since Pac-Man has no ending. I cite 
	[a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man rel=noopener external nofollow 
		"Wikipedia
