	"This game crashes on start with JIT. This can be avoided by running in debug mode, and using interpreter for the first frame advance (frame count should still read 0), then switching back to JIT. It will not sync if you leave interpreter on. It also seems to crash at any time in 32 bit if you switch to JIT. Mac and linux versions have not been tested.

	"The password HCRAYERT will normally put you in chapter 16 with most upgrade, and 200,000 hero points. However, by entering it at a very specific time, in this case ~24 frames before the white dot marker disappears from the map, it instead triggers the credits. This glitch was found by jlun2, but it is not known how or why it works.
