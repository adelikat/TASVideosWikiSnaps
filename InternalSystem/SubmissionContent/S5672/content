	": Hello and welcome to TASVideos marder1991. We are here to assemble the best superplays there are. However, your movie is best described as a casual playthrough which we don't need here. It's bad, it has mistakes, it's slow, and it lacks a clear goal. You are slower than people running this game without tools. You get hit. You have a questionable route. You seem to start with collecting all the dragon coins in each level, but then proceed to not collect the ones you didn't find.
