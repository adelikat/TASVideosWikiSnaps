	"This definitely was a fun game for me to run a time attack on.  What I wanted to do was achieve the fastest time possible, and combine that with the lowest passable level.  I think this movie is a good combination of both.

	"Time to last command entered was 1:30:48, and time to "The End" was 1:35:53.  I ended up finishing on level 11, which for the time taken, was the lowest level I could achieve.  I "had" done this movie three times, and finally realized the error of my ways on the 3rd run.

	"Thanks to Rincewind's encounter list on GameFaq's, I was able to modify my run to cut out approximately 10 "required" random encounters (ones you cannot flee from).  When you watch this run and notice extra steps, a few loops, or anything unorthodox (i.e. the Sea Shrine), it was done purely to manipulate the encounter list, so I wouldn't fight any more than absolutely necessary.  I was surprised at the fact that my 3rd run had approximately 12 more fights than my 2nd run, and yet my time was almost two minutes faster.

	"I'll admit, most will find this a boring run.  A lot of fleeing, and some lengthy pauses on the final command for luck manipulation, but the movie does have its highlights...make sure and watch for the first Kraken fight.  Done purely on accident, but worthy of a laugh.  I also tried to include WarMech into this run, but based on the way I ran the encounters, I had NO chance to pick a fight with him.

	"Thanks go out to Inzult...without his start on his run, I would have never motivated myself to do it.  Also, a big thanks to GameFaqs, Rincewind, and every other poster in the FF thread...without that encounter list and people's suggestions, I wouldn't have ever conceived some of the things I tried, let alone made a movie with them in it.
