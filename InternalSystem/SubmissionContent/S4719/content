	"It's finally here people! The new 100% TAS of Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee done in 1:01:35. This new run has been improved by over two minutes thanks to Shunpuk's discovery of the multiple backwards jump, using a camera trick in Paramonia, finding more ways on using the DDG and using the early bird portal closure glitch. In addition to all of these, Dooty has managed to improve every rescue.

	"Often abbreviated as DDG once Abe jumps or rolls into an explosive, it makes Abe invisible and can corrupt his sprite. This glitch will allow Abe to get past things that would kill him. Abe's sprite will show up after entering a door and wells will cancel this glitch. Abe will die if he falls of a ledge or gets zapped. A video made by Sligfantry can show you how this glitch works:

	"This glitch works by standing on the edge of the ledge and pressing the down button quickly and run towards a spot where you would like to hoist down. You will need to press either 'left/down' or 'right/down' depending on which direction Abe was facing.

	"By timing this glitch perfectly you can make Abe stop and turn. Combing it with the auto turn glitch above a ledge you will be able to make Abe do a backwards jump. This will allow you to jump backwards to areas and skip Zulags. In a 100% run it will allow you to get to secret areas quicker and it skips a section of StockYards Escape after finishing the secret area. Sligfantry's video can show you how this glitch works: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIo1TJUBGlo
