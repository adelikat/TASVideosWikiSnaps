	"I only got to Level 7 instead of 9, had no equipment at all until I got Erdrick's sword (but without the armor, I had to use all the healing I could get), died 3 times to return to the castle faster, used shorter pauses to avoid fights, and finished the Dragonlord with a surprise attack.

	"Getting everything to work out at the end took some more planning, mostly because I had to use all the healing I could get, without Erdrick's armor (ran out on my first 2 attempts). I had to go back in the movie a few times to figure out the best way to do it ... and I ended up with just enough, finishing with 1 HP and no heals left!
