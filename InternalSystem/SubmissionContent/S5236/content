	"I agonized over whether to take 0, 1 or 2 damage boosts from the statues on the way. They're not ideal since statues do 1 heart damage and taking the boosts limits the number of up-right turns. It's pretty close, but as the luck works out it seems faster to take 2 boosts and manipulate more life refills in Level 9. I was happy with that outcome since I think entertainment-wise it looks pretty bad-ass to go into Level 9 with only 1 heart.

	"Because of the number of tunnels and not needing to finish with full life, damage boosts are a much bigger consideration than in prior levels. Compared to the published run, my route gets 2 more heart refills and takes 2 hearts less damage to make up for starting with 4 fewer hearts. In a couple of rooms I made up time by boosting off damage-free bubbles. The room before the Silver Arrow was also slower due to luck and having 1 less bomb. Overall, I was 20 frames slower up to Patra.

Many tedious hours followed trying to match and then improve that time. Basically, the satellites rotate counter-clockwise and all must be killed before the main body can be attacked; each takes 6 hits with the wooden sword. So the key is to try to move clockwise around the boss as well as you can without missing any opportunities to damage a satellite (since you'll end up waiting for its invulnerability period at the end).
