	"The objective is to destroy the large enemy ship approaching the base. The ship advances at a fixed rate, spending a considerable amount of time off the right edge of the level before entering into the field of play. Going through the level as fast as possible and getting into position to destroy the ship results in approximately one second of extra time waiting for the ship. This excess time is utilized to destroy more enemies. The weapons available in this stage are weak or ineffective on small enemies and destroying all of them without slowing down is not reasonable. When the large enemy ship is destroyed, it explodes for a while and then the game advances on. This process is shortened by getting the ship far enough off-screen to unload, which immediately progresses the game. Bonus points are awarded for how far away the ship was from the base.

There is a medium-sized enemy ship in the area and it is not required to be destroyed, but it is worth a lot of points so this opportunity is not passed up. There is a limit of 9 enemies loaded at a time so enemies are destroyed before reaching this limit which would result in potential enemy spawns to not occur.

Weapons that deal higher rates of damage become more important as enemies here have more health. When approaching the entrance to the base, a trigger is passed to load the ally that will open the entrance. After some time has elapsed, a dialogue box will pop up directing Rex to stand clear. This dialogue is avoided by staying far enough to the right so that the game does not care to give Rex this warning. The reactor is at the bottom of the interior section of the stage. Most of the reactor never comes into view because it is quicker to progress the game after its destruction by unloading it with it off-screen.

The first half of the stage has a grounded ship with an impenetrable barrier and must be destroyed to proceed through the stage. At the end of the interior of the base, Rex encounters Rance again. Rance can take damage prior to triggering the dialogue which starts the battle. Rance would start moving to the left, toward Rex, and then upon being defeated, would fly off to the right. This fight is done optimally by dealing the final blow at the same time as triggering the fight so that Rance does not move to the left, therefore, moving off-screen and unloading sooner. Triggering the fight to start is required as putting Rance below zero health does nothing until then.

Voting response was not particularly great, especially after discounting yes votes based on the author and not on watching the movie. Accepting for the Vault.
