	"Also, sometimes the bot gets into an infinite loop, bouncing the ball repeatedly into a corner, because the game has no bounce randomness at all.

	"It seemed hopeless, but guess what? This is where the human aspect comes into play! I occasionally stopped the script and adjusted the position of the paddle myself, so that the bot would not fail.
