	"City Connection is a side view driving game. The game was originally developed for the arcade by Jaleco in 1985, it later received a  port on the NES in 1988. The story is fantastic, and oddly specific. You've broken into an exclusive paint store in New York City and are now on the run whilst carrying leaking 10 gallon cans of paint. You must inexplicibly drive over every mile of highway in order to make your escape.

		" Complete all six cities. True to the arcade style, the game loops indefinitely (the stage rolls from 255 back to 0). The backgrounds for the 6 cities rotate and do not reset when the stage counter rolls over. The platforms are shifted in later stages, but the discription of your world tour is in the game's manual and the progression of cutscene images between each stage in the North American version of this game suggests that the game should be considered complete after the sixth stage.

		" Balloons - collecting 3 balloons rewards you with a warp. The warp takes you to the next "stage" (increments the stage counter), but in the limited testing it did not seem to follow the normal progression of backgrounds. Additinally it is not used in this run since the warp animation is so long that it's faster to just finish the stage and sit through the cutscene.

[p 
	"The most difficult part of this TAS is the routing. The route is simple enough that stage by stage details probably aren't necessary, but the high level strategy is to keep turning and changing platform levels to a minimum. It turns out that the best way to achieve this is to work from top down, finishing each layer as you go. If platforms lined up in the right way it may be useful to change levels in some situations, but there were no cases like that in this run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If you hold up and jump, you can jump towards the next layer up, but if there is a platform in your way you'll bonk against the ceiling. It turns out that you gain control to turn around 5 frames earlier when you bonk into a ceiling, so this is used as much as possible to save time.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"You can gain a little extra hang-time during a jump by pausing and unpausing at the right time. This is used to avoid wasting time switching platform levels in New Delhi. Credit to L33Tz0rs (ツ ツ) on youtube who used this strategy in his good, but slightly slower TAS of this game.
