	"Level 1 - 3: 313 frames gained. Toad is used instead of Luigi, due to Toad being a lot faster in the first and last part of this level. Those frames gained makes up for the frames lost in the middle of the level. The bomb timers are active while taking damage, and taking damage against Mouser saves a few frames of lag, so taking damage is the fastest way to deal with him.
