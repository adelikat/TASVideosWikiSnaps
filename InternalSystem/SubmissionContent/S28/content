	"Conquest of the Crystal Palace is a teriffic but often sadly overlooked NES 
	$LF
	"game. I've made a vid that completes it in 17:10 (roughly) and never gets 
	$LF
	"hit. There's room for improvement (this is my first attempt at making such a 
	$LF
	"video) but I think it's pretty good. Made without slowdown, just lots of 
	$LF
	"rerecording.

	"It was tough not getting hit, and I could have gone faster allowing hits, 
	$LF
	"but it looks better this way IMO. The video is much cooler if you keep in 
	$LF
	"mind that the snowflakes in stages 2 and 5 will hurt you if they touch you.

	$LF
	"how to improve would be very helpful if you can spare the time. Thanks a 
	$LF
	"lot. I will probably work on an improved version of this either way.

My video is better than anyone actually playing the game could actually do, but after reading discussions about "shaving off frames" I've realized that isn't quite good enough. I'll save my submission from a flaming death on the poll by cancelling it now.
