	": This is like so many other Action 52 games for the Genesis. Basically, it's an "Auto-Scroller" where you dodge to survive. Only thing is, it gets harder on each level. The last one is the mix of mass confusion and the most interesting one to watch. One thing I want to point out, for those who haven't questioned it, is that the level is basically on a timer. It doesn't matter if you push up to crawl faster...it still ends off on the same frame for any given level...even if you don't do anything.
