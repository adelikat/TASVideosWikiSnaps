	"This is the hardest port of Duke Nukem 3D with a pased-down engine for a 16-bit hardware so it looks like Doom and Wolfenstein 3D. Enemies like Pig Cops, Assault Captains and Assault Enforcers have increased Damage per Minute (DPM) and it was hard to stay indamaged. There are 9 maps: all are pased-down; from the 2nd episode of PC Duke Nukem 3D.

	"I think it's the best FPS for Genesis. It has beautiful graphics, smartly copied sounds from PC-version, you can pick up thrown pipe bomb and throw it again, Duke can even tell you: "What are you waiting for??? Christmas??, if you don't press any button on your joystick for some time!

	"Generally, all the maps are passed in the fastest time and a little playaround added while waiting for the elevators. I used the fastest possible movement (running and strafing at the same time), now all the routes are the fastest and all mistakes are fixed, I used lots of AI manipulation to keep my health in normal condition because I didn't take much medicine. Also I found a good use to pipe bombs in Occupied Territory map and saved much time by changing actions! Another main difficulty is the control: no crosshair and turning speeds up (especially in Space), difficult aiming after strafing!
