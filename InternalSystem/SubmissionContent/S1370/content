Without this one trick, motivation would go out the window (Bospider would be the biggest offender).

[ul 
	[li 
		" X-Buster: X's native weapon, and the most reliable one. It can autofire, it does more damage when X is dashing, it travels fast, and it is the least likely of all weapons to cause lag. When charged to yellow level, it travels even faster when shot, but there is a delay when leaving X's arm cannon. 
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Storm Tornado: This weapon competes with the X-Buster in non-boss destruction, as it deals 1 HP of damage every frame. It has a larger hitzone that can hit enemies where the X-Buster can't. On the other hand, you must be close for this weapon to hit right away.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Fire Wave: This weapon would have been mostly useless if not for its continuous fire. Because of this, it allows charging up while shooting, so I can enter boss rooms charged even if there are enemies in the way. Also, it allows two less hits on Chill Penguin. It sometimes causes lag, however, when this is done. When charged, it produces a "fire wave" that travels along the floor and can hit Chill Penguin twice.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Shotgun Ice: A shrapnel weapon. Sometimes shrapnel is good (destroys enemies fast) and sometimes it is bad (prevents firing when shots are still on-screen; causes lag). It is the fastest-travelling weapon. When charged, it produces an ice platform. There's not much use to the ice platform other than doing more damage than otherwise.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Electric Spark: This weapon travels slowly. But slow is sometimes good, when you can fire multiple ones around and charge up at the same time. Add to that the splitting feature: when the spark hits a wall, it splits in two, with one going up the wall and one going down. Once it splits, it ignores level structure.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Rolling Shield: I didn't find much use for this weapon. I only use it when the boss is weak to it. Some non-boss enemies are weak to it but it rapid-fires very slowly (9 frames per shot even when up close). The charged form is only useful to pass through enemies up to a 7-frame limit, but charged Chameleon Sting is the better choice.
		$LF

]ul

[ul

		" Boomerang Cutter: A very useful weapon. It can curve up or down and hit enemies in inconvenient locations. It can pick up items (but I don't pick up any heart tanks or sub tanks, of course). X can lead Boomerang Cutters and have them circle around him, delaying shots on bosses and charging up at the same time. The downside is the possible lag, as well as the slow speed of the weapon (the shots come out of X's body!).
