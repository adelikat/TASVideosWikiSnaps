	"First things first - how do you move quickly without swinging? It's quite simple - wallrun! By running sideways on a wall and immediately releasing a fully charged jump, you can maintain a high speed... okay, I say "high", but it's about the same speed as swinging with no speed upgrades. This method of movement (we'll call it "wallbouncing") is simpler than swinging, with a much more defined skill cap - but the actual tricks necessary to complete the run are much more difficult without swinging.

	[li 
		"Similarly, if you stay away from a corner and then run on it, you can get a wallbounce that actually doesn't lock you to the wall, essentially meaning you can use the corner of a building to go at an oblique angle. For an example, go to 32:36 in the encode.

		"A "slyjump" (coined by user Slyfincleton, originally as a joke because the tech was thought to be useless) is performed by releasing a charged jump from a swing, crawl, or wallrun, and wallrunning a frame later, your jump will be stored into your wallrun - and when you fall from the wall, your jump will release and you'll get a lot of distance. However, doing this also puts spider-man into a strange airstate - if he wallruns after doing a slyjump, the wallrun will be extremely slow. However, if you punch in the air after a slyjump, it will fix this.

When enabled, the world moves slower than spider-man, and many of spidey's attacks are replaced with much stronger versions. By activating this for just a few frames, I can press the attack button for as many attacks as I want to buffer, and then disable spider-reflexes. This means I can utilize these stronger attacks.

If you push against a wall after a spin kick, you will cancel the recovery, allowing you to do ANOTHER spin kick... and as many as you want. Like I said, this only works on foes that are not brought into the air by a spin kick.
