Yeah, there may be parts of the game that can't be sped up...IE the circuit solving problems; however, The action scenes are very much the spectacle of this run...as precision work is done against every enemy and boss. From my calculations, this appears to be 37 seconds faster than the best run I could find. (None to be found on speedrun.com). Great job!
