Unfortunately, you can't get manipulate without costing time because Funky Kong converge it before the minigame for whatever reason. Strangely RNG is constantly changing while he is facing to your kong(s) otherwise it isn't. Spawn pattern can be changed to some extent by delaying fishing things so some big waiting especially first minigame was unavoidable unfortunately. Hand slap also advances RNG by certain amount steps and used it in Queen B to change barrel spawn.
