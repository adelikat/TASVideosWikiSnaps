	"Special note: For level 2, it could be ~1-3 frames faster by using the watch at beginning of stage 4 instead of fire bomb. Logically, the fire bomb should be indeed faster but it costs some time to collect it at level 1 because of some bad randomness and such. The reason we've decided to keep it is that there are so many multipliers on the same screen, at stage 4 2nd part, which is rare and weird. This is caused by some bug with the fire bomb only. Although it's not so important, using the firebomb gives more points than keeping the watch.
