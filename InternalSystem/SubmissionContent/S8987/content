	"Bonsai Barber is a WiiWare barber-sim made by Zoonami, a team led by the director of Goldeneye N64. Inspired by the Japanese art of bonsai and the barbershop experience, it involves giving charming anthropomorphic plants a fresh trim, with styles ranging from simple shapes to bizarre structures.

	"This game has a real-time system where you can only cut 5 characters' hair per real-world day. It also has no definitive ending. So the only interesting goal is to complete the Perfect Day achievement - getting five stars for all of one day's trims. It can be noted that it would be faster to achieve this from dirty SRAM to not have the tutorial trim, but I chose to start from a clean slate. It is also aiming for speed but see the speed or entertainment section below for why that doesn't matter too much in the end.

	"Control was difficult with this TAS. Despite TAS Input allowing you to rotate the hand cursor in the menuing, it wouldn't work at all with the barber tools; the IR control worked but not rotating with the orientation sliders. Instead, I did the cardinal sin of TASing and used a controller's analog stick to control the left and right Tilt found in Dolphin's controller settings (this also meant controlling the IR with the same controller). While it was a pain for efficiency, I made sure I was accurate.

But by doing Bristly Bob before Reg Wedge (yes, these are their names), there's no talking afterwards. So trade-off 8 frames for 20 saved overall.
