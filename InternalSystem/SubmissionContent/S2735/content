	"Brain Age is a puzzle game to exercise your brain a little each day. It is inspired by the research of professor Ryuta Kawashima. You will play a variety of puzzles to train your brain. Although there has been controversy over the scientific effectiveness of the game in keeping your brain active, the game got very popular.

	"This run shows you how you can abuse the number recognition program by secretly drawing the number answer in each picture. You can see random characters on Brain Age Check mode, and video game stuff on calculations X 100 mode. The latter mode, the run ignores the game time and failed to launch a rocket. This is because the run aims to be as entertaining as possible.
