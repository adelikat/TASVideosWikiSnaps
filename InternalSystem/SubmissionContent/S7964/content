	"Hockey is far from boring (usually.) There's a lot of "play" time compared to some other sports who have constant replays and generally get stopped pretty often. Hockey can go a long time without a stoppage.

	"So I threw all that out the window. I discovered a way to lock down the AI during the faceoff to where they literally can't do anything. 25 (this number varies based on what body types are in the actual faceoff) frames after the puck drops, two one frame A taps will freeze everyone in place until you "win" the faceoff.

	"There's about 3 seconds of gameplay in the 2nd period. We do have to score a goal after all, so we score the goal at the best possible frame (right after the clock hits 0:00) which skips the resulting faceoff and goes to intermission with the zambonis.

	"The file doesn't have to be replaced, because the fact that the NES core involved cycle timings for a bit was just a bug and it was fixed after release 2.8. Actual timing of the movie is unaffected either way, because NES frames have equal duration.

	"The game doesn't have an obvious ending screen, but it has a cutscene after the 3 period where the losing team goes away and the winner team celebrates, and then the game goes back to the main screen. I think that counts as a legitimate game end. You can continue playing to beat all teams, and that could be a separate branch, alongside a potential "maximum goals" one.
