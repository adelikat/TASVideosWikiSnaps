As a starting point, I wanted to use Xemn in this run for variety and because the glove is the coolest item to watch employed at high speeds.  This turned out to be possible without losing much time despite the extra character change and detour to get the glove.

	"Speed starts at 1.  There are 2 types of speed scrolls; normal scrolls are dropped by monsters and treasure scrolls are obtained from treasure chests.  Either scroll will increase speed by 1.  Treasure scrolls last twice as long (60s vs 30s) and have a higher max speed (5 vs 4).  If a scroll ‘expires’ without picking up another one, speed returns to 1.  Picking up a new scroll increases (or maintains) speed and resets the timer.  The exception is that a ‘normal’ scroll cannot maintain speed at 5.  Thus, if speed is 5, and a normal scroll is picked up, speed will revert to 4 when the timer for the treasure scroll expires.    
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Put simply, getting 3 normal scrolls without letting them expire maxes out speed at 4.  Temporary boosts to 5 can be achieved with treasure scrolls, but there are only three in the entire game.  Because speed returns all the way to 1 when a scroll is allowed to expire, it is very desirable to get a new scroll every 30s to keep speed at 4.

The precise treasure drops can be finely manipulated by collecting the cross on a particular frame.  Sometimes I pause up to a second or two (usually much less though) to get the cross and the right drop, but it’s worth it – to collect the items individually requires additional magic and time as you wait for each monster to drop off the screen.

It is difficult to predict exactly what timing allows this, but it seems to be possible with any block that can be moved at least 2 spaces.  Xemn takes a point of damage when he passes through and the block turns white and reverses direction.  This trick saves almost 30s due to faster solution of Xemn’s many block puzzles.

	"I get Xemn’s crown first to collect items for later crowns.  Unlike Walker Boh’s run, I get the crystal first and use it to warp back to the entrance after getting the glove, saving the long walk back.  I save a ‘crash’ by moving a block as I fall to the left of where the dragon is.  The combination of the air-jump and block pass-through glitches lets me blast through Xemn’s block puzzles.  I buy the key at a higher price than necessary to use the least out-of-the-way store.  I save time on the ‘boring’ screen by using the press up trick and moving the bottom blocks right, saving two pushes per column.  I crash after killing taratunes so that Xemn’s ‘crashed’ sprite gets to go through the post-boss animation.  As described above, to preserve speed, I get a scroll immediately before and after fighting the boss.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Lyll’s crown is next, but she needs to get the wings for Mayna.  I pause for a while on the screen above the wings to manipulate a scroll, one of the toughest drops in the whole run. Lyll needs the treasure scroll’s 60s of high speed to allow preserving speed after the crown – this is the only crown with no enemies nearby, meaning it is not possible to open the chest before getting a scroll.  Using the longer-lasting treasure scroll, it is just possible to preserve speed.  I originally wanted to buy a crystal at the store right before the inn, but that used too much time off the treasure scroll, so I had to get the crystal with Mayna later.  Lyll’s mad jumping and block-breaking at speed 5 en route to the crown is my favorite portion of this run.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Mayna is happy to start with all of her items on board, and uses the wings and rod to get Pochi’s crown very quickly.  Unlike previous runs, I skip the knuckles (increase magic damage 400%).  The time to collect and equip them is not worth it because the bosses go down in about 2 seconds each using the ‘stationary magic’ trick.  I wanted Mayna to get the last 2 crowns because her magic is powerful and the wings are very useful for gracefully tearing through screens and fighting archwinger and rockgaea.  Doing it this way I end up skipping a money bag, but I don’t need it and use very little time in this run going after cash anyway.  Pochi’s crown is guarded by treasure chests that do 100 damage; they can’t be killed without first touching them.  To avoid dying, I get a ring two screens earlier; the invincibility only lasts 10 seconds, so there’s no time to dawdle in reaching and killing both chests, manipulating a scroll in the process!
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Mayna’s crown is the last of the four.  The major difference from the last run is she starts with the magic key, saving an inn stay and the detour to get the magic key.  At the screen below the entrance, I kill a crab for a cross that appears to give me no items, but I actually grab a scroll drop from the monster right at the bottom of the screen, but it’s tough to see this in real time.  Because Xemn used a crystal earlier, we need another one and Mayna takes about eight seconds to procure one from a treasure chest.  On the screen with green blocks and a long row of doors at the top I kill an offscreen monster by firing down and left, which results in a scroll waiting for me right next to the inn.  At the start of the screen with the crown, I have to shoot the block and wait while it stops moving.  I choose my position carefully to have the block end up in just the right place each time.  I use crosses to get extra magic on two occasions which just allows me to get the crown with only one inn stay.

	"Roas’ quest is similar to the last run, but I save a lot of time by starting at speed 4, wasting much less time getting the last scroll I need, and a faster ascent using the sphinx.  Jumping just as Keela dies allows me to end input one frame earlier.
