	"After narrowly surviving the horrific onslaught in Raccoon City, Claire Redfield now seeks clues in search of her missing brother, Chris. To her horror, she discovers Umbrella Corporation's insidious activities are not isolated to the remote, mid-western city. No. Something much larger is going on here. Flesh-eating zombies, horrific beasts and now Wesker, a stranger from the past haunt Claire's every move. Just how far does this twisted conspiracy extend? What is Umbrella Corporation really up to? And who is behind this bio-tech terror?
