	"Despite being one of the more obscure games in the franchise, this game has actually had one of the earliest properly documented history starting with the 2008 TASes by none other than 'theenglishman'. The game wouldn't see any activity for another 8 years though, until he returned to do a 100% TAS, and it was showcased at PoPRuns. This sparked an interest for the game in the RTA community, and eventually lead to the discovery of the game breaking "Death Duplication Glitch (DDG)" by 7eraser7.

	"While an improvement of this branch was due for quite a while now with the new tech found by 'theenglishman' during his 100% TAS journey, my interest in it was purely based on one specific skip - Griffin 2/Absorption skip. This game is a pseudo-metroidvania and a new power that is hidden behind a boss is required to access a new level. "Absorption" is one such power and it is used in the run a grand total of just 3 times in the entire run, so naturally it was the best candidate for completely skipping it. The progression of this skip is itself a

	". It seems like 'theenglishman' has put quite some reasearch in the movement tech in the game, especially in his 100% TAS, so it helped me immensely to have it as a reference to know about all the latest tricks and mini-sequence breaks. I was able to find a couple of new parkour skips but the main show is at the "kill rooms" where I can skip large parts of the room and slow fighting required for some enemies using DDG.

It would enable us to perform the zombie glitch at world 1 itself. This would have definitely been worth if not for the fact that it is reset at the start of world 2. The glitch itself requires some time to activate in the first place but it starts to slowly save time over the course of the rest of the world. However, its not nearly enough to compensate the timeloss involved in getting it. It was worth in 100% TAS because obviously it has a lot more stuff to be done, but not here. Right now health management is not that much of a concern thanks to very timely heal points that can be found later.

	"R11 - This is a kill room where DDG is not possible as all the enemies are absorbable enemies. So we just kill the 2 enemies, and get the upgrade as well, which might have lost time here but overall it turned out to be a good thing as I was just leveled enough to fight the upcoming boss on par with the previous TAS. Also we get the last life heal flare until the end of not just this, but the next world.

[div class=p 
	"R12 - Some serious health management starts here. The goal is to not have to waste anytime to refill our health anywhere until we get into a position where are comfortable to activate the Zombie glitch without having to worry about losing it. It might be weird how having said that, I take like 5 hits in this very room that are quite avoidable, but the thing is, if I waste a couple of frames to save damage from those fire things at the start, I end up losing it anyways to the bats as their cycle is important. So effectively we would lose a couple of frames to save like 5 damage or so, but considering almost everything does like 7 damage or more, its not really worth.

Little does he know that he immortailized us for basically the rest of the game. We activate the life potion at the exact frame of death and it renders us immune to damage from traps and enemies alike. All the health management we had to go through comes together at this very moment, as we need to worry about it no more! Also lets not get distracted from the main picture, we just skipped a boss that grants a mandatory power, so what are we going to do? Lets move to the next world to find out.

This room is home to some really annoying enemies like the spear guys, the genies and so on who have really extended periods of invincibility, but luckily we do not have to deal with them at all. This room also features the clipping glitch which is surprisingly easy to do. Wouldn't be an Ubisoft game without things like this.

It should be noted that this is the case only because we have the zombie glitch so we can ride along with Griffin and keep hitting him in the air to decrease his health real quick. At the end, I had to wait a bit because unfortuately he is not in a state where he can take the "final blow" for a bit. Overall the fight saved time without the use of any collectibles!

Given that I try my best to focus on the run quality and also how much I tend to procastinate it feels like a bit like a miracle honestly. I would like to thank 'theenglishman' first and foremost. I would not have been able to pull this off without the base that he has worked hard to build. Special thanks goes out to '7eraser7', 'toca', 'Smathlax', 'DevilSnake74' and the RTA PoP speedrunning community in general, and ofcourse, to the TASVideos community here, who were very encouraging about this project right after my previous one. One of the things that was different about this project compared to the previous ones is the fact that I have neither played this game casually nor have done RTA speedruns of this game, not very extensively anyways. So I was a bit too cautious at the start to make sure I wasn't missing anything obvious due to my lack of casual knowledge of the game. As the project went on however, it got used to the game mechanics and it became just like my previous projects, perhaps even more comfortable thanks to amazing features presented in the BizHawk emulator.
