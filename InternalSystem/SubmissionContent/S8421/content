	"Whenever I got a new magazine, I was always excited when the one of the games was shown on the cover. Usually this meant that it was something to show off. Well, it was a decent game; however, this wasn't exactly my type of game. On the other hand, it was something that I liked playing enough. Being written entirely in machine language, it was certainly going to be tons better than the BASIC games published.

You will notice that you might have to adjusted a frame from place to place. This is because the game may have a starting point for the elevator that is one pixel off, due to the offset of a sprite carrying around from its last position.

This is due to the character's walking animation having a larger width, and causing collision with an elevator. So it becomes necessary to wait a moment so that the sprite animation doesn't cause a death.
