	"The "Reset Curse Glitch" room is basically an area that messes up the game for, to me, unknown reasons. If you reach the same area in the SNES version the game will crash. Here it will give you a couple of useful items as well as changing the way they work. Boomerang becomes very powerful, Cane of Byrna won't cost any magic (Though you have to use the Lamp once first before you can use it) and you'll die in one hit. So the method to kill the boss is: Throw the boomerang, make yourself invincible and end the movie.
