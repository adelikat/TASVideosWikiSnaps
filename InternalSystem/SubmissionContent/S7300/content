Their mission is to rescue Princess Kirihime who has been kidnapped by the demonic warlord Yoshiro Kuyigusa and his aide-de-camp, the rogue samurai Yukinosuke Riko, in an attempt to overthrow the Tokugawa shogunate.

	": At a glance it looks like simply using clones on bosses would be an easy improvement. But you still have to charge the skill to spawn the clones, and the movement in this game is

While charging you're also losing time you could be hitting the boss. And the shurikens are almost useless with their microscopic damage.
