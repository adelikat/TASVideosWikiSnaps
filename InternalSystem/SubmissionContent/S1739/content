		" Sonia is a woman.  ZOMG!  A FEMALE BELMONT?!  UNHEARD OF! (Though she grunts awfully deep...)
		$LF

	[li 
		" There is no scorekeeping, a rarity in the traditional Castlevania style.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Sonia has an ability called "Burning Mode".  This makes her temporarily invincible and also increases her horizontal running speed.  However, it can only be used once per level/life.  Also, when executed, it can not be halted.

	[li 
		" When you take damage, your whip power doesn't go down.

	[li 
		" You can get up to 5 Soul Powers, which are selectable from a special menu (the last one can be skipped, if you avoid the hidden level).

	[li 
		" Super Game Boy mode is supported, and is used in this run.

	"Since Burning Mode is refilled if you die, I take a purposeful death in Stage 4 so I can use Burning Mode on both Medusa and Alucard.

	"Because there is no score tally, I do not manage my heart count until the end of the game, where I beat it with 0 hearts left.
