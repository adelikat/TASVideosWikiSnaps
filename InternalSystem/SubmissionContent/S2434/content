	"Crusader of Centy is an old Zelda knock-off that replaces useful items with useful animal companions.  You can have only two animals out at a time, and some will combine their abilities for unique effects.  Despite being an action-RPG, very little killing of monsters is actually required other than bosses.  Most of the gameplay is centered around swinging and throwing your magical boomerang sword to solve puzzles.  This run contains gratuitous use of abusing slide physics, abusing wall collision, abusing monster collision, abusing the bosses, and literally skipping through many of the game's challenges.

	"This is my first TAS and it's quite a doozy.  I started almost a year ago but gave up in a few weeks, only to start over from scratch about a month and a half ago.  Previously I'd been using my keyboard to record the run, which was painful to say the least.  Using a wired 360 controller was much better, allowing me to hit all four buttons at once and mapping out frame advance, pause, and two sets of save/load commands.

[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Damage boosting:
	]b
	" Touching a monster repels you precisely at the angle you approached it from, so it's very easy to line up where you want to go.  The speed boost is reflected in what I call "Slide" speed, which adds with your controller momentum (the direction you push) to give your total speed.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Swing interruption:
	]b
	" Pressing and holding A usually swings your sword and begins charging.  Some things can interrupt your swing and allow you to begin charging immediately, such as a monster, a slide, or a spring.  This is useful because while swinging, you lose control of your momentum and slow down.
	$LF

[div class=p

		"Wall-hack:
	]b
	" When there is an obstacle next to a diagonal wall, you can squeeze in between the two to pass through, or press into it to force the game into resolving that collision, resulting in you being pushed into the wall.  If you end up fully in the wall, you are allowed to walk freely around so long as you stay away from legal squares.

If you make a long enough trail that the disappearing spikes catch up to the appearing ones, the spikes that remain stay there permanently.  Unfortunately, when I trapped the boss on a permanent bed of spikes, he remained invincible half the time and it took far longer to kill.  Touch Sense was so-so; half the time the fireballs were not co-operating, but I killed them both just in time, so the white-out happened early.
