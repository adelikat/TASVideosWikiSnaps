The intended method is to chase jerry to the end of each level where he will be cornered and you can catch him. But if you’re fast enough, you can catch him before the end of the level.

	"I’d like to give a big special thanks to wrayal, who inspired me to do the V3 of this TAS. Wrayal started doing IL runs of this game RTA and they found a new walk through walls glitch! They used this to improve their RTA times. The glitch can be done by letting go of right on particular frames when Tom is bonking into a wall. If you are not pressing right on the correct frames, you’ll walk through the wall. In RTA this will feel like tapping right with a particular rhythm.

]h4
[div class=p 
	"This strat is used in places where it's quicker than waiting for a ledge for Jerry to climb. Essentially you want to manipulate Jerry to lay a landmine, then after you hit the landmine you manipulate him to throw a bomb. Throwing the bomb causes Jerry to slow down a lot. Thanks to your iFrames, you can run through the bomb to catch Jerry. The timing on this is very tight, so you have to make sure he’s throwing the bomb at the right time in order to catch him. Usually the result is that you will chase him extremely closely and just barely miss him.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"To do the manipulation, I have the window where I start the level and the window after being hit by the land mine. Usually in these 2 windows, I start off by walking and then launch into a run. Once committing to a run, stopping loses a lot of time, so once I commit to a run I keep running until I hit the land mine or catch Jerry. During the walk before the run, I play around with letting go of right on particular frames. You can also slightly alter RNG by pressing L+R. A small thing to note about this game is that it only polls your inputs every 4 frames, so this drastically reduces movement and rng manipulation options.

I did manage to replicate this, and get Tom out of the right side, but he immediately died due to the death trigger on the left side of the screen. If this could be pulled off without dying, it could save some more time in the TAS.

Arnaud talked to me a lot in the weeks leading up to this submission about the game and RTA strategy, this was a good inspiration to stick with it and squeeze out all of the extra frames. Arnaud was able to help me adapt the new RTA finds into the TAS and suggested some further areas for exploration.
