	"This movie choice has been brought up in the forums a couple of times, but never really drew direct commentary either way since 2007.  In my view, though, this movie demonstrates feats clearly only possible with TAS (destroying on average 4.9 cars per second; 5.1 if you include the player's car).  For comparison, the unassisted world-record is 24.745 (played on PAL but time adjusted to NTSC).

	"One key technique is to boost off dead ships by crashing into them at the right angle after they bounce off a wall.  This can be quite tricky as you don't get the boost if you're in the middle of a side-attack (aka DT-R or DT-L) when the ships collide, and essentially all steering uses side-attacks (it's the only way to turn quickly enough).  Finally, both the rotation and relative position of the colliding ships affects the path the destroyed ship will take; the closing speed of the collision affects how fast the destroyed ship will careen away - so all of those factors have to be controlled for to arrange the optimal boost.

	"I tried to preserve the ships in their original line-ups and swing through them for maximum efficiency.  When ships would get out of position I'd try to use other ships to adjust them, using the same techniques used in setting up damage-boosts.  This was very meticulously done in setting up the "endgame", where the lead ship was forced to slow down by hitting a dead car, and then killed simultaneously with another ship.  At that point I slow down as fast as possible and kill the remaining 4 ships, which I'd managed to bunch together very tightly, at the same time generating speed to fly off the edge and stop the timer.

There are only 3 or 4 patterns;ï»¿ Golden Fox gives the best pattern where both cars break immediately to the middle. Crazy Bear, Mighty Hurricane and Great Star (heavier high boost cars) give bad patterns. Also, GF is heavy enough to kill easily, and lighter weight = faster steering - obviously important for this challenge!
