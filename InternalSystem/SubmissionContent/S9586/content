	"In my last submission, I explained how I lost 6 frames in this level and how I was unable to sync the run if I saved them. I luckily found another place to save time in "Celebrating Modernism", so I went back to this level and tried to see if I could combine both timesaves and still get favourable RNG in the Ivan the Terrible fight. Specifically in this level, I jumped off the first slide at the end section earlier. Outside of this level and "Celebrating Modernism", the only timesaves in the other levels were just because the lag frames were slightly different, so they had to be adjusted.

Even though I had to briefly stop, the high speed from the Scarab Ingot allowed me to outrun the previous strategy. I was also able to avoid grabbing the ledge and still get LightBurst, which was much faster.

I'd like to think that there's still more timesave in this game, but I currently can't think of anything. On the bright side, I'm quite glad that I was able to save 30 frames. I expected to save only around 10 or something. Apologies if my notes are lackluster this time around. I am very tired at the moment.
