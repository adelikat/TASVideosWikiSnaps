	"The goal of this run is to beat The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time as quickly as possible while completing all of the dungeons, temples, and Ganon Trials in the game and not taking advantage of the

	" glitch. The reason this goal exists is because it showcases a lot more of what the game has to offer than the heavily-glitched any% run does, but without collecting absolutely everything like a 100% run would, making it a rounded run that casual fans of the game should be able to appreciate more than the any% (where it's often hard to tell what's even going on).

	"Introduction
	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"I started this run in May 2011 when looking for a new TAS project. I had always wanted to improve Bloob's time of 2:51 which he obtained back in 2008, and I felt that at that point, the metagame had evolved enough that a new run was finally needed. I started TASing the game and played until I left the forest, and then I left it for a while because I still wasn't sure if I wanted to do it because I knew it was a pretty big project. After some encouragement from Bloob, I decided to TAS more, and by the time I reached Kakariko Village, I knew I wanted to finish the whole run, because it was already extremely different and much cooler looking than the previous run of this category. I slowly TASed the child section of the run between May and August, and when I reached the Shadow Temple (the first temple done as an adult), I started to lose interest in the run. There was a really precise trick in there that had to be done, and I was in no mood to do it. Thankfully, MrGrunz offered to TAS the trick for me, saying that he didn't mind doing it since he was the one who discovered it and therefore knew all of the tricks to making it work, which would save me a lot of time. After the temple was done, I stopped working on the run for several months. I seriously picked it up again towards the end of November, at which point I blasted through the entire rest of the game in just under two months, showing every part of the run to the Zelda speedrun experts that I talk to every day on IRC for criticism and advice, and finally achieving a time of 2:04. Although the Japanese version was used, it only actually saves 12-13 minutes over the English version, meaning most of the improvements to Bloob's TAS came from drastic route changes and metagame advancements, and a higher level of optimisation. I am extremely proud of both the final result and myself for being able to create it.

[h2 
	"Why did you play on the Japanese ROM when the previous run was played on the English ROM?
	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"The Zelda community has long since accepted that the Japanese ROM is better for speedrunning. It saves 12-13 minutes in this category alone through quicker text. We feel that the point of a speedrun is to see the game done as quickly as possible, and while I understand preferring the English version to play, using it for a speedrun when there's an alternative which is this much faster is just asinine. Everyone knows the Zelda story by now, and chances are, if you're watching this TAS, you already know Ocarina of Time decently well, too, and don't need to read what's being said in the game. In short, the Japanese version removes a lot of unavoidable waiting time during cutscenes and text, and lets the run get back to the action much sooner.

[h2 
	"General Tricks and Glitches
	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"Sidehopping: This is by far the overall most useful form of "normal" movement that you can do in the game. As a child, it's the fastest form of movement period, and as an adult, it's the fastest movement over shorter distances (backwalking is faster over longer ones).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Backwalking: This has its uses as a child (like when carrying a bomb), but it usually is slower than sidehopping. As an adult, it's the fastest form of movement, but its slow acceleration makes it slower to sidehopping in a lot of cases. Over long distances, backwalking will almost always be faster as an adult.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Rolling: Generally useless next to sidehopping, but still helpful in some places, for example, if a sidehop chain doesn't quite reach the door you're going to, it might save a few frames to do a roll instead of the last sidehop.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Superslide: This occurs when you roll and grab a grabbable object (like a plant or rock), and a damage source hits your shield at the time you grab onto it at. Bombs are good for this as they can serve as both the damage source and the grabbable object at the same time. It causes you to be propelled backwards at the maximum speed obtainable in the game, and it continues for as long as you hold R to keep your shield out. Releasing R causes your speed to return to normal. In previous OoT TASes (and in current OoT unassisted runs), this was the most useful method of travel, but it has been largely obsoleted by A-slides and Z-slides now.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Infinite Superslide (ISS): Also sometimes incorrectly referred to as "extended superslide", this is a reduced-speed kind of slide in which you can actually change angles. It's done by tilting the analogue stick very slightly to the left or right, then holding Z after Link begins to move. It can be done with any kind of speed, so speed that you get from damage sources can lead to what is called a "damage ISS". This is very slow and useless, though. A more useful application of it is to go from a superside into an ISS, however, this does not maintain the maximum speed that a superslide has, but rather almost halves it when you switch from the superslide to the ISS.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Hyper Infinite Superslide (HISS): This is just an ISS which actually has superslide speed, meaning it's a superslide in which you can change angles. Sadly, it has very limited use in Ocarina of Time (it can be done anywhere there's a damage source in Majora's Mask), as it can only be started if you enter a body of water at maximum speed and then exit the water before your speed drops. Doing this allows you to do an ISS, but you retain all of the speed you had when you entered the water. Because of its restrictive nature, it's only done twice in the run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Superflip: Also called a "megaflip", this is simply a backflip at superslide speed. If you roll into a damage source with your shield out, and backflip right as it hits you, you will be propelled backwards in the air at superslide speed. This allows you to cover large distances and gaps that you normally are unable to cover. A sidehop can also be done in place of a backflip (this is known as a "superhop", or, for some reason, a "megasidehop"), but it has much more limited use as a sidehop does not have as much height as a backflip.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Z-slide: This is the act of maintaining whatever speed Link has with constant Z presses. No matter what speed you have, pressing Z will maintain it for an additional 3 frames (1 visual frame), so holding Z for 3 frames, releasing for 3 frames, holding again for 3, etc. allows you to keep whatever speed you have for as long as you want. The obvious use of this is to effectively "superslide" from damage sources without the need of a grabbable object. This is started the same way a superflip is started, but instead of backflipping, you simply allow Link to be propelled backwards on the ground for 3 frames, and then begin the Z presses.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Max speed Z-slides aren't the only useful Z-slides, however. When backwalking up or down hills, your speed will often drop below its max backwalking speed, so if you begin Z-sliding while backwalking, you will maintain that speed even when going up or down hills. This saves time in various places and is seen several times in the run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"It is possible to change your angle while Z-sliding, up to 27 degrees either way, but doing this causes your speed value to drop by 2 points for every turn, so it is only ever done when necessary.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"A-slide: Originally called an "analogue slide" but later shortened to A-slide for convenience, this works very similarly to a Z-slide, but instead of pressing Z on and off every 3 frames, you are alternating between holding one extreme of the analogue stick and holding it at neutral, every 3 frames (while holding Z the entire time). An advantage of this is that there is no sound of constant Z presses, but at the same time, it does cause Link to appear to flicker in place because of the constant analogue movements (this is significantly more distracting as a child, and when you're an adult, it's not annoying at all). The biggest advantage an A-slide has over a Z-slide is that you can actually change angles from an A-slide into a Z-slide without losing any speed, and the angle which you can change has a much bigger range than the Z-slide does (45 degrees either way as opposed to 27 with Z-slides). This means that a fairly large angle change can be made in most slides without losing any speed. After the first angle change, you will be Z-sliding, so each subsequent angle change will cost a drop of 2 speed points. This is the closest Ocarina of Time has come to HISSing without water.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"A-slides and Z-slides are also far more useful than superslides because of the fact that items can be pulled out while doing them. This means that there is essentially no waiting time when starting another slide after the slide is finished, as the bomb timer will have already ticked down.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Superswim: This is essentially an A-slide/Z-slide while Link is in the water. The only difference is that the movements here do not have to be frame perfect in order to maintain speed. This will also be cancelled if Link performs his resurfacing animation, meaning that in order to do a truly infinite superswim, he must be hit by a damage source with his shield out after he's already resurfaced.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Hoverslide: This is simply the act of putting on the Hover Boots after maximum speed has been achieved. It allows you to clear large gaps at superslide speed. This can be done from either a superslide or an A-slide. If it's done from an A-slide, the A-slide must be continued while hovering or else your speed will drop. It cannot be done with a Z-slide, and doing one in the air causes your speed to drop rapidly.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Hoverboost: This is switching to the Hover Boots after a damage source (usually a bomb) has pushed you just slightly off of a ledge. There are 3 frames after this occurs on which you have maximum speed, so pausing and switching to the boots at this time will cause you to be propelled through the air at maximum speed. This only has one use in this TAS, and it's in the Forest Temple.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Infinite Sword Glitch (ISG): This occurs when a crouchstab is interrupted by something (excluding a damage source). This can be reading Navi text, reading a sign, or grabbing an object. It causes your sword to be in a perpetual state of attacking, so anything you touch while it's active will be hurt by your sword. It is what allows hovering to be done.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Hovering: This is the act of gaining height or distance in the air using damage sources (usually bombs or bombchus). With ISG active, shielding any damage source will cause Link to become fixed in place, and if he's in the air while this occurs, he will stick in the air until you jump down. With each damage source, the entire height or distance of a backflip or sidehop can be achieved in the air. This allows us to reach various places sooner than we normally would be able to. The most notable example of this is obtaining the Mirror Shield in the desert without ever actually entering the Spirit Temple.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Superslide Teleporting: If a superslide is done (with ISG active) using a plant before Link has any kind of strength upgarde (or something else that can be grabbed but not picked up) but the plant isn't actually destroyed by the damage source, then releasing R will cause him to warp back to it, however, he will be at whatever elevation he was at when R was released. This means that if you go up or down a hill while still being relatively close to the grabbable object, and release R, you will be either in the air or below the ground.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Ground Jump: This is where you can perform a jump while standing in place. It allows you to reach some ledges that are otherwise too high to climb onto, and is activated by either rolling into a grabbable object with your shield out and trying to grab it at the end of the roll, and then having the object vanish (usually because of a bomb explosion), but can also be done more quickly by attempting to grab the object then pulling out the shield before he grabs it.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Power Crouch Stabbing: In Ocarina of Time, the crouchstab move (B while holding R to crouch) retains the same source of damage as the last attack you did. This means that if the last attack you did was a jumpslash, then all of your crouchstabs will have the same power as a jumpslash. This is incredibly useful when fighting almost any enemy in the game, particularly bosses.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Cutscene Diving: Whenever a cutscene is playing, Link will fall until he hits solid ground. This means that if Link were to be over a body of water as a cutscene started, he would fall right through the water and hit the ground below it, allowing some things to be skipped.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Cutscene Skipping: If you die while entering a cutscene, you will not only skip the entire scene, but will also obtain anything that would be given to you during that scene. For example, dying while entering the scene outside the Forest Temple causes you to skip the scene, and when you respawn, you will already have the Minuet of Forest learned.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Although it's possible to die while entering the blue warp at the end of a dugeon/temple, all this does is cause the entire scene to play and Link to die as soon as he respawns after it. It was previously useful in the days where Mupen didn't have recordable resets and deathwarps were used instead, but it has since been obsoleted by savewarping.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Damage Boosting: If you are hit by a damage source in the air, you gain extra distance. Pressing B to attack with the sword right before the damage source hits you gives you an additional bit of distance on top of that. This is helpful for clearing some gaps that are just out of reach.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Owl Skipping: The owl's text can be skipped by alternating between two items (the button presses are frame perfect) while in the zone in which his text would activate. It prevents it from doing so. Note: This can also be used to skip various other texts in the game, like Navi's text about the twisty corridor in the Forest Temple.

	"- Rupees are collected before and after collecting the sword so that a shield and a stick can be purchased from the shop. It's faster to manipulate the required amount from the plants than to collect the blue rupee inside the shop.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- A Z-slide as a result of entering the water with jumpslash recoil speed is performed to merge Link with the kid blocking the exit. After he's done talking, Link appears at the other side of him, and a well-timed and well-positioned roll lets us get to the loading zone before he catches up.

[p 
	"- An A-slide is done from the peahat to cross the field quickly. This is better than a superslide as it means that the peahat doesn't have to be next to the plants, meaning there is less distance to cover.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- The A-slide is turned into an HISS after going into and then exiting the water. The positioning for this is extremely precise, as most of the time when exiting the water, Link's angle is such that his speed drops instantly due to shooting up the steep riverbank too quickly. The HISS is then changed into a Z-slide to go up the stairs to Kakariko.

[h3 
	"Kakariko Village

[p 
	"- ISG is activated on the nearest cucco, which means Link is in a permanent state of attacking it while holding it. As soon as the cucco is released, the cutscene in which the cuccos attack Link begins. This is used to fall through the water in the well, letting us go in there right away and without the Song of Storms.

	"Bottom of the Well
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"- The goal here is to get to a small chest containing bombchus, but in order to do that, the water has to be drained. We don't have Zelda's Lullaby, so the "actor glitch" is used to unload the water from the main room. This is done by opening the locked door after the crawlspace while the camera is still fixed at the crawlspace. This results in the room beyond the locked door being loaded, while Link is still in the previous room, so going back through the tunnel puts us in the main room with none of the actors (enemies, water, etc.) loaded. This means we can fall right through the water and explore other parts of the area early.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- The Dead Hand has to be killed in order to reload the main room, because after getting to this area, we want the water to be back. Going into his room causes the door to lock behind us, but this isn't a huge deal as we need to get rupees for a Hylian Shield later anyway, so they're taken from a small invisible chest in this room after the dead hand is killed.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- The water in the main room is now reloaded, so a clip through the wall is performed, using the skulltula. If Link grabs the wall right when hit by a damage source, he will fall through to the other side of it. The skulltula has to be stunned in some way to allow Link to get into position, otherwise it will attack him before he begins climbing down the vines. This puts us in the out-of-bounds water, and from here we can swim to the room with the small chest with bombchus in it. After obtaining them, the game is saved and reset to quickly bring us to the entrance of the dungeon.

	"- An A-slide is done from the tektite to quickly reach the entrance to Dodongo's Cavern.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- The chu that blows up the rock blocking the entrance also allows us to do a superslide using one of the nearby little rocks on the ground. This means that during the cutscene where the rock blows up, Link is supersliding towards the loading zone. Although we reach it before the cutscene ends, it's impossible to load the dungeon before the cutscene ends, so we wait in the loading zone until it does.

	$LF

[p 
	"- Another chu is used to lower the staircase surrounded by bombflowers. Forward backflips are done all the way up the stairs. This cost 3 frames to do but it looks far cooler than standard backflips.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- A superflip from the chu (which explodes quickly because we slash it with the sword) is used to clear a large gap and reach the chest with the Bomb Bag in it early. This skips another large section of the dungeon.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- Another superflip is done to land inside of the skull without opening its mouth, which also means that the rooms beyond the skull are unloaded. A longish bomb hover is performed to land in the loading zone for the boss. This skips having to hover up to the block and pushing it onto the switch.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- A power crouchstab with the deku stick (which is far stronger than the Kokiri Sword) is stored after the ground explodes and we jump down to the boss. This allows King Dodongo to be quickly killed in two cycles (it's not possible to kill him in one).

	"- Bombs are manipulated from all three plants, and an A-slide is done all the way to the stone structure in the next screen. The aquascape is performed here, which consists of a precise jumpslash through the corner of the structure to fall in the water out of bounds. The bomb pulled out during the A-slide isn't required for the clip, but it quickly pushes Link into the loading zone after the clip is performed. If a bomb weren't used here, we would have to wait for Link to complete his resurfacing animation, which takes a while.
	$LF

[h3 
	"Zora's River
	$LF

[p 
	"- A superflip is used to get behind the waterfall from the side without the need for Zelda's Lullaby. It is not possible to do this from the side closest to where we enter the area, and even if it was, it wouldn't matter since we have to wait for the bomb to explode.

[p 
	"- It's possible to do a hover out of the pit in the middle of the room after throwing Ruto up to the other side, and it is faster (by 3-4 seconds), but we have to save those bombs for later in the dungeon where they save even more time.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- A superslide is done using a worm as the damage source and Ruto as the grabbable object. Because we are still relatively close to her by the time the slide ends, releasing R causes her to warp into Link's hands.

[p 
	"- It was later found that the Navi text when landing on the switch can be skipped with a very precise position when landing on it. Fortunately, it's only about a second long.

[p 
	"- Two bombs are used to kill the enemies here quickly.

[p 
	"- The first parts of the Barinade battle could be done faster if we had Deku Nuts. The nuts could've been obtained in Zora's Domain, but were avoided as I did not believe they were necessary for anything in the run (it turned out they were needed for exactly one thing in the adult section). However, the time cost by interrupting the slide in Zora's Domain means that barely any time was actually wasted here. Damage is taken during the last cycle of Barinade to force him to recover more quickly.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- At first glance, it may seem more logical to get the heart container from here as opposed to from Dodongo's Cavern, due to the long waiting period after the boss dies here. This however is slower overall, as after the cutscene is over, the game is saved and reset. Doing this causes your health to fill up to at least 3 hearts. If I had taken the heart container here, it would be at 4 hearts. The reason this is bad is because there is a cutscene skip coming up shortly after this section, and I want my hearth to be as low as possible for that so that no time has to be wasted getting it low enough to actually perform the cutscene skip.

	"- Next comes the most ridiculous and precise trick in the game, the Shadow Temple boss key skip. This is so incredibly precise that it requires all 20 bombs and 1 bombchu to perform. It's done by first activating ISG while bringing the redead close to the wall, and then using the hookshot to wedge Link between the redead and the wall (forcing him out of bounds), and having a bomb explode right as this happens so that he will stick in the air instead of falling to his death. From there, the redead has to be close enough to Link that he can Z-target him, which allows Link to turn around freely during hovers. 19 hovers then have to be done with bombs, during which Link's angle is changed several times. Eventually, we are close enough to the boss loading zone to reach it with a superflip, which means that we have to have Link positioned directly under a room, high enough that the chu can reach it (if the chu explodes out of bounds, the game will freeze, but if it explodes in an unloaded room, it won't), but low enough that when doing the superflip, Link himself doesn't appear in the unloaded room above. The superflip lands Link directly in the boss loading zone. The entire boss key skip was TASed for me by MrGrunz, who very kindly offered to do it for me to save me some time (as he had already TASed it once before when he discovered it, and therefore knew all the specifics about it).

[p 
	"- Volvagia was easily the scariest part of the run. Before I TASed it, I felt there was a good chance the run would simply end here, due to not being able to hit him enough times in the air with the hookshot (when Bloob TASed this category, he had the bow, which is much faster at hitting him than the hookshot is) in order to kill him in two cycles (the minimum possible). It takes 6 arial hits to be able to do this. I was just barely able to land the 6th hit before he went back underground, meaning I was able to kill him. By targetting the skull and talking to Navi, the heat timer is paused, so Link won't die from it. However, it's not possible to do this immediately, as there is a small waiting period before you are able to talk to Navi. This means that the 4 hearts ARE required, as if we only had 3, then Link would die during this waiting period.

Deku Nuts are obtained from the nearby Deku Baba while the bomb timer ticks down, and after they're obtained, an A-slide is performed from the bomb, heading towards the acute angle at the back of the room. The hover boots are equipped and Link is pulled around out of bounds, after which a jumpslash is done and the regular boots are re-equipped so that the recoil from hitting the wall can propell Link back at enough speed to hit the boss loading zone.

	"Water Trial
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"- The freezard here can be used to clip through the red ice using the hookshot. Since both of them have to die in order for the door to unlock, one of them is killed immediately, and the other's health is lowered so that he will die when attacked with the hookshot, so he dies as soon as the clip is performed.

	"- Pushing the block against the wall lets us reach the ledge with a well-alligned jump.

[p 
	"- A jumpslash with the hammer from a precise position will hit the switch behind the ice, completely eliminating the need for a bottle in this category at all.

[p 
	"- Fire arrows are used to light all the torches in the first room while avoiding the wolfos.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- The rupees are collected in the optimal order and a chu is send to the beamos so it won't hurt Link. After getting blown back by the final fan (unavoidable), a sidehop is done and the hover boots are unequipped so that Link doesn't get blown back as much.

[p 
	"- A superflip is done after the Forest Trial which lands Link right in the loading zone which, for some reason, extends right to the corner of the middle structure. This is much faster than going to the loading zone normally.
	$LF

[p 
	"- The dinolfos are killed very quickly by attacking both of them with the same attack each time.

[p 
	"- The second stalfos is manipulated to jump towards Link as soon as possible to save time.

[p 
	"- The iron knuckles are each damaged by the same attack for every hit. I did not think this was possible at first but I managed to do it.
	$LF

[p 
	"- The long set of slides up the final staircase is the fastest way to clear it. It costs too much time to reduce the speed of a Z-slide at all.

[p 
	"- All was done that could be to reduce lag. This includes camera angles and firing light arrows so that Zelda's magic wouldn't display (this only actually saves time in the outside areas).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- I got ~The Kiss~ on every set of bars that it was possible to do so on, except for one of the outside ones where it was slower because there wasn't enough time to do both that and fire the light arrow.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- I send one of my remaining chus towards the stalfos I don't go for first in order to significantly speed up that battle.
	$LF

[p 
	"- Although to saves no time, I A-slide from the last chu I have up to the final set of bars, just cause it looks cool.

	"Ganon

[p 
	"- It's faster to just crouchstab him with the hammer (having stored the attack of the Master Sword jumpslash before the cutscene starts) than to superslide into the cutscene and keep the sword.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- Three crouchstabs on his tail with the hammer end the first cycle of this battle quickly.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- The Master Sword lets us jumpslash him in the air to attack him. This saves a little time on each hit because we don't have to wait for his tail to be almost fully lowered like we did with the hammer.
	$LF

[p 
	"- The final hit on Ganon is delivered at frame 438081 (2 hours 1 minute 41.35 seconds).

[p 
	"- aleckermit: He constantly watched my new WIPs and his dry, emotionless responses were funny cause I knew he actually really loved them.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- Bloobiebla: He was the author of the original TAS of this category, which is what made me want to run it myself in the first place. He was a constant source of inspiration and motivation for me while him and I were talking a lot for the first half of the run. He also watched a lot of my early WIPs and TASed a few small parts for me when I wasn't feeling up to it, including the riverbank HISS in the field and some parts of Jabu-Jabu's Belly (including the boss fight). He's also been a great friend to me over the years and I'm honoured to be the one to improve his iconic run.

[p 
	"- Cosmo: He's the world record holder for this category in real time and I've been watching him stream OoT almost daily for a long time now. I feel like by working on this TAS I've helped him optimise his gameplay better and by watching him run the game so much in real time I've learned more about the game and have therefore been able to optimise my TAS better.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- maxx: Definitely one of the biggest supporters of the run as I was doing it - I don't think he missed a single WIP, and he always offered great constructive criticism and had many funny conversation with me while I was working on the run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- MrGrunz: He was extremely nice and helpful to me throughout the entire run, watching everything I showed him and offering helpful criticism that only a skilled TASer could, which was great to have because most of the people who were watching my WIPs were console runners. He also TASed the entire Shadow Temple boss key skip for me, which was without a doubt the worst part of the run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- pokey & petrie911: They both helped me with the Deku Tree "BK skip". pokey TASed it once before, so he gave me his m64 of that, and petrie gave me a value to use in MHS to check Link's exact angle, so I checked the angle pokey got and after many tedious hours, I was able to replicate it in my own m64. I would've been at that skip for weeks if it wasn't for their help.

	"- Satyrium: He was the one who transcribed the song for me that I played in the Light Trial near the end of the run. He's an extremely talented musician and it felt good to honour him in some way in the run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- Slowi: He was pretty much my advisor for the entire run, telling me what to do next and offering ways in which to do it. He told me the route and would always try to keep me motivated so that I would stick to schedule and not go too long without making any progress. I think I must've given him about 150 separate m64s throughout the making of the run. The run would've taken way longer without his support.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- ZFG: He watched all of my WIPs religiously and provided the most useful and constructive criticism out of anyone, coming up with new ideas all the time (several of which turned out to save time) and telling me all sorts of little tricks and timesavers in the game that I had no idea about. He also had a fantastic attitude towards the run and was very excited whenever I mentioned progressing further in it.
