It was developed by Clockwork Tortoise, a short lived American video game studio.  The game is notable for having some off the most technically impressive graphics for it's time, and often is compared to visuals seen in the Demoscene.

The only notable feature of the shuriken is its fast recharge time, however it's small damage output makes it useless for this run, so we avoid it.

This will save a bit of time from it moving back to place.  For the 2nd phase I do a mix of melee attacks and air kicks as I am waiting for my weapon to charge up as it does so much damage.
