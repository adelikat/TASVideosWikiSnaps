	[a class=extlink href=http://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?showtopic=26432 rel=nofollow 
		"Sonic VR
	]a
	" that sees Sonic go through 40 mini-levels that range in difficulty from trivially easy to maddeningly difficult -- all without rings, shields, power-ups or time limit. Each level is a mini-puzzle, and requires knowledge of the physics of Sonic games in order to win. With TAS abilities, Sonic blasts through these 40 levels, sometimes reaching the finish line before you can see what is going on.

	": In these submissions both the run and the hack are to be judged. While most commented that the run itself was well made, the overwhelming majority of those that commented on the hack itself responded negatively. The problems cited were that the visual style was distracting and that the levels design did not make for a good TAS. My own opinion of this was a 'meh'; the music was great, but I am sympathetic to the problems outlined by other users (though I don't hold this opinion as strongly as the no voters), mainly I disliked that this hack took the large and non-linear levels that make Sonic TASes interesting and replaced them with the opposite. Either way, the response to this run falls short of the standard of approval required for a hack on this site. Therefore I am rejecting this submission.
