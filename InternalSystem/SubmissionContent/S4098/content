	"I was trying to improve the SNES version of Pitfall, but since I was only falling behind due to emulator differences, I decided to take a look on the Genesis version. Midway through the game I found the rock animation cancel trick, which forced me to start it all over, but it was a good thing; in my second attempt I found the clip glitch, the biggest time saver in the new run. So, this run is an improvement of

	"It’s basically the previous trick used to cancel Harry’s landing animation.  What makes it different is the fact that you can also use the whip (C Button) to cancel the animation when falling from high ledges. Useful to enter doors slightly faster too; jump a few frames away from the door, press Left, Right, A or C in the frame you land then press Up to enter the door immediately.

Once he clips at least 5 pixels into the wall, press away from the wall for one frame and he’ll be able to run through the wall. Alternatively, you can crawl near some walls and Harry will pass through them as well.
