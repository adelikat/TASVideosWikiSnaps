	"IMPORTANT NOTE: This hack just recently received an update to 1.1 mid-judgement phase which changes quite a bunch of things, such as item locations, powerup restrictions, etc., and thus I am beyond certain it desynced some stuff. If this TAS is even still valid, it must be run on 1.0.2 otherwise it likely won't work. The current link to the 1.0.2 version of the hack:

	" . If it doesn't work, try adding &r=0 after the 07. If that still doesn't work, go to smwcentral, scroll down to one of the most recent comments with the "From older version" tag and click on "Nonsense". If I am correct, then it should be 1.0.2, otherwise 1.0.1 could work as it's just a starting life change.

	"I finally did it. After weeks of TASing, procrastination, and various file corruptions, I finally did the full 119 exits TAS. The way this works is it is slightly different from 119/70 (all 119 exits and 70 full dragon coin collections) removing the objective to get all five dragon coins from five levels. This puts you at 65 dragon coin currency. These 65 coins will be used to acquire all of the levels in the special world, without having any extra, because extra time is less speed.

If it doesn't sound like just the background music, it's a sound that'll be added to the sound metre. However some sounds are forced. I don't know how many required sounds are in the first section but the second section requires 32 forced sounds from what I recall (it's been like 1 or 2 months since I've did this level), which is half the metre, meaning you can make 31 unnecessary sounds without dying. So since this is TAS, expect the metre to be 63 every time. For the coins, you need to collect the midway and then enter the door on the left. This will put you in a room that makes you fall down a 1-tile wide gap full of 3up moons. Recall what I said about any sound being added to the metre? That applies to these as well.

The red shell inside the mirror is also use for a midair that I honestly didn't even intend for. After collecting the green key next is yellow. We can also stop by and collect the last set of coins here as well. After collecting the yellow key next is red. You may have realised none of the keys we've already gotten have been used yet. Don't worry, we start now. Access to the red key is locked behind blue lock blocks. For the springboard puzzle. You can actually skip having to get the 2-use springboard down after the pipe by using the 3-use springboard once, and then using a single-use while juggling the single and 2(3)-use springboards. Red key obtained. This red key allows us to get the cape. However, cape flight is disabled in this level, so don't get too excited for cape cheese. After going through a few more pipes we arrive at the water switch locked behind blue lock blocks. I hit the switch in such a way that I'm right in front of the pipe when my movement is disabled. After the water comes all the way up I can instantly go through the pipe. This water switch allows us to go through the yellow lock blocks. This gives us a fireflower, however, not in the way you'd expect. Normally it'd put the cape in the reserve box and give us the fireflower power, but this time, we technically have both powerup at once. By pressing select you don't drop anything out of a reserve box, rather you instantly switch to the other powerup. This allows for fine-tuning jumps very precisely. We also need this fireflower to pass the ice wall. This gives us access to the final key, the grey key. Now by heading back to where we found the first key but not ascending, we'll find the final room. Using the cape we can spin our way through the blocks. Heading left you'll see 4 numbres. 1, 2, 3, and 4. This is where the code we didn't reveal comes in. We need to hit the code 32432114 and then the grey ? block as optimally as possible.

	"Being chased by an Eldritch Horror on Layer 3. Using the buzzy shells we can optimise movement. I don't know for sure but I don't think the Layer 3 is moving at a constant speed. I think it tries to stay in or close to the spawn area, that's probably why it seems like it's always so close. There is a cape but its right at the end and the last three levels don't allow cape and sometimes not even fireflower or mushroom powerups. At the very end you can't just instantly get the goal tape so you have to go to the right, hit the message box that reminds you not to put Eldritch Horrors on Layer 3, and then because the message box messes with and disables layer 3, you can now access the goal tape. It is now time for the final level

The 7 rooms I chose were Gbreeze and Kevin's Ice Magic Castle -> Gbreeze's crumble block Castle -> MiracleWater's Skewer Cavern (Which has a little funny trick where if you throw a throwblock and break it, you can destroy a boo trail's trail, which speeds up waiting for it to leave it's hole) -> Isocitration's Cosmic Castle -> Gbreeze's Clock room -> AmperSam's Building block section -> Jolpe's Fish Tunnel. Now just collect the coins you can't even see and that's time. All 119 exits of Nonsense completed. I hope you enjoyed this as much as I did! :)
