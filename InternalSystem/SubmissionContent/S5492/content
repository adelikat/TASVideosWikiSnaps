	"Due to bad RNG, I lose roughly roughly .2 seconds in the first of those stages, and .15 in the next stage (more precise to be added later). However, I manipulate a significantly better pattern for the Metal Sonic fight, and save over half a second there. These values are all given based on the IGT, by the way.

	"Although the total time of this movie is 3 seconds longer, this is mostly due to the increased framerate of VBA. If we discount the opening portions of both movies (which gets rid of the GBA BIOS animation on mGBA, and the lack of reset on VBA), it should be fairly straightforward to see that this is the shorter movie (despite the 3-4 frames of additional lag picked up on each level due to more accurate emulation).
