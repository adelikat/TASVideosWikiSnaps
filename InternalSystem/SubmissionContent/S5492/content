	"First, we use the soft reset trick at the beginning of the game to skip the intro. More importantly, due to the manner in RNG in this game works, the boss fights in each of Casino Paradise, Ice Mountain, and Angel Island have to be redone.

[p 
	"Due to bad RNG, I lose roughly roughly .2 seconds in the first of those stages, and .15 in the next stage (more precise to be added later). However, I manipulate a significantly better pattern for the Metal Sonic fight, and save over half a second there. These values are all given based on the IGT, by the way.

[p 
	"Although the total time of this movie is 3 seconds longer, this is mostly due to the increased framerate of VBA. If we discount the opening portions of both movies (which gets rid of the GBA BIOS animation on mGBA, and the lack of reset on VBA), it should be fairly straightforward to see that this is the shorter movie (despite the 3-4 frames of additional lag picked up on each level due to more accurate emulation).
	$LF

[p 
	"There is probably still room for improvement. One thing I did not incorporate is the 4 frame improvement to Casino Paradise 1 given in the game topic thread, due to the fact 
	$LF
	"that it didn't actually end up saving time due to waiting for RNG for the Casino Paradise 2 boss.
