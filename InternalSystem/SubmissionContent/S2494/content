One of the two is a dragon coin glitch idea in yi3, which has been dreamed for at least one and a half year and had not been available until May of 2009, because we had no way to duplicate turning blocks fast enough without hitting the message box.

	" Dragon coin glitch
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"A dragon coin can be cut by duplicated blocks, and we can get its upper-half (sometimes lower-half) piece. Then an invisible block is produced. This block is indeed a “wing-balloon-shell-key” block. This glitch is very powerful because it leaves us possibility to short-cut a long level such as an auto-scrolling one.

	" Block duplication
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"When we duplicate a block using an item, the item needs to be with x velocity 0 and go into the block by at least 7 pixels from its bottom, and the position of the duplicated block is determined by the direction to which the item is pushed. If the item goes into the block by 15-16 pixels from the bottom, the block is duplicated to the above, and if the item goes into the block by 7-10 pixels 
	[em 
		"from its side
	]em
	", then the block is duplicated to its side; if both are satisfied, the new block will be generated above-diagonally. But note that oscillation of items in a solid object affects whether we succeed block duplication to the side or not.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"A variant: duplication away from blocks.
	]b
	" Block duplication can be done with an item thrown up away from blocks. As explained above, an item needs at least y speed 97 in order to duplicate a block. After throwing up an item, its y velocity moves in the sequence: -112 -109 -106 -103 -100 -97 -94, so there remain only 7 frames in which it can go into the block by 7 pixels after it gets thrown. The following table shows when you should throw up an item to get block duplication; distance means “how far an item is from the block”, and subpixel “subpixel of the item”.

	" When we want to duplicate turning blocks many times, we must wait for the duplicated blocks to stop turning. To avoid this, by hitting four other turning blocks, the duplicated one stops turning. This however takes many frames, for example when without caped. We can shorten this routine by using double hits; each double hit produces two turning blocks, so we have only to hit them two times in order for the duplicated block to stop turning. This is useful when combined with a dragon coin glitch.

[p 
	"Although this is partially explained in 
	[a href=/forum/p/200202#200202 
		"my reply
	]a
	", I would give a self-contained explanation here for the sake of no ambiguity. Assume mario is flying to the right. When he starts going up after an air-catch, mario needs to be facing to the right (even while cape-spinning; watch mario's facing direction 
	[tt 
		"7E0076
	]tt
	"), so we can cancel his rise by manipulating cape-spin timing in such a way that he ends up facing to the left, and then he can still go up soon again unless his y speed exceeds a particular value (depending on which the air catch is normal or higher). This trick can also be done by making mario's x velocity nonpositive after an air-catch. In this run, this trick is used here and there, especially in bowser fight, where we try to stay at a fixed position for example.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"A variant: continuous air-catch.
	]b
	" After putting mario into the diving animation, we can cancel a higher air-catch by making his velocity nonpositive. But as explained above, he can still catch air soon, so by making his velocity positive again he restarts going up. Iterating this process, he gets “continuous air-catch”. This is useful in such cases that we want to go up soon after entering a door (e.g., after entering the first door of dgh). This trick also eables us to get a

	"Subvelocity 
	[tt

	" (of x direction) is the fractional part of x velocity, which is used only for calculation of acceleration (and deceleration). For example, both of going with velocity 48 and going with 48.5 give the same result. This explains mario's irregular acceleration and deceleration, and is useful when we want to optimize 6/5 in slippery levels where the 6/5 is no longer optimal (it is better to use something like 6/5/26/13 (average speed 48.68627...) rather than 6/5, which is however in such ideal cases as there are no slopes, no enemies, no pits, and so on, so it should be done case by case).

	" seems to be neigher sufficient nor essential. Anyway, I'm going to write down what we know about lag, although we are still away from complete understanding.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"First of all, there is no doubt that lag (both in-level and fedeout) depends on any processings such as sprites' actions, moving layers, fadeout, etc. So if we want to reduce lag, we have to manipulate any of them. But we historically know lag should depend also on score. Why? The game must do sorta many processings around scores; the score is kept in memory addresses as a hexadecimal value, while the score drawn on the screen is decimal, so the game converts a hexadecimal score into a decimal score 
	[em 
		"every frame
	]em
	". I think this conversion makes dozens of processings and thus a large score amounts to increase lag. For the same reason, mario's lives and coins could also increase lag. In order to manipulate lag, it seems enough to hold down the sum of the digits of the score, and the second digits of coins and lives (or also their first digits, but I'm not sure).
