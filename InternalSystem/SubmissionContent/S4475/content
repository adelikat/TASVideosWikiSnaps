	"The story behind this submission is that feos contacted me by PM and asked me to submit it. This movie was made in 2010, and back then I didn't really consider it as a very interesting game in terms of TAS potential. But now that we have the vault, I feel that this game at least has its place there. For reference,

	"Since it has been 4 years since I made this movie, I must admit that I don't remember much. But the game is pretty straightforward, and I hope you won't have any complicated questions regarding the choices I made.

	"As for the game, I think it makes for a decent TAS. It's maybe a little long for an NES TAS, but it's not too bad. There is some variety in the game, and the mazes will at least take away the "run right for justice" factor. It's a little bit slow moving, though. But I hope you will like it!

	"In terms of quality, I do remember that I spent quite some time optimizing movements. But of course I gladly invite people to try and improve this, I suspect that both the movements and boss fights could be improved. But to my knowledge, there aren't any (big) potential improvements to this TAS. But mind you, when I made this I made it mostly for my own enjoyment, rather than as something I would be submitting.
