	"Mirror's Edge 2D is a sidescrolling platformer made by Brad Borne for EA as a way to promote the full game, at the time only available on consoles, to PC users. The first beta of the game came out on the same day as the console game, with the full version coming out around a year later. This TAS completes all 3 levels from the full release.

	"Generally from a standstill simply running is the fastest way to accelerate. Higher speeds can be achieved by rolling or sliding down slopes, that speed can later be preserved by jumping. Wallrunning is also generally faster than staying on the ground, though from my testing it didn't seem to help at all in level 1, only later on. When hanging from poles, jumping right away tends to be the fastest option.

I haven't been able to reproduce it, not sure if it even works in ruffle, and there don't seem to be many resources explaining how it works other than videos of speedruns that perform it. Perhaps it warrants a separate branch with this TAS being published as "glitchless", I leave that decision to the judge.
