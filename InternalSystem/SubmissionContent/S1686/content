	"This is a Any% TAS of Super Metroid, the aim for the movie is lowest possible ingame time thus some realtime sacrifices are made to lower ingame time such as collecting certain items and using a route with more door entry's. The movie is 1477 frames or 24.6 seconds slower in realtime then the currently published any% run which aims for realtime but it is 5271 frames or 87.5 seconds faster in ingame time. The ingame endtime is 24:04:37 and item collection is 22%.
	$LF

[p 
	"The reason why I choose to aim for the lowest ingame time is because in my opinion it is a little more entertaining to watch both because of the route and more variety in item use. The majority of the improvement came from the route change and  the troizo skip, the rest simply comes from new strategies and optimization. It was hard to make this TAS, especially since it is my first one (aside from 3 other "test TASes" I made of this game before this) and Super Metroid is known to be quite a hard game to TAS. Without the help of other released TASes which more in depth learned me the uses of various tricks I would not have been able to make this.

	"There is (I think) a good chance this movie will not be accepted because I put a higher priority on ingame time then realtime but if that is the case I still hope that as many as possible will be able to enjoy it through SMV anyway.
