	"Star Control II is one of the greatest PC games ever. It is a space
	$LF
	"adventure/exploration game that has a story, battles, exploration,
	$LF
	"thousands of worlds to mine, and a modular flagship that can be
	$LF
	"configured for whatever purpose needed.
	$LF
	"It sports a large number of different alien species, most of which can be encountered
	$LF
	"during the gameplay; some of which become allies, some of which become enemies, and
	$LF
	"some which become neither.
	[br

	$LF
	"There were literally hours of dialogue, each species bringing out their
	$LF
	"characteristic conversational quirks, music, and even display fonts. Almost a hour
	$LF
	"of digital music is also included.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Because you can pretty much go anywhere whenever you want, there is
	$LF
	"no "sequence breaking" in this game. However, there are numerous things
	$LF

	"Twenty thousand years ago, when they were already avid space travellers,

[p 
	"This talking pet turned out to be a highly malevolent sentient creature

	$LF
	"The single talking pet compelled the Ur-Quan to bring thousands of other
	$LF

	$LF

[p 
	"During those times, the Ur-Quan species were split into two: the green,
	$LF
	"who were the thinkers, and the black, who were the warriors.
	$LF
	"They were forced to commit numerous atrocities around the galaxy,
	$LF
	"including the annihilation of the only other alien species they
	$LF
	"had ever considered a friend, the Taalo. Ironically, the Taalo, who were
	$LF

	$LF
	"the process of finishing a device that would have granted freedom of
	$LF

	$LF

	$LF
	"themselves in order to gain the upper hand over the Dnyarri.
	$LF

]h4
[p 
	"I harvested Io for precious radioactives. I also harvested Mercury. And Luna.
	$LF
	"This time-wasting diversion not only gained me enough resources to maximize
	$LF
	"my speed boosters in the very beginning, but it also meant I ended up having
	$LF
	"a lot of _slack time_ while waiting for the Quasispace window to open... Oops.
	$LF
	"The route from Pluto to Jupiter was carefully selected considering the peculiar
	$LF
	"space-time geometry in the solar system (an artifact of the zoomed views).
	$LF
	"It was significantly faster than any other way.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I actually sold all ships and weapons; I would do the first trip around the
	$LF
	"galaxy completely unarmed. I also sold the mineral storage module; I had no
	$LF
	"intention of honoring the Commander's "bring back lots of minerals" wish.
	$LF
	"I still needed the planet lander though, and hence, at least one human
	$LF
	"present in the flagship, and hence, a crewpod.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I named the alliance "The Empire of Bisqwit". Contrary to popular belief,
	$LF
	"this has no effect in the difficulty level of the game, but I thought this
	$LF
	"would be a nice touch. This was also the shortest name available.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Expedition 1
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"From here on, I head straight to Alpha Pavonis, where a crashed Ur-Quan Dreadnaught
	$LF
	"happens to be waiting for scavenging. I pick up a powerful warp-pod from there, and
	$LF
	"then head into the only region of space where a portal to Quasi-space happens to occur
	$LF
	"in the 17-20 days of every month, naturally. After entering the portal, I travel to
	$LF
	"the Arilou homeplanet where they'll be happy to equip my ship with a Portal spawner,
	$LF
	"using the acquired warp-pod as a core ingredient.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"After the meeting with Arilou is over, I warp to the other edge of the galaxy, and

	$LF
	"Next, I head to the Pkunk homeplanet and ally them.
	$LF
	"Last, before returning home, I go to the Ilwrath system, and use the hyperspace

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"After a long and enlightening expedition throughout the galaxy,

	"the fuel tanks are nearly depleted, and I'm back at starbase.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"After I gained Arilou and Pkunk as allies, both of them were kind
	$LF
	"enough to donate some ships for me. Showing the kind of emperor I am,
	$LF
	"I sell them for scrapmetal, except for one of each kind.

]p
[p 
	"I could actually keep a few Arilou ships so I could sacrifice some
	$LF
	"of them when fighting the Umgah later on -- this would save some time,

	$LF
	"instead of battleships, I'll pack my flagship full of fuel tanks.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I bought just enough fuel to get me to the next refueling point, and I
	$LF
	"bought crew for the rest of the money. I needed some plasmafodder crew
	$LF

	" Syreen subplot
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The Syreen homeworld, Syra, was invaded by the Mycon, who habitually

	"de-terraform Earth-like worlds into molten worlds with violent volcano
	$LF
	"eruptions and earthquakes happening all the time.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The Captain presents the Syreen the proof that the Mycon were behind
	$LF
	"the destruction of Syra, and thus the Syreen start planning revenge.
	$LF
	"The revenge plan involves telling the Mycon about a new planet
	$LF
	"for them to de-terraform, and ambushing them there, while the
	$LF
	"Captain uses the distraction to steal the Sun device from one
	$LF
	"of the Mycons' holiest planets.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"After the Mycon are cheated, I could visit the Syreen commander again
	$LF
	"to participate in some rather intimate scenes. However, this doesn't
	$LF
	"aid a speedrun so I left it out.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Sometime this route I also ally the Orz in order to gain
	$LF
	"permission to visit one of their holiest planets -- the
	$LF
	"moon of the Taalo homeworld. Conveniently, the Orz ship which handled
	$LF
	"the honors of alliance negotiations existed in the same screen with
	$LF

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I also sell them the Burvixese Caster, which I no longer need.
	$LF
	"For this, I gain my tanks full of fuel. Because I had previously
	$LF
	"packed my flagship full of fueltanks, this invokes the rare treat

	$LF

	$LF
]p
[p

	$LF
	"I could now communicate with the Umgah, who would be very happy to

	$LF
]p
[p

	$LF
	"their holy artifact, the Aqua Helix. The item will be used later to
	$LF
	"repair the Ultron. Normally, I would have to destroy 25 Thraddash
	$LF

	$LF

[p 
	"Q: What was the long wait for after acquiring the Urquan warppod?

	]br
	$LF
	"A: The Quasispace portal appears between 17th and 20th days. I had a lot of
	$LF
	"slack time. However, I did not have slack fuel, so I couldn't move around.
	$LF
	"Also, I couldn't travel to the portal first, because the Arilou would have
	$LF
	"popped in and asked what I'm doing. Communications do not consume the timer.
	$LF
	"I could have equipped the ship with less speed upgrades... (and used the RU
	$LF
	"for ship rotation instead), but I believe this was faster in the end.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Q: At the first visit in the Mycon homeworld, why didn't you drive directly
	$LF
	"to the planet?
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"A: I wanted to get the attention of the patrolling Mycon ship, so that it
	$LF
	"comes closer instead of ambushing me when I try to leave the planet later.
	$LF
	"This prevented one fight. To get there to be only one Mycon ship in the first
	$LF
	"place, I luckmanipulated the entry to the solar system. The same was done at

	"a few other places.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Q: That's it?
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"A: There were a lot of races we did not meet face-to-face in this speedrun --
	$LF
	"even of those which we battled with, such as Kohr-Ah and the Umgah -- and
	$LF
	"lots of subplots that were not visited. The Melnorme traders were never

	(__wikiLink|user:Truncated)
	": While this is a very interesting movie, technically, being the first PC TAS, viewer feedback has been negative, and it is obvious why. Probably more than 80% of the movie is just seeing stars zooming by on red/green tinted backgrounds, which I started skipping after the first minute. The space battles are interesting, but few, short, and far apart, which isn't a very good combination. Therefore I think this movie should be rejected.
