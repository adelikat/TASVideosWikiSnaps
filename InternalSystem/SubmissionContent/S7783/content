	"This was actually interesting watching the encode before loading it up in emulator and playing around with it, because it doesn't actually show off how the game operates that well. The questions on screen are all the previous question that was answered frame perfectly before the little ladder animation. I suppose there could have been a small kerfuffle over triviality here if it worked exactly as shown, but that could have easily been derailed by the revelation that this game sells for thousands due to its rarity.
