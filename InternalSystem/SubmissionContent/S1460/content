	]li

[p 
	"Fire while jumping. It's better than fire while standing on the ground. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Jumping has the same speed as walking,but it'll cause a small lag. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"So I tried to have fewer jumps,especially the vertical jump.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If I do have to jump,I try to make them continuously. It help to save several frames' time. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There's a lag when walking to the door at the end of each mission.I always jump to avoid it.

]p
[p 
	"Some enemies won't appear at certen places.

[p 
	"Sometimes you can see a jump without firing,it's not meaningless.
