	".  While there is a story, it's really lame, involving Kid Dracula and aliens (WTF?!).  With their appearance, you must traverse through 8 levels to eventually beat up Garamoth for thinking UFOs are cool.  Or something like that.

But fly as I might, he says he wants to dance with me.  "No, later", I say.  Then I run into some Nazi Ghosts.  CREEPY!  Seems that they are wimps.  Too bad.

	"Ah.  I take a deep breath of the lovely fresh air once I reach the forest.  I tried to ask Mr. Owl how many licks it takes to get to the center of a tootsie pop, but he would have none of that.  For shame.  I also found some cool sunshaded flowers.  They looked sick, so I helped them enjoy the sunshine.  They didn't seem happy about that.  :(  After that, I decided to go over the river to grandmother's house.  I cooked up some fish along the way for her to eat, but much to my surprise, the BIG BAD WOLF was there!  He tried to eat me for breakfast.  SCARRRRRY WOLF!
