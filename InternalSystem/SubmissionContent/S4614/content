	"The fastest way to accelerate at the start of a level and when coming out of a pipe are the inputs: > <> >x4 <>x19. In both of those situations, you are registered as being in the air for one frame - the fastest way to accelerate from a stop otherwise is RA> Rx19 R<>x19.

	"8 frames saved on the turnaround at the end of the level. If you press the opposite direction to the one you're running in and jump on the next frame, then land with an X speed of at least 24 while holding a direction, your speed will be set to 9 in the direction you're holding. I use this to decelerate faster at the warp zone.
