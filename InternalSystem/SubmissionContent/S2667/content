	"While this is my second submission of the game, it is technically my fourth full run of the game. Each run, I realized how little I needed every force member other than Peter. Leveling Peter to absurdly high levels is the key to success. A great number of improvements came from handling death and locations better. The number of characters that are dead changes the starting layout of each battle. I'll be discussing each battle independently.

	"This submission plays on the difficulty level "Super." This gives all monsters a bonus of 125% of their normal attack power. While, theoretically, "Ouch" was intended to be the most difficult, it is obvious the programmers didn't test the difficulty feature. The AI does not change its behavior, unlike popular opinion states. For fans of the game, "Super" is widely regarded as the hardest difficulty, and thus was chosen for this improvement. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Truth be told, for a TAS, the difficulty matters almost nil. Misses take an extra 30 frames over non-killing hits. However, since a vast number of characters die in the run to critical attacks, and may have require two hits previously, this saves ~100 frames per death. I lose about 5 seconds in the first battle, due to the increased difficulty, however, no other battles required a change of strategy to deal with increased difficulty.
