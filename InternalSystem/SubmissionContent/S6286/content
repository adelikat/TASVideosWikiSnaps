	"Me and Sullyrox made a Super Mario Bros. warps TAS.

	"happylee's TAS is 4 framerules ahead of our TAS (at least in the way i calculated this).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"glitches:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"the first glitch i want to talk about is the Flag Pole Glitch (or FPG in short):
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"in 1-1, 4-1 and 8-1 you can see that mario grabs the flag but it doesn't come down, why?
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"well to be honest I don't know why it's happening... but I know how to do the glitch (TAS method):
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"1) You need to get mario to the top of the stairs.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"2) You need to jump from the top stair so mario's leg will almost walk on the flag's base (the closest possible without walking on the base).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"3) after that when mario's leg is only one frame in the flag base, you need to do one of this inputs (there are many options but these are the best i could find): l+r, nothing, r , l+r+A \ l, nothing l, l+r+a \ l , l , l , l+A \ l, nothing , nothing , l+A \ l , nothing , l , l+ A.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"the second one is the Bullet Bill Glitch (or BBG in short):
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"in 8-2 there is a similar glitch to the FPG, but it's diffrent from the classic FPG, yeah i know the flag is still not coming down, but... in the original FPG mario still walk into the castle and all of that. but the when you do the BBG mario doesn't run into the castle but getting stuck at the flagpole base, why it's happening?
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"well there are two things that make this glitch possible:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"1) the FPG (so mario will not be in his animation while being in the block or that maybe other things will happend)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"2) when mario tries to clip into the wall the game send mario to the opposite dieraction his holding on the controller (to skip the castle sense)
	$LF
	"how  to do it (the setup I used): 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"1) be on the top stair so mario's whole right foot is on the edge on the stairs.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"2) when the bullet passed like 2/3 of the line between the two blocks that make the top stair: then do an rta fast acelleration (Inputs: l+B, nothing , r+B+A, r+B (press r+B until you will hit the ground))
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"3) run 10 frames, on the 10th frame jump (for one frame)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"4) while you midair do these input: r , r , r , r , r , l , l , l , r , r , r.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"block cliping:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"for this: you need a good vaule of subpixles, they are tinier then a pixel and normally you can't controll they're vaule, but if you got a good sub pixels then you can clip into block do the FPG and the BBG.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"so you can save time in 1-2 and 4-2 with wall clips, but in those levels there is one thing that make them easiar to got a wall clip than others: if you just run and don't slow down at all in 1-2 and 4-2 than your subpixel position is the right one for clips.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"but... remeber when i wrote: "when mario tries to clip into the wall the game send mario to the opposite dieraction his holding on the controller"? well that's why when you clipping into the wall you want to hold left or left+right. because of some reason the proggramers make mario pushed to the opposite dieraction which he pressing insted of just make mario get pushed to the opposite dieraction which he walking / running / running midair / walking midair.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"and i don't need to explain the setup it's just to run to a wall, jump, press left when you just entered to the wall and jump couple of times if needed.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"so... that's realy it, me and Sullyrox worked really hard on this TAS, hope you enjoy!!!
