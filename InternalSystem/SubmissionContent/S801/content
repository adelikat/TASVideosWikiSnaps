	"The strongest moves are the knee drop (because of its damage+speed) and the double flying kick (because of strength), so i dont need any kind of magic attacks. The flying magic would also be useless, so i skip the magic power ups and rush to the end. The only magic items i take are used to "warp" ahead on the stage, saving some time.

	$LF
	"if the enemy has X hp, he will now have 2X.
	$LF
	"at the end of the second quest, the game will say the same thing again, and this time that enemy will have 3X HP. I have tested it and there's a 4th quest with 4X HP. My guess is it never stops. So i did it on quest #1.
