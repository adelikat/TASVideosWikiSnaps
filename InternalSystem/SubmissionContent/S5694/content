		"Front Line
	]em
	" is an arcade game produced and released by Taito in 1982.  In it, a lone soldier clad in periwinkle fatigues and a red Brodie helmet, armed only with a revolver and a satchel of grenades, must advance through an onslaught of soldiers and tanks to destroy the enemy fortress.  The perspective is top-down, and the screen scrolls vertically (and horizontally somewhat) as the hero progresses through the game.  While it is not Taito's most polished game, 
	[em 
		"Front Line
	]em
	" was quite innovative and rather popular.  Taito's competitors took notice as well, shortly releasing games utilizing similar themes and design elements, such as 
	[em 
		"Commando
	]em
	" and 
	[em 
		"Ikari Warriors
	]em
	".  Influenced by the foundation laid by 
	[em 
		"Front Line
	]em
	", this style of game would propagate at arcades for years to come.  The control scheme is innovative as well, pairing a joystick for moving the hero, a button to throw grenades or enter and exit a tank, and a combination spinner/button that could be rotated to change the hero's aim, and also pressed like a button to fire the gun.

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Ordinarily, the Hero travels at a rate of 3 pixels per each 4 Frames, or .75 pixels per Frame.  Using this technique, the Hero can travel at a rate 42 times greater: 126 pixels per each 4 Frames, or 31.5 pixels per Frame.  This is effectively half a screen of travel for each increment of Hero movement.  Hold Up and Down on the joystick simultaneously to cause the Hero to rush forward.  Holding Left on the joystick in addition to holding Up and Down reduces the Hero's vertical speed to 33% of his maximum to 42 pixels per each 4 Frames (10.5 pixels per Frame), and also causes him to walk to the right at the normal rate of 3 pixels per each 4 Frames.  This is useful in a situation where travelling at maximum speed would cause the Hero to overshoot his destination, but traveling at normal speed would be too slow.  Note that holding Left on the joystick in addition to holding Up and Down prior to about the end of Screen Y High 8 allows a Hero Tank to spawn, which prevents Blitzkrieg for 20 Frames.  As a point of reference, even if the Hero could advance to the Fort without interruption at his normal rate (which he can not), it would require 47,600 additional Frames...nearly 3 times as long as the entire TAS.
