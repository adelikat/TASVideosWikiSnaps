	"(again, i'm sorry for this undo count. I tried few times (loading states etc. each time). At the last stage i neded to take a break (my EYES XD). So, the total UNDO COUNT is 2149)

	"About the run:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Stage 1- no problem (probably it have the same time completition as krieg TAS)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Stage 2- i beat boss slighty faster than krieg's (i think).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Stage 3- skipped one platworm somwhere in the middle (when first hovering, stone platworm is). Slighty slower at the BOSS.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Stage 4- No idea....i dunno is that stage (and boss fight) faster than krieg's
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Stage 5 & 6- same as above
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Stage 7- about these spiked "arm".....i was able to easily avoid them (they were "working" in other pattern ( or the same pattern but they were bit too late)). Also i missed one R power up (but that didn't slow me down).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Stage 8-About this "long" alien....krieg was "hugging" this wall the most of time (sometimes jumped back to avoid these alien larvas). I actually founded "blind spot" and probably i hitted the exact most to the left pixel of this long alien....four extra hits= little faster dealing with monster..... Also....kidna slowed down at the very end (these "spider" things), but i easily destroyed this alien's heart.
	$LF
	"That's all. (i don't know how much frames that run is faster, but i bet is something arround 80-100 frames (i didn't checked that submission here, but on youtube). Thank you for reading. Have fun!
