	"This is a TAS of MK1 for the genesis using Raiden. I activate the DULLARD code and Fight reptile 3 times. I fight him twice in a row in the endurance match. Because I cannot use Shang Tsung, I choose Raiden. He can teleport behind the opponent, shoot lighting, and can fly foward crushing the enemy. I tried to do different styles of fighting for every match since I can only use one character.

	": A very underwhelming movie, due in large part to the limited game mechanics, and due in small part to the poor entertainment choices made by the author. Rejecting.
