		"Zook Hero Z

	" is the prequel of 
	[a class=intlink href=/2572M 
		"Rockman DX3
	]a
	" (also known as Zook Hero 2), created by Taiwanese unlicensed game developer Vast Fame. Even moreso than its sequel, it is a clear rip off of Mega Man and Mega Man X. The engine is practically exactly the same, which means that all the physics-defying movement tricks of the RDX3 run are also applied here.
