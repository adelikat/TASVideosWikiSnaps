	"Here's my improvement of Solar Jetman. It's 64.8 seconds faster than the existing movie by Slotermeyer. The improvements come mostly from more optimized flight paths, but also some route changes (most notably in level 2). I destroy the pod on purpose at least twice in this run, this enables me to go through a small wormhole and start back at the mothership.

	"Level 1: No boosters, so flight is very limited. Self explanatory.
	$LF

[p 
	"Level 2: Improved route, saved lots of time.
	$LF

	"Level 3: I go straight for the warp. *yawn*
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Level 7: Almost exactly the same as the previous version. Time bombs are used to kill the big green ships. If you place a timebomb so that it touches the enemy, it will go off immediately. Thankfully it doesn't damage the player ship. :)
	$LF

[p 
	"Level 8: Straight for the warp, even less interesting than level 3.
	$LF

[p 
	"Level 13: This is the first level where I actually had to mind the boosters usage. Again very similar to the previous version, with some small changes. One time bomb was used to kill an armored enemy.
	$LF

[p 
	"Level 12: A very big level with crazy gravity. I try to make it a little bit interesting by pretending to roll on the ground and stuff. I use up ALL the fuel and go to spaceman mode once, but it's OK since there's a spare pod right in the way. It might be faster if you could optimize the boosters usage to near perfection and not have to do that, but I'm not even sure if that's possible without being slightly slower. Anyway, this level is again mostly similar to the previous version. I skip the smart bombs, they're not necessary.

[p 
	"Final level: I try to destroy all the blue blob things, but it's not always possible. Some of them are just untargetable.
	$LF

[p 
	"Bonus levels: No matter what you do in the cyberspace levels, it will always take the exact same amount of time. So the first one I collect all crystals, and the rest I try to do in interesting ways.
