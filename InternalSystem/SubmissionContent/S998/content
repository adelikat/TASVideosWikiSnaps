	"Here's my improvement of Solar Jetman. It's 64.8 seconds faster than the existing movie by Slotermeyer. The improvements come mostly from more optimized flight paths, but also some route changes (most notably in level 2). I destroy the pod on purpose at least twice in this run, this enables me to go through a small wormhole and start back at the mothership.

	"Level 12: A very big level with crazy gravity. I try to make it a little bit interesting by pretending to roll on the ground and stuff. I use up ALL the fuel and go to spaceman mode once, but it's OK since there's a spare pod right in the way. It might be faster if you could optimize the boosters usage to near perfection and not have to do that, but I'm not even sure if that's possible without being slightly slower. Anyway, this level is again mostly similar to the previous version. I skip the smart bombs, they're not necessary.
