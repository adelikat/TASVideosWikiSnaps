	"In my previous run I had 2 clumsy flaws. I grabbed 2 ladders in the middle instead of grabbing it at the side, meaning I lost some frames. So why is this version 38 seconds faster?

	"Most of the time comes from actually use death as a shortcut. I didn't use that in my previous run because I thought it would look sloppy. But it doesn't really and it saves around 20 seconds.

	"Next big timesaver is the technodrome. I managed to move it this time and this saved me quite some time. However, the randomness in this game is teh_stupid. I tried everything to be able to affect the position of the Technodrome but whatever I tried I found it impossible to change it. For example killing more enemies, killing less enemies, using second weapon (it affect stuffs sometimes) etc. Only exception was when I on purpose waited for like 1 minute before killing the mouse boss. But that's not worth it.

	"In this version I also managed to reduce lag. I kill more enemies and manipulates some to act like I want to cause less lag. I don't know how much time exactly that saved me but it looks much smoother now.

	"Also I got the suggestion to jump moreon the conveyor belts. I thought this would be a bad idea since in most cases I would

	"have had banged my head into the ceiling, causing me to stop for a few frames. But it turned out to be faster to jump anyways.

	"Finally, in the Dam I took loads of damage to save time. This resulted in 1 time unit faster completition of it. In my previous run I had 1.14 left when disarming the last bomb. Now I have 1.15.
	$LF
	"Also my second last hit might look a bit sloppy but I had to swim in that evil electric sea-grass (?) to be able to use the same turtle (he's pretty useless anywyas ;P) to die with.

	"Oh and I have to climb downwards on one ladder because else I couldn't avoid that hedgehog and that would have messed things up in the Technodrome later on.
