	"Next big timesaver is the technodrome. I managed to move it this time and this saved me quite some time. However, the randomness in this game is teh_stupid. I tried everything to be able to affect the position of the Technodrome but whatever I tried I found it impossible to change it. For example killing more enemies, killing less enemies, using second weapon (it affect stuffs sometimes) etc. Only exception was when I on purpose waited for like 1 minute before killing the mouse boss. But that's not worth it.
