There are three different faster speeds, and all of them depend on when you don't press a directional key for a single frame: First it's 175, which is what happens when you do it in the air, it's most commonly used after wall jumps. Second it's 180, which happens on the floor, it's most commonly used at the beginning of every level. The fastest speed is 195, which happens when you unpress the directional key the frame you land, unfortunately, I only understood  how this last speed works in the last fifth of the game, I thought it was random before figuring it out.
