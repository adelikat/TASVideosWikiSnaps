	"This is a TAS of the SEGA genesis Mortal Kombat. This movie was made with Gens_10a. The run is on Very Hard mode to ensure that it is entertaining and not a senseless Easy Mode-Beat em up. This run uses Liu Kang. Shang Tsung is not legitimately playable, neither is Goro. I use the Genesis version because it has blood and gore(ABACABB on the "code of honor" screen) as opposed to the SNES version, it has better graphics and music, but there is no blood or gore.

	"- The reason I miss with fireballs sometimes is luck manipulation, I do it to make them either duck or move a different way etc.

	"-Shang Tsung transforms if you jump or preform a special move or sometimes randomly. So for the last part of Round 1 and for Round 2, I roundhouse kick Shang Tsung to death.
