	"As a fan of tournament-play Scrabble I wanted to try a run of this game, but my dreams of a speedrun showing off crazy vocabulary for tons of points was dashed when I realized the best speedrun strat is to play no words at all.

	"Basically, four passes in a row ends the game immediately. Fortunately the dumb AI never seems to exchange tiles and will simply pass when it can't play anything. When the game ends, each player with remaining tiles gets the point total of those tiles subtracted from their score. In order for this strategy to work, I needed to wait until I got a game setup with 1) an opponent with an unplayable rack and 2) for that rack to be worth more points than mine. Amazingly I only needed to wait 2 frames for this exact situation to show up.
