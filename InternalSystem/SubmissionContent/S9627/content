	": I've reviewed the other two submissions, previous to this, and the rules have certainly changed over the years. Unlike the NES version, where there is actual game play, this one is just progressing through cuts scenes as fast as possible. I understand the old rules, which prevented it from being accepted; however, I also wondered why it couldn't have been a TAS either. I've always wanted to see it played all the way through, since many runners struggled to "guess" the right choice on each scene...back in the day.
