		"Since there is such a gray area in defining what is or is not a "glitch" in this game, a group of OoT players voted to define a set of rules that they would all abide by. It is important that all players use the same rules, since it allows them to compare times with each other. These rules are not perfect, but they are the current standard. This category aims to create a speedrunning experience which feels like a glitchless category. This is accomplished by requiring intermediate goals in addition to simply beating the game, and by allowing a narrower set of techniques than Glitchless Any%.

[div class=p

	"There are certain situations in the game (typically after some cutscenes) where you can’t sidehop or roll immediately (an example is talking to Mido after Deku Tree). 
	$LF
	"If you don’t hold Z on the first sidehop in a chain, Link’s angle will be slightly skewed when he lands.  This can be used to change his angle a bit during a sidehop chain without stopping and allows for getting round some corners more smoothly.

This causes Link to perform a sidehop/backflip at a certain angle, but because Z is still being held, the camera doesn't change and he rotates back to the direction he was facing previously while he's in the air.

[div class=p 
	"Whenever you complete the puzzle or kill all the enemies in a room and a chest spawns or door opens, the position of the camera (how far away it is from Link) will affect how long you have to wait before regaining control of Link.  Usually, the best way to manage this is to go into first person mode before the cutscene starts, which brings the camera close to Link and lets you regain control the quickest.

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- I started this run immediately after finishing my Any% one, but before I submitted it to TASVideos.  This means that I didn’t do optimised backwalking for the first child section of the run, as I wasn’t aware of it until it was pointed out in the discussion thread.  It’s used all throughout the rest of the run after this point.  It’s important to note that this saves, at most, 3 frames (1 visual frame) compared to the way I was backwalking before.  Similarly, the idea of rolling after entering a new area at maximum speed before starting a sidehop chain is not used during the first child section, but is used whenever faster after becoming adult.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- Some parts of the first child section were copied directly from my Any% to avoid having to do them again.  The start of the run until entering the Deku Tree is identical to my Any% run.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- If you see me waiting before doing something, it's for enemy manipulation purposes (e.g. the Green Bubble in child Spirit Temple) or because there are frame rules that don't let you hit the enemies any sooner (e.g., the Lizalfos in Dodongo's Cavern).
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- I collect two heart containers in order to survive the Fire Temple without using a fairy or getting the Goron Tunic.  It is technically possible to do this with four hearts (so only one extra heart container collected), but this ends up being slower because it means there are fewer places you can take damage to save time (the timer in each room in the Fire Temple is based on your health when you enter it, not the total number of hearts you have) and in the final room before the boss, it would mean that I couldn’t cross the room via the lava (as my health would be too low when entering the boss fight to survive it).  That last part alone is enough to justify getting two heart containers, as the other path around the room before the boss is slow.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- Volvagia (Fire Temple boss) has a second hitbox that’s beneath one of the holes.  Using bombs, I can damage it.  The specific pattern of bombs used here is done to prevent the boss from flying around the room.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- Twinrova (Spirit Temple boss) is a largely luck-based fight.  The quickest way to do it is to have the same one fire at you three times, from the edge platform she starts on (this reduces the amount of flying around she does before attacking), followed by the second one moving into position on the same platform and attacking you for the final hit.  Their positions after taking damage just make this the fastest way to do it.  For the second phase, if you fire a long-range weapon at her after she shoots the spell at you, she’ll spin in place and there is then a chance she will stay on that platform rather than flying to another one, which saves time.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- On the boat in the Shadow Temple, I look down for most of it because this saves quite a lot of time due to lag reduction (around two seconds).
