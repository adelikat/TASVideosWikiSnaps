	"The trick saves about 20 frames.  And there are some optimizations here and there. However, as typical with modern cores, this game has a lot more lag than with old versions of GENS.  Probably.  With this game, it is hard to definitively prove anything, as it is laggy, and hard to guage where you are or if you are doing identical routes.  But in general, a lot more lag.  It's really hard to say, and one of the many frustrations with TASing this game.

	"This run uses the grid controller options like the previous movie.  This is not a style choice.  I did attempt an improvement that uses standard controls but they are slow.  You gain 43 by not picking this option, but grid controls give you a slight "head start" at the beginning of each level for reasons I cannot determine.  This advantage eventually overtakes the extra time needed to pick it, and it turns out it is the optimal choice.

	"There might be more frames to eek out and I did intend to do so, but I realize I'm not going to come back to this game anytime soon, or ever, due to it generally being unfun to optimize.  Finding tricks is fun, optimizing is just frustrating, and so are the grid controls, I truly dislike them.
