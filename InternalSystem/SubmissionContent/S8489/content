	"The TAS really starts to take off from Round 3 onwards, when the screenwrap glitch becomes useful. The glitch is then used in every subsequent round. To perform the glitch, simply attack while jumping (or falling as per Round 7) to a vertical position that would ordinarily hit the top of the screen. The player will instead "wrap" into the next section of the map.
