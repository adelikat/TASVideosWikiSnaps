[p 
	"Before watching the run I'd suggest to read this part to understand what is happening at some combos and glitches, techniques and how to do it.

		"Break & Fake 
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"Break combos are based on special move cancel, probably you will see this technique on every part of the run. To do the technique just need to press LP+LK after a special move to make cancelable, example: Terry power dunk (forward, down, forward + LK or HKxxLP+LK) Terry will do a spin you will be able to do another move after that.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Fake abuses from the same conditions but now with normal moves. To do the technique just press LP+HP after a normal move, very useful on corners.

		"Just Defend
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"It's like the well- known "Parry" of the Street Fighter 3 third, Garou also uses a similar defense so-called "Just Defend", sure, SNK brings new proportion, a exclusively defense with life recovery from normal, special attacks and of course, Super/Power as well,  that gives more life. The more damage you take the more your life is going to recovery. Got it?

		"Invincible Kain
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"Most known as Kain x Freeman bug because just freeman is able to make the bug possible. it's kinda difficult to do, it's required a lot of attempts and everything will  dependi on what effect will come out first. The first of them is the player come across with clone duplication which can be done with both Super and Power moves of Kain, also there's no effect on fighters just a Freeman clone animation on screen so it isn't a good deal to get. The second effect is quite impressive; first-off you need to build a P. Power bar (two bars) to perform it, take a good position and do a morbid angel attack followed by the power move himmlische seele, if did correctly the clone animation will not appear and then all his spcial moves will become invisible . Taking advantage from this glitch you're able to manage a 99 hits/infinity combo or make both characters stuck frame on screen dropping infinities power moves.

		"Kain Color
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"It's a piece of cake to do it. 
	$LF
	"If you're using Hokutomaru, with Rock Howard needs more frame manipulation. Just do a himmlische atem super move at mid-screen and dash on the 2nd player, with 2nd player just do a super move followed by a "just defend" from Kain's super ball and when the punch/shuriken try to hit Kain, do a quick just defend with Kain, your clothes will become blue like just defend color.

[ul 
	[li 
		"Kain Guard Crush
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"A Kain combo glitch, you need to hit a lot the second player until his guard gets crushed, when the defense get red, just drop the himmlische seele ball then break the player guard with HP+HK (C+D) after the ball hit your opponent  defense.

		"B.Jenet extra hit
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"Try to do some combos on Jenet an extra counter hit will be allowed giving more combo options, thus due to some wrong programmation (I don't know yet) she's the only character that is able to do a combination of normal moves into special/super/power one.

[p 
	"A difficult bug/trick, consists on cancel the fastest way possible of hell rotor into another, there's no secret way to do just need to do the hell rotor (down, back + punch) and cancel into HK (D). that took me a huge effort to charge those bars and manipulating them by frame advance abuse.

		"Gato's Stomp

		"Tizoc throw escapes
		$LF

[p 
	"Makes possible dodges every time Tizoc tries a new throw even if is a super/power move. There's no much addition of this trick on fight since it is small stuff.

[p 
	"Hotaru has a Kobi Kyaku move which has the same function of Soul Reflector of Rose in SF Alpha/Zero. She can reflect every projectile and super/power moves, also she can use Butt/Marco Rodriguez power moves against him allowing to make a 100% due to Haou Shoukou Ken absorb damage.
	$LF
	"Another interesting effect can be done reflecting the first projectile against the enemy, if hit the second projectile will pass through the character when reflected getting invulnerable of their own movements.

[p 
	"Cool game, I've never expected an "All Characters" run, firstly the mainly idea was just add the best glitches and some matches, grassini suggested Tizoc addition which encourage me to go far and reach this result. Despite the lot of records (70k) was a good game to work on, just one desync throughout the run, one mounth of working and FBA didn't disapointed at all.

	(__wikiLink|user:Nach)
	": This run is a bit weird in its style, and not what I would normally consider entertaining enough for a fighting playaround. I think most of that is a fault of the game itself though, it doesn't seem to offer the kind of fun things some others do. Feedback on this was also negative, therefore, rejecting.
