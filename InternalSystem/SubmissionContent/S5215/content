]h2
[p 
	"Rockman EXE WS was developed by either Bandai or Capcom, depending on what source you use, and was released in early 2003 in Japan for the WonderSwan Color, putting its release at around the same time as Battle Network 3. Unusually for the series, this game is a platformer instead of an RPG, which means MegaMan.EXE gets to jump, gun, slide, charge, and defeat bosses like classic Mega Man. The game still adapts several Battle Network staples - features such as obtaining battle chips from enemies, using battle chips as special attacks, obtaining Style Changes, upgraded versions of bosses, and the familiar cast of characters and mooks are all adapted to the platforming gameplay of this game.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Unconventionally for a platforming Mega Man game, you don't get to directly choose the stages you go through. This game has six stages (up to seven on a second playthrough) and you go through each of them in order. However, many of the stages have different branches, with different environments and different bosses. This mean that running this game still has an element of routing, deciding in each stage which path is cleared faster, which gives access to useful battle chips, which has a more convenient boss battle, or which has an exploitable weakness. At six stages, this game is quite short, but the game is designed for replayability, with harder difficulty options and newgame+ options that can be used to traverse the different possible paths across multiple playthroughs, and use certain chips to reach secret areas to obtain more chips.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The plot of this game: I have no clue. I haven't read any of the dialogue or cutscenes or other such information, and while a translation patch of this game exists, I have not looked at it at all. All I know is MegaMan.EXE is jumping, gunning and sliding through stages and defeating bosses and other things that get in the way. I do know that the game takes its set of enemies and bosses from Battle Network 1 and Battle Network 2 (mostly 1), and the plot kind of takes its elements from there, so something something WWW something Life Virus something something yeah I don't know. Life Virus gets destroyed and the end.

	"The reasoning here for the routing in each stage is as follows:
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" Stage 1 has no choice. FireMan.EXE is always the first boss.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" ColorMan.EXE's stage is shorter than ElecMan.EXE's stage. The difference is approx. 600 frames.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" PharaohMan.EXE's stage has the very useful BodyBurn battle chip, which is used everywhere for faster movement and dashing through enemies unharmed. PharaohMan.EXE is also weak to it, and it is a reasonably powerful attack in general although its use for boss battles is situational.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" BombMan.EXE has a faster bossfight than SnakeMan.EXE, who likes to spend a lot of time in an invincible jar.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" FireManV2.EXE has a faster stage than ElecManV2.EXE. The difference is about 750-800 frames. Defeating ElecManV2.EXE would net the ElecBrother Style, which increases movement speed, but its speed is only marginally faster than BodyBurning everywhere and it's unlikely that it would save enough time to be worth it in just the final stage.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Stage 6 has no choice, you fight ProtoMan.EXE midway through the stage and Life Virus at the end.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"Besides routing stage branches, there's another much more complex aspect of strategy in this run - gathering battle chips for use in boss battles. I get a lot of random chip drops throughout the run, in order to use them to speed up boss battles. I get several ShockWaves, SonicWaves, Cannons and M-Cannons from minor Mettaur, Canodumb, or other enemies, and Atk+20 or Atk+40 chips in later stages, all to be used in boss battles to serve as filler weapons while charging the buster, or in the Atk+ case, just to reduce the number of hits to take down a boss entirely. After all, every attack that's stronger than an uncharged buster shot helps towards reducing the number of hits to defeat a boss, and most of the time, every hit saved is a 32 frame gain.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The chip usage is also carefully planned to use every chip at its most efficient point. M-Cannons are used to do just the bit of extra damage to make a boss take one hit less to defeat, Atk+ chips are used to beat bosses fast before they use time-wasting attack patterns, etc. Some work is also made to work around the limit of 4 active chip types at a time, which can get tricky especially later on when the BodyBurn is permanently fixed to a slot, and the WideSword's overall utility is also often too good to miss out on.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"All the chip usage makes the run quite annoying to plan, especially with the given fact that some drops are quite rare, and the RNG is tricky to manipulate. For instance, the odds of a Canodumb to drop an M-Cannon are 3%, Atk+40 from the DeathFire in stage 3 and Fishy2 in stage 6 are 7.5%, Atk+40 from Buffy are 10%, and those are some of the most crucial time-saving drops in the run. Sometimes I need to delay a few frames for some of these, but the boss hits they save make them well worth it.

]h2
[ul 
	[li 
		" Framerate note: as with other WonderSwan games, the game runs at 75 frames per second. Therefore, frames here refer to shorter time units than in most other games.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Bosses have 32 frames of invincibility after getting hit. When a character gets stunned from a particularly strong hit (only during certain attack patterns), this is raised to 76 frames of invincibility.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Boss lifebars appear to use bars, but bosses actually have hitpoint counts that usually are not integer divisible by the bars (for instance, Life Virus'  lifebar shows 32 units of HP, although it actually has 500HP). This means that the lifebars don't always accurately depict damage taken, with the same attack doing different lifebar points of damage, or weaker shots sometimes not visibly affecting the lifebar at all.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Walking and jumping have a speed of 1px per frame.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Sliding lasts for 40 frames and has a speed of 1.5px per frame. The game has no concept of subpixels, so the game actually just alternates traveling 1 or 2 pixels depending on the animation frame.
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" At the end of a slide, MegaMan.EXE continues to slip for another 6 frames at 1.5px/f, during which he can freely jump, slide, or walk. Pressing back for 1 or 2 frames while sliding also triggers this end-of-slide animation.
				$LF
			]li
		]ul
		" BodyBurn has a 12-frame charging period at 1px per frame, and then 40 frames of invincible dashing at 2px per frame. It cannot be cancelled in any way.
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" There's a glitch where it is possible to jump after a BodyBurn in mid-air, if the BodyBurn has made contact with the ground at any point while active. This is used in a few places for its gain in horizontal movement, such as to get the WideSword in stage 4 without requiring a death, and to skip part of a disappearing block section in stage 6.
				$LF
			]li
		]ul
		" Charging the buster takes 116 frames, and does triple damage.
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" With AquaCustom style, charging takes 90 frames. Other style changes have other rates, but those are not relevant for this run.
				$LF
			]li
		]ul
		" It is possible to charge the buster while using battle chips, but only with single-use chips, not toggle chips. So one can fire ShockWaves or Cannons while charging the buster, but selecting a Sword will cancel the charge. This is used for a few boss fights, where charged shots are used but other weapons can be used to hit bosses while charging up.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Buster slide cancel: Normally it takes 10 frames to fire successive buster shots. However, this can be done faster by firing a shot, sliding, cancelling the slide, and then it is possible to fire a shot immediately again (taking 4 frames in total). This is the fastest way to deal continuous damage to something without mercy invincibility. However, since most enemies follow mercy invincibility anyway, this is only useful in one instance - breaking the Life Virus' shield. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Weapon damage notes for the weapons used: uncharged shots do 10 damage, charged shots do 30 damage, ShockWave and Cannon do 20 damage, SonicWave does 30 damage, M-Cannon does 40 damage, and WideSword and BodyBurn do 30 damage. Elemental weaknesses do double damage, which is used against PharaohMan.EXE (weak against fire) and FireManV2.EXE (weak against aqua).

The coffin is one-hitted by BodyBurning into it, which also positions MegaMan.EXE nicely to attack him from the right side, so the Bodyburn moves him back center to hit PharaohMan.EXE again once he's teleported.
