	"Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles is an action role playing game developed by The Game Designers Studio and published by Square Enix in 2003 for the Nintendo GameCube. This was the first Final Fantasy game to include real-time fighting, which has since become a staple of Final Fantasy games. It was also the first Final Fantasy game to be published on a Nintendo console since Final Fantasy VI on the SNES.

	"You play as a caravanner, trying to beat dungeons to collect myrrh drops to be able to sustain your village's crystal energy, which protects the villagers from the mortal effects of the miasma. In this run, you go out as a Yuke, a race of mages, to go explore the world, but only the fastest way possible, skipping longer dungeons and bosses.

	"This is my fifth TAS of this game, and first time on this category. Any% is not the first category I chose to TAS because I wanted to play all dungeons initially, but since my run got published, I wanted to try to beat the game as fast as possible. This way, Conall Curach and Rebena Te Ra (and the end of Lynari desert) are skipped and replaced by faster cycle 2 dungeons (Mushroom Forest and Goblin Wall).

	"Final Fantasy is my favorite game of all time, even if it's mostly nostalgia. Here, you go on an epic quest to discover characters and cities, new stories unfold and there is sidequests offered to you along the way. Unfortunately, in this run, I skip most of it. In this game, the fastest way to beat it is to get to the last dungeon, wich is blocked by a miasma wall. The only way to pass it is to get the unknown element in the Lynari Desert, which is only accessable at year 5. You have to collect 3 drops of myrrh to complete a year, wich means I have to beat 12 dungeons before even being able to get to the last boss, 13 if we count reviving the flowers in Veo Lu Sluice to rise up the river to even get there. I do all 11 of the 14 dungeons in this game.

	"I chose to play the Yukerace, because he is not only the fastest caster, but his casts are even faster than autoattacks. Not only that, but spells are way more flexible and fusions can offer some great gameplay to beat boss easily. Also, with this race, I skip having to buy equipment, instead I focus on getting good artifacts to gain magic power. Since it's a TAS, I dont have to worry that much about my defense either since I can manipulate rngs all I want.

	"You choose, after each dungeon, an artifact that will give you permanent bonuses. In my case, I obviously choose the ones helpful for my magician. There is 2 ways to get artifacts: with points, or by dropping them inside the dungeon. The game works on a global timer, so each frame dungeons get a different seed wich affects bonus points conditions and ennemy drops (in the first room). The best way to manipulate what you want is to wait frames before entering a dungeon or a zone. It's also the same strategy I do after beating bosses to get the good set of artifacts I want. You also gain bonus points by killing ennemies and picking up things. It is important to know that my magical power only grow each multiple of 5. So most of the time I try to get to the higher one, with fruits and droppable artifacts. We start with 15, and we will be at the last boss with 75.

	"Money is also something important in this game, to pay the boat's fee. It costs me a total of 1200 gils, 2200 if I want to do a dialogue skip of 1 second. I got just over 1200 with all the money I dropped, and the items I sold to my merchant dad. I also take some detours here and there to change the element of my cristal, to be able to pass miasma streams.

Contrarily to the precedent TAS, I only take 2 magicites to make Fira since I did't take another command slot yet. Still, my magic is so high I beat the boss faster.

	"Funny thing is that the any% route and the all dungeons route are the exact same for the 3 first years. So for my next TAS, it'll be technically already started. Concerning the mistakes of the run, I must say that I have very few, and some that are not even mistakes at all. A mistake in Deamon's Court cost me like 5 frames, and I lost some little frames here and there (most notably up to 15 frames in the Mushroom Forest cycle 2) because of RNG.
