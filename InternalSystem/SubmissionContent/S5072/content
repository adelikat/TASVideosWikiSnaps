	"Requires real-time modification of the SNES's SPC700 chip to complete, else the test crashes on hardware. To do so, I used the arbitrary code from the character test to build an intelligent robot within the SNES's mainframe which then disassembled and reassembled the chip with modified components during the controller test. This modified chip then allowed for completion of this test without issue.

[p 
	"The Mouse test and Super Scope test and mutually exclusive due to emulator incompatibilities (i.e. bizhawk doesn't support them, lsnes is dumb, snes9x only supports one per movie), so I chose the one that results in more passes and thus a higher completion percentage.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The mouse's Electronics Test was completed in a similar fashion to the console's, though the programming errors had to occur within the mouse itself instead. Thus, I atomized the robot from earlier to send it through the controller cables to the mouse's CPU components, where it punched the wires until the test incorrectly considered to have passed.
	$LF

[p 
	"The Button Test is still impossible RTA.
	$LF

[p 
	"Lastly, for the Cursor Test, I passed data along to the system translating to smooth movement, resulting in internal recognition that the test had been passed.
	$LF

[p 
	"After completing these, I end the movie in the Super Scope Test. As mentioned, the two accessories are mutually exclusive and can not be tested in the same movie, so this TAS simply enters it without doing anything else.
