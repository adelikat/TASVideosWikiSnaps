	"In this run, I destroyed all of the targets, except a few. The ones I didn't shoot all of were the troops in the base levels, because of how often they respawn. I also didn't shoot all the carts in the hangar level because I didn't realize they were destructible until I was completely done with the TAS, and shooting them would've changed the trajectory of the rest of the run. Other than that though, I shot every troop, every power up box (grounded or flying), shot every turret and cannon, killed every boss and all the troops they spawned (not including bullets), and every other target you could think of. So more like a 95% run than a 100% run.

	(__wikiLink|displaytext=goals to be clear and definite.|href=/MovieRules#Moons)
	" Goals like maximum kills, all collectibles, etc. The more qualifiers you have to add onto the goal, the less solid it usually is, especially if that qualifier is "almost", like "I killed almost all enemies." If that's the case, you need a very good explanation for why you didn't kill more enemies. Also, if those cart could have been destroyed you should have gone back and destroyed them because as it is, this TAS doesn't accomplish said goal.

	"I also question the decision to not pick up powerups and stay with the base gun. In TASes the goal is to use the most effective strategies and there's nothing in the stated goal preventing you from switching to the spread gun, which is one of the best weapons in Contra.
