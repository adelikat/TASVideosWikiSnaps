	"Even with the Computer set to Hard, he can still be defeated rather quickly. I set the level to 0 and the height to 5 for me and the computer. The reason I set the level to 0 is to minimize input so that my stack won't overflow before his does. Sending 4 rows of garbage is enough to overflow your opponent's stack on height 5. To send 4 rows of garbage, is by making a Tetris or 2 triples.

	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Vault|href=/LegacyPages/Vault)
	" rules). This movie does not reach any meaningful end screen - after completing, it goes straight back to the Vs. Com settings menu. This is unlike the actual single-player modes, which do provide such end screens (be they as simple as a "you are a Tetris master!" screen). The fact that this movie picks the easiest settings to defeat the AI with also does not feel right.
