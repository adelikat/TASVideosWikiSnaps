	"My idea was to do a TAS with just 1 minute, but I saw that I could do more than that, so I decided to do a longer TAS, and I ended up doing one of 16 minutes and 3 seconds, it's a short time, but for me It was a high time, I can improve with time, especially because this is my first TAS, and I have never had a TAS in my life. so yeah, I will bring more long TAS, just wait.

	"At first, I was very confused at your categorization of "Warps", when it looks more like a play-around. If your intent was to perform an entertaining run, then it would be critic-ed by voting and audience feedback....which is not looking good. (Currently standing with 5 no's and 2 yes's). If it were compared against the existing "Warps" runs, then you are way off pace. I usually ask TASers to redo their work to make up for differences, but that goes for work that we have no comparison for. Here, you are over 6 minutes behind the current record holding run of
