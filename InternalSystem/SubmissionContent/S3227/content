Also, I manipulate luck for the Snake (the spawning place) in this level. RNG changes every few frames when there's a mosquito flying around. If the mosquito at this level's end it killed, you can wait all you want and the spawning spot of the Snake doesn't change.

As I explained in the post in the submission thread, this level didn't hex-edit properly so I had to fix something and that's why I lost an additional frame at Act 12 (1) due to the fading screen taking longer for some reason. Also I didn't kill a bird which is another bad side-effect of hex-editing but I left this mistake in, since it is not major and I can't seem to fix it. Also I'm too lazy to re-TAS this autoscroller.
