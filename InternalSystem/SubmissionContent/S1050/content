	"Stage 8, before anyone asked me that question, I answer you. When Simon take the stairs, it looks like that I've lost time by shaking him but in fact, it is faster by 1 frame. :P (Note that it is only useful at this place throughout the game)

	"The bosses, mummies, strategy in Famtasia was almost perfect. However, I did managed to beat it by 8 frames even though the randomness wasn't in my favor.
