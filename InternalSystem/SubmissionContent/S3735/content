	"This game is easy to optimize, but hard to route plan. Input for horizontal movement in the main stages occur once every 2 frames, except for jumping, which can occur any frame. For going up/down ropes, delay 7 frames before the next input. Yes, rope movement follows a frame rule. Here's the addresses for both movements:
