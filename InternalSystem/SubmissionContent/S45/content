	"I have been waiting for a time attack on this game since I first heard about them and it seems no one is doing it so I did it myself, this is a long side scrolling action game composed of 7 levels, it has a wide variety of weapons that can be used alone or mixed for better damage-speed, it also has some bare hands attacks and even a combination move just like the special moves of one on one fighting games, there's also a space shooting level where you control a ship, there's little room for improvements unless you play with 2 players or controlling both characters at the same time (a bit difficult for this game).
