	"Doc Louis's Punch-Out!! is an exclusive game that was released only to Club Nintendo Platinum members, and only in North America. It is by far the shortest Punch-Out game, and is really more like a demo for Punch-Out Wii. The game consists of only three different fights (all against the same opponent, Little Mac's trainer Doc Louis), fewer than even the arcade games, and the total in-game time is faster than SNES Super Punch-Out!! despite the ingame clock running faster.
	$LF

[p 
	"As always with the Punch-Out games, the goal is fastest in-game time. Fastest real time is a secondary goal, but to my knowledge these are also the fastest real-time strats. The only places real time matters are menu navigation, skipping cutscenes, and one punch that happens while the in-game clock is stopped.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"However, going through the menus as fast as possible means the fight times can only be seen by slowing down playback. To keep them visible at full speed, I sacrifice 20 frames at the end of each fight.
