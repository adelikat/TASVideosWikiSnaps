	(__wikiLink|displaytext=welcome to TASVideos|href=/WelcomeToTASVideos)
	". Here on TASVideos we aim for perfect movies... or at the very least as close as one can get. While I think it's great you're trying to get into TASing, your submission has some major flaws that aren't acceptable given our standards. As has been brought up in the replies, there really isn't a reason to use default difficulty here. However, the bigger flaw here is your optimization. It is extremely likely this TAS would be a lot faster if you used combos. I recommend looking into this game some more and using 
	(__wikiLink|href=/Userfiles|implicitdisplaytext=userfiles)
	" for WIPs and gathering additional feedback on these WIPs by making a forum thread for this specific game. You said you completed this in a single day, but please take your time while making TASes.
