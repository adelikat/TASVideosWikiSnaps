	"While making this TAS, I've been annoyed by frequent freezes of the emulator in dungeon manipulation
	$LF
	"and continuous desync between luabot and real result in battle.
	$LF
	"They made the rerecords to 5 million and make me waste several months...

	"It is pretty liner.

	" Gate of Beginning (たびだちのとびら)
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Required gate.
	$LF
	"I set the message speed to "8(slowest)".
	$LF
	"it's known to Japanese DQ RTA/TAS players that "the slowest is the fastest, when we press buttons repeatedly".
	$LF
	"It also helps for luck manipulation.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"No "HP 1 entertainment" at the battle of Healer, because every damage wastes about 30 frames.
	$LF
	"Befriended the strongest Healer(ホイミスライム) with AT 15. it saves some turns of later battles.
	$LF

[h4 
	" G Class Arena
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Practically required.
	$LF
	"When you cheat money, this class is skip-able. :P
	$LF
	"Nothing to tell on battle. they are too weak.

[h4 
	" Gate of Villager （まちびとのとびら）
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Not required gate.
	$LF
	"I go to gather 100G for D class arena and to befriend Dragon（ドラゴン）.
	$LF
	"I've taken Lib(ほねつきにく) and sold it at the shop of 3F, because it seems to be impossible to collect 100G efficiently in the gate.
	$LF
	"even if it's possible, it would be slower. to gather 100G, terry needs to pick up 5 gold item, at least. Max 20G there.

[h4 
	" D Class Arena
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Required arena.
	$LF
	"Killed Slime, because he will waste 40 frames every turn.
	$LF
	"It takes a bit longer than previous run, because of the lack of Golem.
	$LF

[h4 
	" Gate of Anger  （いかりのとびら）
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Required gate.
	$LF
	"I need to gather 10000G for the next arena.
	$LF
	"Collected expensive staffs as previous run.
	$LF
	"the staff and hole manipulation was really a**, it deprived me of crazy amount of precious time.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Befriended Dragon Kid（ドラゴンキッズ）, using Herb（やくそう）.
	$LF
	"He was so strong, i assume he saved much time to beat his father, Battle Rex（バトルレックス）. lol
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" S Class Arena
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Required arena. Nothing to talk with 1st and 2nd battle.
	$LF
	"the 3rd battle annoys me so much as DonamerDragon had annoyed 5 years ago.
	$LF
	"Due to the fool AI, they don't attack Metabble（はぐれメタル）, when the other 2 monsters are alive.
	$LF
	"Metabble casts unavoidable magic every turn, unless we succeeded to cancel magic.
	$LF
	"Only when Roboster（キラーマシン） attacks before Metabble, Metabble re-thinks what to do and sometimes changes his action.
	$LF
	"After killing Roboster, my monsters had to kill Metal Drak（メタルドラゴン） while taking unavoidable damage from Metabbles.

	" Gate of Judgment （かがみのとびら）
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"I had planned to befriend Servant（まおうのつかい）, because he appears in unavoidable battle.
	$LF
	"but it was turned out that Servant can't do critical hit. so, i abandoned my plan and befriended Mimic（ミミック） as usual.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"One more unexpected thing is that, in Japanese v1.0 ROM,
	$LF
	"one of Servant casts Blizzard at the first turn by 100% and it kills Dragon Kid...
	$LF
	"So, i had to take Miststaff（まふうじのつえ）to prevent his magics...
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Nothing for the other 2 bosses. they were easy to be beaten.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Starry Night Tournament（ほしふりのたいかい）
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"it was a funny tournament. most of the monsters are easily "defeated" by Defeat（ザラキ）spell of Mimic.
	$LF
	"There was no fatigue, unlike previous run. ;D

	" Ending
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The current run ends at the weird point. there are some dialogue after the movie end and the long ending credit.
	$LF
	"my submission is ended at the same point though, i can replace the movie, which is same as the one i posted on niconico, when needed.
