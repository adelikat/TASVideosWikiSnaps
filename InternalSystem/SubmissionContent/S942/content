	"It was a while since I did my previous run of this, and it turned out to be not so good. In my old version however the second player was a total pacifist and I didn't take damage. This time I take loads of damage, tossing squirrels everywhere and let them kamikaze into pits and other evil things.

	"This is actually my forth version this time because I had to start over a couple of times. It was good though.

	"My original plan was to do a run that could be compared to Genisto's masterpiece but unfortunately the game didn't allow me to do that. I do control both characters this time but I can't, in most cases, run with them simultaniously because the game lags (hacks?) too much. The first area alone ate 1000 frames if I recall correct from my test runs if I were to run with both of them. Thus one of the animals has to be carried to make it faster.

	"Else it's quite a simple game and I don't have more to add really. When I started and saw how the progress went I was hoping for a 2 minute improvement, landing somewhere above 12 minutes, but it went even better and I managed to improve my old run with 3 minutes and 3 seconds if I got it right (from 14:39 down to 11:36).

	"Oh yeah. The boss in level 8 could be the most boring boss ever. He's the one driving that machine. He takes 8 hits to kill and I have to wait for him to drop stones that I can toss at him. The other bosses went fine though.
