	"This is the sequel to Air, by U1, the author of the original. It's almost exactly the same as its predecessor, but with one major change: no infinite jumps. Obviously, this makes the game much, much harder, and most of the solutions in the original are useless in this one. There's a few level changes to accomodate the primary modification and all invisible coin blocks are marked, but the vast majority of the game is exactly the same.

		"In 3-1, I have to take a hit at the beginning to be able to make the subsequent jump into the coin, which allows me to enter the block far enough to start running to the right and into the pipe. There's an alternate route, but it results in simply running across the entire level, which is really boring, especially since I think this level is the most entertaining one to see in action. I also have to take a hit later so 3-2 will sync.
