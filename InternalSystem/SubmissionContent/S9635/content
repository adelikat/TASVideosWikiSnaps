	"No, I don't know anything about Bratz. I used to see commercials for the dolls on television back when I was a kid. I've never seen anyone actually have them. The only reason I TASed this game is because I did a speedrun of it back in 2023. Why did I speedrun it? Beats me.

	"This TAS aims to clear the "Contest" mode on the GBA version of the game. In this mode, all you have to do is simply clear 10 levels. You push the buttons on the screen when the game tells you to. It's as exciting as it looks.

	"At the bottom the screen, there is a health bar. If it reaches 0, you fail and have to restart the level. Missing notes causes the health bar to decrease. Getting a "Perfect" note will increase it. Getting a "Good" note won't increase or decrease the health bar.

[div class=p 
	"After clearing a level, you will unlock new dance moves that you can use in the freestyle sections, as well as the next level. How many new moves you unlock is determined by your score. Perfect notes are worth more points than Good notes, so I miss the first few notes and get Good on the rest. You can miss more notes by restoring the health bar with Perfect notes, but your score would still be higher than just getting Good on everything. For some reason, doing a pattern of Perfect-Perfect-Miss is 4-5 frames faster, but since your score is higher, you sometimes unlock an extra dance move, wasting time.

	": Ok...I get it. You may have intended for this to be a joke, but it does qualify for acceptance. After looking at how the optimization works, you are correct that 4 to 5 frames are lost from playing this perfectly. Leaving off a number of inputs allows this to occur....but I also see that you have to play the majority of the game in order for it to continue. So this means that your run qualifies for "Fastest Completion", while a maximum score could run as another branch.
