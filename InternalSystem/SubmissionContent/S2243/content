	"Hello everyone. This is my first full-game TAS, so I decided to try my hand at Star Fox 64. I chose this game because I really liked playing it when I was younger, and I always wondered how good you could get at this game. When I saw that there was no movie for it, I immediately thought: "I could do this!" I feel really good about this run because it shows the raw game pushed to the limits without any special glitches or cheats. I hope everyone enjoys my run and that more are made in the future.

	"Star Fox 64 is the supposed "remake" or sequel of the original Star Fox for the SNES. You play as Fox McCloud and basically fly around in an "Arwing" shooting down enemies. You have 3 friends who accompany you on your voyages adding their "helpful" advice such as doing a barrel roll. You encounter team Star Wolf, Star Fox's rivals and many other foes. The final boss is Andross, a giant monkey head with floating hands. When defeated, he turns into mechanical set of eyes and a brain. (Not unlike Mother Brain)

	"This movie was made over about a week long period. The hardest part to making this movie was probably getting all the angles and aiming perfect. Many will enjoy the results because it shows this game played to the highest degree.
