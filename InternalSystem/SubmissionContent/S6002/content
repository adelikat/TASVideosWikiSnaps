	"Unlike many other games that allow to play some levels in arbitary orders, this game is unique that the layout of the freely selectable levels have variants depending on where the player starts off as well as arrives at. Some of them each consist of three sections separated with screen transitions, but some others have only one each.
	$LF
	"The five peripheral locations as end points of levels each features a boss that will be gone for the rest of the game after getting defeated.

	"So what is needed to be done to beat this game?
	$LF
	"The answer is to defeat the five bosses each locating at one of the five peripheral end points first, then find the princess between the two end points on the bottom of the map, and just continue on the plot to beat all of the remaning fixed-order levels.

	$LF
	"Because the sum of any two of the five levels connecting to the central house are longer then any of the five peripheral levels, the central house has no value to visit, except as the starting point of the game.

	"These reduce the free part of the route for consideration to two. With testing, the winner is the current:

	"In a platforming game, speed is almost always the modst important thing for speedruning, but the ability to hover in the air, the power to take down bosses fast, and sometimes the defence to take damage to save time are often as important as well.

	"Weapon of each chracter can be permantly upgraded by collecting... weapon upgrades of certain amount. That usually increases the fire power, but can also slow down the game with excessive lags. Bosses usually have no invulnerabiliy but can only receive damage once every frame. Thus weapon upgrade has to be ballanced for speedruning.
