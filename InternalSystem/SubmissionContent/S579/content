	"Trojan is a kinda simple game. You play as this great warrior who has faboulus powers. Basically this means he can walk forward and strike enemies with his sword. He also has a shield and the power to jump. Despite the fact that it is simple I really like this game. It's sort of hard because you are limited to a few movements but it's still not that hard to control.

[div class=p 
	"This run is more than a minute faster than my previous published run and also 24 seconds (if I calculated it right) faster than my recently submitted attempt. Those 24 seconds comes from jumping! This is because every now and then the hero puts his heels in the ground and stops for a frame if walking. This can be avoided by constant jumping. It's not possible though to jump all the time because of enemy spawning. This is not that big problem though because as mentioned, the hero only stops every now and then. This means I can walk some frames occasionaly without delay. Enemies also works as walls, so I must kill the ones in front of me to proceed.

	"Finally I want to thank Blitzag for poiting this simple but yet very useful "trick" out. I don't know how I missed it but I did. Thanks!

[div class=p 
	"The improved time is basically from better boss fights (compared to my oldest run). I used new strategies against every boss and also manipulated some of them to act like I wanted.

[div class=p 
	"The second last boss, King Shriek, is a bit different than the others because before he/they appear they toss small stones all over the place. I didn't want to get hit by the stones but I made sure I could strike the boss/es as soon as possible, thus it resulted in some necessary waiting there. Also, they are not vulnerable before they come out from the wall so the waiting is necessary anyway.

[div class=p 
	"I make two stops to pick up power upgrades. This is good because it allows me to spank bosses really fast and it's worth it. Where I pick up the second I also gets a speed upgrade for the rest of that stage. This speed upgrade is very handy, it let's me walk at the exact same speed as jumping and thus I could walk the entire forth stage, which in my opinion looks cooler.

	"In stage 2-2 there is a lake I have to cross. There is no delay caused by walking in the lake and it's equaly slow to jump so I choosed to walk most of the time here.

[div class=p 
	"In the "vertical" levels where the goal is to reach the bottom I sometimes jump, sometimes walk to the elevator/hole. This is because it was either 1-2 frames faster or equaly fast. This depends on position of enemies and myself.

[div class=p 
	"Oh, in stage 1-2, where I pick up the first power icon you might see a small delay. This is caused by an invisible wall. However, any other thing that I tested was slower than this and also it's good for avoiding that mini-boss.
