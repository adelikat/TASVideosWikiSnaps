	"This is a 1081 frame improvement over the published run. Most of the time saved is from a new bug in level 3 that allows the player to clip into the boss room (and fight a bugged version of the boss), saving several seconds of navigating through the level. Other than that, a few misc things were tightened, like the other boss fights, the pig jumping and lag reduction.
