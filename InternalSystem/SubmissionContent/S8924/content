	"Sonic Classic Heroes is a ROM hack for Sega Mega Drive that is the result of a collaboration between flamewing and ColinC10, combining their respective hacks Sonic 2 Heroes and Sonic 1 and 2. It is therefore a single ROM that offers all the Sonic the Hedgehog campaigns. and Sonic the Hedgehog 2, either alone or together; and allows the player to play as many characters as Sonic, Tails and Knuckles. The hack gets its name because of the ability to control a team of characters, which is reminiscent of the 3D game, Sonic Heroes.
	$LF
	"The hack is based on the Sonic 2 engine, which has been enhanced by both Flamewing and ColinC10 to have new features. These include: multiple gameplay elements from Sonic 3 & Knuckles, such as element shields and character-specific abilities; the ability to save progress, scores, etc. in SRAM (something rarely implemented in Sonic 2, the other notable example being Esrael's Sonic 2 Delta); various bug fixes and mechanic improvements from the original games; and many more features, both implemented and planned.
