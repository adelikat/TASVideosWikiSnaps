	"Kid Icarus is a classic platformer for the NES.  It has some stages that scroll vertically, some that scroll horizontally, and some fortresses that are designed to be mazes.  It's known for being a challenging game, so it's fun to optimize.

		" The TAS makes heavy use of the rapid fire trick introduced by Celeri in 2007.  Ducking resets the shot cooldown, so we alternate shoot and duck to fire rapidly.  This is most apparent in the 1-4 and 2-4 boss fights, but it's also used throughout the run any time we want to fire a quick burst of arrows.

		" Lava, thorns, and other environmental damage will only hurt Pit once every 32 frames according to a timer.  If you know the value of this timer, then you can jump in and out of lava without taking damage.  This is abused on stages like 2-3.

		" Killing enemies awards points which take time to tally up at the end of the stage, so it's usually better to avoid killing things.  Exceptions to this include stages 1-2 and 2-1, where Pit needs to kill enough enemies and collect enough hearts to earn strength upgrades.

Around 13900 you'll see I hesitated for a moment - this was to manipulate the moving platforms in an upcoming section.  This platform section (roughly 14800-15400) was the biggest time save in the stage.  I was able to make a new jump thanks to a damage boost, and then I did a small hop to force the last platform to bonk into the thorns; this made the platform turn back earlier (thanks to Rumbleminze for helping me understand how this works).

	"The biggest time save in the run comes from the Medusa fight.  Basically, if you shoot on an odd frame in 4-1, you'll actually shoot two arrows.  Typically only one will deal damage, but we can get both arrows to hit Medusa if we're close enough.  This finishes the fight in 26 shots instead of the usual 51.  This fight has an interesting history.  Sleepz first showed off a similar setup for their 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=2004 TAS|href=/47M)
	", but they took a lot of damage and only survived because they had 3 bars of health.  Subsequent TAS videos and speedruns only had 2 bars of health, so players backed off and played it safer.  Years went by, and Sleepz's method was forgotten.  Recently, TMR experimented with fighting Medusa up close, and he found a safe spot where Pit could deal damage up close without getting hit.  This made it possible to get double hits regardless of how many bars of health we have.  Darkwing_Duck_sda perfected this method and Rumbleminze helped figure out how it works.
