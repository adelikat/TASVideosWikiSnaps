	"River City Ransom is a side-scrolling beat-em-up where Alex and Ryan fight gangs of evil high school students. It also contains RPG elements, where the player can defeat opponents to earn money and upgrade his fighting techniques. This run unlocks the secret 4v4 final boss fight, and wins, as quickly as possible. This is all thanks to winning the lottery and spending the money on swords and the powerful martial art of bashing people with improvised weaponry.

[div class=p 
	"Areas generally contain 10 enemies that must be defeated to trigger a boss fight. Four enemies will spawn at a time, about 30 frames apart, out of view of the player. Defeated enemies drop a coin 120 frames after they are knocked unconscious. When this coin is picked up, a new enemy spawns. Movement when entering a new area may seem slow, because waiting to cause enemies to spawn together lets them be defeated quicker.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"If an enemy runs away, that counts as defeating him. A new enemy spawns as soon as the retreating enemy leaves the stage (not simply when it goes offscreen). Throwing an enemy into a pit also counts as defeating him. These methods may be faster because there’s no wait for a coin to spawn. The Entrees and Generic Dudes are the most cowardly gangs.

	" Boss Fights:

]h3
[div class=p 
	"Bosses have a lot of Hit Points and Stamina. When a boss’s hit points are reduced to 0, he will gain HP and lose stamina equal to the damage from the hit that took his HP to 0. After this point, any hit will knock the boss down. An enemy flying through the air after being knocked down can’t be damaged, and a downed enemy takes half the usual damage. Therefore, it is usually better to fight a boss with weaker attacks until he reaches 0 HP, and then start hitting him with the strongest attack, Grand Slam.

[div class=p 
	"Moose, Rocko, Thor, and the four final bosses can be thrown into a pit or thrown outside of the level to kill them instantly. To throw a boss outside of the level, it is easiest to have Alex jump backwards into the wall, and throw the boss with perfect timing so that he will escape as Alex’s arms are moving the boss backwards. By holding down the attack button for about 30 frames while standing still, the player can deliver a charged punch that is guaranteed to knock down the boss if it hits.

	(__wikiLink|displaytext=counterpart run|href=/7579S)
	" was quite a unique experience. On one hand, the other run has a faster time and some better early movement. On the other hand, this run has the better overall route choice in the latter half of the run. On a mutated third hand after that accident at the chemical plant, the "routing" in both runs would most likely improve each other. Both strategies should be able to be combined into a run at least 30-40 seconds faster than either run, perhaps upwards of a full minute using additional discoveries made during the judgement of the runs. At the same time, it doesn't quite make sense to reject either run for optimization issues, because neither run is outright poorly executed. They just "complement" each other in the strangest way, particularly by both being on the workbench simultaneously.

	"The bigger issue is the goal choice. It's not going over quite well. The goal is, basically, to get a full gang together as fast as possible, triggering a more difficult version of the final boss fight. This, to me, doesn't feel like quite enough to differentiate it from a pure any% run. There's a lot of weird stuff in this game, lots of altered fights and secret scenes and things you can do with gangs, so the runs kind of straddle this weird line just above any% but not quite up to the level of any other reasonable category. What kills the category for me is the final boss fight itself, as the run uses a bug to instantly take out every boss with little to no effort, essentially making the run feel like a long detour for no real payoff.

	"Ultimately, the judge team decided we can have both of these runs in Playground. Despite being the same category, they tackle it in different enough ways that it's worth having them both available for reference and study.
