We had one version up to the dungeon finished when we realized that we didn't have enough health. After redoing, we got another heart, two instead of one, and matched the RNG number to have the run sync up. But for some reason, despite the same RNG value, we didn't get the Kinstone drop inside the dungeon. This baffled us for a long time. Apparently, having one heart or less, changes a value which will affect drop rates for items, possibly to easier get heart drops when on low health, unsure. We solved this by getting the Kinstone from the Darknut fight instead of the Armos as in previous TAS. This even ended up being faster, so all good!

Through the entire run, up to the final boss, an Arrow drop has been attempted for, but RNG is mean... A couple of frames were lost to grab it after the Bracelets and we also had to redo the Mazaal fight, dungeon 3 boss, to save extra Arrows (Which actually ended up saving time).

Even more sadly at this location is that it's very close to skipping half of the dungeon. While Link can run on holes while the glitch is activated, he can't move to another screen if he won't be able to stand on solid ground the first frame. Otherwise we could have ran to the boss room, which is on our right after activating the glitch, skipping the Boss Key and second part of the dungeon. So close, yet so far :(.
