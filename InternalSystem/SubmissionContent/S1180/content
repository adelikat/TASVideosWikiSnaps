	"Sonic Advance 3 is the third Sonic game released for GBA, and is certainly the 
	$LF
	"longest and most difficult of those three to TAS. It is the least-breakable 
	$LF
	"Sonic Advance game, with no way to gain potentially unlimited speed (air dash 
	$LF
	"has been removed) and not as many bugs leftover from the previous games. Not 
	$LF
	"only does it have more (and more complicated) levels than the previous games, 
	$LF
	"but this time there are 20 different teams of two characters to play as (each 
	$LF
	"with different capabilities and "tag actions" to perform), which adds a lot of 
	$LF
	"complexity to figuring out how to beat each level the fastest. There's no 
	$LF
	"clearly superior team at everything, it was fairly well-balanced with 
	$LF
	"different teams possessing different strengths and weaknesses, although this 
	$LF
	"run takes advantage of some exploits that upset that balance a bit. Of 
	$LF
	"course, this being a Sonic game means it has difficult-to-optimize and often 
	$LF
	"non-intuitive physics.

	$LF
	"using suboptimal character combinations on many levels simply to avoid taking 
	$LF
	"the time to switch characters, which wouldn't have been much fun. Playing 
	$LF

	$LF
	"(I believe) have questionable entertainment value for the added movie length, 
	$LF
	"and would possibly result in re-playing quite a few levels for very small time 
	$LF

	$LF

	$LF

[p 
	"I admit that the character switching means that the run as a whole isn't very 
	$LF
	"well-paced, if nonstop action is your idea of good pacing, but I'd rather have 
	$LF

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The most important ones have to do with Sonic's tag action. Sonic's tag action 
	$LF
	"is supposed to give you a boost as if you were running over a booster, and it 
	$LF
	"is supposed to work even in the air, but since you can jump while running over 
	$LF
	"a booster, that means you can use it to jump while already in the air if you 
	$LF
	"use Sonic's tag action boost and jump at the exact same time. Not only that, 
	$LF
	"but the frame spent jumping causes the boost to get applied for 2 frames 
	$LF
	"instead of only 1 frame, giving extremely fast movement (12 pixels per frame 
	$LF
	"instead of the usual 10). (As another variation of this maneuver, holding Down 
	$LF
	"to roll while using a tag action boost also gives the extra speed, obviously 
	$LF
	"without the jump.) Additionally, if the boost+jump is done while on the ground 
	$LF
	"on a downhill surface, preferably a completely vertical one, that speed goes 
	$LF
	"even higher (up to 16 pixels per frame horizontally). Because it counts as 
	$LF
	"regular jump, characters that can fly can do so out of a boost+jump, and note 
	$LF
	"that flying with Tails, unlike with Cream, does not decrease horizontal speed. 
	$LF
	"Other tag actions can be done while still in the air from a boost+jump, but

	$LF

	$LF
	"boost if you do it while in the air. Most people thought it was worthless for 
	$LF
	"gaining height, but I found that it works by multiplying your current upward 
	$LF
	"velocity, thus giving you quite a large upward boost if you use it immediately
