	", PC, Android and Amiga. It features a character with a physical body who must collect pink jelly-like things while avoiding monsters. They can swap with the location of their Alter Ego an unlimited amount of times to either avoid monsters or get into a better spot. This Alter Ego also needs to collect grey jelly-like things and avoid it's own type of monster which is only featured in the final 20th level

	"When I originally made a TAS of this, I thought I had used the switching ability which is much faster than walking normally.. The author of the TAS of the NES port noticed this was not the case and managed to save 861 frames while I only managed to find an extra frame of timesave so they must be credited for pretty much all of the imporvements.

	"The improvements are made by using the switching ability more often as it removes the need to wait for enemy patterns (which are always the same) as much and increases movement speed when the character and alter ego are close to crossing over.

	"There is one glitch which isn't too hard to find but it is completely useless where switching on the very first frame possible launches the character and alter ego to the top left and right side of the stage, I assume because they have not be given a set swap location.
