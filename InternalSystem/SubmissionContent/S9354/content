	"This TAS could be improved by just doing the exact same strats on PC which has sharper turns, i did all the best version of the clips including a theoretical strat for the last stage which was only considered to be viable for individual laps but actually is TAS viable with pixel perfect precision, i wont spoil which character is so you watch it until the end.

	"The Sonic R discord is amazing,  i really wished they would have interest of TASing as they would easily have made this faster and probably better, my huge thanks to them, specially for telling me of the not very practical skip for the last stage. The new strategy makes Super Sonic obsolete in 100%, but I won't redo that TAS just because a new strategy was found by me and because Super Sonic doesn't have any other place to appear in the game TASes.
