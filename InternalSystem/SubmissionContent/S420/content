	"I Grabbed the Maru-Mari(Morph Ball) at the start. I then proceeded to kill Ridley and Kraid for their missle bonuses. After that, I went to Tourian to dispose of Mother Brain, while trying to avoid metroids at all cost, as I have no way of destroying or incapacitating them.

	"I used the door glitch to reach lower Norfair, and also to get to Kraid's hideout. Item drops from enemies were manipulated to give me what I needed. I used the restart sequence, Up+A on controller 2 while paused, four times to avoid backtracking. Although this run is faster than Arc's regular completion run, it should not be treated as such, because of the restart sequence. Without it, this run would be slower by around 2 minutes.

	"Many areas were improved over my previous 100% run. I was 73 frames faster after the first four rooms on this run, although about 1/3-1/2 of that is from optimizing the password entry. The first room in Tourian is much faster than in Arc's and my previous run. The escape sequence was also 6 time units faster than on Arc's run. I recorded this almost entirely frame-by-frame using the advance frame feature of FCE Ultra. The frame counter was also invaluable to judge time differences between different tactics along the way.

	"The biggest challenges were the Multiviola room in Ridley's hideout, and escaping the Metroids in Tourian. Ridley and Kraid didn't turn out as well as I would have liked. I needed more energy for Ridley. Kraid spawned poorly, causing him to fire his spines at a bad time, and nothing I tried would change the way he spawned. Other than that, I am very satisfied with the way the run came out.
