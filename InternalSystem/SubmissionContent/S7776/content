	"Anyway...this was a TAS that I did for my wife, who is a Yahtzee nut! In fact, she helped me to confirm that I played the game correctly. It was done about a year ago for fun, because we wanted to see how ridiculous it would be to see a "Max Score" run of this. Now that the rules have changed to allow board games, I decided to give this a submission.

	"I searched among many consoles to find a version that I liked. While some had decent graphics, the ability didn't exist to "Brute Force" the RNG necessary to make the dice values for a perfect run. I eventually ended up finding a version on the Commodore 64 that had good graphics. At first, I wasn't able to control RNG without letting the game run extended amounts of time. Eventually, I found a method to control the game code; thus, giving me the "Dice Rolls" for a perfect game. Now, the results of that effort are available.

	"This TAS strives for "Max Score". In regards to time, another problem was considered...Sound. The "Options", at the start of the game, allow for sound to be turned off. Doing so, causes the game run faster, due to supressing the "Speaking Voice". Because I wanted to demonstrate the capabilities of the C64, I decided to use the "Sound" version. For those interested, I have included an encode to show how fast this "Soundless" version ran. In this alternate version, the difference in speed is about 43 seconds. This version was TASed separately, as all the "Brute Forced" inputs occurred on a different frame in contrast to the submitted version.

	"As you see, the final score on the conclusion screen is "?05". This can be reversed engineered by using the above details. So, we can infer that our ending score is "1505". So why is the score still not up to the expected perfect value of 1575. I'm puzzled at this, but the breakdown comes from applying a Yahtzee on the "Small Straight" and "Large Straight". If you watch the score, the bonus is applied but not the score...where "30" and "40" are expected to be added. I retried the order and it appears that the combo is missed as a rule, yet it correctly scores a straight when done as a sequence of correct numbers. I also notice that it doesn't say the words for these selections, which could be a part of the issue. So, adding 70 to our final score gives us 1575.
