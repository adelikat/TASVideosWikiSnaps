	"Unfortunately, I am cancelling your movie, because it does not beat the currently existing record for this game, which is 
	(__wikiLink|1724M)
	". You lose time in many places due to suboptimal movements, missing tricks, odd character choices (for example, using the princess in 1-3), odd routing choices (for example, getting the key in 1-2 just to skip the key door anyway, and then only using the key for one hit in the next Birdo fight), and other sub-optimal areas or actions (like getting hit in the 6-3 Tryclyde fight).
