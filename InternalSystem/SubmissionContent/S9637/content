	$LF

	"So, remember how I said that the two-color gradient patterns (which are treated as regular colors for theorem purposes) require a layer of primer, thereby taking double the fill time? Well... what if that primer were 
	[em 
		"already there?
	]em
	" Yeah, that's what happens when you use orange. It turns out the primer layer is not always pink, but the third color not in the pattern, so any pink/yellow pattern will take 
	[b 
		"only one pass to fill.
	]b
	" I'll be honest with you, I find this a little disappointing. The gray regions were the heart and soul of the colorings. With three identical colors, it barely matters which ones you pick anymore. That said, there is a lot more opportunity for creative routing in terms of dual colorings and trivial differences, so it's more interesting than I initially thought.

Freehand lets you move the pen during the fill, while the p2p pen gets stuck in place; this means freehand is faster, ceteris paribus. However, the freehand pen moves 2 pixels at a time, so certain tiny regions may be inaccessible. See last year's submission for more details.

The only thing I could think would be to do an "ocean" mode (see below FAQ) that leaves the backgrounds purple and requires you to use pink, yellow, gray, and orange. But even that would be weird because the first palette actually has a second color 1/color 2 pattern, unlike all other palettes. So suddenly you're locked to the red/white/blue palette. So... oceanic, no funky patterns?

While that seems to be the case for some of the dinosaurs, the reduced coloring times resulting in different coloring routes. The fact that some of them resulted in some fairly radical (for Color a Dinosaur) routing changes is pretty neat and shows that even "simple" games can have not so simple challenges to them. Nice work!
