	"While the biggest improvement is spawning the final boss in the Hell Dimension and skipping an entire stage in the process, the other two boss fights are also improved through better understanding of how fighting a boss works. Bosses have 148 HP and die when they reach 128, like normal things that make sense. For the two melee characters, they do damage every non-lag frame of their attack as long as the hitboxes are connected. You can do a maximum of 9 damage per attack if positioning lines up properly, which given this game you can pretty safely say that no, it usually doesn't. The rhino boss is real nasty with positioning issues. The charge attack starts at an inopportune time and is ever so slightly too fast to allow for a 9 damage hit without dying. The best we could get was 7 damage, we need 8 on the last hit, so we had to back up and semi-RTA strat that guy.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"There's a possibility that we could get the quicker kill, which would save about a second, but there is the big issue with the final boss. Namely, it's an RNG-based spawn, like normal things that make sense, and it's a frame delay thing. We got literally the best possible result for that spawn, 0 delay needed and a beautiful pattern for the fight itself. The Glitch World Hell Place is... Really, really weird and inconsistent. Sometimes there are invisible platforms, sometimes there aren't. You can't stand on an invisible platform and fire, because you will immediately fall through, like normal things that make sense, so we do have to cut our firing barrages short so we can move back to where we think an invisible platform is and jump off of it. This is in fact a slower fight than the published run, but that's because the published run actually has a stage with actual platforms and is able to just stay in the boss's face and rapidfire it to death near instantly. It's a price of a second or two for the huge 40-ish second improvement of skipping an entire stage.
