	": This is an extremely plain game, however it features enough room for optimization in order to warrant a publication. This could be done mainly by jumping as often as possible while moving, since it makes the player slightly faster. I estimate that this trick would save from 10% to 15% of the time, that is at least half minute over this run. While the difference would not be noticeable while watching the movie, it would be an unacceptable flaw since it has an impact on the final time, while on the other hand there are almost no other means to speed up the gameplay.
