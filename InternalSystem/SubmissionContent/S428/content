	"This is just a game where you try to achieve the highest score/times in an olympic style type. It's basically a button-masher throughout most of the game. Other events, such as  the Javelin Throw, Shooting and Archery, do require you (to the best of your ability) to achieve great accuracy and reaction speed.

	"The making of this movie was fun, but a challenge, as I have to be as close to perfect as possible. Granted, the times in the running events aren't the fastest, I was still able to receive quite a high score, overall (since this is for the highest score). The hardest event for myself was probably Archery, as it had to be accurate in hitting the target. It'd taken quite a bit of re-recording for that event.
