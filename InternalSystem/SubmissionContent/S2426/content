	"It was a fish, actually, it was a "Cheep-cheep" who helped me. I've found lots of strange tricks before, but never that strange. It's almost the largest range a flying-fish can get.

	"But somehow I made it. I had to give up little entertainment to get the right circumstance. This randomness might be improvable, but it could hardly save time, it's quite impossible to get the fish goes 20 frames faster.
