	": Hi, PikachuMan.  All in all, while this technically is a fastest completion of a game mode -- there is just such a minimal level of skill and input needed here in order to be optimal.  Each fight in the very beginning, for instance, only requires holding Up and the fire button for a few frames in order to destroy the enemy jet.  From there, another brief input sequence is then required in order to safely land your aircraft (i.e. speed up to around 790 mph, hold down B to slow down, then slightly adjust to land).
