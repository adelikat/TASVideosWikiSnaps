	"This is an any% run of the playstation platformer 'Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back'. Originally I wanted to make a 100% run of Crash 1, but after I switched to any% I chose to use my extra motivation to make a run of this game.

	"NOTE: I didn't experience any desync while recording this movie because I used the TAS sound plugin. However, this plugin is not particularly good for this game. The music is fine, but the sfx is almost completely lost. Eternal emulates the sound perfectly, but it may be a massive pain in the ass to edit in for whoever encodes this. Unfortunately I lack the experience to do it myself so hopefully it is not a huge problem either way.

			"Movement:
		]b
		" Crash's fastest movement speed is  on ice (v=15), but under normal circumstances it is when sliding (velocity = 18), however due to the pauses after each slide a mask is faster over all (v = 12). The game removes your masks for each boss and 'Boulders' style level so collecting them is not as fast continually sliding. Spinning is the same speed as walking in this game (v=10).

			"Gripping:
		]b
		" This trick can be used to clear normally impossible gaps. Crash's grip of platforms is very buggy and he can be surprisingly far into a ravine while still having an active ground flag. This is used in many places, but it is not particularly obvious in real time.

			"3rd Dimension Abuse:
		]b
		" This game has many 2D levels and the designers attempted to have these within 2D parameters, however in some 2D levels it is possible to jump towards the camera and bend around normally impassible objects.

			"Traction Glitch:
		]b
		" A very cool glitch that I stumbled across. Crash's speed when on ice is 15. When crash comes off the ice this reverts back to 10 usually, however on the frame of landing it is possible to press X and preserve the 15 velocity. This velocity can be held for as long as you can proceed without landing for more than a frame.
