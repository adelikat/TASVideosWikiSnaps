	": We don't accept hacked ROMs, except in case it's necessary for running bootlegged games, since these barely function on actual console, let alone emulators. In this case, the ROM used also features some grammar corrections, but it's still acceptable since it uses the most common patch available; also, it's the only fixed ROM present in the latest GoodNES list.
