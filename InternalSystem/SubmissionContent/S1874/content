		"When you hang on a ledge you press up and there will be a long climbing animation. You can skip this if you swing your sword at just the right time. It will skip the climbing animation, and just have you sort of jump up with the sword slash. This is a lot faster than watching the climbing sequence. However, this trick triggers a few extra glitches. It's really quite remarkable how one little thing causes so much damage. All of these glitches are fixed when you either take damage, climb a ledge without the Sword Climb trick, or leave a room.

	" I started working on an improvement run, and I've totally trounced this movie so far. just by the end of the first level, I saved 195 frames! Due to a big discovery in level 2, I didn't have to wait for the platform in the water to come back, saving (hold on to your hats) 666 frames! At this point in the run, I had shaved 14 full seconds off my first run. I made some big improvements in level 3 so far too, and made the level less boring by killing all the bad guys without wasting time. At the point where I am right now, I have saved 971 frames. This is why I'm canceling this run, and waiting to finish my new version.
