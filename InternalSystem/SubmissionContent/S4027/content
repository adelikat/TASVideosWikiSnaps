	"TASing this game was very fun and relatively easy though I did have to fix many things.  This was my 2nd time redoing this entire game after finding many spots to improve.  There's not much to say about the controls and gameplay in this TAS.  Notable things include that moving 1 space at a time is 6 frames faster than jumping across 2 and jumping into the end of the level is faster than moving 1 space up to it.  In the first zone, Firefly Swamp, there was very little improvement except for the 3rd level where I went to pull out the wood blocks behind the ship.  This allowed me to zip past the enemies in front of the ship without losing time to avoid them like in my last run.  The boss for this zone relies heavily on RNG.  I had to slightly manipulate luck to place the rock in the best position.

	"In Metro-Mayhem, the first stage was improved by roughly 1000 frames.  Before, I had to wait that amount of time for the moving platform to arrive because I was too late for it.  The 2nd level was improved by 91 frames because I was able to avoid being electrocuted.  Level 3 had a 1 frame improvement.  The boss was improved by a small amount thanks to a faster strategy.

	"Molten Island was one of the most annoying zones.  I previously lost about 1.5 seconds because I missed a faster route, but because of bad enemy positioning I lost a bit of time there.  The second level I also lost time because of bad enemy positioning which I can't fix.  So a little bit of time was lost.  In the third level 3 frames were saved from better optimization.  The boss was only improved by 2 frames because of better routes.

	"Forgotten Island had no improvements.  Puzzling Pyramid was improved by 259 frames, 148 coming from the boss.  I saved 210 frames in Sunken Temple because of better routing.  Only 18 frames were saved in Nuclear Nemesis and the final boss.

	"This is my first TAS besides Time Trial TASes within Mario Kart Wii, so I decided to pick an easy game to TAS first.  I hope to go for a more difficult Gamecube game in the future.
