	"This game is a standard top down adventure with basic controls. Dpad moves, B throws banana. That's it. There are some tricks up our sleeve though, if you throw a banana horizontally off the screen, it'll warp to the other side and come back to you like a boomerang. Bananarang? BANGARANG?! This lets us hit switches and stuff to progress.

	"There is also a glitch in certain screens where you can warp to an adjacent screen without having to traverse the one you're on. It involves being in the right position on the Y axis while leaving a screen to the left and holding up 20 frames later, as long as the screen you're glitching to can accommodate the warp location (so you can't just do it anywhere.) We use this trick to skip a screen before the final banana which saves some seconds. It's possible to do this trick in other locations as well but that's probably more useful for a 100% run to dart around to each other banana faster.
