	": This game is really neat. Your optimization is very solid. The only places that I thought were issues, weren't anything that I could find improvements on. One of the techniques was jumping from platform to plaform, when ascending. I found it odd how the detection on landing works. Needless to say, I wasn't able to improve. The other was corning around some ledges, during a fall. Again wasn't able to figure out anything. My guess is, there is something there, but it would take digging into the mechanics to see what can be found. Still, nothing to worry about.

	" from joeymittens. There are a number of levels  that you are able to include the risks and advance yourself ahead to make this run look perfect. Aside from the constant jumping (which helps your optimization), I didn't notice any "TAS" only tricks....only  the inclusion of risky maneuvers that make all the difference in beating all known times.
