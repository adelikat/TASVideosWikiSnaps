	"When landing while attacking, you're stuck on the ground for some frames to recover. However, there's a frame in which there's the opportunity to jump (although you'll do an undesirable aerial move which will not even hit enemies standing on the ground.) I often add another aerial move to make it look less crappy.

	"Enemies will always grab and damage you. They can be defeated by punching or kicking. When they've grabbed you, you must mash on your control buttons. Of course, in this TAS it's a matter of only ~3 frames. It's still faster to just kick enemies out of the way, so I only get grabbed if there's no other way to escape the enemies or for luck-manipulation.
