	"The player has to walk across stages and fight enemies.
	$LF
	"Each stage has a specific boss who has 6 life-points (the final boss has 7).
	$LF
	"Each hit deals 0.5 points of damage. You can jump, duck, kick and punch or do your 'special move' (up + b) which is kind of like Captain Falcon's Upair in the Super Smash Bros games. ;)

	"When landing while attacking, you're stuck on the ground for some frames to recover. However, there's a frame in which there's the opportunity to jump (although you'll do an undesirable aerial move which will not even hit enemies standing on the ground.) I often add another aerial move to make it look less crappy.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Enemies will always grab and damage you. They can be defeated by punching or kicking. When they've grabbed you, you must mash on your control buttons. Of course, in this TAS it's a matter of only ~3 frames. It's still faster to just kick enemies out of the way, so I only get grabbed if there's no other way to escape the enemies or for luck-manipulation.

	"In the levels, there are sometimes tougher enemies (more lifepoints). But this doesn't need further description.

	"In later levels, it's possible to get inside of walls. I'll describe everything in the level-specific descriptions. But for those who are curious can check this out: http://dehacked.2y.net/microstorage.php/info/693001496/glitch%20kfm%20v2.vbm

	"At the chainsaw guy, when landing and attacking but additionally ducking, you'll attack on the ground. The chainsaw hitbox was also sometimes tricky and led me to several restarts. I came up with some strategies, and the one in the run was the fastest.

[p 
	"When I played the game as a child, I always thought those bouncing black things were stones until I read a GameFAQs guide where I found out they're barrels.^^
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Whenever the boss picks up a barrel, he gains some invincibility time. 
	$LF
	"During this time I do my 'special attack' (up + b).

[h4 
	" Stage 3 
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"On this stage, I spend some more time on killing enemies because this gains me a bomb. Since the flying physics of it are so strange, I had to move backwards for it to hit the stage boss with full efficiency.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Stage 4
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"From this stage on, there're now new enemies. The little ones will jump on you if you keep ducking (which you'd do to kick them). I abuse this fact on the last stage to gain another bomb. The tough enemies will sometimes throw 
	[a class=extlink href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuriken rel=nofollow 
		"shuriken
	]a
	" (which causes lag and I always avoided that by kicking his ass before he can do it). 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This level has some ceilings in some spots. When doing the special attack which moves you upwards a bit, it gets canceled and you can do another one and thus float in air (above an assembly line and a moving platform which would have slowed me down.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In the middle of the level, there's a spot where you can get onto a wall (which wasn't intended), and get some wall ejection boost.^^
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The boss was a reason for me to postpone the project for some time. You can clearly see how he tries to escape after each attack. Fortunately, I figured out a good way to approach him.

[h4 
	" Stage 5
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Gaining some damage boosts here and there. The first tough enemy throws shuriken which causes the game not to load one of those spike structures.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"At the end of the stage, where you normally would have to duck and wait on the assembly line, I repeatedly jumped more and more inside the wall until I could gain a wall ejection.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Stage 6
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"As said earlier, if you duck while one of the small enemies is approaching he'll jump on you making it impossible for the normal player to low-kick him. I abuse this to make them be in midair so that I can easily kick them out without a time waste. I ended the movie as early as it was possible.
