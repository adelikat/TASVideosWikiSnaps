	" In DK this was the most complicated, the non-stop jumping is for avoiding conflict in both games, I mean, If in both games Mario and DKJr are in the floor and I have to jump in one of the two games, in both games jump, this avoids it.

	": This was rather fun. The feedback was also nice. And the movie is generally entertaining on 2 screens as the action is simplistic and slow enough to comprehend what's going on on both of them at once. Accepting to Moons as a multi-game TAS.
