	"Someone found an interesting glitch in RTA,it can help player warp Stage2.The glitch is not as simple as it looks,since there are four restrictive conditions in it.Firstly,player must hold back one box at least before Boss1.Secondly,player must destroy the box at the right time and place,probability will decline with fewer boxes.Thirdly,memory address 0x0355 must be 1.0x0355 is one memory address which show golden status about 2P(or computer support)in the air.There are two ways to make 0x0355 be 1,let 2P get 5 equipment and level up golden status,or,call computer support and take away computer support in the air.Finally,memory address 0x07B6 must be 0.Memory address 0x07B6 is a important address which can alter memory address 0x0075(Stage Sign).Unfortunately,Memory address 0x07B6 will be 1 if 2P attack Boss.That means 2P will be abandoned,although 2P's initial position is 16 pix(13 frames)faster than 1P.Player will lost all the equipment after warp.It's lucky that collect slot is retained.So I level up golden status at the beginning of Stage 3.

	"This tas is 8872 frames(147.6 seconds)faster than the previous published 
	(__wikiLink|href=/1561M|implicitdisplaytext=1561M)
	",and 1906 frames(31.7 seconds)faster than 
	(__wikiLink|href=/6514S|implicitdisplaytext=6514S)
	".Some improvments come from optimized strategy and details,you can see them obviously.Other improvements come from lag decline.There are too many element can produce lag in this game,enen only one moving object.I saved much time with the help of heavy lag manipulation.Then I will chat lag in the Stage 4.Lag in the Stage 4 is obviously more than in other Stage,even there is nothing in Stage 4.I found who is culprit after exploration.Yes,culprit is cloud.Cloud in Stage 4 is not only one picture in the background,it is active block which possess position and speed.Speed of cloud is from 5 to 7.5.So keeping its speed in 5 with heavy luck manipulation is necessary.At last,I am sorry I made a lot of noise in last Stage since a malignant Bug.Memory Address look this.
