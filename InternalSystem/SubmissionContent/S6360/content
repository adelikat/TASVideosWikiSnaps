	"Minit is an adventure game released in 2018, where the player obtains a cursed sword, resulting in each live only lasting for one minute. This TAS follows closely the unassisted speedrun route, but with some heavy luck manipulation and tight movements.

	"This TAS was done on the "v1.1" or "speedrun release" version of the game, as called by the community, because there is no mention of a version number in the game. It corresponds to manifest 6678403216955145752 in the 
	[a class=extlink href=https://steamdb.info/depot/609493/manifests rel=nofollow

	". This version features a speedrun mode, which shows the in-game timer on screen, starts at the sword grab and ends at the boss. This mode has no consequence on the final in-game time, but saves more than ten seconds of real-time. This is the chosen mode for this TAS, so it spends a bit of time in the menu to activate it.

	"The later two items make the any% speedrun in "v1.1" about 1-2 seconds slower, but I considered that it was not worth using an old version for such a small time save. Also, the other speedrun categories use "v1.1" because of the introduced camera item which saves several seconds, so it would be more consistent with potential submissions of other speedrun categories here.

	"When hitting the suicide button, the in-game timer pauses, but the environment still continues for several seconds. To save some in-game time, we can suicide while waiting for an event to happen. This is used when giving water to the lost person, and when destroying the last crate.
