	": This TAS is the result of a huge amount of researches done by the author, as well as a fierce competition between multiple players. It pushes the game close to its limits and beats all known records, thanks to optimized usage of the "Remove glitch" and RNG manipulation.
	$LF

[p 
	"The audience reception was widely positive, thanks to the movie's unprecedented fast pace and mind-blowing glitching. I agree that this is indeed an entertaining example of superhuman gameplay.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In 
	[a class=intlink href=/6052S 
		"a previous judgement
	]a
	" I noted how there is no gameplay difference between choosing MED and HI speed for TASing, and thus both options are acceptable. However, some people prefer HI speed, due to the fact that it results in displaying the best ending cutscene, which gives a better sense of completion to the watcher and thus making it a better choice for entertaining purposes. On the other hand, from the technical point of view choosing HI speed results in a minimal time loss and it's trivial to implement and remove, so it doesn't count as an actual gameplay loss; if a future submission aims to obsolete this movie, it should not consist in just a removal of the speed selection, but it should feature 
	[a class=intlink href=/MovieRules.html#ModicumOfEffortIsRequired 
		"actual gameplay improvements
	]a
	". For the same reason, future submissions that use a more accurate core (NESHawk) would not be compared in relation of the time lost due to different loading times.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The 
	[a class=intlink href=/MovieRules.html#FullCompletionRules 
		"criteria
	]a
	" for recognizing the full-completion conditions varies from game to game, but we can summarize that there needs to be "optional accomplishments that can be objectively measured and maximized". In the game used for this submission, the player is able to choose the starting level to play, and every time a level is beaten, the game proceeds with presenting the subsequent level for playing. So the game does objectively recognize the beating of each level as a form of progression, regardless of which is the initial level choosen by the player. The game does also remember which was the last level beaten even after soft resets, so the completion point of each level is verifiable even when the player makes use of soft resets after beating a level, like in this submitted movie; in fact it's possible to notice in this movie that after beating each level and doing soft reset, the main menu of the game has the level cursor already pointing to the subsequent level, which wouldn't happen if the player used soft reset before beating a level and closing the relative "stage clear" message.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"For the purpose of full-completion, this movie starts from level 1 and beats all levels up to 20, which causes the game to display the best ending cutscene. It must be noted that after this cutscene, if not soft resetting the console, the game proceeds with presenting level 21, and so on until level 24, which will then repeat endlessly; however, it must be noted that any level beyond 20 is actually featuring the very same settings, which doesn't introduce any kind of new gameplay content and thus would be completely redundant to include in a movie.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This movie features usage of soft resets for RNG manipulation purposes, which causes this game's RNG to start over. This means that the inputs for each level can be cut off and played as a separate movie, without incurring in any sync issue. The player already provided a 
	[a class=intlink href=/Userfiles/Info/50338848258928313 
		"movie file
	]a
	" that beats level 20 HI speed with the same inputs used in the submitted movie during level 20, and I was also able to do the same with other levels. This means that the submitted movie does include the inputs of a fastest-completion run in it; in other words, by fulfilling the full-completion goal, it does also fulfil the fastest-completion goal. At this point there is no reason to have an active branch for fastest-completion anymore, as an updated movie would result completely redundant. This superseeding mechanic was already explained by feos in 
	[a class=intlink href=/6111S 
		"this judgement note
	]a
