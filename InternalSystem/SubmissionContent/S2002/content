	"The Terminator has grown to be one of my favorite Sega Genesis Games over the course of TASing it. This is my best TAS yet with faster and more optimized Gunshots in the 2nd(L.A. 1984) and 3rd(Police Station) levels and more interesting ways to manipulate enemies and such with tweaking.

	"This is used in many games. Here it can be used to manipulate enemies and where in the level they will spawn.

	"In the last level it is used twice; Once to jump over the Terminator easier and the other is near the end to spawn it closer on the next ledge.
