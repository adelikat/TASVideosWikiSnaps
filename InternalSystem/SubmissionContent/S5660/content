	"This run heavily abuses glitches old and new to complete an All Dungeons run of Ocarina of Time, without using doors. The lone restriction of this movie can be best defined as ‘no opening doors’, where ‘opening’ refers to multiple different in-game events. The first and most obvious of these is opening a door by standing in front of it and pressing A. Opening the Door of Time, which normally requires 3 child dungeon stones and an ocarina song to open, is also disallowed. There are some actions (Zelda opening gates during tower collapse, Dampe using doors during his race, the rolling Goron unlocking Darunia's room) that are arguably 'using doors', but Link does not control these and these 'doors' are not labeled as doors in the game files. This initially seems to greatly limit the possible progress of any playthrough with this goal in mind, but due to some decisions made by the game developers, it is often possible to accomplish the same practical effect that you would get by opening a door by instead making Link touch the loading zone just behind it. As this often involves hovering or clipping out of bounds, not every door/loading zone combination can be skipped in this way, but most can. Because of the tiny crack in between Door of Time and the wall of the temple, we can force Link into the corner with enough speed and at the right angle to clip out of bounds and skip it, and can also utilize a void warp from the tower collapse scene to skip the door (twice) as adult.

After making our way to Kakariko and collecting a bottle, we use a cucco dive to reach Bottom of the Well early, and abuse a glitch exclusive to the 1.0 version to clip out of bounds and collect bombchus. We savewarp out, and head to Zelda's castle courtyard for a fairy and the Weird Egg, which we hatch and use to wake Talon when it turns day.

	". Using Cojiro on C-Right with this glitch gives us a bomb bag and a quiver, and Poe in Bottle on C-Right gives us 29 bombchus. Getting bottle on B used to be a more significant challenge, but now can be performed anywhere with a wall and a correctly spaced damage source/explosion (although in this instance, we use Quick Draw bottle duplication with the water). This essentially gives us the ability to refresh our Bombchu count to 29 whenever we want.

HESSing back to Kakiriko, we abuse the faulty collision by the Potion Shop stairs to clip out of bounds and then quickly damage boost with a chu to hit the loading zone, and continue the trade quest with the Odd Potion. Once we savewarp out and warp to Forest, we trade for the Poacher's Saw, which is quickly RBA'd for a few warp songs along with Poe in Bottle to replenish out Bombchu count.

We mount her again and ride all the way to Gerudo Fortress, stopping only briefly to collect the Broken Goron Sword in Gerudo Valley. While avoiding the Gerudo guards, we use the Ocarina to dismount Epona with blank B, hookshot the box to store a hookshot jump, and then back Epona up closer to the wall and dismount to use the jump and enter Gerudo Fortress. After exiting the same way we entered to store the correct exit value, we repeat the same hookshot jump setup, except this time using the flagpole to get more height. When we're about to void out, we return FW and are warped to an Out of Bounds area in Jabu Jabu, from which we fall into the water switch room and RBA Broken Goron Sword, set FW, then warp to Temple of Time into the Light Arrow cutscene.

Because we are still dead, we take the death as soon as the Barinade cutscene ends and are revived with our fairy. The Barinade fight itself is interesting, as the only way we have to damage it with Boomerang on B is with the pots by the walls of the room. After two hits like this, we can throw the boomerang one last time and re-equip our sword for the next hit, and the final quick kill immediately after. We use the time it takes the game to fully load the blue warp to position ourselves on a very precise spot within it, entering the cutscene early and saving a few seconds.

Skipping past Mido, we move to SFM again and finally enter Forest Temple, only to set FW and warp away to Lake Hylia again. From here was travel all the way back to Gerudo Fortress, where Epona is waiting for us to perform a hookshot jump and void warp to Forest Temple. This spawns us slightly above the basement of the temple, where we drop down and maneuver around the slightly inaccurate collision to reach the boss loading zone. The Phantom Ganon fight is standard for the first phase, but gets quicker once he moves out of the painting thanks to a well placed bomb and hookshot manipulation to make him stay low enough to attack with out sword and finish him off.

After hovering around the wall and into the hallway, we do the regular hover to boss key skip and enter Morpha's room. The fight finishes quickly, as we only need to get Morpha out of the water once and then we can finish him off with some power crouch stabs, using the spikes on the walls to self damage for the upcoming cutscene skip.

Since we are out of bounds now, we get ISG and begin the hover. From the initial clip position, we hover first above and then across the truth spinner room, and then sidehop down, barely clearing the door barring us from entering the maze hallway leading to the Hover Boots. Once in the hallway, we HESS to the corner just before the Hover Boots room and perform a bomb hover, clipping out of bounds through some strange wall/ceiling collision and sidehop-jumpslashing to just barely make it onto a tiny out of bounds patch of land in the corner. From this position, we hover underneath the ground before the Hover Boots room door, and then sidehop all the way down to the boss door room, megaflipping across the gaps and then using a clip/damage boost combination to hit the boss loading zone. Because Bongo-Bongo's damage hit box is loaded as soon as we enter, we can drop a bomb to stun him from above and then quickly finish him off before even watching any cutscenes.

Thanks to N3rdsWithGame for providing me with several scripts that made the process much easier, for such things as optimal text advancing and sidehops (seriously, this probably saved days worth of work alone).

[div class=p 
	"From a cursory look at the run, the main concept is simple enough to grasp; no action where Link opens a door (directly) is acceptable. What is and isn't a door is visually unambiguous in practically all cases, and what counts as directly or indirectly opening a door is also evident enough (for example, Dampé or Zelda opening doors does not count, it has to be Link in charge of the action).

	"Obviously, this is an arbitrary category. Most TASes don't adhere to restrictions of the player's actions, or care about performing actions that have no long-term consequences, do not result in any long-term state or flag changes, and so on. The game does not care too much if you enter a new area through a door or otherwise.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"However, this TAS is not unique in that regard. I see this run as comparable to TASes like 
	[a class=intlink href=/2676M 
		"the Super Mario Bros. walkathon
	]a
	", which also is a category which restricts a player's action which has no long-term state or flag changes associated with it. (And, incidentally, the published run also goes through the extra hoops of going through each world, like how this movie does all dungeons). Another popular TAS with an unusual goal that come to mind is 
	[a class=intlink href=/2078M 
		"Super Metroid's Reverse Boss Order TAS
	]a
	". It's a cool run, sure, and there is

	"Ocarina of Time presently only has two published categories on the site, any% and MST. The primary question here is if this movie differentiates itself sufficiently from the published ones. Any% is no argument, as this movie obviously has far more of the game to show. And between this movie and MST, while the runs look similar at the start, once the movies start branching out they become very significantly different. This movie's route is definitely unique, and it has to go through a lot of hoops to be able to finish some of the dungeons with its no-doors restriction.

	"This is definitely a big part of the appeal of this movie - the fact that a lot of creative routing and interesting tricks are required to pass it, and it is this routing and usage of tricks and glitches that makes the movie very entertaining to watch to many. In the end, this movie has a lot more to offer in these aspects than MST does, and that gives it a distinct edge. With that, I find that this movie may reasonably be published alongside the existing any% and MST categories.

The movie ends input at Link's final slash on Ganon, rather than on the final dialogue like other TASes of the game - because of this, it does not reach the credits by itself.
