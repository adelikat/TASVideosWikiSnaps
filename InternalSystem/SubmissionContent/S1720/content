[p 
	"Major improvements come from 1-1 where I beat the 255 frame rule and 6-3 where I use a shyguy to go over the wall rather than under it.  There are numerous other smaller improvements in each level such as subpixel optimization, improved boss fights, speed boosts from enemies moving to the right, and jumping at the top of vines/ladders to avoid the automated climbing animation.  In addition I tried to perform more stunts and antics throughout the run.

	"Birdo's egg spitting is on a 255 frame timer.  The game calls upon this timer when birdo comes onto the screen.  This gives a 255 "frame rule" for all levels encounters where you need to fight him with eggs.  I tested lg's 1-1 level and found that only about 8 more frames needed to be saved in order to approach birdo on a quicker egg spitting event.  I managed to scrape some frames by getting speed boosts from right moving shyguy's and from subpixel optimization upon entering doors.  I also scraped a few frames from the warp glitch.  I got to birdo on the exact frame needed, so a 8 frame improvement turned into a 255 frame improvement!  I also saved 2 frames landing the final blow to birdo.

	"40ish of these frames came from not picking up the shyguy near the end of the level.  This was an error brought up in laughing gas's submission.  Other frames came from a much improved boss fight and the usual subpixel optimization.
	$LF

[p 
	"Subpixel position can be manipulated when going through doors.  By pressing up+right or simply right, or b+up+right, etc.  One can get different subpixel values and still cause the door transition on the same frame.  The subpixel (x & y) values carry over to the next screen as well next levels.  Get the maximum (or minimum value if moving left) can lead to full pixel improvements in subsequent screens.  These add up to occasional frame improvements over the course of the movie.

	"The veggie machine is on a 255 frame timer just like birdo's eggs.  This timer begins at the beginning of the level.  The frame rule works out so that no improvements were possible and that even large frame losses would result in no actual loss.  (The princess in mine and lg's movie get there about midway in the frame rule).  The 7 frames came from timing the run to the exit door better so that the speed address was still at maximum when control of the character is lost for the door animation.
