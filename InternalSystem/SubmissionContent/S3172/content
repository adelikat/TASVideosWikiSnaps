		"Normal way: First, you have to go to ICE DRIFTS to acquire Charge Beam, use it to kill Spore Spawn, then the door to 1st Super Missile will be active! Get it, then go to VOLCANO for Phantoom! Before kill Phantoom, go to PHAZON MINE to acquire Red Phazon (you can't acquire it after Phantoom's death!) Now you can reach to Morphing Ball, then go back to POWERPLANT for the 1st Phazon Missile! After that, you can open WARP-area! You have to acquire Hi-Jump Boots in this area, then warp to PHAZON MINE, kill Golden Torizo for Speed Booster! After that, warp to POWERPLANT, kill Botwoom for Grapphling Beam (you can only acquire Blue Phazon with this Beam, and you have to acquire Blue Phazon to be able to escape SEWERS). After wearing Blue Phazon, go to SEWERS to collect Power Bomb! And on the way to Power Bomb, you have to acquire Dark Beam (to kill Metroid) and Bomb! Now you have fulfilled the conditions, just Draygon and Ridley left!

		"TAS-way: like Normal way, but after killing Phantoom, I found a pack of Phazon Missile right under lava, so I have to manage enough Energy to survive! (I found a very nice thing when I collecting the 1st Phazon Missile! In that room I have to kill 4 enemies to open the door. Those enemies HP = 360 which mean I have to kill each of them with 4 Super Missiles. But when I shot them when they're landing on flame, the Super Missile I shot didn't disappear when it hit them, it pierced them and did 100 of damage per frame!) Using this way, 1min and 12 second ingame-timer is saved! Then I go to WARP-area, but I go for Speed Booster first, then acquire Hi-Jump (save some times) The next is just like normal way, but after acquire Blue Phazon, I found a shorter way to collect Power Bomb, by using X-ray Scope, and this way is 57 seconds faster than normal way!

	[li 
		"Ridley: HP = 22096, >"< this is a pain! The author has changed its vulnerability, so this last boss is very hard to kill! All the beam without charged do half of damage. Charge Beam, Super Missile and Phazon Missile do normal damage! Besides, its room has a very high floor, so it's waste time everytime Ridley dive under ground! And after its HP = 0, I cannot let him grabs Samus to end the fight sooner, because she'll get stuck under the ground!
