	": This submission has a few issues. This game is an almost identical port of the SNES Clue game, with identical gameplay and graphics, to the point it classifies as the same game, and there's no point in publishing multiple versions of the same game. This movie does not add anything to the existing Clue publication. Alongside that, Clue is a board game and is ineligible for the Vault, and this movie also got insufficient positive feedback to go to Moons. As such, rejecting.
