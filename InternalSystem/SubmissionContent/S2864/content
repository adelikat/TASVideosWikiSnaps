	"Phred's Cool Punch-Out 2 is a hack of Punch-out!! made by "Master Phred".  It is noteworthy because it is the first Punch-out hack that changed more than just graphics.  Opponents behavior are changed as well leading to all new challenges.  The overall quality of this hack is quite good.  The graphics & character names are sophisticated and the opponents behavior are changed to make fun interesting gameplay as opposed to the often over done "zOMG impossible to beat" style play that many hacks are guilty of.  Some opponents are easier, some are harder.  The last few opponents are very difficult but still fun and enjoyable.
