	"This movie is 7824 frames faster than the 
	(__wikiLink|1114M|previous run)
	" by me and Rising Tempest. This movie uses damage to save time in better ways. It adds death to save time to bring it in line with the forced game overs we've been using since the very beginning. It is smarter about what levels it takes. It uses up&a to bring up the save/continue screen at smarter times. The play is also tightened, but improvements from better play are very minor across the whole run, this is largely simply strategy improvements.

If you just use the D pad for this, it will take extra time no matter when you start your turn.
