This is unfortunate, as his flight path is blocked by barriers of kryptonite, impassable except for narrow gaps. The gaps are movable—luckily, for SuperSprite does not wear helmet—but moving them requires deft hand at the controls. And that's where you come in.

The SuperSprite looked like a flying machine. Only if I had read the article. Now...almost 40 years later, I know exactly what its about. This game was extremely difficult and worthy of a TAS.
