	"This TAS takes advantage of boss quick kills by either manipulating which direction the sword will fly when connecting for damage, or by outright catching the sword. A 1 hit quick kill was recently discovered for Horned Witch, which is a frame perfect trick. I found a way to skip ahead on 2 forms of the Stone Wizard on the final level, while also maintaining control of the sword. Some stage secret rooms were used to advance the level quickly.
