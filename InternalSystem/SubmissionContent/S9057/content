	"This game had a bit of turning point for me. At first, I thought the game was running on a timer. Because of that, I was going for maximum score. Well, after starting over from the beginning and improving this TAS...I saw that maximum score was a very shaky category...as I was about 6000 frames faster over my first effort. I continued on and improved this movie by ending input earlier than I have in most of my games. In fact, it was around 800 frames cut from doing so, although it depended on the outcome of luck.
