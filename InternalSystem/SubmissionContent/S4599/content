	"Spelunker II: Yūsha e no Chōsen, translation in English would be something called "Spelunker II: Challenge to the Brave", there are 3 characters to choose from, Explorer, Priest, and Esper. I used Esper, that character is fastest because of ability to use ESP which I can set teleport point, then use ESP to teleport back to where I set it to.

	"I'm going to explain a few game mechanics, normally when character gets hit, character gets knock back far, but it can be worked around is upon exact frame before getting hit, turn around, or press up or down to get knock back other way around or be hit still. When character jump, character always jump exact height, no way to control jumping height. When character touch ceiling, character falls straight down, no way to control falling left or right. Same for rope, moving off rope makes character fall straight down. Also when messages comes up (getting healing deer, getting bomb, getting thunder power up, and talking to final boss) holding direction up button speeds up message. The "TOKU" below Life bar is "VIT" or "HOLY" or whatever translation is, if character loses too much of it, character won't get LIFE healed up after stage and won't be able to use Rosary to kill undeads.

	"I had choice to start game with 1 bomb or 1 ration, I had to go with ration because I can give it to injured deer in exchange for gold key. Bomb is useless in this stage. Using thunder weapon is stronger than sword (about twice damage) just in case if you're wonder. If you're seeing bags and crate lying around, bags usually contains ration which heals character a few (I think 3 to 4 bars, useless in TAS) and crate usually contains bomb. One of crate contains Rosary which can be used to kill undeads and bats, useless in first stage because I can just take hits and walk thru them. On the final part of stage 1 where I swim in water with flames in it, for odd reason, ceiling flame hurts at bottom part, but not top part, I swim thru top part to avoid damage. At end of stage, fairy message screen, there's no way to skip it, none of button skips it.

	"First time you would noticed me jumping up the rope rather than normally climbing up, it is a few frames faster this way. You would also noticed me using ESP to get pass silver key door, this trick seem to only work for this room because of standing on right side and the area has horizontal scrolling. After 2nd stage boss, you would noticed me pausing game - pausing game adds missed Rosary to inventory, which I can obtain upgraded thunder weapon, and helps me avoid few more damages from zombies and ghost. Also pausing at that point allows me manage RNG of enemies position and behavior (timing they move and jump). Jumping over cross is to avoid losing TOKU. If you had noticed me skipping that last gold key, all the keys get wiped away on next stage so I skip it.

	"On the 3rd silver key door, I cannot use ESP teleport trick, probably because area don't horizontal scroll. The apple I collected from Stage 2 is used to keep final boss stunned and keep still, which makes it easy to kill quicker.

	": The run looks decent overall, but the game is just a bit too slow and because of that, the run feels like it drags on at times. Viewer response also appeared tepid. Accepting for the Vault.
