	"Quackshot is debateably the best Disney game ever made and somewhat overlooked as well. The movie improves nifboy's version by about a minute and its also a good example of how far TASing has come since then, mainly through the advancement of better tools and experience.

	" Megaman, the main character Donald duck slides on his belly and has to obtain items in order to advance further in previous levels and to sometimes return in future to make a further advancement in the current level. The game is relativley sequence break proof, mostly because the items required are either needed to be used time and time again or that its simply impossible to avoid using the item at all. In the Egyptian pyramid (not the first one entered) its possible to skip the sceptor, but unlike Flashback the game does not make any kinds of assumptions that you already have aquired an item before reaching a certain point.

	"Some improvements in the slope glitch. Basically, Donald maintains the same speed when he runs up a slope from a sliding position although it doesn't last forever since the glitch acts as if the sliding it about to come to a halt. The glitch will be more noticable on steep slopes since the glitch tries to maintain the same horizontal speed. The second part of mexico may seem entirely automated but the platforms only load when you reach a certain postion so its important to be as quick as possible and only wait until the gaps become narrow enough to make the oposite platforms.

	"There is a weird pause glitch I discovered late on in the run so I had to test various places after to see if it saved time. This is the first place that saved time, it might not look it but it saves 3 frames. length of the black screen depends on the length of the text and it generally only saves time when you need to switch weapons or use an object anyway. I use bubbles on dracula since I had great problems with the final hit. plus the game lags a bit when you kill Dracula with a plunger plus Donald needs to stand directly under Dracula to hit him since he can't hit him off screan

	"Potential sequence break here but the bubbles were falling just pixels short of breaking the ice cubes at the start, so I couldn't obtain the book earlier, which would have been a good thing since the game unavoidably lags like crazy. My guess is that the programmers used near perfect checks and also had too many things loaded on screen at once.
