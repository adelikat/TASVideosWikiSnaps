		"Planet DOB
	]em
	" (プラネット•ドブ) is an adventure collect-a-thon game developed by Microvision and published by Hudson Soft for the Sony PlayStation released exclusively in Japan in 1999. It is a tie-in to the studio album of the same name by the Japanese band called 
	[em 
		"Date of Birth
	]em
	". In the story, the cosmic sheriff named Dob (the band's mascot) is flying through space on his ship when he gets distracted by a sign and heads that way only to be captured by a net and crashes down to planet Earth. He's rushed into a laboratory where the evil scientist Dr. X tasks one of his assistants to go inside Dob's brain and explore his mind. After going inside Dob's brain, "YOU" (the player) falls down onto Planet DOB and into a colorful town called Dob Town where the CPU crashes and 144 BITs have scattered around the town, and it's up to you to find them all and restore the links to each piece of the town.

	[a href=https://www.speedrun.com/planet_dob/runs/z5ee4xdz rel=noopener external nofollow 
		"WR
	]a
	". At one point, you had jumped ahead that I lost track of my comparisons. It turned out that you completed one level so fast that you were running side-by-side with the previous WR area. Now that I see the ending is different, over the any% speedrun...this TAS looks great and it is apparent that a lot of work went into making it. Great job on this!
