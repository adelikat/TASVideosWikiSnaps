[div class=p 
	"-Jumping: In this game, jumping works in such a way that if you were to say, jump diagonally up/right, it would take as much time and cover the same distance in one direction, as if you were to just jump directly right. Meaning, you can clear a screen diagonally in the same amount of time you can clear it in one direction (left, right, up, or down). This is used constantly in the run as it saves tons of time.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-Jumping while carrying items: If we hold combinations of up/down/left/right and use the feather while holding an item (such as pots and rocks), we can actually jump while holding the item, and upon landing, he will hold it in his hands normally again. This speeds up a few areas quite a lot, most notably, Eagle's Tower.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-Cornerboosting: If we push Link into a corner for a few frames, he will get a small boost. This is used all over the place, but it becomes very hard to notice after I get the feather (although it still works while jumping). Because it's used so frequently, I will not point out every single place that I did it at. Just know that it was done at every feasible place.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-Save & Quit: The S&Q screen (activated by pressing A, B, Start, and Select at the same time) is used to skip many pieces of text in the game. It doesn't work on all of them, but it always works after opening a chest (but oddly, not with items you pick up from the ground, such as the golden leaves). It is also frequently used to take us back to a previous area to avoid backtracking.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-Up/down/left/right sword attacks: If we hold combinations of up/down/left/right and slash the sword, we can sometimes hit enemies from a distance. This isn't nearly as useful as you might think, and is generally only handy during spinattacks, and even then, it's pretty useless. It does look cool, though, to see Link all pixelated and messed up for a few seconds during the spinattack.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-Shieldboosting: If we hold combinations of up/down/left/right and use the shield, we can shield enemies that are at other parts of the screen. This has limited use as the shield isn't used much past the start of the game, but it does speed up the start of the game a bit. It can also be used to pick up items from a distance, but this only has one use (picking up the sword without going down to it at the beach).
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-Damage boosting: When taking damage, Link will get pushed forward a few spaces at a high speed. This usually saves 4-5 frames when done effectively.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-Superdash/superjump: If we hold combinations of up/down/left/right immediately before dashing with the Pegasus Boots, we can cause Link to shoot off in various directions. These directions include up and slightly to the right, up and slightly to the left, up and left, and down and right. No other dashing direction is possible. If we jump during one of these highspeed dashes (superjump), we can go either straight down, up and slightly to the left, or straight left. It's also possible to go straight right but it isn't any faster than a normal dash jump. This is used constantly after getting the boots, as it saves so much time all over the place.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-Superdashing through objects: I found this awesome glitch when TASing the fourth dungeon. If there's an object above us, and to out left, but nothing diagonally up and to our left, if we charge up a left/down/right superdash, we can glitch through the vertex and skip lots of stuff. This can also be used to get through small fences and the like, which are along the very top of a screen. It can therefore also be used to bypass loading points on doors that are against the top of the screen, such as the one shortly before the Eagle's Tower entrance.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-Awesomebombs: If we hold combinations of up/down/left/right while using bombs, we can plant them at different parts of the screen without actually going to those parts manually. We can also use it to have multiple bombs out at once. While it's possible to get more than two bombs out at once, two is the optimal number to have, as after that, it takes too long to pull out more bombs for it to be worth it. This is used to kill dodongos and the Face Shrine boss very quickly.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-Aquaslide: If we hold combinations of up/down/left/right before moving into a body of water, Link will move through the water at high speeds. This has very limited use in the run, but some areas where it's very noticable include the water after exiting Catfish's Maw, and the water in Angler's Tunnel in the room two rooms before the boss key door.
