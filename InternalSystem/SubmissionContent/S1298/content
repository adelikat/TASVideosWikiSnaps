	"One bad thing about doing a three player run is the switching. In order to do so, you need to press A+B+C and that can cause some undesired actions, so I had to choose carefully when to switch characters (ex. cannot switch characters while ballooned up or will deflate). This would be eliminated if each character had 6 buttons to use.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Since all three characters can move at once, Erik usually has to wait or screw around for the other two to catch up. Sometimes Erik intentionally gets hurt or bangs his head on an enemy so Baelog or Olaf won't be interrupted by it.

	$LF

[ul 
	[li 
		" Falling key glitch - This glitch is pretty simple. Using a key on a keyhole while falling will prevent one of the characters from taking damage. I use this frequently.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Falling multicolor key glitch - This one is almost identical to the one above, only this uses a key on a different colored keyhole while falling to avoid damage. This also doesn't use up the keyhole. I was able to use this only once in WKYY. 
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Slide in to wall - This glitch involves an elevator. When on one, standing on the very edge and sliding into a wall, then moving over and back again quickly will get a character lodged into the wall. I only was able to use this once in BTRY. This glitch is similar to the Rockman 2 wall-omission glitch (only I can't zoom through walls, which would be awesome). 
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Slide through door/wall - In TRPD, there's a spot where pinchers are use to hold a block. When in the path of the pinchers, turning the direction opposite to the wall will get the character stuck in the wall, which happens to be on top of a door. Then, switching will cause the character stuck in the wall to fall to the ground and jumping will then cause him to get zoomed down reaching a button to skip a major part of the level. 
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Fall through horizontal door - This is only usable in one place - TRDR. This is, when falling, using a key on the door in the floor and falling through it. Giving it to another character enables that character to do the same. 
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Avoid damage by switching characters - This is when you're moving (falling or jumping), switch and switch back quickly and end up taking no damage. This used on enemy projectiles and vertical lasers. 
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" This is more of a trick than a glitch, but you can sometimes walk over holes if able to find the right frame.
