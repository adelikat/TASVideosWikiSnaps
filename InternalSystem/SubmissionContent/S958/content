		" - there might be a problem with this. end the movie once drac ultimate is dead (with a second or so after to ensure the final hit is delivered and that the movie doesnt end before i make the final blow). there IS some user input required AFTER the credits. however, after the credits role, the game is over.

	"as far as movie making, it went fine. im more familiar with this game than others... it was fun to find new things via frame advance and slowdowns though.

	"this is an excellent game, far surpassing the incomplete release in most every aspect. the music would be even better if it werent for the N64's sound chip which blasts the sound, but its still good all the same.

	"the gameplay in this is slightly different than its predecessor... notable is the jumping and the camera angles... its actually made in this game to HELP the player as opposed to making it just frustrating.

	"and why would anyone wanna watch it? the same reason you watch any other movie on this site... because you wanted to. there's no outstanding glitches, and this version is the longest (cornell has the most quests). im not saying its not entertaining, because i did make it so it would be. but some people might not like it. it is different than the first game in enough ways i believe.
