		" - there might be a problem with this. end the movie once drac ultimate is dead (with a second or so after to ensure the final hit is delivered and that the movie doesnt end before i make the final blow). there IS some user input required AFTER the credits. however, after the credits role, the game is over.

	"and why would anyone wanna watch it? the same reason you watch any other movie on this site... because you wanted to. there's no outstanding glitches, and this version is the longest (cornell has the most quests). im not saying its not entertaining, because i did make it so it would be. but some people might not like it. it is different than the first game in enough ways i believe.
