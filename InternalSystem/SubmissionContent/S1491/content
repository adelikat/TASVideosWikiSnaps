	"I was planning on doing this eventually. However, when I saw 
	[a class=intlink href=/1159S 
		"tim333's cancelled submission
	]a
	" I was inspired to actually work on it. Many ideas in this run came from tim's run and the resulting discussion (damage boosting, using the dog as a platform, e. g.). My run is much faster, though becuase of more precise movement, better routes, and ridiculously short boss fights.

	"Some tricks I use in this run:
	$LF

[p 
	"Damage boosting: each time you take damage and thrown to the right, it saves 16 frames. Because of this, I try to take damage as many times as possible in each level, since at the start of each level your hp is replenished. I tried my best to spread the damage across the entire level for aesthetic reasons.

	"Using the dog as a platform: To call the dog, you push down + A. Usually then he will jump on the screen before landing and attacking enemies. The thing is you can land on the dog in midair if you jump just right. He can be used to reach much higher places that way. To make the dog leave, press down + A again. You can call the dog off when you're standing on top of him. He takes a little while to leave, and while his cloud is on the screen you can still ride on top of him. Also, when he leaves, he stays in the same place on the screen regardless of whether the screen is moving or not, so you can use him to walk on air for a few frames, or as an elevator (which I do once).

[p 
	"Backwards attack: If you attack away from your enemy then press the arrow toward him, the character on the screen will do a double attack. The second hit does about four times as much damage as the normal attack, so in the time it takes to do three normal attacks, you can do about eight times as much damage.

	"I don't consider any of these glitches or programming errors, but if you feel differently, so be it.
	$LF

[p 
	"It's possible this run could be better, but without any extra help, I think this is the best I can get it (I'm still new to TASing after all). Have fun watching it!

	":  Response has been good.  In addition, this game has many nice TAS elements such as damage boosting & advantageous programming errors.  I am accepting this movie for publication.
