	"And a very special thank you to the FCEUX developers for the built-in TAS Editor. Being able to tweak individual frames of input and jump back and forth was incredibly helpful. I would never have made it the whole way through with just save states, rerecords and frame advance. As a sidenote, it seems that FCEUX 2.1.6 never got an official release and they instead moved to 2.2.0, so finding the exact version I was using may be a bit tricky. Hopefully that won't be a problem.

	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"In platformer sections, if you turn around the frame you would go through a horizontal door as Jason, Jason undergoes his usual "walking through a door" animation but in the wrong direction. This results in him teleporting almost a screen away from the door, and offsets his visual and map position by one tile. I only take advantage of this once because of the fairly heavy cost of leaving behind your tank. A run that skips bosses would make more significant use, such as in the European version run.

When you come back, you can just go pick up the upgrade in the boss room. This saves a lot of time using continues, since the two long death animations can be made to overlap.

]h4
[div class=p 
	"When you enter the boss's room in a dungeon, an alarm sound plays, then the screen fades out and the boss fades in. This is so that the tile graphics from the level can be replaced with the graphics for the boss. Normally, if you leave before it fades out then the entire process is cancelled, and after the fade-out occurs the exit disappears as well. However, there's a one-frame window during which you can leave without interrupting the process. This leads you to a very glitchy version of the previous room, now with a glitchy boss. If the previous room has harmful terrain, this can facilitate the Boss Death Glitch mentioned above.

	" Mega Man-Style Pause Glitch
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"It has long been known that the bosses in areas 2, 4, 6 and 7 have a glitch wherein if the game is paused while an exploding grenade is damaging the boss, the boss will continue to take damage while the game is paused, trivializing those bossfights. However, I discovered that, like in Mega Man, boss invulnerability timers still tick down while the game is paused. By pausing and unpausing the game with proper timing, you can get a boss with a longer invulnerability timer to be damaged up to 5 times with a single grenade, and with only 10 frames of in-game time passing. The Area 1 boss has too short an invulnerability timer for it to save any time, and the area 3 and 5 bosses are too hard to hit (moves too much, hitbox too small). Thus I use it only against the first boss in Area 8 since the second Area 8 boss is trivial anyway.

	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"In platformer sections, if you come very close to a wall as you jump or fall, the game considers you to have run into that wall even if you're actually travelling away from it. This resets your horizontal velocity to 0, which is often problematic, but can be useful when turning around in mid-air.

	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"Like in many games, taking damage normally slows you down. In particular, when your tank takes damage you are instantly accelerated by a significant amount in the direction opposite your horizontal travel. This would usually slow you down, but is helpful when turning around in mid-air. If you are traveling very slowly to the right when you fall onto or jump into an enemy, it will result in you moving to the left at a moderate speed. Though this can't get you above your normal max speed, it still greatly decreases the time it takes to turn.

	" Offset Vertical Shooting
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"When you hold up for several frames, the tank's turret rotates upward and you can fire vertically. For the first few frames of holding up, you will still fire forward, but depending on how long you hold up the vertical shooting persists. This system is useful in normal play because your tank's special weapons are fired by holding down and pressing B; by holding up for a while, then quickly pressing down+B, you can fire your special weapons upward. This only actually matters for the dumbfire missiles.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"However, under TAS conditions this has an additional application: The frame on which your tank's firing 
	[em 
		"direction
	]em
	" changes is sometimes different from the frame on which the firing 
	[em 
		"position
	]em
	" changes. In particular, it's possible for your tank to fire upward from further forward than a normal vertical shot. This allows you to shoot some overhead targets significantly earlier than you would otherwise be able to, allowing for lag reduction and faster "digging." Further analysis in the in-depth comments.

[div class=p 
	"Prior to getting the dive mechanics, your tank moves, jumps and falls much more slowly underwater than in the air. Your falling speed is checked strictly, but for horizontal movement you can keep your old speed by just releasing right or left at the right time. Prior to getting the dive mechanics this is just a parlor trick, but once you have them the old restrictions apply for the first frame after you enter the water. Thus, by releasing left or right for a frame, you can save the time it would take to get back up to speed.

]h4
[div class=p 
	"In the dungeons, water and lava won't kill you if you're invincible from having taken damage recently. Any time Jason spends over these terrains he behaves as though he is sliding on ice. On ice Jason's movement is a lot more "slippery," but his top speed is also 33% higher. So in addition to being able to take shortcuts by using invincibility to cross these terrains, it's actually faster to keep floating over deadly liquids for as long as possible. A bit more explanation in the in-depth comments.

	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"Though you can only face/shoot 4 different directions, there are about 36 different spots you can throw a grenade to from your current position. This is because the A button, which throws grenades, doubles as a strafe button, and the position of your grenades are influenced by both your facing and the directions you're pressing. So, for example, throwing a grenade while facing right and pressing up and left will cause it to land slightly to the right of you and a bit further above you. This is helpful all over in the dungeons, especially a few of the boss fights.

Also, in several rooms I'm doing things that normally wouldn't be exactly ideal, but generally this is because doing what would be the best at that time would screw things up later.

The fact that I have a bit of fuel left over, combined with an abundance of falling sections, means I get to use the hover mechanics to fall faster by avoiding touching the ground. Pretty cool if you ask me. At the end there's a long unobstructed fall, so Sophia takes this opportunity to get into the music a bit.

All in all, I save 2346 frames in Area 4 over the previous run. To put that in some perspective, that's almost twice the total frames I had saved in Areas 1 to 3 (1395). Thanks again, Twisted Eye.

There are generally three basic techniques: just plain holding the other direction, using corner braking, and using damage boosting. Theoretically the second and third can be combined but opportunities for that are rare if they're even present. Generally it's preferable to use a technique when possible, but I'm fairly certain this isn't always the case and I didn't test extensively. Also, there are definitely a lot of places earlier in the run where I should have used corner braking and didn't (at the time, I was assuming corner braking would slow me down overall), and probably a lot of places where I should have used damage boosting but didn't. Also, in several cases whether or not damage boosting is possible/efficient depends on the positioning of an enemy with at least partially random behavior, so RNG manipulation could matter as well.

They have various costs associated with them, and many have further ways in which they could be adjusted to save more time for a greater fuel cost or vice-versa. Combined with the delays necessary to acquire hover fuel at the various points in the game it's possible to do so, there is a lot of potential for more time savings. In particular, the first technique for ascending which I mention in the extended comments is never used and likely could be to save significant numbers of frames at a few points without much fuel cost. Also, I wasn't examining memory as heavily when I did the section where I hover up to Area 4, so that could probably be further optimized in either direction.

Of course, sometimes it's best to just not destroy an enemy. Figuring out what is best where isn't always obvious, and there are also issues of prioritizing which enemies should be destroyed first and so on.

When not pressing left or right, he decelerates at approx. 0.5 sp/ff, and when not pressing up or down he accelerates at 1 sp/ff toward a target velocity of 16 sp/f.

	"In a dungeon, Jason's maximum speed is 24 sp/f in any direction, and acceleration and deceleration are instantaneous. When on ice, his maximum speed increases to 32 sp/f, but his acceleration is only 1 sp/ff and he does not decelerate if he releases the D-pad.

	"Grenades spend 10 frames in transit before exploding (e.g. if you press A on frame 60764, it will start damaging enemies on 60775), at which point their explosion remains and does damage for 9 frames (e.g. 60775-60783). The Area 1 boss's invulnerability timer is only 3 frames, so it can be hit 3 times with one grenade. Most bosses have an 8 frame invulnerability timer, so they can generally be hit twice with one well-timed grenade. However, this isn't important against the Area 2, 4, 6, or 7 bosses, and generally doesn't work out against the Area 5 boss because of its tiny weak point. Both Area 8 bosses have a 16-frame invulnerability timer.

	"As a final note, I sometimes switch weapons "unnecessarily" while going through doors, sometimes even from one weapon to itself. This is because something (I assume the sound effect it makes) manipulates lag in the future, and the effects of which reach out through basically the entire rest of the video. It's usually just a couple of frames gained and lost here and there, but sometimes it seems to actually have a significant positive or negative effect at some point in the (fairly) near future. Manipulating this is theoretically possible, but seriously annoying.
