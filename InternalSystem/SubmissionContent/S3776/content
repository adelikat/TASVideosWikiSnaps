I was originally planning to do a run including the Area 4 skip, but when I was stuck at one point, I came back and tried his route and came to the conclusion that actually beating Area 4 would make a significantly more interesting run that is only slightly slower.

[p 
	"And a very special thank you to the FCEUX developers for the built-in TAS Editor. Being able to tweak individual frames of input and jump back and forth was incredibly helpful. I would never have made it the whole way through with just save states, rerecords and frame advance. As a sidenote, it seems that FCEUX 2.1.6 never got an official release and they instead moved to 2.2.0, so finding the exact version I was using may be a bit tricky. Hopefully that won't be a problem.

	$LF
	[a id=heading-2120 
	]a
]h4
[p 
	"In platformer sections, if you turn around the frame you would go through a horizontal door as Jason, Jason undergoes his usual "walking through a door" animation but in the wrong direction. This results in him teleporting almost a screen away from the door, and offsets his visual and map position by one tile. I only take advantage of this once because of the fairly heavy cost of leaving behind your tank. A run that skips bosses would make more significant use, such as in the European version run.

[p 
	"There is a narrow window during a boss's death sequence during which you can die and the game will save that the boss is dead. When you come back, you can just go pick up the upgrade in the boss room. This saves a lot of time using continues, since the two long death animations can be made to overlap.

	$LF

]h4
[p 
	"When you enter the boss's room in a dungeon, an alarm sound plays, then the screen fades out and the boss fades in. This is so that the tile graphics from the level can be replaced with the graphics for the boss. Normally, if you leave before it fades out then the entire process is cancelled, and after the fade-out occurs the exit disappears as well. However, there's a one-frame window during which you can leave without interrupting the process. This leads you to a very glitchy version of the previous room, now with a glitchy boss. If the previous room has harmful terrain, this can facilitate the Boss Death Glitch mentioned above.

	" Mega Man-Style Pause Glitch
	$LF
	[a id=heading-3630 
	]a
]h4
[p 
	"It has long been known that the bosses in areas 2, 4, 6 and 7 have a glitch wherein if the game is paused while an exploding grenade is damaging the boss, the boss will continue to take damage while the game is paused, trivializing those bossfights. However, I discovered that, like in Mega Man, boss invulnerability timers still tick down while the game is paused. By pausing and unpausing the game with proper timing, you can get a boss with a longer invulnerability timer to be damaged up to 5 times with a single grenade, and with only 10 frames of in-game time passing. The Area 1 boss has too short an invulnerability timer for it to save any time, and the area 3 and 5 bosses are too hard to hit (moves too much, hitbox too small). Thus I use it only against the first boss in Area 8 since the second Area 8 boss is trivial anyway.

	" Corner Braking
	$LF
	[a id=heading-4501 
	]a
]h4
[p 
	"In platformer sections, if you come very close to a wall as you jump or fall, the game considers you to have run into that wall even if you're actually travelling away from it. This resets your horizontal velocity to 0, which is often problematic, but can be useful when turning around in mid-air.

	" Damage "Boosting"
	$LF
	[a id=heading-4818 
	]a
]h4
[p 
	"Like in many games, taking damage normally slows you down. In particular, when your tank takes damage you are instantly accelerated by a significant amount in the direction opposite your horizontal travel. This would usually slow you down, but is helpful when turning around in mid-air. If you are traveling very slowly to the right when you fall onto or jump into an enemy, it will result in you moving to the left at a moderate speed. Though this can't get you above your normal max speed, it still greatly decreases the time it takes to turn.

]p
[h4 
	" Offset Vertical Shooting
	$LF
	[a id=heading-5386 
	]a
]h4
[p 
	"When you hold up for several frames, the tank's turret rotates upward and you can fire vertically. For the first few frames of holding up, you will still fire forward, but depending on how long you hold up the vertical shooting persists. This system is useful in normal play because your tank's special weapons are fired by holding down and pressing B; by holding up for a while, then quickly pressing down+B, you can fire your special weapons upward. This only actually matters for the dumbfire missiles.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"However, under TAS conditions this has an additional application: The frame on which your tank's firing 
	[em 
		"direction
	]em
	" changes is sometimes different from the frame on which the firing 
	[em 
		"position
	]em
	" changes. In particular, it's possible for your tank to fire upward from further forward than a normal vertical shot. This allows you to shoot some overhead targets significantly earlier than you would otherwise be able to, allowing for lag reduction and faster "digging." Further analysis in the in-depth comments.

	" Horizontal Hovering
	$LF
	[a id=heading-6436

[p 
	"When using the hover mechanics, you can save fuel while flying horizontally if you press A only every other frame, given certain starting conditions. This allows me to get a lot of "mileage" out of my hover fuel in stages 7 and 8. Further explanation in the in-depth comments.

	" Tank Diving
	$LF
	[a id=heading-6737

]h4
[p 
	"Prior to getting the dive mechanics, your tank moves, jumps and falls much more slowly underwater than in the air. Your falling speed is checked strictly, but for horizontal movement you can keep your old speed by just releasing right or left at the right time. Prior to getting the dive mechanics this is just a parlor trick, but once you have them the old restrictions apply for the first frame after you enter the water. Thus, by releasing left or right for a frame, you can save the time it would take to get back up to speed.

	" Icy Water/Lava
	$LF
	[a id=heading-7284 
	]a
]h4
[p 
	"In the dungeons, water and lava won't kill you if you're invincible from having taken damage recently. Any time Jason spends over these terrains he behaves as though he is sliding on ice. On ice Jason's movement is a lot more "slippery," but his top speed is also 33% higher. So in addition to being able to take shortcuts by using invincibility to cross these terrains, it's actually faster to keep floating over deadly liquids for as long as possible. A bit more explanation in the in-depth comments.

[h4 
	" Precision Grenades
	$LF
	[a id=heading-7806 
	]a
]h4
[p 
	"Though you can only face/shoot 4 different directions, there are about 36 different spots you can throw a grenade to from your current position. This is because the A button, which throws grenades, doubles as a strafe button, and the position of your grenades are influenced by both your facing and the directions you're pressing. So, for example, throwing a grenade while facing right and pressing up and left will cause it to land slightly to the right of you and a bit further above you. This is helpful all over in the dungeons, especially a few of the boss fights.

Since they're always fired in threes, are pretty slow, and make smoke and noise, the dumbfire missiles are usually quite laggy. On the plus side, they do huge damage. I tried to use them when it would save more time than it costs. Also, in several rooms I'm doing things that normally wouldn't be exactly ideal, but generally this is because doing what would be the best at that time would screw things up later. On a final note, the last room before the dungeon entrance is where I get my first good damage boost.

The fact that I have a bit of fuel left over, combined with an abundance of falling sections, means I get to use the hover mechanics to fall faster by avoiding touching the ground. Pretty cool if you ask me. At the end there's a long unobstructed fall, so Sophia takes this opportunity to get into the music a bit.

However, with just 1 point of hover fuel, I can float over such a gap... for reference, each bar on the left represents 32 points of fuel, so 1 point is an amount I'm happy to spend anywhere it saves time. And though homing missiles have odd pathing and are potentially very laggy, they still allow me to hit enemies I can't normally reach.

Of those three, the last was least expensive, but it still took 8 points of fuel which, when I first got there, I didn't have.

	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" It's unverified, but if you can get the Area 7 frog boss far enough into a corner and then grenade it from far enough away, you may just barely be able to kill yourself on a fireball late enough to Boss Death Glitch. I never managed it, but my testing wasn't completely exhaustive.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" When tapping the opposite direction to shoot an enemy behind you, it's usually better to do so in mid-air than on the ground, because grounded acceleration is better than aerial acceleration, slowing you down more. This is true even on ice, but that's because ice makes it practically impossible to do because of how often it just ignores your left/right input.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Movement could be more optimized when turning around in mid-air. There are generally three basic techniques: just plain holding the other direction, using corner braking, and using damage boosting. Theoretically the second and third can be combined but opportunities for that are rare if they're even present. Generally it's preferable to use a technique when possible, but I'm fairly certain this isn't always the case and I didn't test extensively. Also, there are definitely a lot of places earlier in the run where I should have used corner braking and didn't (at the time, I was assuming corner braking would slow me down overall), and probably a lot of places where I should have used damage boosting but didn't. Also, in several cases whether or not damage boosting is possible/efficient depends on the positioning of an enemy with at least partially random behavior, so RNG manipulation could matter as well.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Resource management of hover fuel could be improved. There are more places where hover fuel could be used to save time, only some of which I take advantage of. They have various costs associated with them, and many have further ways in which they could be adjusted to save more time for a greater fuel cost or vice-versa. Combined with the delays necessary to acquire hover fuel at the various points in the game it's possible to do so, there is a lot of potential for more time savings. In particular, the first technique for ascending which I mention in the extended comments is never used and likely could be to save significant numbers of frames at a few points without much fuel cost. Also, I wasn't examining memory as heavily when I did the section where I hover up to Area 4, so that could probably be further optimized in either direction.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Lag could be better managed by prioritizing the appropriate technique for shooting enemies. Sometimes it's best to kill them as early as possible, sometimes it's best to minimize the time your shots remain on screen, and sometimes it's best to minimize maximum processor load by decreasing the maximum number of bullets you have onscreen at a time. Of course, sometimes it's best to just not destroy an enemy. Figuring out what is best where isn't always obvious, and there are also issues of prioritizing which enemies should be destroyed first and so on. This could be managed a lot better than I did, and that's not even including the lag tradeoffs and resource management involved in special weapon use.
		$LF

	[li 
		" The random number generator could be better manipulated for a multitude of purposes. Ideally, enemies wouldn't ever drop powerups you don't need. Failing that, enemies would only drop powerups that you could pick up without losing time. Enemies that randomly appear wouldn't when it wasn't necessary, and those that appear at random positions or move in random directions would all do so in the most convenient ways. Oh, and enemies would randomly decide not to shoot when that's a possibility. Of course, accomplishing all this would be impossible, but it could certainly be optimized better than I managed to.

In the air, holding a direction accelerates you at 1 sp/ff, and your horizontal velocity does not change when you release both directions. You count as grounded on the frame you press A but not after it, despite your tank having a fairly lengthy jump startup.

	"When jumping, there's a 4-frame delay between pressing A and the jump starting, e.g. if you press A on frame 771, your velocity variable won't become nonzero until frame 776 rather than frame 772. During this time the jump can be interrupted by falling, walling, or damage. Once it kicks in, your vertical velocity is set to -66 sp/f. After this point, there is a further delay of 16 frames before the game will count you as having released A for the purposes of jump height. As long as you hold A (or this delay continues to apply) gravity applies as normal. Once the delay has ended and you have released A, if your vertical velocity is still negative it is reset to 0. The acceleration of gravity is 2 sp/ff, and terminal velocity is 64 sp/f. So, e.g. if you tap A for one frame on frame 771, your velocity will be -66 sp/f on frame 776, -36 sp/f on frame 791 assuming you haven't hit a ceiling in the interim, and 0 on frame 792.

	"If you activate the hover mechanics before the minimum jump height applies, you can be traveling upward more quickly than 16 sp/f. In this case, the "acceleration" will actually reset your velocity to -16 sp/frame when the maximum is checked. If you activate the hover mechanics after the minimum jump height has ended, your velocity will necessarily reset to 0 because you must release A before you can press it again to activate the hover mechanics, and in fact will reach 2 on the next frame because the mechanics take 1 frame to activate. By tapping A to jump, then pressing and holding A exactly 20 frames after that (e.g. 42027 and 42047), your velocity will actually be -34 for one frame before being reset to -16. This is because your hover mechanics have not yet activated, but you are holding A, so normal acceleration of gravity applies rather than either being reset to 0 or capped at -16.

	"After receiving the Dive Mechanics, your maximum horizontal speed is 32 sp/f, strangely faster than your land speed, and your acceleration is 2 sp/ff. Your max vertical velocity is 24 sp/f while pressing up or down and your acceleration is 2 sp/ff. When pressing neither up nor down, your minimum velocity is -24 but your maximum is only 4, and your rate of vertical acceleration is 1 sp/ff. When not pressing left or right, you decelerate at a rate of approx. 0.25 sp/ff.

	"I'm not 100% sure here, but it seems like, while on ice, the game only actually reads your horizontal input once every 16 frames and otherwise keeps your velocity constant. Strangely, the "once every 16 frames" counter seems at least partially independent of lag. Some things actually manage to change when your left/right input actually matters, but I'm not sure what, since at least once in my run there's an area where it's reading ice input only on frames that are congruent to 3 mod 16, and then there are 8 frames of lag, and then it continues reading only on frames that are congruent to 3 mod 16, rather than 11 mod 16.

The Area 1 boss's invulnerability timer is only 3 frames, so it can be hit 3 times with one grenade. Most bosses have an 8 frame invulnerability timer, so they can generally be hit twice with one well-timed grenade. However, this isn't important against the Area 2, 4, 6, or 7 bosses, and generally doesn't work out against the Area 5 boss because of its tiny weak point. Both Area 8 bosses have a 16-frame invulnerability timer.

	"As a final note, I sometimes switch weapons "unnecessarily" while going through doors, sometimes even from one weapon to itself. This is because something (I assume the sound effect it makes) manipulates lag in the future, and the effects of which reach out through basically the entire rest of the video. It's usually just a couple of frames gained and lost here and there, but sometimes it seems to actually have a significant positive or negative effect at some point in the (fairly) near future. Manipulating this is theoretically possible, but seriously annoying.
