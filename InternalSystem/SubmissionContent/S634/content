	"Every boss (except maybe the tree at the beginning, if compared to the rematch at Mt.Dedede) was beaten at the minimum number of rounds. I spent most of the time manipulating bosses, not to say that was the only vexation in the whole run. Dodging enemies when there are 6+ sprites on the screen was sluggish and took a lot of rerecords as well. I was pleased with the outcome, however, and I hope everyone could take 10 minutes out of their time to enjoy this video.
