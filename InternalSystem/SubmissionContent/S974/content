For the optimal situation I got when doing the 120-exit run, I needed to wait 48 frames before entering the level.  Fortunately, this was slower than what I ended up doing (by only 4 frames, but still, no long waiting to enter the level).  If about a second more of improvement is found in this run before here, then another 40 frames can be saved in this level.
