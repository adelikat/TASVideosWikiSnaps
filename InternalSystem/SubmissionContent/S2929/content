	": Unfortunately, the first movie submitted was severely sub-optimal, which caused many of the initial no votes/negative reaction. This makes it difficult to judge the new movie; I should have suggested a resubmission as opposed to an update. However, its been shown that taking damage is much faster, and I would encourage any author of this game to use that trade-off. Therefore, I am rejecting this movie as sub-optimal. However, I would like to let the author know that I thought this was a very good first attempt at a TAS.
