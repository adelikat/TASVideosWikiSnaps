		[img class=embed src=http://imgur.com/EgPp6va.png

		" ). The current record stands at 11:44 minutes and while running the game, the idea of making a TAS came. This is our first ever attempt at making one and I'd say we did a pretty damn good job with it. While this game was unforgiving as hell, I did enjoy the overall experience in the end, so I might make more later on with Atroz or by myself.

While it may seem like I did most of the work, Atroz was still a huge help in suggesting strats and especially motivation. We took about a 4 month hiatus due to the syncing issues but eventually came back.

The European version syncs up to the middle of 1-3 but then desyncs on stairs and the Japanese version can't even get past the title screen. Delaying the Start press gets Japanese to sync to the beginning of 1-2 but dies there. Interesting stuff but that's about it...

	"Popeye 2 is up there with the laggiest games for the Game Boy. Most problems arise from improving previous stages and having important things later on be desynced. This is complicated further by something we dubbed the "frame cycle". Basically during stages the game runs around 30 FPS, with every second frame being lag and the other one allowing inputs. For whatever reason 
	[em 
		"these
	]em
	" lag frames aren't detected by BizHawk though it does detect actual lag frames in stages like 3-1 and 3-3.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Now these frame cycles aren't consistent. Assume we need a jump on frame 4 to do something optimally. Depending on whether every even or uneven frame is lag, this can make the jump be impossible on frames 2 and 4, but possible on 1 and 3. We tried our best to work around this, but we never did figure out how the game determines the frame cycle for a stage. I did note that delaying inputs for the round transition screens did not seem to work, so you'd have to either gain or lose time in a previous stage itself to manipulate it somehow.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The stages affected by the frame cycle vary, but because this game is evil, of course the ones it affects are also the most painful ones to TAS. From the bit of testing done, it seems at least 1-3, 2-1, 3-3 and 4-2 are affected along with the boss of 3-3 and the final fight with Brutus. Aside from desyncing inputs, the most painful thing from the cycles were their effects on the barrel boost in 3-3 and the aforementioned bosses. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"With the awful lag explanations out of the way, I'll explain more of the mechanics of the game.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There are a total of 4 rounds to complete, each with 3 stages, a boss and a bonus stage (Round 4's bonus instead being the fight with Brutus). Each stage also has its own bonus room somewhere, which are all avoided. This gives a total of about 15 stages.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Popeye starts off with 3 health and when he has 5 or more, his hand grows up, improving the range of his attacks greatly. This is really useful for breaking brick walls, as you can break two walls at the same time rather than one at a time. Losing the hand is something you never want to happen. With the max health of 7, Popeye can also shoot spinach cans from his hand which can come in handy, though they can cause more lag. As mentioned by Nitro the spinach can and Popeye's punch are the same strength, though this only really affects bosses, as all other things die in a single hit. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Spinach cans on bosses are quite interesting in that the invincibility frames are longer if they get hit by a can. The iframe duration is different depending on the boss, but the window where you can hit a boss with a can again is around 10 frames slower than punching. So rather than trying to snipe bosses from really far away, you're better off rushing right next to them while shooting cans.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Popeye 2 also contains two power ups which many don't know about. The first one is a stopwatch that... stops time. It lasts for 10 seconds, but lag can make it last much longer in real time, up to even 17 seconds. They can be found by breaking certain bricks in stages. The stopwatch is utilized a few times to reduce lag, but one downside (aside from the annoying ticking sound) is that the timer countdown at the end takes longer, though this is pretty minor. The second item is a spinach can, which fully restores Popeye's health to full, which is quite handy. The can item is obtained after every boss in the game, oddly including 4-3 right before the fight with Brutus. The special items are used by holding Up or Down for the wanted item and then pressing Select.

It turns out that if you reach the middle of a rope just as you get hit by a barrel, you'll get boosted by a varying amount diagonally. We couldn't figure out what distance you get aside from that it was reliant on the frame cycle and lag. Punching right as you get hit makes the boost instead be vertical, which is really handy for skipping the rope climb, assuming the necessary height is attained.

We found out quite late while making the TAS that letting go of the direction you're heading to for a frame makes Popeye uncrouch. It is also possible to uncrouch by punching in the air, but it is usually slower. Uncrouching in the air also puts Popeye in his standing position. This sadly doesn't let you jump in the air, but is useful for when you land on stairs for example, as the jump input can be done 2 frames sooner than normally. Crouches themselves are also worth a mention, as they can be used to avoid bonking into ceilings in various places.

	"The first stage of the game. The start is nothing special but you'll notice that unlike Nitro, I'm grabbing spinach cans early on to get the big hand. A sick reverse punch is done to grab the third can without slowing down as much. This third can is for the crab boost done at the brown brick wall section. Without it, this would place us back into 4 health, losing the big hand for 1-2 and thus losing time. With the third can grabbed, the boost saves around 1.5 seconds. It's worth to be mentioned that not grabbing the first two cans for big hand like Nitro is slower even without the crab boost in place. Breaking the wall without big hand loses about 2 seconds, due to the range of the hand being smaller.

I ended up redoing it again even after we initially reached Brutus, just to shave off more time. I decided to give each redo its own version number and I believe this is the 5th one. I'm pretty happy with how this turned out. If you watch this stage side by side to Nitro's TAS, I think you'll see what I mean. Aside from the crazy amounts of optimization, the bat dodge near the end and the door itself are worthy of mention. The former is really annoying to do and actually requires turning in midair which seemingly alters Popeye's hitbox to barely avoid the bat. I've no idea how I managed to do it the first time, but it gave me a real hard time on my final redo.

Hilariously Atroz's first TAS through this stage as a test actually got the best door entering. Ah well...

This boost is a bit awkward, as it is possible to turn around to have it boost me towards the rope.

It greatly reduces the lag in the last quarter of the stage, saving around 2-3 seconds. As the stopwatch is used, our clock is frozen and thus can't be used for direct comparison.

It was with the stopwatch that we also ran into an awkward issue, as we need to hit Up and Select to use the clock, but we're also in the middle of a rope that we have to avoid by crouching, which requires holding Down.

One noteworthy thing to mention is that there's a "god pixel" when Popeye is exactly at X position 41 where the Dino can't hit him at all.

	"I'd say a sub 10:50 is definitely possible, but would require basically redoing all of the TAS, which I've burned out on. If the science behind frame cycles is figured out, that could theoretically provide a god barrel boost in 3-3 along with good cycles on the bosses. I'd guess this would in total save around 20-30 frames. I guess some stages also can have some time to save as we're only human after all. But yeah there isn't really anything that really strikes to my eye as bad, that we could have easily done something about. Overall quite happy with how everything turned out.
