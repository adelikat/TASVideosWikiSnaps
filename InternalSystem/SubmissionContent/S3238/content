	[a href=http://pastebin.com/C07zCyyu rel=noopener external nofollow

	" together. Shortly after, I found a useful speed trick which involves keeping your speed by pausing the game at certain frames, and I felt like running the first level. I didn't consider running the whole game at that time, but I recently got interested in it again. The upcoming levels were a much easier job than I expected (because the speed trick which is annoying to optimize was applicable to a much lesser extent). When I was near the end of world 4, I was made aware of further improvements by cyghfer, mainly the world 2 boss could be improved by a lot so I had to redo it. Unfortunately, the game isn't very hex-edit friendly due to lag behavior and varying speed oscilations. When entering a new "floor" of rooms, the game may tend to throw 10 lagframes right at you, and there isn't anything you can do about it. Also, when standing still for a long time there will be frequent lag frames, probably due to the BGM. I had to redo all of world 3, but I managed to save another second here by better luck-manipulation (kicking in the air changes the RNG apparently, and it helped bypass the ceiling enemies) and better midboss strat. I managed to hex-edit my previous world 4 in without trouble, I only had to account for lag frame differences.

All the other levels were done in July/August 2011. Probably more frames can be saved in this level since I wasn't very serious about it, but it's quite a pain to use the pause trick optimally.

I used the enemy boost and stopped the robot for faster walking, as suggested by cyghfer. Right before the boss rooms, I got another bunch of lag frames thrown at me... Nothing to do about it other than trying to save frames earlier on, which you can't just do on the spot. I killed the two small bosses seperately, because the score needs to end racking up before the floor opens so no need to get to one side of the room first. There's some sprite glitch going on at the final boss. By the way, if you kill him as Big Yacopu, the game locks up due to him flying away.

You can glitch into walls if your speed is somewhere at 100, but it's not possible within the game's level layouts.

World 3 has the greatest potential for a wall clip, the ceiling enemies can clip you to the side, but due to the level layout you don't get stuck in the wall. The World 3 midboss' shots don't last long enough to push you into the wall.
