	"There is one exception to "only items on the way." In one level I sacrifice a few seconds to rescue someone, but the next boss fight is faster because I get a better weapon during the fight.

	"I don't believe this game is very well known, so here it is in a nutshell. There are seven scenes. Each scene has two levels, Daytime and Nightime. In each Daytime level, you get the opportunity to rescue Van Helsing. At the end of each Nightime level is a battle with Dracula. When your weapon runs out, a refill automatically floats onto the screen. If you rescued Van Helsing, you get a better weapon here.
