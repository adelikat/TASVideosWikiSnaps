I know this hack is for more casual play, but I thought it would be interesting to TAS this hack, as there could be a potential "play-around" branch for this game. That would probably be the best thing ever. (Now that I thought about that, I might do that. Stay tuned, I guess.)

	"Another thing is that it's kind of hard to find a game or rom hack that has not been TASed yet. When I found out about this, I jumped right on it, which resulted in the un-optimized movie, because I had no idea how to make a TAS before that, watched some YT Videos, then decided to make it. Just saying, jumping right into TASing isn't the best thing to do.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"However, just all the normal levels, which can be broken in sevral ways (see Author's comments) would be more entertaining because they are short and sweet (this is also why I chose it for my first full movie, because I don't want to spent 2 months on something that probably won't get much attention. Yes, I know that I did get attention for choosing this hack, but nobody has done it, and it came out in 2013.)

	"This level, was optimized, optimized, and optimized over and over again. Started with Spikestuff changing my stupid 257 from the un-optimized TAS into a 261, even though he said he absolutely sucks at SMW. Then, I turned it into a 262 with using P-Speed, improved it again into a 263 after I found out about hopping 31 (but I didn't do it right), then I took it down to a 270 (I uploaded the userfile, avalible 
	[a class=intlink href=/Userfiles/Info/54088568660156425

	". After I made that, I made a 1 frame improvement for this movie. The first level wasn't too interesting at the beginning, as it was just getting P-Speed. after I got it, it got crazy.....what a second... YOU CAN TURN ENEMIES INTO COINS?!?! Well, yes, you can. It's pretty weird but awesome. What I was going for is P2 was turning all the enemies into coins (except big bills) to help P1 get through the level faster. I'm not sure if it worked out as planned, but the result is pretty awesome. As I said before, this level went through about 5 stages of optimization, going from un-optimized to extremely optimized. I think it could even be imrpoved by a couple of frames, but It's not worth re-creating the entire movie just for 2 frames of improvement. (I'll probably get hate because I said that, but 2 weeks of work is 2 weeks of work, and I don't want to re-sync the entire thing. Sorry.)

The community there is super supportive and helpful with any game you happen to be TASing. If it's a hack of a game thats been done 2030200349394 times, then they will probably point you to the game resource page for that game (thanks, people who did that, i forget your name). They are also super helpful. I got a bunch of help from the people there, especially greysondn, who took their time to make a benchmark run for this game for me (tysm btw). I'm super glad that the userfile storage place of TASVideos exists, because it's a good place for me to put my movies that are either just 1 level, a test, or not fully optimized. That's where I stored the improvements and such.
