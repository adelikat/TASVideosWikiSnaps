	$LF
	"hard mode.  The game plays like a mixture of Prince of 
	$LF
	"Persia and any beat-em-up, but you can see that in the 
	$LF
	"movie.  If anyone is confused about the crystals: every 3 
	$LF
	"red crystals grants you a stronger standard combo, which 
	$LF
	"makes boss fights much faster.  There are also blue and 
	$LF
	"green crystals, but those affect health bars, and therefore 
	$LF
	"are a waste of time.

	"If the movie desynchs, I don't know what to tell you.  I've 
	$LF
	"been getting mixed feedback from people saying it works 
	$LF
	"completely or that it will desynch at random areas.  I 
	$LF
	"suggest you let the program, the ROM, and the movie all 
	$LF
	"fully load before viewing, and I recommend not using any 
	$LF
	"sort of turbo.  Also, if the music drives you crazy, I don't
