	"Chrono Trigger is a phantastic role-playing game made by Square. It is known as one of the best RPG games of all time. The story is about time-traveling in which a group of young adventurers is trying to save the future by defeating a mighty creature called "Lavos" which has infected and destroyed the world.

	"Big thanks to Hero of the day, who discovered a crazy trick to skip Marles "Candy-Scene" that alone saved incredible 1017 frames! It actually was the only reason I did this improvement. Also thanks to inichi for another crazy suggestion to lower "Battle Speed" from 1 to 2, which allowed to skip one major attack of Lavos (the Hand Sickles) and even though all battles were slightly slower because of that, it still saved another amazing 314 frames in the end result.

	"The 16 more frames saved from v2 against v1 by finding even better ways to reduce lag during boss-fights, are still count in. Except of that, I couldn't save even one frame anywhere else, including the entire End Of Time scene, and this despite hard analyzing and testing in every place. This just shows how frame-perfect the 1st run already was. :-)
