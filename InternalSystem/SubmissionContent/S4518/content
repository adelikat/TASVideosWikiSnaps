	$LF

		"First starting in the combos,the combos sequence are a little different,a example is the air/junggle combos that some characters can't execute only certain characters as: Kabal,Sindel,Jax,Kano,Sektor,Striker,Nightwolf,Sheeva and Striker,this version blocked some special moves of some character as Striker gun(back,foward,HP) or Kung lÃ£o Spinning Shield(foward,down,foward+run) in UMK3 you can do infinite time this move on the corner and making a infinite combo MK3 you can't,in corners you can do several B+HK easily already UMK3 you is pushed back,the glitches called: Eruption,Moonwalker,Later fatalitys,Kabal tug,are in this first version too but isn't the same effects of UMK3,example using Nightwolf the game crashes,the same effect using Striker,Jax,Sonia,the only effect that are the same is using Sub-Zero the char stay the air,Sheeva sometimes change the scenario,sometimes change the pallete but only happens in the corners or in the exact frame (in this I choose change the "pallete" character),as this version have animalitys we have a lot of strange glitches using mercy command,have still a strange glitches using the cheat in "one button fatality" when your enemy are in danger you can use a special move as kung's hat and when hit the enemy press the button fatality and the part of hat will be marked in the scenario here I used the example in the smoke x kabal fight in the last round I used smoke spear and then used the button fatality the effect is strange both chars crash but have other effects,another little and stupid thing for me is that the CPU in this version is bad comparing with UMK3,a example in my run you will see I doing a simple combos as shang's combo> HK,HK,B+HK in the second HK sequence the CPU drop the defense,in UMK3/MKT until the older MK2 and others versions this didn't occour,showing how the CPU isn't perfect,this version didn't have Male or Female Ninjas and have Sheeva as character to choose or morph.

		"Well,I loved played this game again and finally got this mainly playing Galaga-Game never played in other MK run,when you are playing this game you can freely see  the greatest differences of the old to the successor UMK3/MKT,who are conversant with UMK3/MKT can easy see the differences,the limitations as I tried best to talk for you above,the glitches same if you aren't conversant with the games you will see differences up to if are identical of UMK3 but are different to do and others have others effects,well I tried my best in this run I'm happy with this,now is see the result from you.
