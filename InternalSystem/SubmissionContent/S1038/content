	"This is the ultimate experience for every Disney lover. You will have a hard time finding a game quite as lovely to the detail created as this one, featuring marvellous graphics, music and smooth gameplay.
	$LF
	"The only bad thing with the game is that there's just not much extent to it, it's perfectly linear and very short, but that's just good for a TAS ;)

	"This is an improvement of this movie here: http://bisqwit.iki.fi/nesvideos/353S.html

	"It's an improvement of about half a minute, although the movie file is longer, this is due to that I ended the movie this time just when I pressed enough buttons that the movie can really scroll to it's very end without any input anymore.

	"Improvements were made through better optimization of where to get stars (health) and where to get hurt, improved smoothness, faster boss fights, and doing some things in a better way than the previous movie.

	"There are some seemingly missed shots, these are either to prevent falling delay when you fall from high, or to get Mickey in a right animation that I jump on an enemy just the right position that I hit him or prevent damage, or to dodge things that could hurt me.

	"Note for the encoder, if this should get published: The game immediatly automatically resets after the credits are scrolled through. The best moment to end the movie would be at 23:16.
