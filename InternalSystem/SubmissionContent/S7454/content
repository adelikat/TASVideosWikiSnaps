	"From outside the house, you can wait for midnight and going into another load to advance one day at 6am. The first frame of "normally" midnight, the game will put the IGT to 6am the next day, at this frame you are able to move for one frame and if you load a new area you'll stay in the transitionning state of the frame you entered so if you are able during the first frame where you can move and where the trainsitioning state ends to load a new area the game will pass another day.

	"Older use of the glitch : In my previous TAS, I was using the stock to trigger the glitch as it was not known (I didn't test anything else) that any other loads was possible. The problem with the stock is that inside the stock, it is considered as a menu and so the IGT doesn't advance and so the transitioning state stays until you leave the stock.

[div class=p 
	"New and more effective use of the glitch : Since we can use any load triggers to perform the glitch, the best possibility would be to enter a building where the IGT continues and the transitioning state for beeing able to end so that both when entering the building and leaving it, we would pass a day. Something that is possible in any other buildings of the farm.

	"This is where most of the time save comes from, the other reason is that the building with the load beeing the fastest was used.

	": BOY's reality warping powers grow stronger as he finds himself truly mastering the art of the dimensional pocket, living these three years almost three times faster through that more refined time dilation. Honestly, my favorite genre of speedrun is "do some insane, repetitive action for several minutes until the game is cleared impossibly fast", and this game continues to be no exception to that. Passing several years in the space of 4 minutes just by entering and exiting a door at a very specific time is both peak Samsara humor and a great execution of a fun little quirk that continues to show just how uniquely and differently games can be analyzed and broken.
