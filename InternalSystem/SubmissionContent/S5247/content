	"As I stated in the thread, the current published Breath of Fire 3 run is sitting in the Vault at a low 5.3 entertainment rating, and having watched most of this run (in fast-forward over a couple days), I can see why. It's just... Cutscenes. And talking. And a little bit of walking. And then sometimes Fight Boys happens and my attention is held for a brief moment. Of course, I'm not familiar with the game or the series, and I don't think most of the audience is either, but judging from the way the run looks, I don't really see any entertainment increase from passing over Super Combo. It makes battles a little better, but it does nothing for the entire rest of the run.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The fact that Super Combo is passed over means this run does not qualify for the Vault, as it is an speed/entertainment tradeoff (and a significant one at that, it seems, with this run being 11 minutes slower than the published run despite numerous improvements), and that's honestly a shame, since the overall optimization is pretty good. It's just that goal choice. The thread (and myself) have been fairly vocal about it being arbitrary by site standards, ironically some of the most "vocal" feedback I'm seeing for the run is the lack of feedback at all. Discussions on IRC back up that there just isn't a whole lot of interest in the run, even if it had an encode for people to watch, it's 8 hours long and the biggest change between this run and the published run is forbidding the usage of something that makes it faster.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"If you're really into TASing this game, I would suggest a straight improvement to janus's published run, using Super Combo. It should be easy with all the improvements found since it was made, and it would absolutely be acceptable and publishable. But as it is right now, I have to reject it for an arbitrary (and poorly received) goal choice.
