	"Yeah, this is a TAS for Super Mario Advance 2, which is the GBA version of Super Mario World. As the title says, it aims to complete all the exits and collect all the dragon coins in the shortest time possible. It's been over a year since this TAS was made, so I don't remember exactly how long I worked on this movie; but I think it was around a month.
