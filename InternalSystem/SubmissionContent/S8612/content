	"Given the minimal information available about this specific code, I can only assume it's not one commonly known/used.  In fact, the AISSON code (mentioned 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=here|href=/Forum/Posts/525384)
	") is a much more well known code for clipping through walls/objects.  While these two codes modify different instructions of the ROM, these modifications are only a few instructions apart (which is why they likely have similar effects).  FWIW, this run's input does not sync when using AISSON instead of EATSSY, and runs made for AISSON don't seem to sync when using EATSSY; so the codes seem to differ enough to make the two not directly equivalent.

	"That stated; given that both codes have the same basic effect on the game, I don't really see much value in having both separate runs as full publications on the site.  It may be possible for a run using a wall-clipping Game Genie code to be accepted for publication at some point in the future; and if that happens, it will likely be one using a more well-known code like AISSON (that also happens to yield a faster run).

	" that uses only AISSON and is still faster than this submission.  Therefore, Playground seems to be the ideal landing spot for this submission.
