		"I found a thread on the Uzebox forums
	]a
	" where the game is discussed. In it, it's described as a "demo/proof-of-concept", and it definitely shows in its content (rather, it's lack of such). It is the first level of the original NES Castlevania, just completely devoid of any obstacles. Enemies? None. The pits downstairs? Float right over 'em. Candles? Not even an obstacle, but not there either.

	"Looking further in the thread, you can see that there was a lot of early excitement about the engine, particularly in how faithful it is to the original game (the physics are 1:1 as far as I've tested). There was early discussion on potentially porting the whole game over and even a bit of work done, however that quickly stalled out by

	", such as demakes. I suppose you could count the complete lack of obstacles "transformative", but given how faithful everything else is to the original version, it's hard to classify this little proof of concept as something other than just that - a proof of concept port that, while incredibly impressive, fails to set itself apart from the original by succeeding at what it set out to do.

	"All that being said, though, given that this little thing was last discussed just a few months ago despite originally being made in 2012, I do have some hope for some kickass Uzebox Castlevania fangame coming out in the future. Maybe we can revisit this submission then.
