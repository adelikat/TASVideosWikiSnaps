	": Accepting as a new, "deathless" branch. Even though the existing run is in Moons, and has good votes so far, even if it didn't, these 2 branches would still both be vaultable, so they can't obsolete one another. This one goes to Moons as well, as a variant of a "warpless", or full completion branch. But don't assign the warpless label, since this game has no warps.
