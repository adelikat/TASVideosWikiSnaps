	"The PASS WORD tech from last year caused a bit of a controversy in the speedrunning community. Some were thrilled to save 15 minutes off this crappy game. Others were mortified at all the fun and exciting gameplay that was lost. They called each other hypocrites, fools, cheaters, casuals... Eventually, a schism formed. No one could agree on what was true Any%, so we now have Any% - PASS WORD, and Any% - no PASS Word. Rockman 2: Dr. Wily no Nazo no PASS WORD. It's all so confusing. I wish I had left this tech in a vault to rot in obscurity.

	"Let's define a softlock for the purposes of this run. A softlock is when you're stuck at a certain point in the game world with no way to advance and no way to die. So the only way out is to get up off your roommate's couch and press the reset button--or stomp your foot real hard for the same effect. This type of situation usually occurs when we "overzip" in a speedrun, which is when you fail to hit a scroll trigger and end up in the boss room while seeing the corridor on screen. Most overzips leave you with a way to die; it's very rare to get properly softlocked. However, for this run, we do not need to limit ourselves to standard any% strats. There may be a useless zip that could get us softlocked much sooner.

	"A Buster-only softlock would be ideal, but I don't believe one is possible. In the 8 robot master stages, there are a total of 9 spots (technically 13) where you can zip without items. Of them, only two have overzip potential: the one used at the beginning of Crash, and a useless one in Wood. The Wood one simply takes you to the next room where you can die by grabbing the ladder. The Crash one, no matter how high you climb past the usual death point, will always leave you with some way to scroll backwards or die. So an Item is necessary to get softlocked.

	"Item 3 (obtained from Flashman) obviously saves a lot of time in Heatman's stage with that big zip overhead, but not enough time to actually be worth doing Flash. So if we want Item 1 (obtained from Heatman), we should do Heatman Buster only and then go straight to the softlock site. However, Heatman's stage is 2,114 frames slower than Flashman's stage when done without items, so an Item 3 softlock would be a much better choice if one exists. Item 3 is much more limited in its zipping applications, so this may not work out.

In the second room of Heatman's stage, we can do a useless vertical zip into the ceiling of the previous room, after which we can overzip back into the yoku block room and drop down into the long hallway proceeding it. By sheer coincidence, the last frame of input is exactly 2,114 frames into Heatman's stage. This means that an Item 1 zip would have to be

But in Flashman's stage, you get stuck in the ceiling and cannot escape. I really don't see a way to do this without Metal Blade. So the route would be:
