	"This run is the first run of this type. There is another small only run, too, but the other run is a 100% run, that means all possible levels, because you can't do all levels as small Mario. Because of that, we can't use the same route as the normal run. Star World 1 can only done as big mario, because you must destroy the blocks with spin jumps, but with small Mario you can't destroy them.

	"When you run (hold Y/X and >), your speed oscillates. 36 > 35 > 36 > 35 > 37 and then again from the beginning (36, 35, 36, 35, 37, 36, 35...). If you sprint it's the same (48, 47, 48, 47, 49, 48, 47...). If you stop holding > in the air, your speed stops, too. But to hold this speed, you must jump the first frame you touch the bottom. With this method, you can hold a speed of 37/49.

	" Walljump
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"If your speed is at least 33 you can jump off a wall. You must be pushed in a wall 3 pixels and you must be exactly at a block boundary (every 16 pixels). Mario "catches" the wall, that means Mario stands on the wall. This frame you must jump.

	" 1/1

[p 
	"In the water, your speed oscillates, too (16, 15, 16, 15, 17) or with an item (32, 31, 32, 31, 33). If your speed is on his maximum (17/33) press one frame < and the next > again and then < and >,<,>,< and so on. Then your speed oscillates only between 15/31 and 17/33 so it's more than the normal because: (16+15+16+15+17)/5 = 15,8 and (15+17)/2 = 16
