	"Anarchaeologist is a 2022 GBA homebrew game in which Archie Logist enters a series of ancient pyramids equipped with a gun. Buttons need to be hit with bullets from the gun to progress through the pyramids while breakable blocks must also be shot to open up a path to the exit. This TAS swiftly breezes through the pyramids and damages very little in the pursuit of speed.

	"All level require a button to be hit and this is the main goal speed-wise. Jumping reduces the amount of time needed to raise the gun upwards which is annoyingly slow. The only interesting level that has an unintended strategy is the final one where I just jump straight to the end. The intended method is probably moving the two crates at the top of the stage to create a platform you can jump on to make it over the barrier but it is possible to just jump from the breakable blocks because of how generous the ledge forgiveness is.

	"Other than that, I also found that you could end every level on 0:00 time by repeatedly pausing and there was some other thing with pausing I was messing around with ages ago I can't remember.
