	"ABOUT THE GAME
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Platoon was released on 1988, and it is based on the Award-Winning 1986 movie of the same name,
	$LF
	"wich by the way, i have never seen.
	$LF

[p 
	"GAME PLOT
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The game basically follows some scenes of the movie on each level, you are trapped on vietnam and your so called mates are about to send a nice quantity of napalm quite close to your location, unless you can
	$LF
	"tell them to hold their horses just a little bit more.
	$LF
	"In fact the game is quite short if you know where to go, but if you try to play it by instinct... well, prepare your liver to begin a massive bile production.
	$LF

[p 
	"ABOUT THE RUN
	$LF
	"I decided to make it because i wanted to see it and couldn't find any, it took me one whole day to make it, if that's too little time to do a TAS, well i guess gruefood will keep it for another fool that happens to be looking for it :).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I tried my best at all times to save as much frames as posible, i couldnÂ´t find any 
	$LF
	""speed-glitches" , so i just kept moving as fast as i could.

	"LEVELS
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"1: JUNGLE/VILLAGE
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"DESCRIPTION:This level is basically a jungle maze filled with exploding white lines and Vietnamese enemies that appear randomly, you need to grab some explosives in order to blow a bridge.
	$LF
	"Once you have blown the above mentioned bridge, you have to find a map and a torch inside a village in order to reach the next level.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"ENEMIES: Soldiers on foot, soldiers buried in the ground (?????) and death lines (yeah, like the ones at the office)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"MOVEMENT: I tried my best to make it interesting to watch, but there's not much i could do that wouldn't cost time.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"2: SEWERS
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"DESCRIPTION: First person view is used, and as usual on an 8 bit game, is kind of weird looking.
	$LF
	"This was in fact the easiest part to record, just grab those flares, take that compass
	$LF
	"kill one or two enemies and go straight to the exit.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"ENEMIES: Gun soldiers and Knife soldiers
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"MOVEMENT: Fast paced, it takes some time to turn around and the cross hair bounces 
	$LF
	"from left to right until you encounter an enemy.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"LEVEL 3 NIGHT ASSAULT
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"One of the slowest parts of the game, just kill anything that moves and you'll be fine.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"ENEMIES: Soldiers in the dark
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"MOVEMENT: You move the crosshair from one shadow to another, that's it.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"LEVEL 4 FINAL SHOWDOWN
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This was meant to be a maze but as you will see, there is no such thing, you go
	$LF
	"always straight forward killing enemies and avoiding any objects on your way,
	$LF
	"from my perspective, this is the most dynamic part of the movie.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"ENEMIES: Soldiers, snipers and the final Boss!
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"MOVEMENT: every bullet follows the shortest path to reach you once it has spawned, in order
	$LF
	"to avoid them you need to move the character from one side to another to make the bullets go the opposite way, enemies move from left to right, just like ducks on a fair. The last boss requires 5 grenades to die, i stop the movie as soon as i drop the last grenade.
	$LF
