	"In this game, Ronald finds a magical map, to lead him to treasure. He voyages with his friends where the map leads him. Each boss defeated gives Ronald another piece of the map. First they go through the Magical Forest, and they face a Giant Tomato boss. Next he travels through the Magical Train and into the Magical City, where he must defeat a goblin-like enemy in a spaceship. Ronald then goes to the Magical Sea, where he encounters Captain Lips, a pirate. Captain Lips possesses the final piece of the map, which then changes and points towards a moon. They meet up with a scientist who builds them a rocket to travel to the moon, they crash the ship, breaking it.

We press down to get off the second zipline instead of letting go of ‘A’ at the end of the screen. This is because Ronald on a zipline is 1.5 times faster than walking, so it’s important that he stays on ziplines as long as possible.

Normally Ronald moves at a screen speed of 512, however this trick allows us reach speeds of up to 700-800. 4-8 specifically uses two massive balloon boosts that give us speeds of up to 812 and 856 respectively for both boosts.

However, it was discovered by Sonikkustar that there are 5 frames where the health of the miniboss hovers around 1 before going back up to 4. By doing two frame perfect inputs, you can get the health to zero and instantly kill the miniboss. Doing this allows us to save 192 frames (3.2 seconds) over the previous TAS.

This removes the need to switch to another floor the moment you hit the boss. More importantly this trick also allows us to hit the boss on the top floor which is not normally possible. By doing this, we are able to hit the boss three times where it’s not supposed to be possible. The strategy has completely changed the boss so that we are now able to finish three cycles sooner.
