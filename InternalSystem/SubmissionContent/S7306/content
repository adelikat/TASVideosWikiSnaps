	"This game is a modified hack based on Mega Man 2. It was released in 2017 without a version notation, and became version 1.2 in 2021 with major content changes. This TAS mainly focuses on the warp bug caused by Gemini Time (Geminiman's weapon),and the increased movement speed from Snake Buster (Snake Man's weapon) to advance through the stage as fast as possible.
