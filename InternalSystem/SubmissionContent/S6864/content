	"This is the very first submission to use the brand new PCE core in BizHawk known as TurboNyma.  It is slightly more accurate than PCEHawk and the audio emulation is much more accurate to the console.  I originally started this project on 2.4.2 on the PCEHawk core, but as soon as TurboNyma became TASable in dev builds of bizhawk, I decided to switch over there.  Of course I waited until the core was officially released before submitting, I'm not a monster.

	"Very straight forward level, we travel through some land, climb up some ladders made out of fish bones, and go to the ginger bread house to fight a boss.  For bosses, you can shoot words at it, and the boss wont have any I-Frames for it, however it doesnt do nearly as much damage as bouncing, which does cause I-Frames.  For the Ghost, I do as much damage as I can do it before it goes upwards, as soon as it's about to go up, I do my bounce attack on it so the I-Frames can happen at a time I don't have to confront it.

There also aren't any obvious glitches being used) the game itself is colorful and fun to watch. I did not feel bored or fatigued watching this. Also, audience reaction is strong.
