	"HRtP takes place within 20 stages of varying card layouts that Reimu will have to kick the yin-yang orb through. Every 5 stages the gameplay will change into a boss fight, where you must knock the orb into the boss to deal damage. After stage 5, you get the option to pick a route; Makai or Jigoku (Heaven or Hell). This run picks Makai as it's the highest scoring overall.

The base value is depending on which stage you're on, for 1-4 it's 100, 6-9 it's 200, 11-14 it's 300, and lastly 16-19 it's 400.

However, this introduces a rule given to this TAS : When the timer hits 0, the game will tell you to HARRY UP and will spawn bullets infinitely until you finish the stage or die, if you die the timer is reset to 1,000; but with TAS you can survive the barrage infinitely, causing an infinite scoring problem to arise. So to keep a form of scoring integrity, when the words HARRY UP appear, I'm not allowed to milk the bullets that spawn from it and can only use it to reset my timer for the stage clear bonus.
