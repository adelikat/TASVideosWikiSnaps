	"This is a very odd mario-esque game that was as a promo for Dominos Pizza in 1990.

	"The pizza battles at the end of certain levels were the biggest pain ever. Even if done as fast as possible, they added at least a minute of play time to the run. I managed to avoid as many of them as possible by using warps.

	"Another annoying thing about the pizza battles is that his card choice are all determined before you enter the game. So, when you enter, the cards he will choose and their order is already determined, as opposed to each card being randomly chosen at each turn. This made it very difficult to find the choice grouping that was the fastest to beat. about half of my re-dos were trying to find the fastest way to beat the pizza battles, so i think i found the best ways in each one.

	": Rejecting this movie, because it isn't really interesting to watch. I was also about to complain of lack of creativity, but the submission note hints towards that there actually was some work to be done. Too bad the game was badly chosen.
