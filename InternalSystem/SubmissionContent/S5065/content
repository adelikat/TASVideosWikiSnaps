	"Whaddap bitchez n' niggas and wellcome to Nester's Funky Bowling yo!!!
	$LF
	"Ok, let's pause that for a bit... Nester's Funky Bowling is a Bowling game released on the Ultra failed Virtual Boy, the black sheep of all Nintendo's game systems.
	$LF
	"The game was released in 1996 by Nintendo, and it's notable for featuring the character of Nester, he comes from the Nintendo Power (RIP) magazine, being the star of his own comic strip: Howard & Nester.
	$LF
	"It features few modes, CHALLENGE, being the most viable to TAS. VBjin is surpisingly a comfortable emu to work with, maybe I'll TAS another game one day who knows... :P
