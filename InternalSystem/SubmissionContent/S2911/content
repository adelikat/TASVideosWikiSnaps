	"This game - which is known as Kirby Mouse Attack in Europe and 星のカービィ 参上! ドロッチェ団 (Kirby of the Stars: Calling on the Dorotche Gang) in Japan - is much like a sequel to Kirby & The Amazing Mirror, however, in my opinion it's not such a great game. Many rooms or places of Kirby & The Amazing Mirror were recycled into Squeak Squad, but the game itself doesn't really provide anything new or innovative. The bubble system, while being an interesting feature, is making the game really easy. Enemies are placed loosely throughout the rooms and there also isn't much to discover in this game (unlike in Amazing Mirror, which consists of a maze rather than ordered levels). In my opinion the era of GBA and NGC games was the best time for a Nintendo fan: So many good games, remakes of old NES & SNES classics and excellent games like Super Mario Sunshine, Super Smash Bros Melee or Paper Mario TTYD. It was so much better compared to now. Nowadays games are so purposefully easy, aimed at casual players and short or non-innovative, that one gets the opinion that these games were produced to just "get more money out of the franchise". There are exceptions, but the Wii console is primarily aimed at family or children or casual players so there aren't so many good games... This is the way I see it. Nowaways, I'm not playing videogames much anymore. Well, I think Squeak Squad is still a good game since I played it many hours and it's also a game suited for speedrunning.
