	"This submission uses the FCEU (Blip) emulator, most specifically due to the fact that other NES emulators randomly crash...No cheats whatsoever were used in the making of this movie...Programming error wise, I showcase one of the kewlest glitches I have ever found in an NES game, one that is extremely difficult to pull off...It may appear easy, but it certainly is not...It can literally take hundreds of tries or more for the average gamer to pull off, that is if they get lucky...This wonderful glitch has to be seen to be believed, and it occurs at the very end of the film, to wrap it up nice and tight...And, also do not miss the magical spike jump glitch...Anyways, I have decided to do this game Excitebike style (just one single stage, in this case stage one), whereas it is more impressive and interesting to watch as a teaser rather than as a whole...Strider, as you may already know, is a great Metroid-esque action-platformer game...It is my personal favorite NES title...Sadly enough, two major drawbacks to the game are  constantly having to do the same stages over and over and over again, with the nail in the coffin being fighting the same exact boss over again and again and again...Sure the game is very fun to play, but it certainly would not be very enjoyable to watch after seeing stage one for the 4th, or even 5th time...lol...I take damage on purpose in one area of the first stage...that is after I receive a disc, and use the slide maneuver to quickly get out of their as optimally as I can...I do not think anyone could really do the first stage faster than me, especially with this game having some of the worst play control in any game ever made...You can jump in the air..and be knocked back to the ground instantly..by just being next to certain ledges...I believe this, my first time-attack playaround to be a very fun to watch effort...that will not be a regret to those who take the few minutes necessary to watch it...And, remember that fantastic glitch I do near the end of stage one...I make it look sooooooooo easy to do...But, trust me, it is not easy in the least bit...:)  Enjoy the movie...more to come in the future if this one works out...
