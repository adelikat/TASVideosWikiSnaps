	"Illusion of Gaia is an action/RPG. It's actually the second in a trilogy, the first being Soul Blazer and the third being Terranigma. It was also released in French as "Illusion of Time". It's a very linear game, so there isn't much room for improvisation. The main character, Will, travels the world with his friends to find his dad, but quickly finds himself in the middle of a much more complicated story. For a more detailed description of the game, you can check out

	" In the first part of my work on this run, I used Snes9x's Memory Watch feature to see the RNG and manipulate luck that way. Not only that, but he also is the one who basically makes this TAS possible because he modified Snes9x to give it TASing capabilities.

For example, if you attacked an enemy to the left, you could do this: A, nil, nil, up or down. This allows for faster recovery between hits, making it possible to start running earlier after a hit. This can be used while running too: cancelling a hit will allow you to continue running in that direction.

	" was my comparison point for this whole TAS. Overall, this 100% run was 8813 frames slower than the any% (2 minutes, 26 seconds and 53 frames). Considering that I had to get all the 50 Red Jewels AND complete Gem's Mansion, it's an incredible feat. To clear things up a bit, the 100% was actually FASTER than the any% up until Gem's Mansion. It was exactly 2246 frames faster after all the boss refights were done. Only it lost about 3 minutes to go get the remaining Red Jewels and complete Gem's Mansion. If it weren't for Gem's Mansion, the 100% would obsolete the any%.
