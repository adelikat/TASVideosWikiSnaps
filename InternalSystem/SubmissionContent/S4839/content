	": Hi again, arandomgameTASer.  All in all, very good job on this improvement, and shaving time off in almost every room!  Emphasizing Mickey's diagonal boosts were among the most eye-catching, as well as the added skips in Big Thunder Mountain and the Haunted Mansion.  Looking forward to your next run!
