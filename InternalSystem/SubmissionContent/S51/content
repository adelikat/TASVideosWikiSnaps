	"My Aladdin movie - completed without collecting all of the red rubies. I tried to go for pure speed, and I attempted to throw in a few "close-calls" (Nearly being hit by an enemy, lava, gliding across a long stretch) and I hope they make the movie a little more exciting. The ending is extremely long (Without the ending movie, the time attack was only 18 minutes) but I had to keep it on.
