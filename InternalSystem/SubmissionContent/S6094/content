	"depending on when you jump in each screen can determine when you arrive to the next screen.  Sometimes when you jump in one place the game might take extra frames to load it, while when you jump in different places, you can make the transition slightly faster.  that's really the biggest optimization for this movie.

	"you die in one hit so everything you do has to be in perfect execution, so this game cant exactly be considered trivial.  probably the more easier modes can be considered, but not hard mode.

	"The very last jump to get to Smurfette requires a straight jump then a forward jump to get enough height to reach her.  The game then loops back to the beginning with no real change in difficulty.
