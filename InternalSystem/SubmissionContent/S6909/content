	"Insmouse no Yakata (インスマウスの館) is a Japan-only Virtual Boi gaem that consists that the player must escape from every room in this mansion before the time of the top reaches zero or the monsters kill the character. The exit door is like every door in the game but is not visible in the map (pressing select) but can be visible if you get both white orb (get map) and black orb (get key and items locations). Oh! Speaking of key, that door is locked! You must find the key before reaching the door.

	[em

	" because the run is so short (or cyort, if you will). Routing looks optimal, considering some levels are beaten in the time it takes to take a single shot it's clear that even the paths that look suboptimal on the maps are in fact the best routes to take. Optimization's great as well. Always liked these sort of first person dungeon crawler TASes that fly through levels butt-first because it saves a couple frames over turning around. Just imagine someone aggressively twerking their way through Howard Poward Lovecraft's Big Fun Heck Mansion. That's my jam.

	"Speaking of jam, this run in a bit of a weird area entertainment-wise: It's half Yes and half Meh (after removing my own Yes vote, heck yeah for transparency), but the thread feedback only really represents the Meh votes, and I think that speaks more for the overall viewpoint of the audience than the voting does. It's definitely borderline, though, so while I'm accepting this run to Vault, I could see it getting popped up to Moons in the future.
