	"I improved my old run by 996 frames or 16.6 seconds. Most of this improvement comes from more general optimization and more use of the blue copter. I made more of an effort to control lag, which prevented me from making parts of the run more entertaining.

	"The blue copter is obviously used to move faster than walking. It is only useful over long distances because its duration is timed. However, I had more hats in this run so I could use it even for short distances. When the blue copter symbol is flashing, Gadget will be invincible while using it.

	"A damaging copter that can be controlled. It is the main weapon used for fighting bosses because of its strength and its ability to be controlled. I didn't use one on level 3's boss this time because he can be killed with just punches, so I have no need to waste the hats.

[p 
	"The first few sections are almost the same, except for some copters I use over short distances. I didn't use copters in the last section because it wasn't necessary (I have to wait for the platforms anyway). This allowed me to use two additional copters in the run. I also didn't use a red copter on the ship for the same reason. The boss fight is faster because I drew him to the hole before I killed him.
