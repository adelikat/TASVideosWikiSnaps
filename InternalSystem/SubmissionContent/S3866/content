	"A magic wand is used to turn trees and rocks into fighting men and a potentially large army is amassed to fight through to the castle.

	"Collecting more troops makes them harder to control.
	$LF
	"You hypothetically can cycle through the 3 types of units (king, soldier, knights) and then they all move one square in the same direction.
	$LF
	"But because of the way the game accepts input you have limited control of all of them at once during a TAS.
	$LF
	"The first frame is input for the king, the next frames control the soldier and then the knights after that.
	$LF
	"How much control this gives seem to vary randomly through the game, sometimes you can control knights individually, other times soldier will have their input locked to the king.
	$LF
	"The enemies will never initiate a fight, but rather just block your path so the only way through is fighting.
	$LF
	"Fighting is slow and pretty random.
	$LF
	"The RNG seems tied to the kings movements in some unclear fashion.

	"The other kings castle is 600m away and it has many defenders.
	$LF
	"Every 100m is a wall that only your king can break through.
	$LF
	"Before each wall is also a POW camp that your knights can break into for some extra soldiers, but it takes a long time.
	$LF
	"Every kill gives an attack boost of 10 that caps out ~300, but combat seems much more like a coin flip than something stats meaningfully effect.
	$LF
	"Killing three enemies upgrades your soldiers/knights to gold versions and gives them a one time bonus of 90 attack.

	$LF
	"The bricks turn into ninjas when the king passes and they will charge after him.
	$LF
	"They ignore the other troops, so position so they can't block the king's path, then have the blockers catch up.
