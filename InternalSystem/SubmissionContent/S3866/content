	"You hypothetically can cycle through the 3 types of units (king, soldier, knights) and then they all move one square in the same direction.
	$LF
	"But because of the way the game accepts input you have limited control of all of them at once during a TAS.
	$LF
	"The first frame is input for the king, the next frames control the soldier and then the knights after that.
	$LF
	"How much control this gives seem to vary randomly through the game, sometimes you can control knights individually, other times soldier will have their input locked to the king.
	$LF
	"The enemies will never initiate a fight, but rather just block your path so the only way through is fighting.

	"Fighting is slow and pretty random.
