	"This is an improvement of 2 whole frames over the previous submission by Lollorcaust & Alyosha.  Upon checking the previous submission, it appears as though there was room for improvement, so I'd figure I'd give it a shot given its lack of length or (perceived) complexity.  However, the previous movie was still pretty well made.  It's possible to save 1 frame on the second set of enemies, but this messes up timing on the next wave and so negates any benefit.  This movie manages to save 3 frames on the 4th wave, but due to the frame rule that exists this gets erased immediately after anyway.  Thus only 2 frames managed to be save here, by doing the final boss slightly different.
