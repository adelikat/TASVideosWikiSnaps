The Cross boomerang subweapon is more powerful fighting the 2nd form than the Axe Sub weapon or the whip at higher MP cost, which in turn doesn't slow down too much fighting the 3rd form due to MP limitation thanks to a collision glitch that touching the beam-casting "ring" floating over Graham doesn't inflict any damage to Julius or interrupt his movements, but still grants the same invulnerability as if Julius were normally hit.
