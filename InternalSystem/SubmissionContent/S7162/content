	"Probably too boring to publish. This was really just an early test of some general-purpose software I am writing to assist in TAS/RTA routing. For this game it is pretty simple to solve for optimal solutions. First every possible solution (set cover) is found using the dancing links algorithm, then I analyze each cover individually for the fastest overall ordering of piece placements.
