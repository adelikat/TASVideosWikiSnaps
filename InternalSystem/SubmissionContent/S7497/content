	"This route is similar to a standard play route, but with luck manipulation to have almost no unnecessary random encounters, a joke of a Matrix run, and only gargoyles or hellhounds for the necessary drops on those quests. I come up a point short on Karma, so I forced a fast delivery run for the 18th point I need to get 4 Reputation.

	"There are no major skips or glitches I am aware of for the game. Sometimes it seems as if I shoot or cast spells for no reason or sit and wait for a bit of time doing nothing, these are intentional to adjust the Random Number Generator in specific ways for the purposes of the run. We fire our hired runners and die to warp out of areas occasionally. The glitches used here are:

	"The run could likely be made a bit faster by earning the 18th Karma point along the way without an extra run, or with tighter routing which could effect the RNG. Given the luck manipulation available, I'd like to try with a Decker to rob the Matrix blind and buy my way through the game, possibly hitting the CHERNOBYL side quest in the process.

	"Second, I'll fully admit I can't quite tell what's happening in this game, but everything I'm seeing looks solid. There's some occasional weirdness with the movement, but at least some of that's explained by the game itself turning characters slowly. I can't help but think the movement could be executed a little tighter, though. There's also some 30hz A button mashing during fights, which is generally frowned upon as it's guaranteed to lose frames, but that's nowhere near a rejectable mistake on its own. Fixing these things can come in another version, should you decide to make one (please do!). What's here right now is definitely good enough.
