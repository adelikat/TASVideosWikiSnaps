	"World Games has 8 events. Scoring points in any event awards a medal, so the nature of the run becomes "get points ASAP and end the events also ASAP." The medals appear to be based on how many players are in the game. There's no "threshold" for bronze/silver/gold. We get points, we get golds since we're the only player in the game. Obtaining a medal in all events seems like a good win condition to me.

[div class=p 
	"This is an event about timing up and down presses to optimally lift and put down the weight. This event has some RNG to it. When you have the bar overhead you have to wait for the 3 lights to come on, at which point you're clear to put it down. The lights come on differently based on when you press the final up input, and funny enough it's faster to use the 80kg weight instead of the 75 for that reason as there was a frame way faster than anything else I found. After that we fail the rest and get to see the amusing facial expressions.

	"Here we control Skeletor as he attempts to get one over on He-Man by jumping over barrels in ice skates for some reason. You have to alternate Left and Right inputs, but on a cadence. They can't be spammed. After that we intentionally jump way too early to end the event sooner and watch as Skeletor falls through the ice.

[div class=p 
	"This is a typical Slalom event, where you can ignore the flags and just race down to the bottom since we get points just for finishing. You want to keep the skis pointing down as much as possible so you don't lose speed, and luckily there's a good line that only takes very minor adjustments. After this we fail the rest and move on.

	"Fed up with always being the underappreciated brother, we control Luigi as he tries to murder Mario by defeating him in the Mario Party Origin Story AKA the log roll and feeding him to sharks. You can roll the log in either direction and you speed up by alternating Left and Right presses. Unlike other events you can spam these inputs. We hold A to reverse direction and spam L/R to win in 0.4s of IGT for all 3 rounds. Using the reverse direction was the fastest.

	"Typical rodeo event. You stay on the bull for 8 seconds by holding directions based on what he's doing at the time. We pick the hardest bull because he will throw you off faster than the other bulls on the 2 rides that we fail and has faster animations in general.

[div class=p 
	"This is one of those "Strongman" style events where you have to flip a large and heavy log. We throw and flip one immediately by pressing right then holding and releasing A at the right time. After this we drop the log to fail twice and our character looks like a soccer player flopping for a yellow card because the log didn't fall anywhere near him and yet he still acts like he dropped it on his foot. Shameful.

	"For one reason or another you gain points in this event no matter what, so the idea is to finish as fast as possible. You can push your opponent out of the ring, knock him to the ground, let him do those things to you, or 30hz mash Left and wavedash yourself out of the ring. Mashing left was the fastest I found, and actually, if you keep mashing left you'll screen wrap and end up back in the ring (though you still lose.) I thought about including that but you don't lose until you stop so it's faster to just lose ASAP.
