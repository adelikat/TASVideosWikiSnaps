	"Okay.  Before I go into details, if you guys don't like this version of a Contra 3 No Kill Speed Run, this will be my last attempt.

	"TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION!!!:  I played the game on NORMAL with 3 lives.  Playing a no kill speed run on HARD skill is impossible.  I repeat:  It's impossible.  The enemy's ranged attacks go twice as fast compared to normal and they require to be killed for it to be a fluid speed run.  Actually, mostly everything needs to be killed to be a fluid speed run.  If you've played the game as much as I do, you would know what I meant.

	"The only enemies that I do kill are the ones in the way or on the mid/boss I'm trying to kill.

	"Okay.  Now that I got that off, I will go into details.

[p 
	"LEVEL 1:
	$LF
	"The randomness of enemies interferes on how fast you can defeat the two walls.  I tried my best to make due and no matter how many times I re-recorded from different spots, the same outcome came up.  Other than that, the level was completed pretty fluently.
	$LF

[p 
	"LEVEL 2:
	$LF
	"I'm not sure taking the broken bridge route is faster than what I did from my starting point.  I felt this was a good route to take when making this run.  The boss was beaten pretty fast too (around 2-3 seconds).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"LEVEL 3:
	$LF
	"The only thing that had "randomness" written on it was the Flying Mosquito Alien enemies.  Their appearances are at random and I had to dodge them as best as I could to make it seem fluid.  When re-recording, they seemed to give the most trouble.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"LEVEL 4:
	$LF
	"Nothing really troubling happened in this level.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"LEVEL 5:
	$LF
	"When you get the boss's health to mid-point (at least I think it's mid-point), he starts spinning.  On normal, it's a little hard to get your spinning just right because he spins faster than what you would if turning normal and slower than what you would do if you tapped turn twice (dang run-on sentence).  Other than that, it went pretty smooth.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"LEVEL 6:
	$LF
	"This went better than I expected it to be.  The bosses were beaten nicely... all except the end boss in it's first form.  His arms came out at (you guessed it) random.  I did what I could to make due.  Every time I re-tried, he either chased me around the screen, or came at me with both arms at once (like in the movie).  I took what I had because he didn't seem to pause long enough for me to kill him.
