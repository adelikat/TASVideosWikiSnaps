	"This TAS is literally perfect. It's unbeatable. It's a masterpiece. My greatest achievement. This is what peak TASing looks like. The creative clicks I make, the frame perfect menuing. The sheer vast amount of rerecords at display. That ABSOLUTELY FAST textbox skipping. The execution is flawless. This TAS should be put in an art museum, a hall of fame. A "truly remarkable" speedrun. It definitely cannot be improved any further. That is all I have to say. Like, subscribe and hit that bell for more content like this one, thanks for watching. RIP Aunt Artic  she will be missed.

	": I watched this TAS with a few of my aunts in order to get in the mood to judge it, and I have to say it was a miserable experience. My Aunt Hill mostly just kept talking about her house being infested, my Auntie Flag just kept talking about her punk band, and my Aunt Endec didn't even show up because she's busy presenting every show in Britain and being
