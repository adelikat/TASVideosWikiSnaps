	"In the PSX version of Warcraft II, the game includes both the original and the expansion, and instead just goes under the single title "The Dark Saga". This means up to four potential runs could be made for this game, with this particular one completing the original 14 Human levels.  Full details of the game can be found at

	"The awkward thing here is that neither ship nor land units can be finished significantly faster than the other, which means that a high degree of efficiency is required for both.  Not only that, but when it comes to the matter of destroying coast units, we need both groups to participate.  Ideally we would just simply end with the coast units, eliminating any potential problems caused 
	$LF
	"with timing; but with our current strat that is not an option.  Our ships need to clear out the coast quite early, but not get tangled up there for so long that they forget the rest of their duties.  They'll need to go back for the oil rig at some point, while still remembering to leave just the right amount of work behind for land units to do.  Trying to plan ahead like this is always frustrating, taking many versions and tedious calculations to make sure that all sections have a perfectly synchronized ending.  Anything short of that, is not optimal.

Evasive manoeuvers will safeguard your sea units, while micromanagement

Ballistas which move so slow you'd think they do it just to annoy me.  Ballistas which take ages to train, which is particularly bad when the enemy base
	$LF
	"happens to be at the opposite corner of the map.  That means that a lot of time gets consumed, resulting in the attack being done by a rather petite army.  It's so small in fact that there's barely enough to go around, and so the secondary attacks up north needed a helping hand from a brave peasant.

Just getting a few of the major buildings out of our way is good enough, then we're free to leave the rest in peace.  The remaining buildings here will pose no threat whatsoever, since our quick invasion has left the owner completely bankrupt.  Once that's done, it's time to retire our troops.  Like so many units before them, their usefulness expires pretty quickly.  The main attack is done only with sea units, and so might

	"One of the very rare times where RNG manipulation was heavily factored here.  You can probably imagine, that when there's 20 units attacking many times a second, trying to manipulate each of them to do maximum damage values is obviously not gonna happen.  But on the other hand, with only a few slow ships to control, good RNG can make a far more significant difference.  It can reduce the number of hits needed to sink a Destroyer from 2 to 1, highly necessary to get such a good time on this level.

	"A huge army is only useful if we have enough farm room for more peasants; which we don't.  This means we need to sacrifice loads in order to proceed, which is quite easy here.  Even when trying to keep them alive, it's still quite a struggle against the combined forces of both the orange and the black clans.  No need to destroy their bases fully though, since the only clan who bothers to actually attack us in the future is White, with dragons.  But as explained in the previous submission, patrol patterns of flying creatures are too chaotic to control.  They basically change after each command given to any unit, and thus create a nightmare when trying to plan ahead, hence the occasional odd positioning of our defence team.  How to handle the offense though?  Well we need to create a brand new army from scratch, and might as well create one which doesn't require building multiple shipyards and transports to get them to where they're needed.  It looks like we need to take to the skies.  Traditionally creatures have a Fight or Flight response, but I say why not do both?  Sending in a horde of gryphons across the main map ends up being faster, and requires only one sacrifice near the end to keep the last pack of dragons away from the main group.
