	"Trivial Pursuit: Genus Edition is a 1992 Sega Master System version of the board game developed by Teque London and published by Domark. This supports four different languages and was a European exclusive. The goal is to answer a question correctly on each wedge on the outer wheel and return to the center. Victory is achieved when a question is answered correctly at the center while having all of the wedges. Most likely due to technical limitations and multiple languages, the answers are confirmed via a trust system. This makes a bit more sense if you're actually playing with other people at the same time but at the same time players could also just lie to the game.

Thankfully there are two roll again spaces between each wedge at 2 & 5 spaces away, respectively. That generally means that it takes an initial 6 roll to a wedge, a combination 2-5 or 5-2 to each wedge, and a 6 back to the center.

	"As the board is bigger than the screen there's waits on the camera to scroll around. For the initial roll of 6 it's faster to go with the first option available to avoid extra screen scrolling. When moving between wedges it's important to choose the order of the 2 & 5 rolls to minimize camera movement.

The length of each question is variable depending on the amount of text to display, as the host "talks" out the text, as well as any possible elements such as graphs or music that need to be shown off. This means that getting questions that can be answered quicker is important. This is mostly relevant to the last question as the fastest overall question is selected.

Obviously, nothing look out of place...just getting right to the fastest known strats to get this over quickly.  In fact, this run is about 1 minute and 40 seconds faster than the WR. Good job.
