	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Shortly after submitting my v1 of this category, a lot of significant time saves were found(namely in different types of applications of the phantom grab glitch) which I felt merited an immediate salty run-back. Also, through the use of an LUA script made by Pasky13 and edited by FractalFusion, I was able to do a much better job this time around of manipulating RNG, reducing lag, and optimizing movement.

]h4
[ul 
	[li 
		" Phantom grab - Collecting an item with a boomerang on the same frame that a miscellaneous object (life energy, weapon energy, extra lives, hearts, e-tanks, floating platforms, boss doors) spawns will cause the object to replace the collected item inside the boomerang. This was utilized in this run a total of 11 times to change the route, skip a boss, achieve flight, and expedite the collection of the majority of items required for obtaining the hadouken.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Ice sled zip - Positioning X to be inside of an ice sled will zip X out of the way when the sled manifests. This can be used to bypass camera scroll triggers as well as zip through walls.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Charging during projectile travel time - Creating distance between X and a boss before you fire an uncharged shot allows you to gain a head start on your next charge equal to the projectile's travel time. This makes some pattern of alternating between charged and uncharged shots the fastest way to kill the majority of bosses in the SNES X games, although it was only used on 3 bosses in this run.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Luck manipulation - Creating a dust sprite by sliding down a wall and killing an enemy are the only two ways to consistently advance the rng sequence by two values on one frame. These are the two primary methods of luck manipulation in the SNES Mega Man X games, with delaying movement for one or more frames being used as a last resort.

		" Platform flight movement is extremely difficult to optimize since you have to move X in such a way that causes the boomerang to take as direct a path as possible from point A to point B. The first line I took was from where I grabbed the platform to a point in space that just dodges a trigger which causes the clouds in the background to move (this is very important for reducing lag later on). The second path I take is from there to point in space which dodges a trigger that spawns the second set of platforms in the stage and allows me to spawn the e-tank first instead. This is very important because as you take the platform from the first section with you, the 10 platforms from that section continue to occupy 10/16 miscellaneous data slots in the game's active memory for as long as that one platform remains on screen. If you take a direct route to the e-tank, you will spawn the 2nd set of platforms beforehand and there will be no vacancy for the e-tank to occupy, thus preventing it from being able to spawn. After I fly over this trigger, I can proceed to pick up the e-tank then continue to the helmet capsule.

		" I make sure the platform platform does not touch the barrier leading to helmet capsule room in order to preserve the boomerang so I can use the platform to push me up into the capsule during Dr. Light's dialogue. You are still limited by certain factors during this trick, such as inputs not being able to register during capsule sequences (even to advance text), and the camera lock not releasing until Dr. Light's hologram has faded completely. Nevertheless, this still saves a little over 2 seconds. Also, this is the part where it is crucial that the clouds in the background are not moving (even though you can't see them), otherwise lag would negate the time save and then some. Credit goes to Parrot14green for finding out this trick was possible and ColonelFatso for telling how to dodge the cloud trigger to make it save time.

The steps to do this trick are as follows: kill the highest turret on the right wall of the climb before Kuwanger (to allow it to respawn later), phantom grab Kuwanger's door close enough to his room so that you can the camera lock is close enough to spawn him, respawn the aforementioned turret, spawn Kuwanger (causing you to lose control of X), fall onto the turret and take damage to regain control of X, fall down and grab the ladder at the base of the climb to release the camera lock set in place by the phantom grab, do a midair jump after Kuwanger's health fills, use the midair doors to do fast back and fourth wall kicks and a platform jump, proceed through Kuwanger's room as the game checks to see he is nowhere in sight and destroys the exit door. After all is said and done this skip saves 1 second over hadoukening him and sitting through the boss explosion like normal, which means it will save 10 seconds in an any% TAS.

		" I am not completely sure that this is how this works, but I believe having very specific subpixel values as you approach the bottom of a ladder gap can allow you to wall jump off the inside of it before X even appears to be high enough to do so. This would presumably be as low of a y-axis value (numerically) as possible, and as high of an x-axis sub pixel value as possible if you are facing the right wall of the gap or as low as possible if you are facing the left wall. These are extremely difficult to pull off (I was only able to do it in a few ladders), and I can't even confirm for sure that they would guarantee a frame save since they just give you a slightly higher average vertical velocity for 4 specific frames and would probably require inhibition of prior movement to set up in most cases, but I do believe these have potential for time save in some cases.

		" RNG manipulation in this run is very difficult at certain points, and depending on what kind of cards you are dealt, compromises may have to be made. A separate run of would likely be able to manipulate optimal boss patterns and phantom grab drops in places where this run could not, but equally likely to fall short in places where I lucked out in this run. Places where I had to settle for sub-optimal rng or resort to delaying my movement to obtain optimal RNG were the Spark Mandril boss fight, Armadillo e-tank phantom grab, Octopus heart Utuboros explosion (he gave me a lot of lag-enducing drops which I could not avoid), 2nd Vile encounter, Bospider, Rangda Bangda, Chameleon refight, Velguarder, and Velguarder Sigma. I did not lose more than a few frames on each of these (besides the Octopus heart), so overall I thought RNG manipulation worked out really well for the most part in this run.

		" Boomerang trajectory on Eagle's stage during the platform flight is very difficult to optimize, so I think more frames could definitely be saved here if slightly more direct paths could be taken, especially since dodging the 2nd platform section trigger to allow the e-tank to spawn seems so random. Also it was very difficult to find a balance of making the boomerang take a direct path in the capsule room, but still arcing down low enough to later be manipulated to change directions twice and go far enough right to push X into the capsule, so I think this could be more optimized as well.

		" FractalFusion: everything from customizing an LUA script for me to use, manipulating Vile's RNG, discovering and showing me a myriad of time savers which weren't present in my v1, watching my stream pretty much every time I was working on the TAS to give me pointers and answer any questions I could come up with, to encoding the finished run, FractalFusion was equally invested and instrumental in making this TAS be as big of an improvement as possible over the published run as I was. The vast majority of the 35 seconds saved from v1 to v2 can be attributed primarily to Fractal's assistance with v2.
