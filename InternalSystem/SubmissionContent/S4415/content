Better RNG manipulation, movement optimizations, and new time-saving strategies are included throughout.  As for the current publication by Jesus Fan, this run obsoletes it by 26,165 frames (20,110 in-game & 6,055 from correct ending input).

	"The game's main plot requires your party to visit the various dungeons scattered throughout the Valley in search of allies to trade with.  You're intended to explore these locations in a lineal order to advance the story.  One of these locations in particular, the Swamps, can be skipped entirely.  Possibly due to another programming oversight, the passageway leading into the swamps is scrawled with an illustration of a door combination, which gives your party access to the game's next location:  the Azcan Jungle.  This makes the Swamps an entirely unnecessary area to visit, as you only need to approach this doorway in the Beastman Caves, receive the confirmation message, and backtrack your way out.

[div class=p 
	"Throughout Warriors of the Eternal Sun, there are a series of 'fixed' overworld fight encounters as you progress through the story.  Due to sequence breaking, the only one you're technically required to fight occurs during the trek through the Azcan Jungle, where a squad of Azcan Warriors ambush your party upon climbing the pyramid steps to raid their Temple.  To skip this storyline battle -- and any overworld battle in game -- all you do is simply enter camp and SAVE & re-LOAD as the enemies become visible on screen.  This can easily be done in real-time. After the game reloads, any monsters on screen will vanish, and the event flag for fixed battles will be completed (such enemies won't respawn).

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"This one is a tad tough to explain, and is still a bit of a mystery to me.  The game's second major dungeon, the Azcan Temple, contains multiple floors littered about with fixed traps.  Some of these traps are capable of inflicting upwards of 3-6 damage per shot, which would decimate any real-time party attempting to power their way through.  The Thief class, however, is able to disarm these traps -- provided the RNG is favorable during the particular frame you land on a trap's tile.  
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"This is where my WIP was at a frustrating sticking point.  In my cancelled run, my Thief was able to easily disarm traps by simply waiting for the right frame until a successful disarm could occur.  As most TASers can relate, this meant "burning through" frames until you could manipulate the outcome you wanted.  However, I was perplexed to discover that, during the making of my new run, the Thief had lost this ability to luck manipulate traps.  No amount of waiting or "burning frames" produced a different trap result.  The only way the RNG would change was if myself or an enemy took damage in combat, which is unacceptable for any speed run.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The solution to this problem was even more perplexing.  During the last portion of the Beastman Caves, you have to rush past a horde of Troglodytes in order to backtrack your way out.  Once past them, if the last Troglodyte happens to attack and miss you -- BAM! -- your Thief now suddenly has the ability to easily manipulate traps again.  Not entirely sure why this is the case (perhaps enemy misses add to a memory value in the RAM, granting this ability??).

	"Those with a critical eye will notice two things during my treks through the overworld: the occasional group of monsters that appear and give chase, and how my party will briefly turn away from their current direction while traveling; as if I made an error in movement.  The latter is due to manipulating random encounters from appearing, as these would force me into a battle.  The ones I allowed to appear didn't cause me to lose any time, so I left them in to provide more of an atmosphere during the run.

[div class=p 
	"This last trick is a bit ingenious and can also be performed in real-time.  Most enemies in WOTES's dungeons are programmed to be aggressive toward you as soon as you step into their attack range.  In particular, if you step into its range and then immediately back one step away, that enemy will most likely follow you in pursuit.  This can be exploited in open hallways by immediately turning to either side and backing away as soon as you come into range, as there is a small delay in the monster's movement.  During this delay, you can slip past through and avoid combat altogether.  Especially in the game's final dungeons, I use this trick a lot shave seconds off of my time.

While in dungeons, some monsters have a random chance of getting 'first strike' on you as soon as you step into their range.  Even using frame advance, you wouldn't be able to act first if a monster was programmed in this way.  Even though I had much better luck in this run, there were still a few instances where I had to manipulate a miss from monster groups due to them having 'first strike'.  A better manipulated run could easily save 3-5 seconds if such manipulations were done perfectly.

Friend and foes alike were sucked up and taken into this void.  On the other side, the Duke's Castle and its inhabitants mysteriously found themselves deposited within a hollow valley, securely guarded by impossibly high cliffs illuminated by a flaring red sun, overhead.
