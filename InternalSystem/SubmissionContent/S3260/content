	"As stated before in the 
	[a href=/1593S 
		"previous submission
	]a
	", the goal of this run is to complete as many levels as possible only being permitted small Mario - Yoshi is also prohibited. This run differs from other Super Mario World runs, mainly because it lacks the use of the feather powerup. The use of this powerup may make the run look boring, because it seems like just a "fly-over-the-level" run (I'm not saying all movies do this. Many Super Mario World runs here are extraordinary and entertaining, even with a cape). Being restriced as small Mario, it takes a lot more planning and better execution, as flying isn't the solution to your problems. The amount of exits which only requires straight 49 hopping decreases heavily in this run, as many exits give Mario a challenge that he must overcome through many of these exits.

In the 2nd room, rather than waiting for the 2nd magikoopa to spawn, I am able to use the 1st one that spawns, giving me a big lead. Sliding down the escalator saves an additional frame. I also improved Larry's battle.

	"Although many people gave me support throughout the entire run, making sure that I would stay on task to finish this, as well as throwing in a thought of an improvement in or two (such as bahamete, Kaizoman666, MRO314), only two deserve a great thanks, because they have devoted some of their time to help improve this run. I would like to thank Dawn because he himself was involved in the early stages in this project, such as helping me when I struggled. I would also like to thank DJSecret for helping me submit this run. Without him, I wouldn't have managed to get all the comparisons needed for this movie (even though I did run the comparison script, half the time it would glitch out, so we would manually need to find out how much time I saved). He spent a lot of time on this and it is greatly appreciated.
