[p 
	"A big part of the run is RNG manipulation. The formula is RNG(x) = floor(20.5x)&0x7fff + (x%2)*0x8000. RNG only changes when necessary in battle which means that I have to manipulate before the battle. The initial seed depends of the frame you enter the frame so I just wait until I get a good seed.

	"To me, the movie was not extremely entertaining but I feel I am a little biased in that regard due to my personal history with the game. There isn't too much flashy, but there are some clever moments here and there and some good movement when it comes to avoiding encounters. The game is extremely popular and the movie got all but one yes vote, leading me to believe I am the outliar in this case.
