	"Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle challenges players to collect all carrots in labyrinth-style levels while avoiding enemies. When I started working on this TAS, over a year ago, I thought the game's grid-based system would be ideal for Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) optimization, with carrots acting as nodes to visit in the most efficient order.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) involves finding the shortest route to visit a set of nodes. Levels were translated into graph representations with carrots as nodes and paths as edges, weighted based on movement cost. Using the Concorde TSP Solver, potential optimal routes for each level were calculated. Unfortunately, enemy placements and movements introduce so much complexity to the problem so I tried branch-and-bound to dynamically adjust paths when enemies interfered, with limited success.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"On some levels, enemy manipulation was used to finish the level faster. Enemies react to player input when their respective address 0x433, 0x473, 0x493, 0x4b3, 0x4d3, 0x4f3 goes from 0xf to 0x0 (The enemy with address 0x453 can't be manipulated at all). This is used in some levels to make the enemies get out of the way or make them be killed faster. Button can be pressed even when we're waiting for Bugs to climbing stairs. Unfortunately, this can't be done often because most of the frames are lag frames. When there are a lot of enemies, killing them reduce the amount of lag in the game.

	(__wikiLink|displaytext=test TAS|href=/Forum/Topics/20265)
	"! Yet, for 11 levels, no better routes than those in his TAS could be computed. I've cleaned up and synced those levels and used them as is in the TAS. These levels are mostly at the end where the enemy count is high. Most of the time save comes from better routing. Comparing both TAS, there is less of no inputs periods for enemies to get out of the way.
