	"The Adventures of Pinocchio (not to be confused with Disney’s Pinocchio) is an unreleased isometric puzzle game for the Gameboy, created by Bit Managers. At some point, a ROM of a prototype was leaked and made available to the public. Being a prototype, it has things you wouldn’t see on normal game releases, such as a level select (which was mistaken for a game end glitch), and effectively infinite lives (the lives counter doesn’t tick down if you die). This game actually was released in the form of another game: Otto's Ottifanten - Baby Bruno's Nightmare. Although only your ears would know, as the only thing held over was the music, nearly everything else was changed. Interesting tidbit about the “finished” game, it also has a level select, but it’s locked behind a password. More reason that the game end glitch movie was invalid.

	"Movement is fairly simple, pressing a directional goes one unit one direction, while 2 adjacent directionals pressed (eg, Up/Left) will go both those directions for one unit for each direction. Which yes, this means that 1 Up press then 1 Left press is equal to 1 Up/Left press. For this reason, diagonal movement is heavily used throughout the run.

[div class=p 
	"Jumping is fairly simple, yet very broken. You’ll always jump the same height no matter what, and the game doesn’t have any concept of acceleration, so there isn’t any way to jump further. Yet, many puzzles can be solved in unintended ways with precise jumps. As a note, jumping will always cause 1 extra frame of lag, so it is best to minimize them. As another note, it is best to jump as soon as possible, as you’ll often want to land as quickly as possible.

This glitch is first apparent in room 13, where I effectively skip most of the room with this glitch. Unfortunately, you still need to be actually on the ground in order to clear a room, you can’t corner exit in the air, which does limit this glitch a bit.

	"There isn’t really much else to explain, the movie pretty much explains the rest. As a minor note, the game doesn’t automatically switch music when going to the castle levels, I could pause/unpause the game to force it to use the new music, but I get an extra life after clearing the first castle room, which restarts the music, which gives the new music. This game is probably Vault anyways, so this is probably the better choice. As another note, the credits don’t exactly display correctly; this is an emulator bug, and is fixed in 2.5 (which the movie  syncs fine on).

Even if this game is considered to be "better" by people, that's still a subjective category, and we can't rely on subjectivity in Vault. Which game is better, and which game allows for a better TAS, is really a Moon concern, not Vault. In Moons we endorse subjectivity and rely on it, we in Moons we pick better games and movies. This game is too boring for Moons.

	" back then, which for those of you who don't know was the original name for our default publication class that people claim is called Standard when it actually doesn't have a name but everyone still calls it Standard despite all of my protesting. Vault was much more restrictive back then, there were a lot of weird arbitrary rules that had piled up over the 9-ish years it was in place and it wasn't getting any easier to deal with, so we overhauled it to be a lot more open back in August 2021.

	"One part of it, mentioned in the earlier judgement, was a strict "50% unique" rule that determined whether or not some runs were "worth" publishing, in that we had always aimed for quality over quantity and figured that the best way to enforce that was to turn away perfectly good runs for maybe being a little bit too similar for our liking. Keep in mind that this decision was reached by the same site that, at one point, had two separate low% TASes and three separate any% TASes for Super Metroid. Let's just say consistency really wasn't the site's strong suit in the past. Determinism is for TASes, not logic.

Obvious things like graphics aside, the two games play and feel so different that I wouldn't blame anyone for thinking they were both released games that just happened to reuse assets. Really, Bit Managers were just trailblazers for modern online marketplaces. If only there was a Game Boy equivalent of the Unity store.
