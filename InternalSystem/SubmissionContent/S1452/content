	"The old run has much more variety, never stands still when people are lying down but sets up a combo, makes enemies hit each other (or themselves), a cool multiple jumpkick combo, and the everpresent Trashcan of Judgement.

	"A new movie which combines the best of these two runs would be very publishable. Don't be afraid to sacrifice more time for cool tricks.
