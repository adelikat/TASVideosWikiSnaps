	"This is a 2 Player River city ransom run. ~50 seconds faster than the current run by Sleepz done on famtasia. This movie distributes a glitch and uses it to its fullest.

	"What got me to attempt this run is noticing that you can skip Moose and still be able to enter the school.

	"The glitch was discovered by Nitsuja. While trying to run and holding the opposite direction, weird things happen. Such as death. I use this to Eliminate lag where it is necessary, like rooms when I don't have to fight.

	"I also use this Glitch to go through a wall.
	$LF

[p 
	"I lose many frames by picking 2 player due to Lag. I lose alot at the Twin fight for example, because of 4 characters on screen at once.

	": Many people have been opposed to this version obsoleting our old one. I went back and rewatched the old run and could only agree.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The old run has much more variety, never stands still when people are lying down but sets up a combo, makes enemies hit each other (or themselves), a cool multiple jumpkick combo, and the everpresent Trashcan of Judgement.
	$LF

[p 
	"This run has some cool tricks too: dying for no reason, throwing the other over the wall, using the other player as a weapon.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"A new movie which combines the best of these two runs would be very publishable. Don't be afraid to sacrifice more time for cool tricks.
