	"Used the boss of the previous act to gain slope glitch, and bounced the signpost to obtain a lightning shield. The latter is crucial for this route, as Tails cannot follow Sonic on this route: CPU Tails despawns when off-screen with slope glitch. The speed of climbing at the end is irrelevant as long as you don't die.

	"Yes, as it turns out, this zip is possible for Sonic -- it requires entering it at perfect pixel position with near zero speed. I had previously tried only with positions attainable within the wall (trying all subpixels), and thought it was impossible; Aglar proved me wrong. The needed flame shield was nabbed after the boss, and used to setup object positions on next act.

	"The Tails route can't be followed by Sonic, so we had to improvise a bit. The two characters can then team up to descend faster and setup a zip left, which locks the screen further left for the cut-scene. The idea of going through the drill came about by watching Amy do it in WST's TAS.

Ditched the lightning shield for invulnerability frames, in order to get a frame-perfect kill at the boss. Used Orkal's trick to break the level transition and die with the timer stopped.
