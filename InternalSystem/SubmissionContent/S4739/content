	" Some Information
	$LF
]h3
[ul 
	[li 
		" Psynergy: or just Magic. Can be used in battle to fight enemy/help ally, and some can used in map to solve puzzle. Most Psynergy have a constant damaging power, and so will not effect by low level casters.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Summon: Powerful moves that deals damage depends on target's maximum HP, but requires Djinni's to cast.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Djinni: Collectible object in Golden Sun, which can "Set" to characters to improve their status, or "Stanby" to cast Summon. Also when it is Set on a character, it can be used to cast some unique effect in battle.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" RNG: Golden Sun have two kind of RNG, first one is used to decide enemy moves, damage variation, and first attack/be first attacked. This RNG changed when someone's action is executed, and is only manipulable by change the action of player. In this description I call it "Battle RNG". Second RNG is used more widely, decide how the encounter is process, result of escape, target of enemy move, and even those particle effects. This RNG can be manipulated in several ways, such as casting Psynergy in map, or select a move and cancel it in battle. Summons that cause particles emitting can also use to manipulate this RNG ans Summon's animation can be skipped. This RNG is called Normal RNG.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Ellement: There have 4 elements in game, Venus(Ground),Mars(Fire),Jupiter(Wind) and Mercury(Water). All enemies have atleast one weakness, let moves have the element of that type deals extra damage.
		$LF
	]li

[h3 
	" Glitches Used
	$LF
]h3
[ul 
	[li 
		" Retreat Glitch: Triggered by casting "Retreat" through shortcut while Isaac have less than 6 EP (or PP in english version). This will make the map id stored in memory change into the map id that Isaac will teleported when Retreat is cast successfully. This can have two ways to use, and both are used in movie:
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" Save&Load: Save the game while the glitch will cause Isaac warp into the wrong position. It is because when saving, wrong map id will saved with the current x,y position, so when load the game, Isaac will warp into the x,y position at the map id where he should at.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				" Warp by entrance: go through doors when retreat glitch is triggered will cause the destination of entrance glitched, let him warp into some unexpected positions. This probably caused by door id map is depends on the map id, so when map id is glitched, door id is also glitched.
				$LF
			]li
		]ul
		" Climb Glitch: When Isaac is attempting to climb a ladder (or anything he can climb), there have 1F that allow player to open a menu before he start climb. This will cause player able to save the game while he is climb on a ladder, which will cause Isaac's z-position glitched, let him able to interact with some object that is at higher position than him. In this run, this glitch is only used at Altin Peak, to avoid lengthy animation from played.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[h3 
	" Tricks Used
	$LF
]h3
[ul 
	[li 
		" Return to sanctum: Hold L and Start while load a game will let Isaac warp into the sanctum in last city he visit. This can let him leave the dungeons quickly. Used a lot in the run to save time.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Short Saving: In this game, the saving process cost about 52-54 frames (depends on where Isaac are). But the saving can be abort by reseting at around 20 frames after the dialogue is appear, to save around 30F per save. At this point, data about flags, status, Djinni and other information about system is saved, but the data relate to Isaac's position will lost. So Loading these data will force you to do "Return to sanctum" trick.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Force first attack: When game is hard resetted, Battle RNG will reset to 0. This will cause the first battle after the reset always become a firs attack, let player escape the battle at 100% success rate. This is used a lot at late of movie, as at that point the probability of escape is near to 0.
		$LF
	]li

	" Djinni Strategy
	$LF
]h3
[ul 
	[li 
		" There have total 28 Djinni in this game, 7 in each element. In this run, Djinni is very important as it is essential to use Summon. Each element have 4 Summons, cost 1-4 Djinnis to cast respectively. As the LV4 Summons are very strong (cost 4 Djinni), I obtained first 4 Djinnis to let it is castable early. 
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" Then, there have a Venus Djinni name Ground that can disable an enemy for one move, which is also essential in this run, so we will have 5 Venus Djinni.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				" For Mars Djinni, there have Flash, which can cast to reduce all damage taken to all party members by 90%, which is also essential in this run, so we will have 5 Mars Djinni.
