	": This movie does not sync for other people, and runs into the same desync for everyone. The reason seems to be due to error by the author. The author replaced their Dolphin exe with a different version, likely being the cause for why this movie does not sync for others. Regardless of the reason still, since this movie does not sync for other people, it cannot be accepted.
