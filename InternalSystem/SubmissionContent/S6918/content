	"I got re-involved in this TAS, because I was annoyed that it appeared to have unaddressed lag. I started shortly after it was published 3 years ago and made the discovery, a few months later, that it was more unoptimal than I thought. So, here I am again trying to put a bullet in this game so that I never have to come back to it again. Why? I'm not a fan of this version, like I am the original arcade. But...I have OCD problems and I need to correct it. :)

	"Q-Bert 3 came from the concept of the classic arcade game. Even though this game is classified as a puzzle, it had action qualities as well.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"The object of the game is to change the color of each cube to the designated color, noted at the top of the screen. As the game progresses, the coloring patterns change.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"During the quest of completing each screen, enemy avoidance is necessary to stay alive. The basic concept of identifying enemies, would be to note their color...which Q-bert 3 veers a bit from. Basically, Purple and Red (Coily, the purple snake, Ugg and Wrong way are bad...with the exception of red fruit. With Q-bert 3, the addition of new enemies include non-purple/red enemies...such as the Frog (which follows you around slowly), Pipes (which shoots tiny red balls) , Hats (which bounce back and forward in a defined/static pattern), and purple kisses (which move around in a defined pattern and then drop off of the cubes).
