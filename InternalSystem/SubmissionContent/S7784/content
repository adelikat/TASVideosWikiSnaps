		" Since I sometimes had to wait several frames to get a perfect seed or question, I was able to "add" those extra frames to earlier parts of the run without losing overall time. So you'll notice I sometimes spell out family names instead of selecting just a single letter. The player-1 family is the ABBA family, and there is a WAX family at some point. I also would sometimes linger on an question/answer longer so that a viewer might get more time to read them, although things still go by so fast it doesn't help much.

	"It's a lovely feeling when you come out of judging a run with all of the questions you had about it answered. "Why are two players used?" Because it takes a LONG time for the CPU intros and second player has no other impact on the run whatsoever. "Why are full names typed out?" Because it does take a lot more time to process shortened answers than it does to type out full ones. "What's with the category?" The game automatically kicks you out once you make it to $20k, providing a natural endpoint for the run. "How much time would repeated questions save?" I'd say it's negligible, probably only a couple seconds, and it's an acceptable entertainment tradeoff anyway. Speaking of acceptable, this run sure is! I'm going to do that!
