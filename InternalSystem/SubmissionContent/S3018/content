	"This TAS gets all disks, sub-tanks and all Ex-Skills (100%), it also gets a special rank when the final stage ends (Disk Capturer) and unlocks Ultimate Mode afterwards.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Each stage has 10 disks and the Resistance Base has 20 disks, giving a total of 180 disks. In difference between the other Zero Series Games (Z1 and Z2), getting 100% requires going back to the other stage because of some pre-requisites, wich is why i choosed this game instead.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Why I did such TAS? Because I thought this TAS is a realy good challenge to do, it involves some difficulty to get disks and don't loose any frame/time becuase some disks are in a really odd position. And about the weapons, some disks or enemies drops them, but using slashing attacks delays the drop, because the enemy/box does an slashing animation and then drops them, making me loose time. But in other cases, like Charged Saber or Recoil Rod makes them drop the disk instantly.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"How To Get Disks? Some are in an specific position, some are in an specific boxes you have to destroy first, and some requires killing one type of enemy an specific number of times and the last drops them (the type of enemy depends on the mission).

]div
[div class=p 
	"About the Disks on the Resistance Base, some disks requires certain bosses to be beaten first, but when certain bosses are beaten, some disks are lost, thus making 100% impossible, this is why i divided the disk collection in 3 separate runs.

[div class=p 
	"About the Ex-Skills, it requires Zero to be Rank A or S in the previous mission, wich is calculated with the performance in the stage. I had to be sure that i get one of these 2 Ranks before ending the mission calculating it myself using a Excel [dead link removed].
