	"The main strategy on the TAS to save time is damaging through hazards, you can only take damage 4 times before dying, tho in some levels there's health pick ups, you refill your health between screens.
	$LF
	"Between levels, there's a score screen that counts down each point individually, so it's important to minimize the score gain when possible, you gain score by killing enemies and collecting crystals and gold bars.

	": During the first part of this run, you must have been extremely frustrated that you couldn't get ahead of the best speed-runs that I could find. During my analysis, I used 
	(youtube|v=QQ2EaIVJs_A)
	" to compare your TAS against. For the first 4+ minutes, I saw how you would get ahead and then get synced back up with the human run. This only happened because of the globally timer that the "Swing Ropes" ran on. This is unfortunate, but everything is ok. Later on, you finally caught a break and started accelerating past the human effort. Once that occurred, it was no looking back. I see that this is a really well done run and I enjoyed watching a lot. Thanks.
