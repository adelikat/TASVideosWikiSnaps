	"Sonic Wings is a basic vertical scrolling shmup with 7 stages, once stage 7 is completed, the game will loop; where enemy patterns and aggressiveness are heightened. There are 8 playable ships in the game, I use Tee-Bee/JAS 39- as it's the highest scoring ship in the game.

	"Power-ups are the last item type, you have 4 power levels in the game, so collecting 3 power ups puts you at max power. But there's a twist! When you're at max power, you have a limited supply of ammo before you drop down to Level 3. For Tee-Bee, this amount is 1,800 Ammo. Every tap of fire uses 20 ammo, but mashing the button uses more (but spams more secondary shots for higher damage).

[div class=p 
	"When you collect a power up at Level 4, you are awarded 2,000 points and the ammo will reset back to 1,800. So it's pivotal to stay max power for as long as possible, conserving the ammo the game gives you.

Not everything is killable, so I make do with what my slow ass, huge hitbox ship can do.
