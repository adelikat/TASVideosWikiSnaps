	"This is one of my more exciting submissions, as I refused to submit this game over the past 22 months. I started back in March 2021, and found myself in a delima. Should I submit a movie that almost resembles a human run, or wait until I find something substantial?

	"On the 6th of January, 2023...I found what I was looking for! The details below, describe the biggest items that I focused on...which includes a glitch that made all the difference.  With all the techniques I discovered, I ended up beating the WR by about 7 seconds.

[div class=p 
	"My first concern, was a choice in routing. I saw two speed-runs that were about 2 seconds apart. One entered the camp from the left side, and the other from the right. I ended up going to the right, because of a glitch (which is explained below) that made the left side completely obsolete. This choice of routing allowed me to pull off this glitch twice, before moving on to the second part of the mission.

[div class=p 
	"I discovered, that the use of LEFT + RIGHT, causes Rambo to start cycling through different animations from enemies and objects. At first, I didn't see use for it, until it happened randomly (from changing inputs) at specific locations on the screen. At first, I didn't know what was causing it, but the result was something that I couldn't resist using. Basically, it was a "Zip"...where it could only be done when walking left and when the screen starts to scroll. At the first frame of screen movement, you can execute a LEFT + RIGHT and hold it until you travel a desired distance. Once I got this situated out, this made all the difference for finalizing my work and submitting. In this movie, it is executed 3 times.

	"This was the biggest problem I faced, over the past 22 months. Basically, my run was slower than the WR...because the prisoners randomly exited the cage. This behavior couldn't be controlled directly, since it was determined at the start of the game. Because of the long walk to the right side of the screen, it was evident that this is not going to help in cutting time. When I discovered the "zip glitch", another idea came about...zip past the cage and push the screen to the left so that the walk is shortened.  Well, this worked out amazingly and gave me the cuts that I was looking for over the human WR. Plus, I didn't have to worry about the predetermined RNG of their exit...since they would pop out faster as each prisoner dissappeared to the right.

	"I have come to love lag reduction. It is one of my favorite tasks in any game. Super Metroid was heavily laden with lag and gave me enough skill to carry on to other games. Most of my games don't have this level of lag intensity, but Rambo showed a fair amount of it. In fact, I made a final decision to run through the entire game one last time to remove 68 frames of unaddressed lag. As it stands, I don't see one frame of lag, until the helicopter fight scene...which seems to be unavoidable.
