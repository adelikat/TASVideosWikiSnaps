	". After comparing, I noticed that you were able to get ahead by eliminating a lot of enemy encounters...just by controlling RNG. At first, I was thinking, "What is the point of this game?"...until I realized that you were preventing their spawning. In  comparing this to the WR, it really blows away any human effort which apparently has a lot of deaths. Everything looks good here, and it syncs for me. Congratulations on the great work!
