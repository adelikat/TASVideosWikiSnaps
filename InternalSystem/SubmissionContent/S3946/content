	"You must exchange your money in bank to buy things here. You need needlework, bottle and gun. Gun isn't necessary for beating this game actually but I couldn't beat hang glider without it sadly. When you land 4th Island then trade bottle with old man and go west, trade needlework with people and get stone to enter mountain. Wander caves for some time then you'll be rich if old man doesn't come to steal your treasure.
