	"As for why I'm using this version, it's because of the greater accuracy (especially with sound emulation thanks to Blargg's DSP core).  It sounds like there's further work being done on the APU, so I may very well attempt an improvement in the future.

	": This movie starts from a save because you have to have played through a fair bit of the game and saved in order to access Special Mode.  I've made a verification movie that is a very rough play-through of normal mode. I've uploaded this to Mediafire at

	"A tip for fast-forwarding: go to Emulation->Settings and enable "Toggled fast-forward mode" so you don't have to keep holding down the button.

	"So why does this run play through the Japanese version's Special Mode instead of the US version's Professional Mode?  First, the US Normal Mode stages have already been TASed through the ActRaiser TAS that's available on this site at http://tasvideos.org/1747M.html. Second, the Japanese version is harder,
	$LF
	"so for those who've played the game it looks more impressive. Apart from there being differences between US Normal mode and Professional Mode, there are many differences between Professional Mode and Special Mode. Overall the differences between US Normal Mode and Special Mode are even greater than the differences between US Normal Mode and Professional Mode.
	$LF
	"Here's a (not neccessarily exhaustive) list from Sir VG:
	$LF
]div
[blockquote 
	"The general difference between Normal and Professional/Special Modes (pulled from my SDA Run): 
	[br 
	]br
	" 1. You start with the full 24 HP. 
	[br 
	]br
	"2. Magic is removed. 
	[br 
	]br
	" 3. Simulation Mode is removed. You just go from act to act.
	[br 
	]br
	"4. The initial 'statue inhabiting' animation has been removed form the startof the acts. You simply start the level right away.
	[br 
	]br
	"5. Enemy damage does 2 HP damage. Terrain damage still does just 1.
	[br 
	]br
	"6. Enemies that normally take 1 hit to kill now take 2. Multi-hit enemies don't take any more than before. Certain 'destructible terrain' like the floating skulls in Aitos Act I still only take 1 hit to kill.
	[br 
	]br
	"7. Certain enemies have a different pattern, though not very many.
	[br 
	]br
	"8. Magic Scrolls in the Acts have been replaced by Crushes.
	[br 
	]br
	"9. NO CONTINUES. You lose and it's game over.
	[br 
	]br
	"10. After an act is cleared, there is no life/time bonus. Your life gets refilled and you move on to the next level.
	[br 
	]br
	"11. Projectiles in Aitos Act I have been removed and replaced with a 1-UP. You still get them for the Tanzara battle.
	[br 
	]br
	"12. Ending is removed and you just go straight to the credits, with the final image changed from 'THE END' to 'YOU ARE THE BEST PLAYER!'
	[br 
	]br
	" 
	[br 
	]br
	"Differences between US Professional! mode and Japanese Special Mode (most of what I can think of offhand - this doesn't count religious references removed, since it was mainly in the simulation/creation section): 
	[br 
	]br
	"1. Changes in terrain in a few levels. Most noticeable in Filmoa Act I.
	[br 
	]br
	"2. A few location name changes (Fillmore vs Filmoa, Kasandora vs Casandra, Marahna vs Marana, and Deathheim vs Death heim).
	[br 
	]br
	"3. Filmoa Act II's music is the same as Act I.
	[br 
	]br
	"4. Some enemies take even MORE damage.
	[br 
	]br
	"5. Floating skulls in Aitos Act I can't be killed (they just self destruct). 
	[br 
	]br
	"6. Some boss attack changes (mainly faster, but Rafflasher in Marana Act I ducks in and out) 
	[br 
	]br
	"7. Timer stops after Satan Phase 1. Also, more lag during Phase 2 in the Japanese version.
	[br 
	]br
	"8. All spikes (except the small falling ones), unless you're in a temporary invulnerable state are INSTANT KILL. Also extra spikes in various locations (most noticeably in Filmoa Act II and Bloodpool Act II). 
	[br 
	]br
	"9. Less lives. US starts with 5, Japanese with 2.

	"I've also noticed some (subtle) changes in the AI.  For example, the Arctic Wyvern flies away about 10 frames sooner after shooting balls of ice.  In addition, some of the enemy hitboxes are slightly larger.

		"大根さん for uploading a Special Mode TAS to Nicovideo.  I picked up numerous little things from that run. This run improves on the Nicovideo run by about 27 seconds if one doesn't count the ten seconds or so of waiting in the Nicovideo run before Special Mode is finally selected. Note that the improvement would be somewhat greater (as much as a few seconds?) if it weren't for the greater lag in 1.53.

	"EDIT: Hotarubi has made a post in the ActRaiser thread with two SMVs: one containing a time saver for Bloodpool Act 2 and one that's a Special Mode TAS he made last year.  I want to implement the trick.  This will likely mean redoing the rest of the TAS due to changes to in luck.  I will also compare my TAS with his to see if there are any other timesavers.  I am therefore canceling this submission.  Given that I now have experience with TASing Special Mode, and it's summer, I can hopefully have a new submission ready by the end of August, but we'll see.
