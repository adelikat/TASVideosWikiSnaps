	"Go! Go! Tank is a game that totally makes sense. You play as a cartoonized airplane that has to fly back and forth transporting huge cement blocks in order for a cartoonized tank to walk freely his way toward the enemy base. Since the game is supposed to be played by childs, it features an extremely hard gameplay, with sloppy moving controls and microscopic hook hitbox. And no, it's no bootleg.

]h3
[p 
	"Since the goal is to finish the game fast, I'm doing all the extra work possible for making the tank to walk his way through faster. This merely consists in removing blocks that would block his path and putting them together in order to make him fall as few times as possible, since that momentanely stops his orizontal moving. Also note that the higher the fall, the more vertical momentum he will get.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This resulted in a lot of trickery in order to abuse the collision detection to the maximum, creating in every stage the best path possible, as of the time available for doing it before the tank clashes into a wall. Planning wasn't hard, but putting in pratice every construction project in time was often tricky, resulting in many

If you keep Up button, it will rise faster, and if you keep Down it will go down.
