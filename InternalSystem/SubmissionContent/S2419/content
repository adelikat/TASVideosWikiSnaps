	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"In this action/platformer game, you are a wimpy little creature guided by Gaia in an effort to reach Eden. You don't stay wimpy long, since after killing a few enemies and chowing down on their meat, you can evolve various parts to improve your capabilities whenever you like. Of course, along the way, plot happens, and the road to Eden is a little tougher than expected.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"For this run, our hero is in a hurry to reach Eden, and goes through a few hundred million years of Earth's history in about 40 minutes. Seems that he did his homework and knew exactly what to do. And likes to jump through each level, using poor creatures as stepping stones. Hey, all in the name of Eden!
	$LF

[p 
	"I'll talk about a few details in general here.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Evolution
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"In order to speed through places and beat stuff up in a timely manner, I need to evolve a few things. While there are many things that you can improve, this run focuses entirely on Agility and Strength, and Jumping is important as well. These three stats work together well since most of the things that add Agility also provides Jumping and Strength.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Whenever a Great Power gives you a new body, you revert to a rather weak form with none of the upgrades of your previous form, except size and neck length. When becoming a Mammal, even the size is lost. I seek a few ways to get around this shortcoming, generally involving crystals.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There are a few crystals that you can eat to temporarily transform yourself into something else. The required Red Crystal can pick a manta or an eel at random. The Green Crystals can transform you to an earlier, recorded form. I record my fish just before leaving Chapter 1 and use that to maul a boss, and record the amphibian to completely skip evolving Reptile parts.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"One primary reason for the whole detour to become the bird is that the higher potential speed and strength lets me get through battles faster. 12 Strength and 20 Agility manages to beat the time the detour takes, compared to the 8 Strength and 18 Agility the reptile can get. The flight just helps out even more.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Movement
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Seeing as a great deal of stuff depends on getting from point A to point B, you can imagine why I seek the fastest method. In order from fastest to slowest form of movement: Dash-Jump, dash, jump, walk. As a bird with enough Agility (more than 16, I believe), repeated tackles is slightly faster than dashing.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"To dash, double-tap in a direction. The direction you tapped is in 
	[tt 
		"0x7E074B
	]tt
	" and the timer is in 
	[tt 
		"0x7E074B
	]tt
	". When the timer is 12 or higher, you can't initiate a dash on your next tap, so you'll probably need to double-tap again. You can hold down one direction and walk in that direction and initiate a dash in another direction, which is done at times when I need motion away from something but still need to tackle it.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When you are currently in the middle of some action, the timer freezes. After you get out of your dash through whatever method, it is possible to initiate another dash with a single tap thanks to this timer.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Left+Right or Up+Down moves your creature up. That's fine while swimming or flying, but if you're standing on ground and hit Left+Right, you'll move up, off the ground, then have to wait as you land once more. Left+Right and Up+Down has proven useful on occasion, especially that part I mentioned where I need to move away yet still need to tackle.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The jumping mechanic is rather restrictive... You can either jump as high as you can, or make a short hop designed to drop down through certain platforms. There is no in between, short of reducing your jump stat. In all my jumps, I hit B for one single frame, and it's often max height. That limits the usefulness of jumps for precise maneuvers, but dash-jumping is still the fastest by quite a fair margin.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When I become a bird, I gain the power of flight. Although flying is slower than dash-jumping, flight allows for a few shortcuts and provides a much better method to tackle stuff. As well as stats, but that's another thing.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Offense
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"A quick overview of attack methods and the time they take for each repeat:
	$LF
]p
[pre 
	"Bite: 30 frames; uses Bite
	$LF
	"Tackle: 18 frames under optimal conditions; Uses Strength
	$LF
	"Bounce: Instant, but requires downward motion from jump; Uses HALF of Strength
	$LF
	"Horn: Instant, just dash; Uses Horn; Usually breaks after 3 hits
	$LF
	"Kick: Did not measure; Uses Kick
	$LF
	"Strike: Did not measure; Uses Strike
	$LF
]pre
[p 
	"There are quite a few methods you can use to pummel your enemies into submission. Of which, I primarily use one: Tackles. Strength pretty much goes up with Agility, so that's a plus. Then there's the fact they're faster than bites, another plus. Bosses, when still stunned from the last hit, are invincible, but if they didn't get pushed from your tackle, it's usually shorter than the 18 frames needed for your next tackle.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"However, tackles can push bosses around -- This motion extends their invincibility time. They need to come to a complete stop before they can recover from their stun. The three ways they will stop are when they:
	[br 
	]br
	"run out of momentum (slow)
	[br 
	]br
	"hit screen edge
	[br 
	]br
	"hit the ground when previously airborne
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Although I never let bites exceed one damage, it is fairly crucial in Chapter 2. As a fish, I can't bounce, so I need to stun enemies by bite. Just long enough that I can get through, hit-free. Then there's the boss bees, both of which needs a bite to bring them to the ground where I can then tackle them dead. Plus, bites can eat meat, too!
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Then there's bouncing. Has roughly zero use for speedy offense thanks to the jumping mechanic, but is freaking useful in avoiding landing lag. That's about all I use bouncing for, utilizing enemies to travel a little faster.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Horn was used in a test run, but I found it's unneeded here. They last 3 hits, far below what you need to do to most enemies. Evolving with a horn will restore the horn back to 3 hits, but then there's the flashy yellow animation.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Kicks and Strike are never used because I never become a Mammal.

	" Luck
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The RNG addresses are at 
	[tt 
		"0x7E00DE
	]tt
	" and 
	[tt 
		"0x7E00DF
	]tt
	". If you want flashing meat, these two must sum to some multiple of 16, 32, 64, or 128, depending on the enemy. They change every frame, and may change more than once in a frame if an enemy has to think or when determining flashing meat.

		"helping me out

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Aside from a nifty program, the enemies also uses the same RNG when deciding their actions. I spend a few frames here and there so that enemies don't get in my way. Or move into a better position to bounce off of. Those work too.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Glitches
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"There aren't many glitches I could take advantage of. However, there are two that sticks out.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"One is an upward zip glitch. This is only possible on certain terrain, where you can stand on a platform and be blocked from simply walking off one of its sides. This block is what's important. When you jump, hit Y and bite nothing in particular. After the bite, you can hit B at any time you're inside this block to zip straight up. Saves a small amount of time for a better jumping position, while adding a bunch of WTF when the sky has a band of strange red stuff suddenly.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The other allows me to make one action on the elevator when I activate it. Upon finishing an animation on the ground, such as landing from a jump or finishing a tackle, you have one frame in which you can act, prior to the earliest possible frame in which down or up would move the elevator. If you walk for that frame, you will continuously move until you hit a wall. If you jump, you have control over where you go, but you can't do much else. Control is limited, but the one extra jump can put you someplace closer to your goal.

If you manage to squeeze through that, there's a whole bunch guarding the entrance to Cave of Origin, ready to talk you down. ...
