	" Tony finds himself stranded on a strange planet where nothing is familiar (and without his sister). However, a mech that has a vast knowledge of telepathic skills saves him and empowers Tony with the ability to take on the aliens' army. This machine becomes an important ally in the battle to save Tony's sister and stop the extraterrestrial invasion before it's too late. The game forces players to fight strange aliens across the galaxy. Players collect power-ups while in the mech but loses it after a single hit. The game includes some surreal enemies like a typical dog and some musical notes.

	"You can find more information in the game's forum topic. The run was largely motivated by the numerous new discoveries I made, although only the Arrow bug proved useful. I planned out all of the collectable items that could be found throughout the levels and

	"When descending, for some reason the game sometimes assumes you have touched the ground even when you are not near any ground. This happens depending on your vertical movement, and it allows you to jump in midair to stay airborne indefinitely.

]div
[div class=p 
	"The most common variation of this that I use is to jump from the ground for 8 (non-lag) frames and then descend, then rejump in midair. Repeating this process allows you to slowly climb in the air. This is done in some boss fights for entertainment, but also to save time in a few places.
