	"Cars is a DS game consisting of multiple minigames. While the goal of each individual minigame varies, the main goal of the game itself is to complete the Piston Cup, and win against Chick Hicks.

	"When the movie Cars 3 was announced, I decided to "celebrate" by making a TAS of this game. The DS version was chosen because I actually played the game before, so I'd thought it'd be "easier". Due to terrible memory, I accidentally started the first several minigames with DeSmuME 0.9.11, which has save bugs. If anyone has trouble replaying the file, delete the save file for this game in the battery folder. Be sure to pause as soon as the movie is played, then make a savestate at the first frame, and immediately reload it again! Sorry about that.

	"In Flo's V6 Cafe, you're tasked to quickly refill the patron's gas by rubbing them with the stylus. Each have a time limit, so they must be done quickly or else they'll leave. Flo's cafe has 16 car slots, and while you're supposed to rub the cars multiple times, in a TAS this could be done in ~3-5 frames in general. Like the previous minigame, I'm able to manipulate their placement. Moving around may cause lag, so I try not to make them spawn in such a way that it lags when I move to/away from them.

[p 
	"Moving back and forth between stalls pauses thier timers. Since the minigame will only proceed after the round's amount of cars filled is reached, I messed around a bit with the later rounds to create a sense of "emergency". This does not lose time unless you reach 6 cars at once, which is the max amount of cars which can appear at one time.

I manipulated the light pattern by delaying when to tap in order to avoid the same light blinking twice in a row. If a light blinks twice in a row, I'm unable to click on it again for a while. The only other thing to look out for is making sure the stoplight doesn't swing too much, else it makes certain lights unclickable.

For this and all other cups, every 2 laps, you are taken to the pit to replace your wheels. As that takes far too long, I instead KO Chicks within 2 laps. This is one of few moments in the game where it's mostly TAS-only.

[p 
	"Each of the 4 wheels starts with 255 HP. Getting hit loses 10 HP for a specific wheel, allowing me to inflict 20 damage every cooldown. Since me and the opponent both have the exact same health, to avoid killing myself too soon, I push Chicks towards other cars as well.

The only main thing to watch out for is to not tap them to early, since this glitches them and makes them disappear. I'm sorry for the lackluster minigames so far.

	"The goal of this minigame is to collect "stars" by launching Mater backwards up a ramp. The stage is won if the target amount of stars is achieved. Getting the bonus stars by landing on the purple strip in the meter is only worth it after round 1 due to the increased height along with lag. The hardest part of this minigame was reducing the lag due to the bonus stars.

The order of objects fished was chosen such that there's no delay after finishing reeling in the current trash. If the circle at the bottom turns red, the line breaks, so I'm forced to delay 1 frame for heavier objects to make it green again.

In others, despite showing a rectangular arena, for this round you still drive straight ahead without ever turning. While we both have the same amount of health as before, Chicks can now use a side tackle move that inflicts 50 damage per wheel. This makes the previous strategy trickier.

When the pile is low, I'm able to throw once every 108 frames or so (taking account the fact if I threw early now, the next tire would have to be delayed before thrown.) As the pile reaches 25 tires, the wind starts having a larger effect, forcing me to wait up to 10 frames before tossing.

[p 
	"By the way, even with the wind, you're still unable to toss 2 wheels back to back without waiting 100+ frames. Oh, and you toss straight up always; there's no way to throw "diagonally" to mass spam tires meaningfully.

[p 
	"When you start the minigame at the first screen, the entire 5 rounds are determined at once. The only manipulation between rounds is the color of cars which appear; the puzzle itself remains fixed. That means I'm forced to delay to entering the minigame at the intro screen to change the puzzle order. Additionally, while rounds 1-4 all share the same "pool" of possible puzzles, round 5 has it's own pool to choose from. 
	$LF

[p 
	"I made a list of each possible puzzle, and there appears to be 10 different puzzles in rounds 1-4, and 7 unique ones exclusive to the last round.  I named them by the moves needed, and made a list of the first 99 frames to delay:

[p 
	"From that list, you can see that each "group" of rounds will not repeat the same type of puzzles; Eg. the puzzle that needs 6 moves to solve may appear twice, but it will be a completely different layout that also needs 6 moves. Each additionally move generally costs ~8-10 frames more, so delaying too much will actually end up losing time. For reference, I made a google drive folder showing each possible puzzle:
