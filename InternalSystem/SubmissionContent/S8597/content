No sound...but that was ok, the parallax scrolling was nice though. Certainly not one of my favorites, but I was glad to add it to my collection.

	"There is no level selection, so this game has to be played all the way through until it maxes out its difficulty. I had to do some experiments to confirm this, but I have proved that the article is correct...when it state that Levels 5, 10, and 20 increase the length of the space worm. So in this run, I stop after beating the last worm on 20. To be clear, the article's definition of "Length" is the space that it takes up on the screen, and not the count of body parts that exist.

	"I started TASing this game at the end of May 2023. It may look simple, but I quickly found out that optimization was a little tricky on getting each screens' pattern to show up for the fastest kill that I could manage. It didn't always work well, since the control over the next round's "Space Worm" was rather hard to manipulate. So you will notice that I didn't hold the "Fire Button" down to produce constant shooting...as I need to shoot a specific shot, right before the next round to make changes to an up coming "Space Worm".
