	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Blue's Laser is a consistent stream of inconsistent damage. Red's Force is an inconsistent stream of consistent damage. When using the super forms, Red's Super Force is immensely effective in regenerating the Charge bar; using the weapon essentially refuels itself. Super Laser, however, drains much faster, and is only self sustaining in very few instances. However, Super Laser's damage is inconsistent enough so that over time (and especially if you are right next to your target) Super Laser will deal more damage. Thus, Blue was chosen, to deal more damage and because it increases the difficulty even more.

[p 
	"Just about every motion can be canceled into each other. This is useful in stringing together long chains of actions to be used in movement and for showing off. In movement, if you jump 3 frames before you touch an enemy (or any object) you will continue at normal speed. Then, 3 frames after you jump, do a slide kick, then a slide. This is the optimal form of movement. The slightly more optimal form, which I use during long segments where I do not collide into anything, is to replace jump with uppercut, waiting 8 frames, then doing the slide kick/slide. This extends my slide speed by an additional 5 frames, since aerial kicks are slower than slides. Also, if you press B 6 frames after you do an uppercut, you will slide along the floor at slide speed even more, which allows for tiny optimizations when trying to reach a loading zone.

If you hold B during a different animation, as soon as that animation ends the shot will fire automatically. This can be used to great effect in that you only waste 1 frame during physical attacks in order to fire off a normal shot. This is really useful with fire shot, since at max a fire shot can deal 18 damage.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The other use for this is that it can be used WHILE SLIDING. Simply hold B while sliding, jump, wait 4 frames, then do slide kick/slide. This slows you down very slightly, but it allows you to fire a shot without losing any speed. Very useful for approaching Targets.

[p 
	"Fire is awesome. It has the wonderful ability to linger, so it is used the most during this run. Having a shot linger is great for two reasons. One, you can fire the shot, and then attack physically while the shot is dealing its damage, thus dealign twice as much damage as possible. And second, because fire shots take a while before they start dealing damage, you can use it to fire once before the fight even begins, for extra 18 damage with no time lost.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Super fire is amazing. Used wisely, you can launch these babies one after another and roasts bosses alive. You have to be careful though, not every boss is weak to it, and very often your energy bar can get drained and it can take a lot of damage before you can fire one off again.

It's super form deals, I kid you not, 1 damage every time it hits. it hits multiple times, but c'mon, 1 damage per hit? Super laser deals 10 average per hit. I only use it for entertainment.

It is SHIT to TAS against, it was literally one of the hardest boss fights I have ever TASed in my 3+ year TASing career. It deals like 1 damage, but I need to NOT get hit, and the green thingie was SOOO good at doing that. That ^&%*%^&%$&ing green snake kept homing in on me at all the wrong times, and my stupid super laser doesn't sustain itself. So, I make do.
