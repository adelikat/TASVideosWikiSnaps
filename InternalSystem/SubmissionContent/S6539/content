For the pipe that allows quick access to the end, as for the second level of the world four, I made the invisible block appear to access the pipe and arrive more easily in the game. Just after, I made handling the only glitch in the game. You had to be not too far from the pipe and not too close to the pipe, to be in between to access the water part of the level. The level ends with a fight with bowser and I game is finally over.

	": Hello sushiw097 and welcome to TASVideos. While your movie appears decently optimized, there are two major issues with it. One it fails to achieve the goal it states to achieve: it performs two glitches instead of one, since it uses Left + Right to save time in one level. The second is that this goal is unacceptable. While usage of fewer glitches could potentially be seen as a valid goal, the usage of one glitch total seems arbitrary. Why one glitch? Why not two or three? There's no real justification for the goal choice here, nor any reason to believe the audience would find this particular goal choice interesting. In order to accept exotic goal choices, they must be seen as unique and entertaining, and this isn't really either. Read the
