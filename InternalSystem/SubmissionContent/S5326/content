	"Firstly, to do this you need to go to gear 3 and bump the yellow car out of the way and change to gear 4, wait a while and change to gear 5

	"Secondly, when you get to the first turn silent drift and change to gear 6 while in the middle of the silent drift, keep drifting until you are about to get out of the tunnel

	"Next, just before you get out of the tunnel go to gear 5, start to silent drift and while you are still drifting go to gear 4 and very quickly go back up to gear 6 you should get to around 170-180 mph (273-281 km/h) and basically whenever you get to a corner shift down a gear ang go back up to gear 6 while making sure you are not making any sound while drifting :) if you want to see it on my youtube channel click here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltsD80m4pKk&t=37s

	": Hello, and welcome to TASVideos. As many users have noted in the discussion topic, this run is suboptimal and can be improved. Additionally, to be considered proper game completion, the movie should clear all tracks. As such, rejecting. Better luck next time!
