	"In NG3, as in other NGs, the sword slashing animation 
	$LF
	"causes you to stop, unless you are in midair, and even then 
	$LF
	"if you land during it, it must finish before you can move 
	$LF
	"on.  You can interrupt this animation by jumping again 
	$LF
	"immediately, I do this quite a bit.  There is one static 
	$LF
	"scrolling stage, I show a few holes in the scenery there by 
	$LF
	"entering walls, going through a couple platforms etc, but 
	$LF
	"its more for fun than speed.  Other than that I don't think 
	$LF
	"there were any errors really abused.  A few obstacles are 
	$LF
	"avoided while invincible after a hit.  Certainly I make use 
	$LF
	"of the windmill star a little more extensively than was 
	$LF
	"intended, but that's not quite an error.

	"I only take a hit when it is faster than waiting or killing 
	$LF
	"the monster.  When I do wait it is either to avoid a hit 
	$LF
	"which would propel me backwards or it is for a game event 
	$LF
	"like the spikes in the final stage.  If i wait I probably 
	$LF
	"tried other ways and found waiting was the only way.  The 
	$LF
	"spikes for example do a huge amount of damage so it was only 
	$LF
	"possible to go through them once.

	$LF
	"The bosses only take one damage per hit no matter what you 
	$LF
	"hit them with so i generally use the sword since it fires 
	$LF
	"the fastest.  The exception would be the special weapon that 
	$LF
	"fires up and down; since there are two projectiles it can do 
	$LF
	"twice the damage potentially.  It might be possible to lower 
	$LF
	"total boss time by a couple seconds by using this.  Likewise 
	$LF
	"small optimizations may subtract a few seconds from the time 
	$LF
	"but I am unaware of any exploits or shortcuts which I did 
	$LF
	"not use.
