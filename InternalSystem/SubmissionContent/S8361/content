	"In Race Ace, the course begins on a winding, tree-bordered country road. From there, you move to hot, arid desert where many a car has met its fate among the cactuses. Following another jaunt through the countryside, you enter a long, dark mountain tunnel. Once inside, your headlights turn on automatically, but it's still difficult to see. As you exit the tunnel, the bright sunshine and green grass are a welcome sight, but watch out because the course soon takes you through the frozen north.

	"To understand the ending better, we must first realize the differences and similarities of the first and second loops. During the first loop, you start off slow and have to accelerate up to the max speed of 120 mph. On the second loop, the speed is already maxed out...meaning that it will be faster. No game speed increases occur, nor difficulty. The only thing that changes, is that time is a bit less, as outlined in the article. Since this is a TAS, we can drive perfectly around all obstacles and still make in before the clock expires. So this means each race is the same length.

	"The car's speed is controlled by pressing "Up" on the joystick. Once speed has been maxed out, it is no longer necessary to hold it...as it will continue until something impedes forward progress. This was a perfect situation to have, and led me to writing a derivative of my BOT, that I call Splotch. After determining a few specifics, my BOT ran for a while and the results were shocking! Roughly 12 seconds were chopped off, before the crossing of the finish line! So this makes the ending far from trivial, as RNG was manipulated as such to surpass any expectation of early inputs that I could have hoped for.
