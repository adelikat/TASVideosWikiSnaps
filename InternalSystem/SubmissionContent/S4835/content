[ul

		"Decks are defined by the game for each world (it means no farm of attack cards).
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				"This also means that CP are useless. In exchange, you can boost AP (Attack Points). You can do it on level 2, 5 and then each 5 levels (up to 20 AP). AP is literally the amount of damage you deal : if you have 10 AP, then each hit will cut 10 HP.
				$LF
			]li
		]ul
		"Riku can use the power of Darkness with Dark Mode (I'll use DM). This is unlocked after the first fight with Ansem. Under the HP bar, there is a counter of points. Each time you do a cardbreak, you gain the difference between the 2 cards (or lose it if the enemy cardbreaks you) and each time Riku gets hit, you gain 1 point. Once you get 30 DP, Riku changes his clothes and uses the power of Darkness.
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				"DM boosts attacks by 50%. This makes Riku moving faster and allows him to dodge up and down and even do a double jump.
				$LF
				[ul 
					[li 
						"You must know that boosts from DM and enemy cards (such as Overdrive and Berserk) are both counted by the game. As an example, let's say you have 15 AP. If you use Overdrive or Dark Mode, you'll deal 22 but if you use both of them, you'll deal 33 : 15 + 15/2 + 22/2. Yes, the game rounds to the lower number.
						$LF
					]li
				]ul
				"Riku has only 3 sleights : Dark Break, Dark Firaga and Dark Aura. These can only be used under DM.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				"Once you're in DM, you can lose it if your Dark Points (DP) reach 0. Each time you get hit or cardbroken, you lose DP. You can boost your DP each level. The third option is still HP's boost.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				"In this mode, you have more attacks, too. For example, if you do a double jump followed by an attack, Riku attacks with the move of a combo's last hit. It's the most efficient way to hit an enemy because it can touch the enemy each possible frame. And the game totally works when you press a button one frame, so the inputs look like : B|.|B|A .

Aside from the repetition in the beginning (due to necessary farming), this was a nice boss-rush in watching Riku tear his way through the various worlds, and onto Castle Oblivion.  The fights, notably, also had more of an action element to them over Sora's, due to Riku's superior abilities.  Very nice job here, overall.  Looking forward to your next TAS!
