	"Micro Machines V3 is a video game featuring toy cars, developed by Codemasters and published on the PlayStation in 1997. This movie beats the "Difficult" challenge mode as fast as possible.

	"I started this TAS long ago, but the fourth track was very long and boring and difficult, so I left it untouched for a while. Well, not anymore. I finished it, hooray.

	"It only features the "Difficult" challenge mode, which was the most entertaining option, in my opinion. It doesn't make the movie too long and it features a wide variety of tracks at the same time.

	"It aims for fastest time, but I know there are some mistakes that I noticed too late. Also, I'm sure it could be somewhat faster with more patience and better planning; racing games require you to think very early about your future movements, so there will always be that. And... maybe lag management could be a bit better.
