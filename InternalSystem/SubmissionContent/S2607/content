	"It only features the "Difficult" challenge mode, which was the most entertaining option, in my opinion. It doesn't make the movie too long and it features a wide variety of tracks at the same time.

	"It aims for fastest time, but I know there are some mistakes that I noticed too late. Also, I'm sure it could be somewhat faster with more patience and better planning; racing games require you to think very early about your future movements, so there will always be that. And... maybe lag management could be a bit better.
