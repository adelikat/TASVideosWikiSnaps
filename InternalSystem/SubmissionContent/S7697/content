Therefore, we are able to enter out-of-bounds by moving up-left into the corner. Moving up-left again from here causes an underflow of the map position value and we come out near the lower-right corner of the map with only one mountain separating us from Cloudy Mountain. The map position value is located at Main RAM address 0x111367.

We basically... *APPEAR* on top of the first dragon so that we can take his crown half. He obviously doesn't like that but too bad because we're gonna phase through the wall to get away. We don't even have the courtesy to do the same to the next dragon and collect the crown BEFORE we even reveal the chamber! Thanks to our walk-through-walls ability, we used no arrows during the TAS.
