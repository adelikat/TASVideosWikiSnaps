	"Using the hard difficulty in this game adds a great deal more enemies, specifically the dog that is running at you within the first few seconds of playing the game. How anyone would ever dodge it their first try is beyond me and it seems like a cheap place to put an enemy. However it doesn't matter in a TAS! Also, it makes some enemies require more hits to kill, such as the bats from stage 8.

If you crouch while standing inside (or under in some cases) a block, the game wants to eject you out of whichever direction you're closest to according to the block. Using this, positioning yourself under a block next to a wall you can wedge yourself into any wall. The places where this is actually useful based on level design is minimal though.

I had originally tried to clip through the door area of the tube riding thing, but that always just triggered riding the tube, it wouldn't actually take me through to the other side like with most walls. So then I thought well there's a tiny wall down where the switch is, perhaps I could use that. I didn't think it would work because I didn't think I could get under the block in that tiny space. But after a little experimenting you can actually suction the block up from the hole while you're running and you'll fall through. The block stays on the ledge above but it still pushes you left when you duck! Success! Clips all the way through to the other side of the screen. I had to suction the other block into the same position on the second switch to be able to do that.

It's also something to take note I wanted to kill him as low on the screen as possible, so finding a cycle where he appears on screen quite a bit and ends up dying low on the screen was a bit difficult. This is because he can also be on a cycle where he flies under the level and above the level, not being able to be hit at all.

If he's up there it's actually longer to reach him to grab him than it would be to fire the first one into the switch on the right. I feel like that was a terrible explanation though. The second part of this room is a robot fight, and luckily there's a ceiling. You know what that means. Yup I don't have to wait for enemies to shoot into him I can just keep suctioning to damage him and being inside his head doesn't even damage me.
