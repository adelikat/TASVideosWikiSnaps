	"Hey all, here's my improved (12 seconds faster than v1) timeattack for this semi-famous NES game, using FCE Ultra.  This is known as one of the shortest games for this system, and I believe that this would be the third-shortest full-game completion of an NES game on this site if it is accepted (only Friday the 13th and Atlantis no Nazo would beat this, and the latter uses warps).

	"Anyway, it's actually kind of tough to keep moving forward as much as I do in the movie due to the game's horrible controls and randomness.

	"The "C" items are Crane Kicks, which is the highly damaging kick you see me use in the movie.  The "D" items are Drum Punches, which of course I never get to use.

	"When fighting bosses, you cannot afford to knock them off-screen (or into the water, in the case of the last boss) or else they will regain all of their life.  This is why it looks like I fight them a little slowly...I am keeping this from happening.  This is also why I don't use all of my crane kicks in the karate tournament; the enemies there cannot be knocked off-screen, so you can beat them much more quickly.  Hence, it saves more time to use crane kicks on other bosses.

	"There are a few other times when I appear to make suboptimal movements.  These serve one of two purposes:

	"1. Manipulate randomness to improve overall time.

	"2. Avoid bonus stages.  There are hidden bonus levels scattered all around, and the crane kicks and drum punches they give you nowhere near make up for the amount of time they waste.

	"That's about it.  Personally, I say this movie is worthy if Kung Fu is, but you all are the judges of that...
