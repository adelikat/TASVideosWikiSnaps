	" Eri is best, because she can die easily at 2nd scene to get 20 bombs. It’s enough to beat boss, and only Eri’s bomb can damage boss3top, therefore she can use Z and F. Z hit boss3body (when head appear, Z can make double damage. But in my run, 500 is max), bombs and F hit boss3top.

		"Mission4:
	]b
	" I’m not sure, maybe Eri or maybe Fio. Marco need save bomb to hit boss, but Eri has enough bombs, no need to save, and she can jump and throw bombs down. Fio has 15 Z, 4500 dmg in all.

		"Mission5:
	]b
	" Eri is best. Only Eri’s bomb can hit boss3air at first time.

		"Mission6:

	" Tarma is best. Tarma drive robot VS Mr. |See you in hell”.

		"Mission7:
	]b
	" Eri is best. Eri can get 5 bomb boxes (2 from prisoners, 3 from tentacles), so she can get 60 bombs more than others (if use death, will get more). Eri’s bombs can hit finalboss’s head easily.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"So I think the best choice is: mission1 to mission5 use Eri. Mission1 die once for getting bombs to beat boss, and mission3 die once again. Mission6 die to change to Tarma. Mission6 Tarma searches the chance to die twice. Mission7 die to change back to Eri before get first bomb box.
