	", which this submission uses. For the meme, I decided to resync the GB Camera TAS into this new build. Interestingly, this lead to a much longer startup time, and it's due to more accurate emulation of the GB Camera registers (and hence despite this submission using GBA mode, is still slower than the published movie if not disregarding these emulation differences). I also during resyncing I noticed I somehow got a faster RTA time while losing IGT (the resync at this point wasn't quite right). Messing around, I found out that I could jump right before the goal, and that seemed to be slightly faster. This happens with both GBHawk and Gambatte, so this improvement is legit.

	" in terms of gameplay timings, but it has a certain in-game action at the very end that makes the level fade out faster. The same input for the running level also makes it end 1 frame sooner in the current movie too, so this is a legit improvement. I asked other judges whether they feel improving the fade out counts as a gameplay improvement, and no one felt it doesn't. Indeed this movie doesn't aim for in-game time after all, so improving the overall length is the goal. Extra proof is that fade out speeds up because you manipulate an enemy to move more optimally, so all in all it's good. Accepting over the current publication linked above.
