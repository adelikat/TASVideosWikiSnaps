	"I don’t know how do people feel about this kind of projects, whether they enjoy them or criticize, whether they see the big amount of work. Anyway, there are people who enjoy watching 3-hour walkthroughs of RPG games, so this TAS will also find its viewer. On 3rd of October in 2013 I did a first TAS test when I faced a rerecording PS2 emulator for the first time. Though it was horrible in technical aspects because of desyncs, I found it good. A year later, while mastering Dolphin, I did a Leonardo’s story. I have rewatched it for several times so far, so I got an idea “Why not to make a full game TAS?” So, I started a full TAS project in December, 2016 and now you see the result!

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- Shield makes the host not to lose his health if he takes damage. However, he can still be KOed if it’s possible to KO an opponent by pushing him away from the arena. Power-down is a broken shield that makes the target to lose more health of taking damage. This power-down is being manipulated during the whole game.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- Speed speeds up all the host’s actions. Irreplaceable thing when you fight more then 1 enemy though it’s also useful if you need rapid combos or there are no weapons around. Power-down is a snail that slows down the target.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- Strength makes the host to deal more damage. Helps you with dealing major damage, especially with weapons. Power-down is a skeleton with the opposite effect.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- Medkit increases the host’s health to maximum. Power-down is a skull that hurts the target by 1/3 of his maximum health. It is extremely rare even for tool-assistance, so I haven’t managed to use it in skill-based stages. By plural tests with throwing a crate frame-by-frame during several seconds I can say that some stages doesn’t provide it at all or it’s necessary to spend much time dealing damage before the game increases the chance for it to pop up.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Creates with Shredder’s logo provide weapons. There are 2 various weapons (in a few rarest cases – 4) that could be gotten on a stage. They always spawn in a prescribed sequence. If the 1st item is a bat and the 2nd item is a sword, it doesn’t matter which crate will be broken first: you always get a sword only if the 1st weapon crate is broken.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The Freezer location hides both power-ups and weapons inside the meat carcases which require 2 hits and some relax time to be broken.

		" Simple bots doesn’t try much to beat the player and usually stay on distance from him. If he approaches, they run away or block (purple dragons, protectable characters). This passiveness isn’t good for speedrunning. It takes time to chase them and is difficult to collect multiple enemies in a small area.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Avarage bots have a tradeoff between passive and aggressive styles that makes an influence on their behavior. They sometimes go for weapons and power-ups and, if pushed into the air, sometimes make a flip to land on feet. Usually, they are secondary enemies on late stages and primary – on early stages.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Strong enemies act aggressively, often block player’s attacks and mostly make a flip when pushed into the air. Fortunately, it’s easy to collect them at one place, but it also takes some time to make them not to jump, block or run away when it’s needed. They are bosses in medium and late stages.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"By acting you can manipulate them to approach you, to attack, to hold their right stand and so on. So the entire game depends on it, but TASing require much work to make the bots do what you exactly want. The problem is how much time you will lose in order to make that.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Each combo takes a certain period of time to be performed and deals different amount of damage. TAS mainly uses those that have the best tradeoff between damage, time and enemy’s reaction before/during/after the combo, but sometimes enemies just blocked my attacks when I approach, so I had to manipulate. If you are interested in why I used exactly that combo in that stage, write back and I will explain! 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When you hit an enemy, he turns red for a short time. Some characters like Foot Ninja or Splinter can perform some combos too fast and enemies can bypass their separate hits cause they were still red. That’s why some combos were slowed down a little. The same thing concerns the distance. Some hits make an enemy to bend back and he won’t take the following one if it comes too fast.

		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Heavy weapons like an axe, big sword and Japanese axe deal bigger damage, have longer range of hit, but usually in one direction, and smaller “rate of fire”. Small characters fall down from a single hit while the big can endure 2 hits before falling down. Dealing the first hit in the air makes every character to stay on feet, so it helps to deal 2 hits faster.
