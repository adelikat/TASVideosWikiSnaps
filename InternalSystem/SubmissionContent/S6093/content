	"I don’t know how do people feel about this kind of projects, whether they enjoy them or criticize, whether they see the big amount of work. Anyway, there are people who enjoy watching 3-hour walkthroughs of RPG games, so this TAS will also find its viewer. On 3rd of October in 2013 I did a first TAS test when I faced a rerecording PS2 emulator for the first time. Though it was horrible in technical aspects because of desyncs, I found it good. A year later, while mastering Dolphin, I did a Leonardo’s story. I have rewatched it for several times so far, so I got an idea “Why not to make a full game TAS?” So, I started a full TAS project in December, 2016 and now you see the result!
