[p 
	"In April 2013, I decided to start the laborious project that a 117% TAS of Spyro 3 could end up being. At this time, I knew little about the 
	[a class=extlink href=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3030/keeping_the_pirates_at_bay.php rel=nofollow 
		"Crack Protection
	]a
	" that prevented previous movies from getting finished, and I thought I may be able to bypass it and still finish it. I also considered that even if I couldn't finish, I would have achieved something big enough that I wouldn't mind.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I spent nearly 3 months TASing with a decently fast progression pace. Then I got to Spooky Swamp (2-3)... To realize that a door that was supposed to be opened was not. Indeed, during Sgt. Byrd's Base (2-C), the game randomly removed from my Atlas the egg that was required to open that door. Having hit the Crack Protection so early was like a punch in the stomach, yet I'm glad I did. Here is why:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"After seeing how the Crack Protection was just preventing me from advancing, Hyperbug, some guy that had reverse-engineered Spyro 2's map system, offered his help to try and find a Crack to bypass the protection. It turned out to be a bad solution: it would have taken a LOT of time, and it would have made the submission to TAS video either very hard or impossible. Instead, he tried and succussed into finding a fix for the emulator, that he released under PSXjin's revision r723.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"After Hyperbug officialised the fix, I went into trying out the movie into this new version with no success. Spyro bonked on the very first jump.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In the end, I didn't care. I didn't care that I had to start over those 3 months of hard work. It actually only meant that I had the opportunity to fix errors I knew I made and release the TAS with a much cleaner start. As a matter of fact, I saved 20 seconds over the previous version of Sunny Villa (1-1) and just as much in pretty much all of the subsequent levels, just from finding faster routes, using more optimized movement techniques and newly found glitches.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Oh. About newly found glitches... This TAS turned out to be pretty productive on the glitch-finding side. One glitch in particular - the Enemy Proxy, formerly called Dead-body Proxy - was discovered in Seashell Shore and saves an impressive amount of time throughout the TAS. Now... This newly found glitch would have also saved time in already TASed levels, but I didn't want to start the TAS over again, so I decided to just go on and live with the guilt of a sub-optimal start.

Usually, it would seem a combination of all 3 with very few jabs would be the best because of the damage per frame ratio, but it turns out the jab is glitched. Sometimes, instead of dealing 1 damage, you'll hit while the opponent is pulling up his guard and still deal damage. Since the opponent is then guarding his head, the game assumes you hit with a low hook and registers 2 damage instead. This is why I keep jabbing. Also, when the opponent is cornered, the "Guard break" effect, as I like to call it, is consistent, meaning a very high damage per frame ratio.

	"Since the last Sparx powerup is very useful and saves a lot of time, our primary goal in this world is to play Sparx's level. To do so, we have to fight the Sorceress (4-B), which requires 100 eggs. We already have that. After the fight, we head of to Bugbot Factory (4-S) and then go off to do the rest. In order to unlock challenges in Dino Mines (4-4) and Haunted Tomb (4-3), we need to complete Agent 9's Lab (4-C). The route was pretty much straight forward from then on.

	"The Sorceress fight is split in 3 phases: cannon, tank and UFO. In the cannon phase, you're only allowed 2 hits before it spits you out and all cannons despawn. In the tank phase, you're allowed 4 hits and in the UFO phase, you usually have 6 hits left to deal. Not only is it possible to deal an additional hit during each of the first 2 phases, it's also possible, with good timing, to get Agent 9 to take down, for instance, a cannon at the start of the tank phase or a tank at the start of the UFO phase. Now, the UFO is really slow. You always move forward, and you turn very slowly, so the cooldown between 2 hits is pretty big. It's obvious that it's faster to do what we call "UFO Skip" which skips the UFO phase completely. Finally, since Agent 9 is already moving toward another cannon when you're about to switch to the tank phase, it's faster to also have a cannon to drop during tank phase. We call that "Tank Skip". In the end, the TAS did both the Tank and UFO Skips during the fight.

	"Unlike the previous Sparx levels, this one waits a long time before giving you any powerup that could help killing the bugs faster. Since I quickly get overwhelmed by bugs, I decided to use Sparx as a weapon to get rid of all of those who were in my way. It turned out to be very effective. The rest of the level is played as intended.

	"Second appearance of our beloved Agent 9. Unlike the previous appearance, this level is exclusively played as Agent 9. Zigzagging is our main tool here: we use it for speed as well as to make usually impossible jumps, effectively skipping slow parts of the level. For example, I use the Zigzag to skip both electric doors in the last area, and to skip the long backtrack that you usually have to do with bombs in your hands to break the metal crate at the start of the level.

	"Very special level here... In fact, it's probably the most confusing of all the levels in this TAS. The reason is simple: it has Proxies, SiA, Spin-Jumps, you get to use the flight powerup and keep it for a decently long time, and finally you get to glitch out the map.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"First, SiA. This Crystal Islands has a few SiA spots, all of which are useful. In fact, all of them are used once in this route. The first SiA skips having to get the flight powerup before reaching the area with the exploding bottles and the key. It also skips having to get to the end of the level before getting the flight powerup. The second is used to get a gold gem without flying, but also and mostly in order to trigger the map glitch while swimming. Since the swimming state gets carried saved when hitting a checkpoint, we don't have to get it after trigger the map glitch.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Then, the map glitch. By triggering the load of the slide area at the same time as you trigger talking to the EoL magician, you cancel loading the area, but the map ID already changed for the one of the slide. If you then die, all the meta-data from the currently loaded map will be replaced by the one of the slide, resulting in all the gems, eggs, baskets, portals, etc. from the slide to spawn into the main world. Since most of the gems spawn over the void, you get them immediately as they spawn, hence the extremely loud bling noise after the death abuse. After triggering this glitch, all I need to do is to get the egg and all the gems that didn't spawn over the void, saving overall only a few seconds over doing the challenge normally.

I then complete the Submarines challenge in a tiny 10 seconds.

	"Now, two and a half years later, that run is here - and it is well worth the wait. The run looks amazing, it is clear a very high amount of effort is spent on it and overall just looks pretty tight. Especially for such a long run of a 3D game, it is very well done. And despite the long length of the run, it never got boring, thanks to a lot of different factors: the constant gem collection everywhere which made the routing in every area a blast to watch; the variety of tricks and glitches in movement and bossfights; and the variety of characters played in this run with each their own unique actions and tricks (with special mention to Agent 9, whose zigzagging action added a whole new level of flair to the run).
