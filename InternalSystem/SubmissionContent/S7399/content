	"So for this minigame, the game uses what I call "indoor swinging". It's a slightly adjusted version of the webswinging that's much slower and more stable. Despite the several indoor levels in the main story, only one of the levels uses this method of swinging as well - that level (Birth of a Hero) and pinhead bowling are the only instances of it in the whole game.

	"Pinhead bowling has the option of up to 4 players, sharing one controller. P1 is Spider-Man, P2 is Wrestling Outfit, P3 is Peter Parker, P4 is Alex Ross Spider-Man.

	"Once you're in the lane, jumping off the webline will instantly end your "roll". Much like real bowling, kicking straight into the pins/thugs will almost never work, meaning you need to go at them at an angle.

[div class=p 
	"Partway through the movie, I change the controls to Enhanced, which allows for quickturns while swinging. This is not considered jumping off your webline and can essentially be used to cheat - or in this case, make the movie more interesting.

	": Synced just fine for me once I learned how to format the memory card. You just hit the button it tells you when loading up the game. That's probably why it complained about "Sram" in the submission, but it doesn't really seem to have any impact on sync so I don't feel any sort of verification movie is necessary. Mode is unlockable from the start with the ingame cheat.
