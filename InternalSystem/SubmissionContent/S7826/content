This movie is 31002 frames (8m 37s) long and ends when further input won't make the race end faster. When dealing with games that loop, tasvideos' own feos mentioned the input should stop "after completing the last level you plan to complete", and it is my understanding that this is what this version does.

	"The movement for this game is very straightforward. The hitboxes are arguably not the best, and crashing means restarting the race from the beginning with one less life. Helicopters make appearances from time to time to give you powerups, ranging from invincibility to helper buddies that make other racers crash. Those are fun! But for a TAS, not as useful as gas refills and turbos.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- Gas refills are awesome because you need to get gas in every race. The only ways to do so are with helicopter drops ('GAS' and 'HI' giving respectively a bit, and a less tiny bit of gas), and by stopping at a refill station. The latter is super slow: the manual states that `When you stop for gas, remember that 5 racers will have to pass you before you can go on.` Neverless, we still have to do it when we don't get enough from helicopters.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"- Turbos make your max speed a little higher for the remainder of the race. Obviously, we want them, and as early as possible.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Aside from the obvious movement to not crash, most of the time TASing this game was spent manipulating the helicopter drops and other racers. The drops seem to be affected by the player's position and movement, and, by extension, other racers. They, however, can not always be manipulated finely: a movement different by a single frame will often not change the drop. In some scenarios where movement is limited by the track and/or by other racers, the drop was not optimal, but helpful nonetheless.

	"Another consideration is the leftover gas: there is a countdown at the end of each race, so we want to end with as little gas as possible.

	"Between levels, you can choose one piece of equipment for the next race. According to the manual, one engine helps with acceleration, while the other gives a better top speed… but from my testing, neither of them makes the player go as fast as the 'slick' tires, which are always selected except for one race, where the 'brock' (yeah, I know) tires prevent slowdown because of the terrain. The 'rain' tires only seem to help with the oil spills with matter very little, if at all, in a TAS.
