	"Sonic CD++ (or Sonic CD Plus Plus) is a hack of Sonic the Hedgehog CD by qiuu and snkenjoi, adding the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (16-bit) style Spin Dash and the newer Homing Attack into the game. This enables the gameplay to be significantly speedier, while Sonic CD is known to be one of the more slow-paced games in the classic Sonic series.

You can also homing attack on the little ramps and jump at the right time to jump all the way to the lift platform. After doing so, get the shield and hit into the thorns to (yet again) save time. The next part of the level, you have to hit the fist firefly at the right timing, and the best way to reach Egghead faster is to make sure the 2 fireflies reach each other, and hit them at the right timing, and home attack your way to Eggman. Finally the last boss. Use Eggman to lose your rings and become invincible, (and a bit invisible) to hit with a homing attack faster. Wait until he stops blinking to hit him again, and again, and again, and then, TIME!!!! The game is done in 15:51. GG!

]h3
[div class=p 
	"This hack is of Sonic CD, and made some additions to functionality and improvements to make the game play faster than the original. Despite the additions and improvements for Sonic, the rest of the entire game remained untouched from the original. There has to be more that makes the hack as well as the TAS stand out and be considered worthy enough to be eligible for publication. The 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Sonic 3 & Amy Rose TAS by marzojr|href=/2752M)
	" is a good example.

It appears to me that you didn't quite check to see if any of the zips, level wraps, or other tricks that were used in the other submission were applicable for your run. In fact, there were a number of instances where this run ended up slower than the original's by noticeable amounts.

I'm rejecting this movie for suboptimality and hack choice.
