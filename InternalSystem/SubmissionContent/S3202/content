	"The game requires the player to battle his way through several locations such as cemeteries, laboratories, castles and a house of wax dolls. To defeat the enemies (which range in ability and include zombies, bats and ghosts), players can utilise several primary and secondary weapons. Primary weapons are close combat weapons ranging from knives to rapiers and axes, that differ in range and efficiency. Secondary weapons are long-range weapons (pistols, bombs etc.) with limited ammunition. The player can hold one type of primary and secondary weapon. Picking up a new weapon means it automatically replaces the previous weapon in the player's inventory."

	"Didn't need to memory watch since enemies have obvious HP numbers, subweapon and boss HP are shown on screen. Dr. Social responds to commands after 2 frames, jumping costs 2 frames of horizontal speed, attacking on ground costs 16 frames, subweapon throwing costs 16 plus 8 for him to move again.. taking damage to be thrown ahead is 20 frames (30 - 10), attacking behind (while jumping) costs 4 to 6 frames of speed depending on the lags, and getting an item takes 32 frames. Bosses and enemies blink for 64 frames (a little more than one jump) when they were not defeated, of course =P

I don't think better subweapon planning would save that much in frames now, but maybe I will be trying to improve it more in the future =P (really, I came up with results that were really hard for myself to top on some screens, I even lost frames while testing, RNG and lags can be more explored, that's for sure..)
