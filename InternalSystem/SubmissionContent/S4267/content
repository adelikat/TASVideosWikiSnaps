	[li 
		" Trick 2: if you enough close to the door, but sth blocks you (wall, monster), you can open it anyway.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Trick 3: the is a gltich which allows you to pull down the key without going up using the scattering of the super shotgun.

		" Map 1: simple map, no comments.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Map 2: this is the map where I got the blue and yellow keys earlier using trick 1. Punching imps for some entertainment (unfortunately, nowhere else in the run).
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Map 3: entering the engineering room fastly to save the time. Took the invulnerabelty to save the health and kill cacodemons calmly. This is the first PWYMK - two cacodemons to active the lift.
		$LF

	[li 
		" Map 4: another PWYMKM in the start room. I didn't entered the secret stage to save the time, but this stage had a powerful gun which could help me in some places =(

		" Map 5: no comments, nice watch!
		$LF

	[li 
		" Map 6: killed the cacodemon to "move his clone" on lift next to it! Strange glitch! If I hadn't killed it, it will totally block the lift after I finish the case on right side of the map!

	"Hi, 
	[b 
		"Dimon12321
	]b
	", and huge thanks for all your effort! This is a game lots of people are eager to see well TASed. And there are quite some experts that have a lot of knowledge of how it works. And it is a very complicated game. As a result, we have a game that's actually very hard to TAS up to the level that even the experts would have nothing to add, which appears to be the level of quality at TASVideos. It's pretty sane: if only people who don't know the game very well could enjoy the run, but those who are well familiar with it see many improvements, it can't be considered optimal. In many cases, it's the opposite: if tips and tricks known from the experts are applied, the run is rather optimal, even if some unaware people don't enjoy it. But with this game, all would enjoy the optimal run, maybe it would even get a Star, as the other famous 
	(__wikiLink|2443M|FPS game)
	" TAS got.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"So, I'm joining the others' desire and asking you to resume this project, applying the tricks other members posted, and posting your own works-in-progress in the 
	[a href=/forum/t/6625 
		"Doom 64 thread
	]a
	". This is how our best TASes are done: make sure a segment is optimal, only then move on. It may take several months, but honestly, the longer the run is being done, the better (and the faster) it is in the end. Good luck!
