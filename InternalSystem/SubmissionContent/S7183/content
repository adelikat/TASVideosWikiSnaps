	"The main improvement here is the use of "moonwalking". Simply be, the game does a walking animation while you move if you hold the moving direction. However, if you don't hold that direction (i.e. tap it each time), you don't do this animation, resulting in a "moonwalk". This seems to reduce lag slightly, and even does so on the old TAS (not using latest hawk) if applied (at least as far as the first 6 levels), so this probably counts as an improvement.

[div class=p 
	"However, you can note that this movie seems to be around 9 seconds slower than the old movie (disregard BIOS time, it's more 6 seconds). This seems to indicate that more accurate emulation results in more lag. As I've noted, I've tried applying the moonwalk to the first 6 levels on the old TAS and it ended up resulting in less lag (around 4 frames). I couldn't check anywhere past that due to the lua script I've used not behaving correctly on old hawk versions. I am fairly confident overall this is an improvement, but it is still somewhat questionable.

	"The main issue is that there's actually no guarantee that the new trick makes enough levels faster if we account for lag. The differences in times are all over the place: some levels are shorter, others are longer, and time discrepancy also varies greatly. Maybe in some places the new trick causes more lag than necessary. Which means the old approach has to be tested as well, for every level, and maybe even for every turn where it's an option.
