	"The game mechanic is very different than in other Monkey Ball games. While in mid-air the speed decreases. So minimizing time in mid-air is essential to save as many frames as possible.
	[br

	" 
	$LF
	"Bouncing of edges also doesn't increase speed but it can be abused if not to much time in mid-air is spend.
	[br

	" 
	$LF
	"Due to missing analog controls it is really difficult to do positioning and acceleration well, there's only 8 possibilites to chose from, while with analog there would many more. This means to get a good position sometimes realising and pressing directional buttons is needed. This is more difficult when the camera turns.
