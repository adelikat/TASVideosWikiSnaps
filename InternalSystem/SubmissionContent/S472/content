	"In this game he's kinda soft. Must been the beginning of his career, cous he's not that all mighty and stuff. Thats why I take damage. Hardest level to complete was most probably level 2. Especially *spoiler* the train part. You will somewhat notice funny stuff in it. Such as me jumping into walls. That's because I manipulate some enemies that way. I tried to be as accurate as possible. I started out this run at 6% speed. Then I got the gens_movie_test9c.exe from Jyzero so that I was able to use the advance frame key instead. This shaved off alot of seconds for sure. Some times I even advanced in real time,  where little, very little or no accuracy is needed. In the first level I don't kill as many as possible because I thought I'd have some fun with them. But instead I gathered score from other objects. Might seem kinda dumb. But thats the way I did it. In later levels I smoke almost everything that moves. :D

	"Oh.. BTW. The annoying thing at the last boss. He only requires ONE more hit. But instead he chooses to fly around like a retarded retard just to let the seconds fly past about as fast. I really tried and tried to fix/change this problem. But it woulden't help. So I decided that this is the way it has to be then.
