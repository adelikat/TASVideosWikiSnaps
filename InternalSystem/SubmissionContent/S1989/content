	"WarioWare Twisted is the second in the series. I chose this one for a couple of reasons. First off, this game came up with a new physics engine which it used in some of the games, making them nearly impossible even with lots of practice. This game begged for me to destroy it. Secondly, speed of play does have an effect during some mini games and bosses so the finishing time isn't completely predetermined like the other one.

	"This movie wasn't too hard to make. Took a bit longer than I thought it would over three days but it was still just fun to do. I was going for frame perfection a lot of the time when I thought it would be more fun to see. Honestly you may not know how badly I destroyed the mini games unless you play it yourself.

	"Wario Intro: All the games in this set are not timed at all. You could take an hour to complete this part of the game, or like me just a few seconds. Quite fun to watch, especially knowing how long it can take.

	"Kat and Ana: Same as above, except the boss battle took a little longer. I challenge anyone to try this game them self and see how long it can take. I honestly thought that was very fast...heh. Funny boss level as well. I thought it was very entertaining to watch.

	"Dribble: Once again, timed mini games except the boss battle. This one was entertaining to me as well. With frame precision the entire thing takes about a 4th less time than usual. Bad handling makes boss kinda slow but overcoming that makes you superman.

	"Dr. Crygor: I hate this dudes mini games out of all of them in the entire game. This is the new physics engine I was referring to. Gravity changing. This took me the longest to do on console and I was very happy to destroy them in TAS. His boss battle is mostly predetermined time, but not nearly as painful to watch as Mona's.

	"WarioWatch: This is the big time saver here. I think out of the whole TAS this is the funnest to watch. Why? There is no time limits. You can finish the games as fast as you want and I did just that! Unfortunately there is a fairly predetermined set of mini games you get so I had to do a couple long ones. I don't know, poking candy out of a child's mouth seems pretty fun right?

	"Orbulon: *yawn* He gives you MORE time to complete his puzzles than the other characters do. It's not too much more time but it does make you wish you could speed him up. The boss battle is also predetermined in terms of time, but hey it's got decent music so it's not so bad

	"9-Volt: Ah, the boy that looks like a darn dog to me still. I thought he was a dog for a long time. Anyway his mini games do please me the most. "Spintendo classics" certainly bring some 8-bit fun. His boss battle is fun as well. If you're not careful you can move really fast! I moved so fast that I glitched up the mushroom. I hit the ? block and it appeared near the end of the stage. Awesome. The whole thing is done in a couple seconds.

	"Wario-man: The final set of mini-games. All in this set are timed. I tried making everything as entertaining as possible. The boss battle? I HATED trying to play this on console. It took me so many darn tries I couldn't even begin. Well it turns out that the controls and stuff were very loose and that may have been the problem. Watch me just make this game look stupid, and Wario for that matter.

	"Lastly: I don't really care if this run is rejected. I did it to have some fun and I gave it my all. It needed to be destroyed and I hope that at least a few of you enjoy the same pleasure. I know the other WarioWare runs have been rejected and I know why. A lot of you may find this boring but it's cool.
