	"I'm pleased to submit this TAS in time for before July 2019. This run improves the last published movie by 477 frames, or 7.94 seconds. "Uses a game restart sequence", one of the most notable improvement used in this TAS was already planned and tried a year ago when I tried to beat old TAS. The RNG is reset once the game is restarted after saving, so I expected to reduce the delay that would take for the first Last starmen to appear. At that time, I discovered they appeared noticeably faster, however, it took a very long delay for the second Last starmen to appear, which resulted in more slower than existing TAS. So I accepted this improvement as a failure, and satisfied to have made 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=this record|href=/3714M)
	" after only a little optimization. And a year later, I thought what caused the failure. It was my conclusion that in the battle of the first Last starmen there was unnecessarily a lot of delay in trying to defeat them all at one single turn. As a result of improving the cause of the failure, the time with which the second Last starmen appeared was successfully improved, and finally I could achieved sub 23 minutes record.

Ninten enters the monochrome world and walks 497 steps to the south to reach Queen Mary. Also it's generally known from

The game designer separated this collapsing Magicant scene into a kind of "map" and created a own map of it, and as you go in there and reach her, you can go straight to the entrance to the final battle.
