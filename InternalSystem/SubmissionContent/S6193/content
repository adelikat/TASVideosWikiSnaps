Special care was taken to make sure that we always have the boss in our sight, to remove any extra waiting which the previous TAS did not do.  Note that this is does apply to the level end sequence, and so we're free to jump around once the boss is dead.

Collecting these is what awards the Mystery Bonus at the end of the level, for 500 points per pickup, and annoying ~70 frames to give it to us.  This was completely overlooked in the previous TAS, collecting a lot of unnecessary bonuses.  Proper effort was undertook to avoid all of these, which also includes controlling which enemies actual get killed in order to make sure the bonuses never spawn in our way.

It's still beneficial to lose that spare HP however, since it means 3 fewer frames on each score screen.  The only chance that we have to get hurt without losing time was during the on-rails section in level 11, which ended up saving 9 frames over the next 3 levels.

More ledges have been utilised in this run, and more effort was taken to make sure we get the maximum boost possible by landing when our subvalue is highest.  Note that height difference is based our initial/final height, and so constant jumping doesn't work for constant boosts.

Pond reacts to all the individual nooks and crannies formed by the pixels on the floor which results in constant flickering to acceleration and produces horribly inconsistent velocities across each section.  This is always annoying to predict and to optimise to try to find paths which utilise as many of these potential floor boosts as possible in a given area, causing tonnes of strategies to test.

For the yellow area, killing the first bird was skipped, and after death respawn it's faster to just jump into the next corridor.  When going across the piano, using HP for invincibility proved more useful at the start compared to when going down the slope.  Afterwards, spare HP was then lost during the on-rails section, to reduce each subsequent level's score screen by 3 frames a piece.

This would be acceptable as a form of all levels if not for the fact that this does not beat all of the levels in the game. What this TAS does is beat all the levels that looked required. This means this submission is in an awkward middle ground where it is neither fastest completion nor full completion. The author intends to do the secret levels now, which I feel would warrant an entirely new submission as this could have a dramatic impact on the perceived entertainment value. I asked if they would like to cancel but have not received any response.
