	"Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is a 1999 remake of the classic NES title, released for the Game Boy Color. This movie aims to complete the game as fast as possible, using warps to skip sections of the game. This movie is a 65 frame (1.08 seconds) improvement over the previous TAS. The majority of timesave comes from a Japanese exclusive clip in 1-2. The Japanese release has all sorts of tiny differences from the NA/EU version of the game; a level-by-level breakdown of the differences is listed below.

	"More time is saved back from not grabbing the fire flower, and I implemented a couple of new strategies in the warpzone. If big Mario's head is inside a block, then the game tries to push him out to the right. Pair that with running speed, and Mario runs faster than what is otherwise possible. In the previous TAS, a trick I like to call "fast deceleration" is used to turn around quickly in the warpzone. Fast deceleration still works in the Japanese version, but it requires a different set of inputs, and it looks visually different.

	"The pipe in the middle of the level is too tall, and there is not enough ground before it to get past it without slowing down. It is possible to precisely slow down and jump so that you lose minimal speed. This stage would normally end in a 3, so I have to slow down at the end once again to avoid fireworks. I release b twice shortly before I reach the flagpole to get a good subpixel. If you grab the flagpole with a specific subpixel, you can gain or lose 1 frame, so I need to set up my subpixel precisely so that I can save as many frames as possible.
