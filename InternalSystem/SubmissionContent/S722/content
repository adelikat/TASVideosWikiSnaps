	"As the 
	(__wikiLink|75M|old movie)
	" description said: "This game is really fast-paced. Do a timeattack on it, and... see yourself :)". Well, I gave it a try, and indeed it is (minus lag at times) ... and I improved the time as well.

	"It's a whole 1:28 faster, mostly from doing the last level much better (by over 30 seconds) and not waiting 40 seconds at the ending before stopping (the old one did that, and all you get at the ending anyway is easy access to the full game soundtrack, which is the 4 songs played in levels). So it's actually about 45 seconds faster through the game.

	"I haven't found any useful glitch, except for a small shortcut through a wall (I wish there was a way to do walljumping or go through walls anywhere, since that'd open some huge shortcuts), but it's still a very fast platform game that's actually quite hard normally, especially at the end.

	"I get hit several times and even die twice, but all at places where avoiding it would take longer, one of the hits even pushed me ahead. Dying only adds a few more seconds than getting hit (which adds 1-2 seconds), and the second death happens during a waiting period (so no time wasted) to avoid dying later.
