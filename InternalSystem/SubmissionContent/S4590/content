	"I watched Randil's previously published TAS to see if it's possible to improve either the end of level fights or reduce the position sacrifices in 2 levels. It was already perfect but I found you can reach the rocket launcher fairly earlier by jumping from proning.

	"The only place where this saves time is the final level's final rocket launcher because the spawn time of the enemies are timed and unmanipulatable.

	"I don't have that much to say here since I didn't really have a hand in this submission other than submitting it. I will say though than I'm glad that other TASers have the same taste in games that I have :) I think this submission goes to show that it's hard to squeeze out frames from this TAS. I hope you like it!
