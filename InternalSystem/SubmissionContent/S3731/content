	"You probably know Nancy Drew. She's a popular fictional character who has a knack for solving (and attracting) all sorts of mysteries. Basically a Mary Sue, being rich, handsome, immensely talented and leading an exciting life.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"As the game begins, she comes to a hotel owned by her friend's friend where accidents have been happening, and rumors even say that it's a ghost behind all the mayhem, perhaps exacting some sort of revenge from beyond the grave. But eventually we find out the problem is a much simpler and common one instead, human greed, and that there's really nothing supernatural going on in the hotel, with the exception of Nancy Drew herself, who knows solutions to puzzles without ever finding them and who causes other strange stuff to happen as well.

[p 
	"This game was originally released on PC, then ported to GBA. I know enough about the PC port to tell that it is not comparable to this port, due to technical limitations of GBA mainly.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I wanted to TAS a pure adventure / storybook game for a while now... This was eventually the game I settled on, due to its short length and the number of exploits it had for saving time.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"About playing the game:
	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The game is divided into chapters. All the chapters take place in the hotel, but between chapters different characters are absent or new pathways open up, allowing you to progress further in the game. It's possible to skip some chapter changes by giving a "double prompt" (read more below), but it's usually pointless and you just get stuck.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Cursor is slowly moved using the directionals. Unfortunately you have to use the cursor to reach path arrows on the screen for moving around, no way around it. Good planning includes minimizing cursor movement time (the most important thing after minimizing screen transitions).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"A is used to select things with the cursor or in the menus, simple enough.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"B is for turning around or going back one screen. There's also an arrow at the bottom of each screen you can examine with A to do the same.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"L and R are used for turning around, which is only possible in certain areas of the game, like the main rooms (dining room, saloon, etc.) and some parts of the corridors (usually where there are crossroads). There are also arrows at the sides of the screen you can examine with A for turning. In areas where you turn with L and R it's usually not possible to use B to turn 180 degrees around, which is pretty annoying. L and R are also used to shift between inventory items.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"About mechanics:
	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Screen transitions are the biggest time waste in the run. Forward and backward transitions are slower than sideways transitions, so the latter are preferred whenever possible. It's also possible to skip transitions here and there by using "double prompts".
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Planning when to take an item from your inventory into your hand with is in a big role as well. I sometimes take an item ready well in advance, even a dozen rooms before when I finally have to use it, as long as its most convenient considering the cursor movement. Makes for an amusing mental image of Nancy running around the hotel pointing a chisel or some other item at everything...
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Ok, so "double prompts". Because this game has its shortcomings in coding and/or testing, you can give double prompts to the game to take more than one step during one screen transition. For example, examine a path arrow with A and press L at the same frame. Nancy steps to next room, and if it's possible, she also turns to left, all in one transition, saving the 70 frames it would've otherwise taken to turn separately.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The combinations include...
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- pressing A+B. Examines and exits at the same time, good for activating triggers without even seeing what you did on the screen. Also, you can use it on a forward arrow to take one step forward and turn 180 degrees at the same time, which is sometimes useful.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- pressing A+L/R. On a forward arrow, you step somewhere and turn at the same transitions. On a back-arrow, you exit a zoom-in and turn on the same transition.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- pressing B on a back-arrow exits two zoom-ins at once, which is sometimes useful.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"It's basically a glitch, and allows some glitchy effects like skipping cutscenes and the chapter end screens.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The room mechanics in the game are just messy. There are sometimes strange ways to save time when moving around by using the double prompts listed above. Especially in the downstairs corridor, where the fastest route from Dining Room to Saloon involves stepping forward while turning 180 degrees, then turning left, then entering the Saloon. A normal person would've just walked forward two steps and then entered the Saloon, but you know... Nancy Drew, a rich eccentric. Let her do what she wants.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Whenever you put a cursor on (or off) some examinable thing, with the exception of the back- and side-arrows in each screen, the game lags for about 6 frames each time. This is pretty bad, and mostly unavoidable. Better remember it when planning cursor movement... don't hit any unnecessary things on the screen or time is wasted. Sometimes simply keeping a cursor on some object emits heavy lag, so that should be avoided at all times too. Especially noticeable when you have an item in hand, in which case many more prompts turn into lag-emitting ones... but this is not a problem unless you keep the cursor on the prompt any longer than what it takes to immediately examine it, so it is still pretty safe to move around long ways with objects in hand without suffering extra lag frames.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"You can move the cursor during the last frame before the 6 extra frames of lag hit you. Useful to remember for getting the most out of your cursor movement.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There's some other strange lag in this game which seems random and makes the game bad for hexing. Based on the frame you do things you can get more or less lag in transitions for example. This is something that I maybe should've looked into more while making the run... I'm sure there are lag frames to be saved here.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"You can examine prompts from the side. That is, press towards them and A at the same time when the cursor is right next to them. This way you examine the prompt without having to first wait for the 6-frame lag to hit you, but this doesn't mean you escape the lag. It just gets added at the same time as the transitional lag. This technique doesn't really save any time, but sometimes you affect the random transition lag this way and can save frames.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Finally, the game doesn't think a pressed button is let go until the next non-lag frame. This means that in places like the opening screens or the cutscene at the end of Chapter 1, you should alternate between buttons for skipping text boxes or you waste frames.

	$LF

[p 
	"When I talk about skipping "scenes" below, I mostly refer to small image transitions that last for maybe two seconds, showing something being operated for example. But there are a few more elaborate cutscenes that are skipped as well.

[p 
	"- trying to manipulate lag away
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- it's possible to call Emily from the Menu at the upper-right corner of the screen too. In best circumstances it might save cursor movement time, although there's an extra 20 frames penalty because of going through the extra menu itself. I couldn't use this tactic in this run, but maybe using a different route it could come in handy.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- I've seen strange stuff happen when activating a certain laggy prompt with an item in hand and pressing A+L to step in and turn at the same time. The prompt in question is the one leading to Parlor during when there's a fire there. Sometimes graphics can go all messed up and the game takes extra seconds in loading the room for some reason... what I'm trying to say is, there may still be some strange glitches in this game to be found.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- In one of my tests, I put out the fire with A+B and the conversation with Rose was be a different one. I tried it here, but it didn't occur. Not sure if it could've saved any time.
