	"The Smurfs is a game released on PSX based on the belgian comic from the same name in which the Hefty Smurfs has to save his friends taken by the wizard Gargamel, by finishing 10 levels. This movie improves turbofa's run by 4572 frames (1:17.11 minutes), by a global optimization in most levels, and by using new glitches

	"Even if the levels are pretty linears, this movie skips uses some glitches to avoid collecting items, and so save time. I really did my best to make this movie as entertaining as possible (grabbing or not cakes, using damage boost to get an extra life), especially in the firsts levels where few tricks are used. The improvement is detailed below

	"This level is the one that is the most different from the previous movie. I have discovered that when you lose the helmet, the game updates the smurfs's state, and you can go through the breakable wall with a correct timing. Using this glitch is faster than going to the present to break the wall. 
	$LF
	"The second glitch used in this level is what I call the "Immaterial glitch" : When you throw a present, your state is updated. But, for some unknown reason, if the present is thrown during a second part of a jump, you will be in a state where you can pass through any sprite in the game, until your state is updated again (for example by jumping). I used this glitch to go through a wall instead of taking the magnifying glass as intended.

	"I also jump later on the rope section to get a speed boost from a bat instead of keeping my speed as in the previous movie

	"Almost the whole level is skipped by taking the secondary exit thanks to a damage boost. "Mashing" pause reduces time before I regain control of the Smurf, I used just the number necessary to reach the plat form

	"In this level, I save some frames by getting a speed boost from the yellow enemy, but the most important gain is that I use death to go back to the checkpoint faster to get the shortcut

	"By swimming near the floor, you can keep the momentum given by the fans, making this level much faster than intended. Hardest stuff is to find the good compromise between getting speed, and reaching the ground as soon as possible

	"I spent hours on the beginning of the level, saving frame by frame trying to find a way to reach the moving plat-form at its first cycle. Despite all my work, I still miss some frames and I have to wait for it. I kept the fastest strat in the movie just to show how close I am to the 1-cycle.

	"Still, some frames are saved by global optimization

	"The ninth level, because maybe someone will find a better way to get/keep speed from the fans

	": Hi, Axodo.  This run had good, significant improvements from the second half, onward.  The pause trick used in the Ice Cave was especially noteworthy, as well as the sprite glitch utilized in the Cave level, prior (in addition to the other improvements made).  While the game, itself, remains a bit limited in entertainment value (although you did spice things up a bit, in spots), this was still nice technical work, all around.  Congrats on your first published run!
