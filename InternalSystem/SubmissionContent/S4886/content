	"The Smurfs is a game released on PSX based on the belgian comic from the same name in which the Hefty Smurfs has to save his friends taken by the wizard Gargamel, by finishing 10 levels. This movie improves turbofa's run by 4572 frames (1:17.11 minutes), by a global optimization in most levels, and by using new glitches

I really did my best to make this movie as entertaining as possible (grabbing or not cakes, using damage boost to get an extra life), especially in the firsts levels where few tricks are used. The improvement is detailed below

	"This level is the one that is the most different from the previous movie. I have discovered that when you lose the helmet, the game updates the smurfs's state, and you can go through the breakable wall with a correct timing. Using this glitch is faster than going to the present to break the wall. 
	$LF
	"The second glitch used in this level is what I call the "Immaterial glitch" : When you throw a present, your state is updated. But, for some unknown reason, if the present is thrown during a second part of a jump, you will be in a state where you can pass through any sprite in the game, until your state is updated again (for example by jumping). I used this glitch to go through a wall instead of taking the magnifying glass as intended.

	": Hi, Axodo.  This run had good, significant improvements from the second half, onward.  The pause trick used in the Ice Cave was especially noteworthy, as well as the sprite glitch utilized in the Cave level, prior (in addition to the other improvements made).  While the game, itself, remains a bit limited in entertainment value (although you did spice things up a bit, in spots), this was still nice technical work, all around.  Congrats on your first published run!
