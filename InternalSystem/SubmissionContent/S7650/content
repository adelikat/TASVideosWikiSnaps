	"Tower of Doom was originally set to be the third AD&D title on the Intellivision with the working title "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Tower of Mystery". The game was only half complete when Mattel Electronics folded in 1984. INTV Corp resumed work on the game in 1986. Not wanting to pay for a renewed D&D license, the game was released under the new name, "Tower of Doom". Even if Tower of Doom is outside the Dungeons & Dragons licence, it has more D&D elements than its two predecessors.

Interestingly, the Novice is the only other character that fulfills the latter two criteria listed above, except his starting throwing weapons (axe and spear) are much weaker. So despite the overhead cost of 36 frames, the Warlock ends up defeating the wizard, and therefore the run, faster.

Which of the above items is actually best depends on the situation. If there are no walls around, the Large Scroll or Mortar and Pestle of Battle is best as the player will be able to move out of the way of the spawned enemy before the game enters the battle screen (which is slow). In this run's situation, the Small Scroll of Summoning is clearly better due to all the surrounding walls and the fact that the rat can be manipulated towards a convenient enough location for transformation and attacking.
