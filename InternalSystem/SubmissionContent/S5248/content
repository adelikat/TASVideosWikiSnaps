	"Shantae is a unique metroidvania game released in 2002 for the Gameboy Color. It is an incredibly ambitious title for the system, featuring a sprawling world with a plethora of content, fluid and beautiful looking graphics, and a female main character. Naturally, it failed miserably when it was first released, but gained a following that's growing to this day thanks to the success of its two sequels.

[p 
	"Shantae's regular half-genie form, and the one she has to be in order to change into any other form. She's relatively fast, has a hair whip that can be used in midair, and only suffers 1 frame of slowdown from jumping. Additionally, she can run across 1-tile gaps without stopping.

[p 
	"The first form Shantae gets, obtained in the Dribble Fountain. Its main gimmick is that it allows Shantae to climb on walls and jump much higher. While it runs just as fast as base form, jumps delay movement an extra 2 frames compared to base form, and it can't attack until I get the Monkey's Claw.

[p 
	"Second form Shantae gets, obtained in the Golem Mine. Compared to monkey and base form, its uses are quite situational. It has a dash move that is able to destroy any obstacles in its path, which can be used as a decently powerful attack. However, this small advantage is completely sidelined by how slow it moves. Can get a stomp ability with the proper item, but it's worthless.

	"The third form Shantae obtains, obtained in Cackle Mound. It moves slowly and can't attack without an upgrade. Its gimmick is that it allows Shantae to climb on background walls and spider webs, which makes it even more situational then the Elephant. Used as little as possible.

	"A special form that Shantae can obtain in Bandit Town the game registers that it's being played on a GBA. It combines the abilities of the first three forms, meaning it can climb on walls, scale backgrounds, use a charge attack, and even use a sword. However, its dance is 1 step longer then the other ones, and its jumps are 3 frames slower compared to base form. Still, it's used in the late game to save some transformations.

	"Shantae's last form, obtained in the Twinkle Palace. It allows Shantae to gain infinite amounts of height, allowing her to grab powerups that are completely out of her reach. However, it builds and loses speed very slowly, and it's unable to attack with the corresponding item. Mainly used for item cleanup.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The disadvantage to this, however, is the sheer amount of luck manipulation required in this game. Everything from enemy drops, to puzzle solutions, to even enemy spawn and movement patterns, require some degree of luck manipulation. Thus, it can take a very long time to get the proper result.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"My pet theory for this is how the game processes Shantae's animation cycle. Whenever she's running or jumping, her animation is very dynamic and requires the game to constantly check to see what's going on. Whenever she attacks, however, her animation is always fixed, freeing the game up to do other things. Or it's just random. Who knows.

	"One of the first tricks I found in this game, letting go of Down a frame before Shantae connects with an attack while crouching will immediately put Shantae in her standing pose, confusing the game and making her attack happen twice.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"While this sounds very useful, its uses are mostly situational due to most enemies having instant invulnerabilty periods. Most prominently, it's used on the first phase of Risky's boat fight to one-cycle the bomb keg.

It can also be used to make Shantae start falling one frame earlier whenever she's going off a ledge to the right.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This trick can sort of be done in Monkey Form, but in that case it only saves a frame, so it's faster to just do a jump and transform out of that.

]h4
[p 
	"If a form jumps into a locked door at a certain angle, they will temporarily shift into a version of base form with an incorrect palette. This will persist until Shantae comes to a complete stop. Since Shantae's base form is fastest in terms of movement, this is used as often as possible to save frames or skip detransformations.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Do note that this does not work on the Firefly scroll or any in-field collectable, since they freeze Shantae's sprite and prevent the death animation until their cutscenes are finished.

[p 
	"In terms of routing, this is by far the most important glitch in the entire run, since it allows for a variety of tricks. I'll elaborate:

]p
[h4 id=ShopGlitching(New!) 
	" Shop Glitching (New!)
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Getting hit by a Storm Puff when starting a shop allows Shantae to move while the menu is still up. Most importantly, leaving at the right time when buying an item not only gives Shantae the item, but due to the way the game handles money transactions, ADDS money to Shantae's wallet based on how much the item was. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Needless to say, this glitch removes the need for Gecko Racing, which saves well over 6 minutes, not counting the time saved on the quicker shops in general.

	" Genie Cutscene Skips (New!)
	$LF

[h4 id=SquidOverflow(New!) 
	" Squid Overflow (New!)
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Dying to a Storm Puff at any point after you start talking to a Mother Warp Squid lets you regain control during the cutscene. If you then talk to her again, you can force an additional text box to show up. The way the game handles multiple text boxes is it'll only allow you to advance one box, but with a times multiplier based on how many boxes are active. For example, if you have two text boxes active, text scrolling will be 2X as fast.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Anyway, doing this glitch when Shantae has 1 Squid in her inventory allows her to trick the game into displaying the 'give squid' option choice an additional time, forcing the game to jump from 0 to 255 squids. Thus, one can setup town warps much earlier then intended by using squids you don't have!
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"It is worth noting that the squid count CAN go back to normal if you collect in-field squids, in which case it'll go from 255 to 0.

This is highly useful, since it can be gotten out in about 4 frames, which is far faster then hair whipping. In addition to that, it's three times as powerful as a hair whip, allowing Shantae to completely annihilate any enemy that doesn't have fixed damage values. As if that weren't enough, if you hit an object or enemy in midair with this thing, you can jump out of it the same way you can with an item, which is used a few times to get some items early.
