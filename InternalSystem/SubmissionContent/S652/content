	"Rockman Zero is a game series that had a different approach than the classical Rockman and Rockman X. This time, you played as Zero from Rockman X, but with a different look than before. The game debuted on the Game Boy Advance in the year 2002, and with it's dark atmospheric looks and rockish music, this series has stayed strong til this very day.

	"This is a full "non-warp" run of Rockman Zero 4, with the difficulty set to Hard Mode.

	"The aim of this run was to take no single damage whatsoever, and also, each mission has to be complete with 100 points average (perfect score). This run does just that and much more.
	$LF

[p 
	"To achieve a scoring of this caliber in this type of Rockman/MegaMan game, the player has to beat the missions with as many enemies as possible killed while still getting low stage clear time at the end and also with minimal damage done to yourself to boot.

	"If you kill too little enemies, you will get lower scoring, and thus, you have to plan what enemies that must be killed while still trying to maintain a decent speed time. If you lose an extralife, you will get low score as well. Same goes for using the aid of cyber elves that gives you better offensive and defensive status. No cyber elves can be used on Hard Mode, so they weren't used in this run. No extralives were lost either.

	"The new weapon that has been added to this particular game, called the Z Knuckle, lets Zero swipe the weapon of another enemy in an instance (well, it's more like this... you must do a killing blow with the Z Knuckle to achieve an enemy's weapon). This opens a huge variety of strategies that can be used for faster routes or even beat a boss quicker than before as well. A good example is the Mega Axe that can be swiped from an Axeroid enemy. It's highly useful against big bosses with huge life meters and it kills most bosses in either 10-20 seconds if used right.

	"To end this "description", the savepoint time of completion is 0:46'20 (46minutes and 20 seconds). This can be seen at the very end of the run, when you have skipped the credits and decide to save your game). The idea of this run was also to do as few re-recordings as possible while still trying to reign surpeme! Nearly 200 re-recordings for a huge game such at this. What are the odds to that, eh?
