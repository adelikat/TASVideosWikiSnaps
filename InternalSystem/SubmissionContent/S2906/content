	"The beginning was pretty hard to get through without having to stop. I didn't think it would be possible at first so I didn't do it, but later found out it was possible (but had to change tires to 'slick', but they didn't seem to be any slower than 'pro slick'), so I redid the beginning. I used death to get through the 5th obstacle faster. The WR on this level is 1.43.118, so it's about 13 seconds faster.
