[div class=p 
	"Jumping is the strangest thing in this game since all jumps have a fixed speed.  You can be going extremely fast on ice, but the moment you jump you lose all that extra speed.   However this also can be used to your advantage on slippery ice that usually takes a long time to start moving forward by jumping.   Stationary jump gets low horizontal movement.  1 frame walking then jumping gives you quite a bit better jump. You get the max jump by moving forward 2 frames then jump.  When jumping you can press the opposite direction to decrease your speed.  Low hanging ceiling jumping can be used to move downward faster than running off ledges.

	"Running as much as possible leads to short sections.  In this game everytime you land you must run again. To run you need 1-about 10 frames of no left or right movement and then left or right in the same direction.  There is a backwards running glitch. If you run left then also press right you face right with no speed penalty.  If you run right and press left then you slowly lose speed while facing right until you end up running left but still facing right.  Running on Ice can result in faster than usual speeds.

Sometimes when running then jumping and slashing the character likes to go far away which is not beneficial in boss fights. 1 frame walking moves about 1 pixel and is used to adjust position in bosses frequently.   It is possible to move in the opposite direction more quickly by releasing all directional input for a frame.

[div class=p 
	"When running off a ledge on a single frame there is a way to conserve forward speed for a time when pressing attack.  You can perform the neutral/up/down slash.  Neutral slash has a long recover time but the longest horizontal slash range.  Down Slash has the longest recover time in most cases, but is very useful when enemies are too close to use the other options. Up Slash has the quickest recovery time.  There is a tech where if you press the opposite direction of running at the frame of the attack you still do the 1FS, but with less speed. This has uses where the landing area is short.

I use that to block a falling projectile from a Bat at one point.  It is also possible to do a Block while running off the ledge and holding down.  You can use this to block projectiles while falling off a ledge although you experience some knockback and I think I removed that particular trick from this run.  There is an excellent use of block to keep your running momentum when getting moving onto a ice floor.  Blocking seems to moves you up 0x40 y subpixel value.

It is possible to continue to Hold Down Slash and bounce indefinitely.  If you hold Jump while bouncing you can achieve a higher bounce.

If you get close enough while calling you can hold your pet.  If you are holding the pet and are in mid air you can glide forward and perform a double jump.  While holding him you can then throw him left, right, or up.  The pet gets larger as the story progresses with the final holding form actually making you unable to move forward, but making grabbing him easier as a tradeoff.

[div class=p 
	"Being able to control him and his path will decide if some parts are fast or not. Typically you delay calling him in a new area a couple frames so he will actually run in your intended direction. The pathing the pet sometimes takes to get to you is...interesting.  He may take large arcing paths ignoring wall and floors. He may completely miss you and shoot off past you.  He may take his sweet time coming to you if he is already close by.  If you repeatedly call him the game seems to get a new path for him and sometimes this is the best way to get him to come to you.  It has sometimes flabbergasted me how sometimes a single Call frame difference has dramatically different paths.  He also has a rubberbanding effect so moving further away while calling him, then moving closer again can result in faster times to hold the pet.

If you are holding the pet on the ground the same thing happens, you get hit, get ejected from block, but still no clip.  If you jump though and are hovering with the pet more likely than not you will get shoved into the floor.  This is still not going to get you anywhere since you get stuck in endless hit loop and die.  However if you are hovering with the pet while moving then you can see an oddity one one frame where your X position will be shifted slightly in the opposite direction from where you are moving.  Doing this in a corner can get you slightly more to the right out of the area, but no matter what you do it still seems not enough to escape the fallen block.  If you throw the pet though at just the right frame area while moving left you can get enough distance to the right to escape the block.  Keep pressing left to get the zip and get ejected right.  I found how to do this slightly above the floor by doing this as early as I could manage. This allows me more vertical height so I can starting moving right then left in an arc to get into the exit door earlier. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"This is my theory of how it works. Normally when getting crushed by a block you can get pushed down to the floor.  So the game will move you down adjusting for your height.  When you are holding the pet you get pushed down for both you and your pet's height.  By releasing the pet you somehow get locked into moving in that one direction so you get extra movement.  And while in the wall you press left to move right, because the game is trying to eject you left if you move right, but pressing left will cause the game to eject you right.

To do it you must get the right speed and angle.  During the bouncing you must adjust the height of the bounces as well.  The last bounce needs to be a hit, but short enough so that you also bounce backwards off of him and either get ready for the next cycle or to exit.

	"The Slime miniboss took awhile to get a decent time on.  He has two phases. The first phase you need to kill 10 slimes for him to move slower backwards as long as you are near him.  He will continue moving back until you can get into the door.  It does not seem possible to go through him or get bounced out of him towards the door.  I think they might have programmed him to always have some force pushing you to the left.  I tried several techs like bouncing off of slimes to bounce on top of the slime and getting hit to get well into its body but to no avail.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"In the first phase there is an the issue where sometimes an "Evil Slime" will spawn that is half inside the boss's body and it is difficult to get at.  You have to wait until it bounces out.  The first phase spawns slimes but you have to only kill 10 for him to move back, and there is a maximum of 3 slimes out at a time that spawn in set intervals as long as there are not 3 slimes spawned.  a poorly spawning slime means the next slime will need to have a delay since I cannot possibly make it.  So instead for the next slime after the bad one, I hit it in such a way so that it will overlap with following one. Then I can stack them and kill those two at the same time, putting me back into a rhythm.  This will work as long as the horribly spawning slime does not appear as one of the last two slimes to spawn.  Though it seems rare for that to even happen where it spawns and falls half into the boss...

	"The Sky Castle boss uses attacks from his hands that target you. His hands are also his weak point.  When he uses a single hand to attack it will be on the side of the body that you were on when he raised his hands.  He also has an attack using both hands. That dual handed attack is a problem since there is normally no real safe way to hit it while it is shooting lightning at you and still hit him at the next earliest hit.  However while his hands are not shooting there is a frame section that allows you to do a Down Slash and then bounce up.  If you position him where his hands would be on the edge of the screen you can continually bounce. Here I only lose 1 frame doing that when he does the dual hand attacks.

The heads move in such a way that you cannot hit them at the same time.  The heads try to ram into you and hit you, and they can also shoot out a magic attack. This attack's hit box is not dynamic so the moment the boss uses the attack the full hit-box is used even if the graphic does not show it.  When they are ready to use the Petrification attack their hit-boxes disappear. That full screen move is not avoidable with this setup. If I had the Legendary Sword then I could kill him before he uses the Petrification attack though.  The pet comes in again and stops him from using it again.
