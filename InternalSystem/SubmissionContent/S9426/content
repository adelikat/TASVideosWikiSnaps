[div class=p 
	"MoHawk & Headphone Jack is a very strange game for the Super Nintendo. It has a rotational mechanic, which rotates the camera throughout the game based on what direction Mohawk is being pulled in by gravity. The game is notorious for being quite confusing and sickness-inducing due to this mechanic, along with the clunky gameplay and confusing level layouts. The gravity mechanic is kind of like Super Mario Galaxy, where entering a certain area in a level can change the gravity to pull you upward, or to the left, etc. This makes the levels pretty annoying to navigate, since the rotation messes with how you can visualize the level. Fortunately, you can press Select at anytime and this allows you to move the camera around and get a map of the entire level! The objective is to collect enough of the small CD-ROMs scattered throughout the levels in order to open the path to the next level, with the requirement getting higher as you progress. The second level of each world is a boss level, which you have to navigate to the boss room. Once you defeat the boss, the warp to the next world opens. Throughout the game, Mohawk blares his rock music in the background of the entire game (except for boss fights). You can change the soundtrack by collecting large CDs scattered throughout the levels, and once you collect a track you can switch between the ones you have collected on the pause screen. Health is measured by the small spinning triangles on the bottom of the screen. You can hold up to 5 of these at a time, and you can usually find these scattered throughout the levels. If Mohawk loses all his health and takes one more hit, it will use a life and send you back to the last checkpoint.

[div class=p 
	"Mohawk has two moves that he can use: His main move is rolling. You can roll by holding down Y, and it is your main attack against enemies. You can also block some attacks when you're rolling, however this is not always the case. Rolling can also allow you to skip collecting items, like CDs and hit points. However you cannot roll forever, as after holding Y for a certain amount of time, Mohawk will automatically unroll and you will have to repress Y to get him to roll again. He also has a screen-wide explosion move that you can perform by pressing X, provided you have enough charges which are shown as miniature Mohawks in the top left of the screen. This destroys all enemies on screen, but it has a very long animation and should be avoided wherever possible. It can also be used to attack bosses, however it only will count 3 hits for the entire animation. Mohawk can also perform a small jump by pressing A, and a high jump by pressing B.

	"This level has one-hit-kill fire barriers that we are supposed to find the correct valves in order to get rid of them. Instead of that, damage boosts are used to go through the fire barriers, allowing us to access parts of the levels that we shouldn't be able to. We also use two deaths to be able to get back to certain points much quicker. At one part, we need to lure a worm to be able to damage boost through the barrier and hit a switch. In the RTA world record run, we are supposed to use the worm to damage boost through the barriers 4 times, however I found a way to skip two of those boosts. By flying into the bottom corner of the curved ledge, the game allows us to just clip right through it. The first time around, we can use this to hit the switch and get back underneath the area where the switch is much quicker. For some reason, if done correctly, this allows us to open a "path" to the area underneath where the fire barrier is. This saves us time over having to lure the worm over to the barrier and damage boosting through. We can use this same clip the second time through, being able to fly through the ceiling on the other side and skipping the other fire barrier. This level is the longest, as it requires 350 to open the warp to the next level, and there is only 355 in the entire level.
