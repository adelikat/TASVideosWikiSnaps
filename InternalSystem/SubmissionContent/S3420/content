	"- The 1st path the AI will do depends on the previous level input (ABSTUDLR)
	$LF

	"Overall, I made a TAS which completes the game then rerecord the whole to optimize it and get the best luck at all bosses and scenes. Notice that sometimes it looks like it's possible to improve a level but it just visual. For instance, obtaining the multiball powerup will change the AI's mind even if I don't pick it up, that's why it could look "clumsy" while it's actually a great pull I did.
