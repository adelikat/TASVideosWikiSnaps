	"The game is all about luck. Hence the rerecord number, I learned how the game works:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- The 1st path the AI will do depends on the previous level input (ABSTUDLR)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- The spawn depends on the current frame the level starts
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- The AI acts depending:
	$LF
]p
[pre 
	"  1. is there a power up
	$LF
	"  2. what type of power up
	$LF
	"  3. where are the players (X and Y)
	$LF
	"  4. semi random (input)
	$LF
]pre
[p 
	"- The bosses has a "check input at every frame and act as I want" thing.

	"Overall, I made a TAS which completes the game then rerecord the whole to optimize it and get the best luck at all bosses and scenes. Notice that sometimes it looks like it's possible to improve a level but it just visual. For instance, obtaining the multiball powerup will change the AI's mind even if I don't pick it up, that's why it could look "clumsy" while it's actually a great pull I did.
