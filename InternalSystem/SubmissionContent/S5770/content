Some events are unavoidable, like Kid Klown getting blown by wind, or getting surprised by the first axe. I actually lose 2 frames by rolling on one of the logs, however if you go faster (cutting 0.03 seconds off the timer) the cards will be in a worse location for the next level, costing approximately 10 frames instead. Therefore, I kept the 2 frame slower path.

	"Unlike every other level, this one has speed boosts in the form of springs on the ground. Because these put you faster than your natural running speed, you really want to use up all that speed before collecting a card. That's why we needed to manipulate the card location on this level by going slower in stage 1. The wall I climb over is unavoidable, but you can button mash to climb up faster.

A pitchfork will appear out of the sky and crash down on your head. I can only just barely touch the ground (for about 2 frames, enough to start a jump) when the pitchfork hits me anyway. I tried a bunch of different types of jumps, but I couldn't avoid the pitchfork. As a result, it's faster to squeeze through. I slow down, costing 0.07 seconds on the timer (about 4-5 frames) to manipulate the end sequence.
