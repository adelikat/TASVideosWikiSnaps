	"Donkey Kong 64 chronicles the adventure of five simians to defeat the evil reptile King K. Rool. To get the final key to fight the King you must collect 100 Gold Bananas (think Super Mario 64 stars), thousands of loose bananas, two special coins hidden behind classic arcade games, 15 banana medallions, 4 battle crowns, dozens of banana coins, and more. The game has even made it into the Guinness Book of Records for “Most Collectable Items”.

[div class=p 
	"There are two main goals in this run: spawn K. Rool, and beat K. Rool. The former requires the third and eighth key in this game - keys 1, 2, and 4-7 are supposed to be “required” to get key 8. The latter requires getting enough abilities for the Kongs that they can win the 10+ minute fight.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Central to this run is a trick called “Main Menu Mode” (MMM). Freeing all the Kongs and buying moves turns out to be a very time consuming process, but through MMM that can be skipped. Much of the middle of the run is devoted to setting up and executing MMM. This includes unlocking seemingly useless features on the main menu, notably a Rambi minigame and the ability to re-watch cutscenes.

	"The final time of this run is slower than the best real time runners. This is for three reasons.

	[li

		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Unlike this TAS, real time runs start with main menu features already unlocked. As is standard, I avoid using dirty SRAM. This makes for a more entertaining run with less questionable validity. This choice costs on the order of 4.5 minutes.

This is thanks to new techniques to optimize movement, a new trick (phasewalking) that makes passing through walls even easier and faster than before, and a new route (and corresponding tricks) that skips learning how to throw orange grenades.

Thanks to TJ Blakely for discovering phasewalking and making this redo worth the effort. But dude, don't find a major glitch immediately after I submit this again. And thanks to theballaam96 for helping me get this route working with his original research on temporary flags.

	", typically in real time DK64 speedruns, dirty sram is used. Like the previous movie, this submission also avoids dirty sram. However, the lack of said SRAM barely seems to slow this TAS down at all. As such this should continue to be the standard for this particular branch.
