	", each character is given a default ID; when entering All-Star mode, not only is the list of characters set, but also the list of IDs is randomized for future All-Star rolls. The RNG manipulation tool can check not only the default ID list, but also lists after re-rolling, to minimize the time required to achieve a satisfactory lineup. The RNG manipulation tool provided a route which involved traveling to a specific RNG seed (by random selecting characters on the Classic mode Character Select Screen), re-rolling the list of All-Star characters four times, and traveling to another seed (again with random select). This is feasible for (and indeed, the tool was developed for) RTA runs, as Melee's RNG seed does not iterate over time while in menus and the current seed (a 32-bit integer) can be uniquely determined by random selecting at least 9 characters in a row on any Character Select Screen.
