	"input after suicide creates tons of broken objects that get read from $0B in RAM and then the pointer jumps over $B addresses each time (object descriptor line length), thinking he reads from ROM. giving him needed values is pretty much possible. especially creating objects by direct input (that is stored in $15 and $16). but some objects need special attribute values, that aren't read from descriptor lines, but loaded other ways. finding the ways to load the needed values, and figuring out the very values and addresses - will take time until this submission is obsoleted

	"The 
	[a class=intlink href=/1920M

	" found a shortcut in level 3 which essentially leads to a buffer overflow. Instead of abusing that glitch to its fullest, it simply took the data initially written there and skipped a single level. This run now fully abuses that glitch by writing new data and using it to skip 14 levels straight to the final boss fight room.

	"Now entertainment wise, I vastly prefer the previous run, and even find that run star worthy. However since the same initial glitch is used, even if not fully abused,
