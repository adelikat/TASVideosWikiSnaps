	"When the top row is cleared, the game seems to get confused and also clears the bottom row, counting another line (but tetrises don't clear 5 lines, it keeps a full line instead). So I score tetrises by doing triples at the top, and at the same time set up the rest for more tetrises (as leftover rows fall to the bottom). I actually found this glitch back in 2006 while doing a

	"Placing blocks this high sadly isn't possible at level 19, but barely works at 18, so I start at 18 instead (and had to score 2 more tetrises). It's still hard to fit (and manipulate) the blocks up there, since I had to repeatedly fill the top few rows ... so I made this easier by bruteforcing again!
