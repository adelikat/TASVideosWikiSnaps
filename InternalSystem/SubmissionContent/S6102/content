	"When jumping, releasing and pressing jump button again stops the ascending phase of the jump, setting the vertical velocity to zero. This allows to break ground blocks faster, and more generally gives a lot more air control.

	"Pressing attack on the ground and jumping one frame after results in a grounded slash in the air. It is very useful to attack enemies in the air without triggering a dashslash (which is much longer). Combined with the fast fall, we have enough time to land before the slash animation ends. Hop slash duration is one frame longer than a normal slash, so it must only be used when necessary.
