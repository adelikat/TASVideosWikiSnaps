	". Welcome to our community. You have picked a very good game to TAS, but unfortunately...there are issues with your movie. As 
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/Spikestuff

	" has stated, there is already a faster 
	[a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn0unJPFtqI rel=noopener external nofollow 
		"TAS
	]a
	" of this goal. That, in itself, directly breaks our our top rule of beating all known times...even if there isn't an existing publication. Throughout your movie, there are places where you slow down and/or even wait for obstacles to clear a way. As you will see, our site has many high quality TASes that make use of "down-time". It may be a hard road to accomplish, but that is exactly what many members of our community have done.

	"As a new member of this site, please don't feel discouraged...as it takes some time to get used to the rules and how we operate. Normally, you can submit these types of movies in our "WIP / Userfile" section. There, you can get feedback from others on the quality and entertainment of your work. I normally ask some authors to go back to try to clear up some issues, but in this case...Super Mario Bros. has been a heavily sought after game and it is unlikely that you will be able to accomplish that. So, for the time being...please remember to take your time and go for the impossible. It will certainly be rewarding.
