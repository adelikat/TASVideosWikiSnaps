	"The premise of the film follows a ghost named Beetlejuice as he helps a newly-dead couple to scare a new family from the now dead couples former home.  The game doesn't match this very well.

[ul 
	[li 
		"This game is very hard to play normally!
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Optimizing the TAS itself was difficult as multiple route options exist for most stages, and enemy spawn points are RNG based (more obvious on top-down levels).
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Side-scrolling levels are basic platforming consisting of timed jumping and the occasional attack.  Sometimes the goal is to simply reach the exit. With others times, items need to be collected in the level to finish.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Top-view levels often have a mild adventure element in that you must find various objects to give to other people before a route will open to the exit. On a few occasions all the enemies must be scared (killed) before you can exit through the door.

	"Warp Glitch - Only works on top-view levels.
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This glitch is performed by pressing all four directional buttons on the same frame.  Doing so immediately adds 256 to Beetlejuice's horizontal coordinate position instantly transporting him approximately one screen width to the right.  While minor out of bounds can be obtained, limited motion is available when you get out of bounds.  In most cases the glitch is only beneficial when there is normal walkable ground at the resulting x-coordinate. If the resultant position is on the room exit point, the glitch will immediately exit the room without any more necessary movement.  As this glitch requires all four directions to be pressed at once, it is not possible on a standard NES controller.  Other combinations of movement buttons not possible on the standard controller also affected horizontal and vertical position coordinates, but none were beneficial.
