		" After landing from jumps onto a flat surface Chester usually does a short bounce. I try to turn this to my advantage whenever possible.
		$LF

	[li 
		" Upon landing after bouncing on an enemy Chester has to start his running animation again, so I avoid jumping on enemies if I can.

		" High jump is always the same height & is necessary to break through blocks from below.

	[li 
		" Chester can "swim" up to 3 times to gain extra height in mid air. This counter resets after bouncing on an enemy. I use this repeatedly in the run to help hit bosses on the first possible frame.

		" The plane boss is manipulated to keep appearing from the same side so that I can use air swims to repeatedly hit it.
		$LF

	[li 
		" For the very last hit, landing on the plane as soon as possible actually wastes time because you have to wait for the dead boss to slowly move off-screen before the fight actually ends. I instead wait to hit him on the most optimal frame.
