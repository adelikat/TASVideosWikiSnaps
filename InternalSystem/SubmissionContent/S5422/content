	"Whenever Jennifer has to change directions, it is quicker to change her direction, cancel her movement, and then start running again. Similarly, when her movement gets interrupted (most often during Hole Skip and Dog Skip), it is quicker to cancel her movement and start running again to get out of her recovery animation faster.
