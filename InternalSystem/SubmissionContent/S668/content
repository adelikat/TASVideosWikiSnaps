	"The goal of this movie was to balance speed and entertainment. There are times in the run where I willingly sacrifice a small amount of time to make the run more entertaining. Overall, I estimate I lost one minute, possibly a minute and a half tops by doing this, but it goes a long way towards making the movie more fun to watch. I would rather have people see a 46 minute movie that's interesting than a 45 minute run that's boring.

	"I chose Zan for many reasons. He's severely underrated, for one. His range is superb, his throw (as well as his ability to throw both ways) and directed special are top notch, and since throwing enemies into each other (in most cases) is the fastest way to kill them, this leads to some pretty interesting stunts in the movie. His speed is irrelevant because he dashes at the exact same speed the screen scrolls, so getting a faster character is a waste. Plus, seeing an old man beat the hell out of everyone never gets old.

	"There are countless times in the movie where it looks like I can grab/ kill an enemy faster, but I assure you that the wait is for a reason. Most of the time, it's to manipulate the enemy's AI or possibly other enemies' (for example, in the first set of Soozies I encounter, I grab one and wait, because if I throw her immediately, the second Soozie that enters will jump way out of range, costing more time in the end). Other times I wait for good opportunities to throw enemies into each other. This is almost always worth waiting for, especially if we're talking about hitting 3 or more enemies. Other times an enemy will be on the edge of the screen and will (look) like he/she can be grabbed. Unfortunately, this isn't true.

	"On some enemies, I use dragged out combos with weaker hits (i.e. two punches, a downward jump attack, two flurries[grab attacks], and a throw) because for some enemies it takes forever for them to get up (Electras are good examples), and it's actually faster to do this than to just throw and wait for them to get back up. I usually use this as a finishing combo. Other enemies, such as Donovans, get up really quickly, so just throwing them is faster.

	"Enemy trigger points were also important. You've got "sets" of enemies  where you have to defeat every enemy before more will come. In these cases, I focused on enemies with more health (and throwing them into weaker enemies). Then you have times where the game wants a certain number of enemies on-screen at one time, and will dump new enemies to replace killed ones. In these cases, I focused on the weaker enemies (and throwing them into each other) so that new enemies can be killed quicker. Occasionally there will be enemies that drop in after a certain amount of time regardless. For that, all you can do is wait...

	"Menu selection in the beginning wasn't perfect for some reason. I had gone nearly frame by frame and had chosen what looked to be the first available time I could move the cursor and select the options. When I played the movie back (after completing Stage 1), I realized I was apparently mistaken. However, due to the extreme difficulty of manipulating every single enemy move in Stage 1 again to match what I had done, I did not go back and redo it, as I could have very well lost time in the end.

	"Pretty self-explanitory. I only threw the agents with guns at the end despite them taking a long time to get up. This was done because they don't take flurry hits well at all (they will break out of the grab and hit you). I also placed emphasis on getting them in the middle of the screen because they tend to camp just out of grabbing range, which is very annoying.

	"Three reasons for hitting (and not killing) the bikers. The first is entertainment, the second is that if you kill them, you lose a lot of time, as the game waits for the biker to disappear before it throws another one on the screen. The third is that if you hit them, they go across the screen faster than usual, and when they're gone, the next bikers come. This saves time (except for the very last biker...by then the boat shows up and then it doesn't matter if you kill him or not).
