	"I would like to thank Hero of the Day for his thread and his comment on L+R / U+D glitch being used to pass through solid objects and walls. I was already aware of the L+R / U+D glitch being used to keep the character moving in whatever direction you like and attack up directly, but I didn't know that it also makes the character go thorough objects and walls. I also would like to thank Hero of the Day again for his quick test-run which I could compare my run to. Here is the table; the timing is done for each stage when the screen turns white when a stage is completed and the end of movie.
