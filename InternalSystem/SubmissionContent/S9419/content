	"This is a TAS of Paper Mario World 2. This is the followup to the previous Flash game, this time released in 2010 by Lesjuh once again. Mario goes through the desert this time around, now having to defeat a new enemy, which also has a skull looking face (which looks like it came straight out of Super Meat Boy or something). This game feels overall more polished than the first game, though it still has it's quirks.

	": After clarificaiton via the forum about some of the jumping against platforms, this seems ok.  I am a bit curious on damage boosting; it's done in a few places, but then other times mario hesitates to not get hit by fireballs.  I'm curious if damage boosting the other situations would allow for a faster run.  Unfortunately I'm unable to directly test these curiosities, so I'll give the author the benefit of the doubt as the rest of the run appears fairly well otimized.  If someone can beat this run, great.  Accepting for now.
