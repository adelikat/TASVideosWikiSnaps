	"Playing around. Just for fun, I had no intention to be fast. I Can still improve it a lot, but, as the save state function doesn't work properly with this game, doing it can be a bit frustrating! Because of this, I think that this is the first TAS of the Shadow Dancer Arcade! I'm satisfied with the final result. The game was developed on the Sega System 18 motherboard hardware. Home versions were released for the Master System and various home computers. A loose adaptation was also developed for the Mega Drive/Genesis titled Shadow Dancer: The Secret of Shinobi.

	": Hi BrunoRaji, and welcome to TASVideos! If savestates aren't properly/fully implemented for a particular Arcade driver, it would mean that game can't be effectively TASed. It's not possible for a human to tweak tiny portions of input having a backup state only at the start of the level. Among all other platforms this game was published for (excluding the Genesis version, which is different), only Master System is fully TASable, while for this version, it's not. Rejecting, with a hope you'll do an SMS run for this game.
