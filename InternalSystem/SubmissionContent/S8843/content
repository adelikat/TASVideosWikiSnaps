		" The landing animation is a few frames long and stops you, jumping can cancel this animation, at the cost of at least one frame, so cancelling the animation by jumping depends on each situation, maybe you do it to skip several animations, or continue the jump chain up to a point where the animation can be cancelled in some oher way, like taking damage

		" I don't continue jumping or try stop skip the landing animation when at the end of the level since the character has to do its walking animation, after which the level actually ends, so its better to trigger that animation as soon as possible, and it doesn't triger while not grounded

	"The first three levels can be done in any order, the only thing that matters in the order is that the Brachiosaurus Area is done last, since the car position at the end of it is 20 frames faster than the car position if one of the other levels where done last.

	"On the Brachiosaurus Area, there's a section, where the falling rocks appear, where I break the jump chain and it seems like it should be possible to continue, this is done because that's a major lag point, and continue jumping would create a lot more lag frames that you'd save.

	"On the boss of the Brachiosaurus Area, I shoot first before going to the button and turn on the lights, this shot is done to get the boss to start going towards me, which speeds up the fight since you can only shoot a few frames after the previos shot has landed. The lights have to be on because otherwise the boss in invulnerable.

	"On the triceratops autoscroller, there's points where I stop walking, and even a point where I slide into some spikes, this is because when the triceratops breaks the platforms, it can create a lot of lag, which is minimized by standing still, sliding into the spikes is done to get ahead and be able to stand still later on.
