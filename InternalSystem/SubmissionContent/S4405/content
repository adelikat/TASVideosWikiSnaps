	"This is my very first TAS movie on the Internet! Today! I'm going to be playing Super Donkey Kong 2: Dixie and Diddy as a TAS. Here, Diddy and Dixie will speed up rescuing Donkey Kong from the evil Kremling Kaptain K. Rool, using their feet, bashing through Kremlings and playing as Animal Buddies. I have some problems that there were some death threats in Chain Link Chamber and during the K. Rool Duel battle. Anyways, this is going to be the best TAS ever! After the K. Rool Duel battle, K. Rool fell down into the ocean and the Kongs listened for Cranky Kong because they rescued Donkey Kong and then the credits began to be displayed. I know that the Parrot Chute Panic level without Squawks was a little easy. And also, one of the levels in Krazy Kremland had a few trys untill I beat the world. Anyways, enjoy my first ever TAS!
