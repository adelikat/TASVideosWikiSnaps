	"Super Mario 4 (aka Super Mario Land 4) is a bootlegged hack of the Game Boy game 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Crayon Shin-Chan 4|href=/2143M)
	". The level design is completely different and is the main subject of the game's criticism due to the borderline unfair increase in difficulty when compared to Crayon Shin-Chan 4; this issue is also caused by the lack of a password system and continues. The game has four levels, but each are incredibly lengthy.
