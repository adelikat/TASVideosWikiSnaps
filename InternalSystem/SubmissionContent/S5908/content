	"Super Mario 4 (aka Super Mario Land 4) is a bootlegged hack of the Game Boy game 
	(__wikiLink|2143M|Crayon Shin-Chan 4)
	". The level design is completely different and is the main subject of the game's criticism due to the borderline unfair increase in difficulty when compared to Crayon Shin-Chan 4; this issue is also caused by the lack of a password system and continues. The game has four levels, but each are incredibly lengthy.

	": This bootleg appears to be decently notable, and compared to its base game it has a fair amount of unique content with its new level designs. The run itself is also well done, but the constant flying gets repetitive and its sound effects annoying over time. Accepting for the Vault.
