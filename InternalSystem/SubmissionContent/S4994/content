	"After making the 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Sonic Advance 3 "100%" TAS|href=/4930S)
	", I knew that the any% could stand to be improved significantly. What initially held me back was my lack of confidence to improve nitsuja's already well-optimised work; looking back now, I'm glad I took on this challenge! This run is an improvement of 1218 frames of in-game time and 2443 frames overall (31.07 seconds) compared to the currently published any% run by nitsuja.

	(__wikiLink|displaytext=nitsuja's run|href=/1192S)
	". Most, if not all of the entire TAS was done while analysing his movie and using it as a reference in a separate window. Most of my lengthy commentary will make references to his run, especially the boss stages. Some of my words here will closely mirror that of his submission as well. I also won't be going into too much detail regarding the game's various tricks and techniques as nitsuja has already amply described many of them in his submission.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"There were a few other tricks I discovered which nitsuja didn't mention though. The first one involves catching the partner and not using the tag action; if you do that while jumping upwards, the "catch" provides a small upward boost which can be very useful sometimes (one example where it saved a lot of time was in the Cyber Track overworld, on the set of pendulums before the Act 3 ring). Another noteworthy trick revolves around the moving platforms in the Ocean Base levels. If you jump along the side of said platform (be it a normal jump or a tag action), you immediately come to a stop at the edge of the platform. For some odd reason, jumping on the exact frame you land gives a huge vertical boost, several times higher than a normal jump would give. This trick was used twice in Ocean Base 1, and once in Ocean Base 2.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"This TAS was done with VBA-rr v23.5 svn421, with the "Auto-hold" function on R (to always charge a tag action). I only have to press R once to "release" the R button and use my tag action. I also opened a separate VBA window alongside, and ran nitsuja's movie to look through his inputs in common areas and try to improve them (although most of his work is already incredibly optimised for a run done 9 years ago). I also run a lua script (kindly provided by Anty-Lemon) which details X/Y coordinates, X/Y velocity and a timer which also runs in the overworld.

	"Although there are 20 different teams from 5 different characters to choose from, not all of them are used in this run for two reasons: 1) Not all characters are unlocked from the start; 2) not all teams are fast and/or mobile enough to fit into a run aiming for speed. Here are the teams I use in the run, listed in their order of appearance:
	$LF

[h4 id=TailsSonic 
	" Tails/Sonic
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"The most used team in this run, accessible from the very beginning of the game. This is definitely the most broken team for any run aiming for speed. Sonic's tag action gives immediate boost mode and, thanks to a bug, allows for an immediate jump after using the tag action (more details in nitsuja's submission). Boosting off a downward surface (preferably a completely vertical one) gives an enormous speed boost; combine this with the fact that Tails maintains his horizontal speed completely when flying, and you have a team which can blast through most levels quickly with ease. However, due to the fact that, on a vertical surface, you have to release the tag action the exact frame it is charged, this makes optimising jumps extremely troublesome as I have to determine the exact frame to begin charging the tag action. The only downside of Tails/Sonic which has a significant impact on this run is their poor vertical movement. This brings us to the next team...

]div
[h4 id=SonicTails 
	" Sonic/Tails
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"This team can attain boost mode, but only from running off a booster. With Tails' tag action giving a high jump, as well as Sonic's potential to reach high speeds, S/T is a great team in levels which require a lot of vertical movement. However, they are a lot slower than T/S as they don't have access to instant boost mode (and consequently, boost-jumping).

[h4 id=SonicKnuckles 
	" Sonic/Knuckles
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"This team's main selling point is the upward flame burst attack which Sonic can use only when Knuckles is his partner. Sonic also has a cooler slide attack, with increased sliding distance and a cool flame animation. Pressing B mid-jump also gives a speed boost and is very useful when used immediately after jumping out of a spindash. While the upward flame burst attack is greatly overshadowed by better vertical movements in Tails and Cream's tag actions in the individual levels, Sonic's upward attack doesn't require any charging (unlike a tag action), allowing him to demolish the Ocean Base boss quickly.

[div class=p 
	"I really like this team a lot. This is the only team which can spindash straight up walls, and is probably the most versatile team of all. Their only downside would be their inability to boost, which unfortunately slows them down in most levels, making a +Sonic team better in such cases. Unfortunately I use this team only once in the Cyber Track boss because they have the fastest exit from the battlefield. K/A can do two levels faster than any other team can: Sunset Hill 3 and Ocean Base 2, but they are inaccessible when playing through those levels the first time.

	"This is an amazing team, with the ability to make quick, fast jumps (albeit not as high as Tails' tag action) without losing much speed. Unlike with Tails, Cream's tag action maintains most of your horizontal speed and momentum, making her very useful in two of the largest levels in the game. However, this is an extremely difficult team to TAS, because very careful planning is needed for every tag action to land as soon as possible. It's a pity that Cream is unlocked so late in the game.

However, T/A is put to great use in Chaos Angel 3, where boosting is useless and prolonged flight is crucial.

	"The "timer" address (0300094E), which shows the level timer in frames, also runs in the overworld acting like a "hidden timer". This helped me a lot in optimising the overworld navigations. Perhaps an interesting improvement would be doing Chaos Angel 2 first then followed by Chaos Angel 1. Since exiting act 1 would drop you into a pit, forcing you to high jump back up, it was a little faster to do act 2 first then jump down into act 1, after which I would simply reset to the next team.

	"The only act which I used a different team than nitsuja is Chaos Angel 3. While the additional reset to Tails/Amy costs about 10 seconds, this was compensated by not resetting at Altar Emerald. Using the same team for the Chaos Angel boss and the final boss also meant that I didn't have to waste time travelling from the factory ring to the Altar Emerald ring with a completely different team.

	"It is worth noting that due to the unavailability of some characters early on in the game, not all the levels in this TAS were done with their optimal teams; I simply use the team I have at that point which can beat the level as fast as possible. If anyone is interested in seeing these levels completed with a faster team, you can click on the faster team's name in the notes below.

Even though I already have Knuckles unlocked at this point, I stuck to Sonic/Tails instead because Sonic must be the leader to unlock Amy on this particular stage; two subsequent levels (the Cyber Track boss and Chaos Angel 3) would take considerably longer to complete without Amy as a partner.
