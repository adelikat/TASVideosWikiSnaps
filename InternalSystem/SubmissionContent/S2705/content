	"I've submitted quite a few shorter runs recently so here is something a little different. It's a more substantial submission from me and a first SNES submission. Do Re Mi Fantasy is a fantastic game. It is probably one of the best, comparatively, sequels ever made if one considers just how bad its predecessor, 
	[a class=intlink href=/557M 
		"Milon's Secret Castle
	]a
	", was. The sequel is completely different. Released only in Japan at the end of the SNES lifespan this is a huge platformer covering seven diverse worlds, a great soundtrack, and now famous (amongst SNES fanboys) graphics and style. This run aims to beat this game as fast as possible. The general premise (according to wikipedia) is that Milon, a young boy, heads on a mission to restore the music from the forest of his hometown and rescue his friend, the fairy Alis, from an evil wizard known as Amon, who is also responsible for the music's disappearance.

	"The best thing about playing (watching) this game is the suspense about what cool, creative quirks are coming up next, so here are a few pointers on the run without spoiling anything.
	$LF

[ul 
	[li 
		" Milon runs when you hold the Y button. His speed does not change in the air (it is 2 pixels per frame). Milon's speed increases to 3 pixels per frame when running down a slope or over fast flowing water.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Through the game you can pick up various power-ups. The best is the floating boots which gives you a longer jump. There are a few instances before I get it that it could save a couple of frames, but the boot itself is always too out of the way to be beneficial. I wait until it falls naturally into my path in world 3. Although it appears that I lose velocity while using the hover boots I actually don't. I try and minimise their use to avoid SMW 'fly over everything' syndrome.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" You can also get power ups to allow you to have more bubbles on screen. This would allow me to break blocks a couple of frames faster, but they are also to far out of my way to be worthwhile. It is not until world 6 that it falls naturally into my path.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" World 1 is something of a practice world. In all subsequent worlds I must collect a special star in each level in order to get into the end of world 'Ghost House'.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" To kill enemies you can either trap them in a bubble or jump on them. If you jump on them in mid-air they turn into platforms for short periods of time allowing me to skip some sections of some levels.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" This game has many levels. Unfortunately three of them are autoscrollers. The first one in World 2 I actually quite enjoy. However, there are two in world 6 (6-2 and 6-4) and both are incredibly boring and long. Feel free to fast forward them.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" The movements against the last boss may seem somewhat erratic. This is luck manipulation in order to prevent him using his whirlwind attack. It makes him invincible for a considerable period of time.
