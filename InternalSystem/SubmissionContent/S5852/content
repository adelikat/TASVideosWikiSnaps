	"This is a new TAS of this weird bootleg. This is an improvement of 567 frames, or roughly 9.29 seconds faster than the currently published run back in 2014. This improves every single level with some route changes, more use of tricks and overall better optimization throughout. Because of much more accurate emulation, lag and longer load times are obviously present here.

	"Thanks to the better use of a trick that lets you stop sliding after a run jump by pressing B, I'm able to go to the first platform and jump much faster. I also avoid taking a hit and do an extra slide jump. Also the end is slightly faster too thanks to cancelling my attack animation earlier. Saved about a full second.

	"Since running doesn't work on this level for some reason, this one has the least amount of frames saved, about 21 frames saved or something. This was done by climbing the ladder earlier so I could warp to the top faster. Then I make an extra jump and shoot the Crobat in order so I can fall through the floor a little earlier. I aslo take an intentional hit on a Hitmonchan at the end which a couple of frames faster.

	"Ever since I first made the old TAS, I have improved as a TASer and even as a person. I'm pretty different now in 2018 compared to 2013-2015 me. This is a nice way of viewing how much I have improved and stuff. Now as for what I'll do next, well... Club Penguin improvement, for one, but maybe something else before I tackle that since that one is a big project. I'm not sure.
