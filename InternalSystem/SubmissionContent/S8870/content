	"Action 52 is an unlicensed game made for the NES and Sega Genesis, featuring - you guessed it - 52 different video games. The NES version was published in 1991, whereas the Genesis version was published in 1993. Both versions were published by Active Enterprises.

	" is game 20/52 in the NES version of Action 52. You play as a blue pacifier (called a "dummy" where I live) shooting at other infants' toys such as teddy bears, rattles and rubber ducks.

	"This TAS aims to survive all 12 levels in the shortest input time possible. Due to the amount of levels, this is also the longest Action 52 TAS so far, longer than Echo on the Genesis / Mega Drive by 1:10.46.

	"At the very start of each level, we hold L for 1 frame. This is to account for the circles that show up around two thirds of the way through each level as you will lose a life when touching one and you can't shoot them.

	"Given that this is essentially an auto-scroller, we don't have to do much at all. All we have to do is shoot objects whenever they get in our way until we can take enough damage to finish the level without losing a life. I did initially try moving left and right to avoid the objects like I did in the other space shooters but that affected the game's RNG and it became too complicated.

[div class=p 
	"The gameplay is exactly the same every 12 levels, so much so that it's almost like a loop of the same level 12 times, just with different objects on the screen. After several long minutes of this monotonous gameplay, input ends on frame 47259 when we fire a shot to get rid of a rattle. From here, we survive another 3-4 seconds until the level ends.
