[div class=p 
	"The main trick/exploit that separates Metal Slug TAS'es from speedruns. When you attack while crouching, you can immediately turn around and do something else. For certain weapons, you can immediately turn back around and attack again. This cancels the delay between time you fire a weapon once and the time you can fire again, allowing you to fire once every 4 frames. Useful for saving bullets with some weapons like H, 2H, and L. This can also be done with grenades and melee attacks. In fact, you can use it to alternate between using your weapon one way and throwing a grenade the other way. When doing this with melee attacks, you must wait 2 frames before turning around to cancel the attack animation, but it is still faster than just crouching and attacking.

When you press fire on the earliest frame where the slug shoots 5 additional bullets, they will be shot 2 frames after instead, making it slightly faster.

The caveat is that excess damage does not carry over to the next block. For example, if there is only 20 HP left in a block, throwing a grenade will only do 20 damage. What makes this even more complicated is that some of the bosses (or phases of the bosses) have

Ultimately, I settled with using R at moments when it would do the full 80 damage while using 2H continuously. Since it has 1300 HP, the plan is to use 1 grenade + 8 shots of R + 7 rounds of 2H. I had to delay using 2H at the start to get optimal damage out of the first two shots of R, but it turned out that aiming for the blimp directly with 2H gave me the perfect amount of delay.

The other problem is that skipping the slugs leaves me only with H + pistol when fighting the planes in the 2nd half. Topeng and Sukimos opted to take one of the slugs to combat the enemies better, which I also decided to do. They used the Bradley in their run, but I opted for the Metal Crow (Melty-Honey) in this run. Its "cannons" (missiles) act like C while still dealing 200 damage and can be manipulated to hit the right targets, making it the better option. Despite the slug moving slower, more time was gained from being able to destroy enemy vehicles faster. I thought about taking both slugs, but decided it wasn't worth it. I would have to exit one of them to pick up the bomb crate, which takes too much time. And we have enough R and 2H to provide roughly similar firepower as a single slug. When I destroyed the two helicopters, I initially tried to make both explode, but found that letting the lower one crash-land gave me the best rng to make the screen scroll asap so I kept it that way.

Those soldiers can actually be killed beforehand, but doing so causes two more to walk in after the screen stops. However, I can manipulate the screen position by having Trevor stay behind the slug and make the Sarubia spawn first and destroy it before the screen stops. This prevents the two extra soldiers from walking in and the screen continues to scroll, saving time.

The third segment has the most amount of HP, but there's no good way to skip it, so we opt to skip the fourth segment instead. In this fight, it's possible to hit two segments at once with cannons, grenades, and slug vulcan to effectively deal double damage. Interestingly, the 2H and H are not able to do this. By taking advantage of this, I'm able to destroy the first two segments quickly while also dealing good damage to the third segment at the same. Once the first two segments are destroyed, I finish destroying the third segment and end the fight with the remaining grenades, 2H, I, and pistol. Thanks to the new strats I used in the previous parts, I was able to bring 17 more grenades to this over X2poet's run and by taking advantage of double hitting segments, I was able to save a lot of time in this fight.

The soldiers spawn at the same time regardless of when the truck is destroyed (and it can be destroyed with just H and pistol well before the soldiers spawn), but the way they walk in affects when I can kill them (and subsequently, when the screen scrolls).  Manipulating them to walk in fast allows me to kill them fast and get the screen to scroll (hard to notice since they are still killed offscreen). Once this screen scrolls, the rest of the section only has been done fast enough. The tank will spawn at the same time as long I get there early enough and the screen will scroll at the same time as long I destroy it fast enough (only variation coming from lag).

Skipping the firebombs caused the planes to spawn earlier and shoot missiles at bad times, requiring the characters to sometimes walk before being able to jump again or destroy the planes (which caused a lot of lag in this section). I tried giving Nadia the S and Trevor the F, but the timing of the planes spawning and shooting the missiles was still a problem when I skipped the firebombs.

The firebomb smoke is able to deal full damage (80) to the helicopter, so I make sure the helicopter explodes when it's destroyed to save lag frames.

During the second phase I move toward the right so I can attack the third phase asap. The third phase exhibits some of the unique boss characteristics. It has two separate 100 HP blocks, one for the face and one for the left(?) arm that shoots missiles. Only the one covering the arm is relevant since we spend the rest of the fight dealing damage to it while crouched. The third phase also takes damage from only one weapon at a time, so the best way of dealing damage is using only F (20 damage per 2 frames). Using H overrides any damage done by F. In between each F shot, there is a 4 frame window where the main flame is not doing damage, this window is just large enough to squeeze in two bunched H bullets, which is more damage than two instances of side flame damage. However, in order to bunch H bullets we need to fire one shot normally and since we don't to want to override any main flame damage, we fire the first shot to the left before turning around to shoot the two bunched bullets in the 4 frame window. When the 100 HP counter is at a full 100 at the start of the 4 frame window, I throw grenades instead.

					" All three phases of this boss can only be damaged by one weapon at a time. The first two phases also only take half damage from grenades, so it's best to use only S and F for them. Interestingly, firebombs still do full damage, but I don't think it's worth converting to firebombs just for that as the previous sections would all be slower. Plus, the leftover grenades are still needed for the final phase.

				"The fastest combination for the first two phases is 10 shots of S + 14 shots of F, which we're able to do for the first phase. I was only able to manipulate the missiles to drop 2 H unlike X2poet, who got 4. Fortunately, it turned out that I only need two (and getting less H from the missiles saves a bit of lag). Since the boss can only take damage from one weapon, some of the main flame damage is occasionally lost whenever I use S. I tried to mitigate it by timing my shots such that I'm able to do damage with some shots of S in the 4 frame window between F shots (Excel sheet ftw).

				"Since we're only able to to bring 26 shots of F, we have to settle for using 12 shots of S + 12 shots of F for the second phase, which is slightly slower, but not by much. The main priority is to fire all shots of S asap, since we're able to do enough damage to bring the boss HP down enough that the 12th S shot will destroy it. Using pistol after running of out of F was more than enough and allowed me to have full H bullets for the final phase of the boss.

				"The final phase of the boss takes full damage from grenades, which is why we save our remaining grenades for it. During this fight, the boss will spawn two robots on either side which are capable of dropping extra grenades. In 2 players level 8, the boss spawns six robots in total, meaning we can get six extra grenade drops. However, they only spawn after Amadeus does the pink laser attack, so it is manipulated to do so. During the first attack and the time it takes for the robots to spawn, we can use H to bring its HP down to 6900 and use the extra grenades to finish it off. I tried my best to manipulate the drops while destroying the robots asap, but I often had to delay attacking to get the right manipulation (the missed H shots while destroying some of the robots were necessary to get the right manipulation). It seemed like destroying each robot at separate times was better, destroying multiple robots near the same time would result in only one item drop.

	"I opted to end input early. The only difference in the two endings is the cutscene that plays after the final POW tally up. Ending it early like this also allows the run time to be more comparable to RTA timing (which ends the moment Amadeus is destroyed). If there's a new TAS that manages to beat Amadeus earlier than this TAS, but gets a "slower" time from doing the extra section, it should of course obsolete this run.

Watching side-by-side, you make quick work of things and exit each stage with shocking improvements. All I can say is that I congratulate you on this effort! It was a really great effort and an unexpected surprise! :)
