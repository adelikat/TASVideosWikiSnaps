	"Time Gal is an arcade game that's built in the style of Dragon's Lair. This is the US Sega CD port of the game. I'm keeping it short here but if you want to learn more about the game, just check Gaming Hell for your Time Gal needs:

	"I used the US version of the Sega CD port mainly for the cheesy English voice acting. I do know of the special extra on the Japanese version of the Mega CD port but I'll leave that as an exercise for the viewer to discover that for themselves. Also there's an annoying audio quirk where the FMV audio is about a second or two ahead of the FMV video. The sound cues for succeeding/failing an action seem to play at the right time which is extra strange. I haven't checked real hardware so I can't say if that's an issue with the emulation or the game itself.

	"The time stop sections always run at a set time, so putting in the input early takes the same amount of time as putting the input in late. I do try to mess around a bit with that, for all that's worth. Input ends at selecting the last initial for the high score screen. I could've left it at the screen before by having last input be in 4001 A.D. but considering the nature of the game I don't think this needs an extended input file for entering a name in the high score screen.

Everybody, from prehistoric animals to futuristic robots hates her guts and wants her banished. Fortunately, a few inputs at the correct moment is all she needs to make it out unscathed.

	"Here the author made a movie where said inputs are made as soon as possible, making it rather optimal. I also confirmed the time freeze events cannot be rushed. Personally, I would have not included the high-score inputs in the movie but instead provided a different one for that. But I can understand that it doesn't really make a difference (probably no further improvements are even possible anymore).
