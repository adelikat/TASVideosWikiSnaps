	"As I make new GBAHawk releases, I check old runs to make sure I didn't break anything that was previous verified. At some point my original run did desync on newer versions. This seemed strange for such a simple run, so I tried it on console again, and it desynced there as well. I believe I dumped the inputs for the old run with an old version of the dump script, and this led to a lucky cancellation of errors that allowed the run to be 'verified' somehow. This led me to revisit the run and find some improvements to fix this issue. now the run is properly verified with the same script as all the others.
