I had to do some "hacking" to figure out how the scoring actually works in this game, since all the game shows you is your final score at the end.  Points are awarded mainly for being near the surf and doing jumps.  Actually, the fastest way to get points is to go backwards, but it's not possible to do this very long before you wipe out.

I throw in a few spins for extra points, but these slow you down so I didn't spin too often.  Strangely, the course ends with a sand pit that you can't avoid tripping over.
