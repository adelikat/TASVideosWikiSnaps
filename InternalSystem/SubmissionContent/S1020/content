	"California Games is a collection of six minigames.  This run tries to show off what is possible in the game: I show all tricks, and also aim for high scores when it's not too repetitive.  I also aim for fastest times in the non-timed events.

	"I get the maximum score, 9.0, and never wipe out until time runs out.  I had to do some "hacking" to figure out how the scoring actually works in this game, since all the game shows you is your final score at the end.  Points are awarded mainly for being near the surf and doing jumps.  Actually, the fastest way to get points is to go backwards, but it's not possible to do this very long before you wipe out.

	"This event is simply jumping to avoid obstacles.  It's difficult because there is a significant delay between pressing the jump button and actually jumping.  I throw in a few spins for extra points, but these slow you down so I didn't spin too often.  Strangely, the course ends with a sand pit that you can't avoid tripping over.

	"This game doesn't seem to well suited for TASing.  Despite showing off as much as possible about the game, there doesn't seem to be much going on.  Most the run is timed and can't aim for time. The character is stuck doing a limited number of stunts over & over.  All six events in this run were too repetitive and offered nothing new after about 10 seconds.
