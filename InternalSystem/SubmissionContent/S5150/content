	"Welcome to my new Abe's Exoddus TAS completed in 59:40. This movie is slightly slower than the current published TAS dueto using an accurate emulator, Bizhawk with it's Otoshock core. There has been some slight changes to some of the levels in the first disc of this game. More information is in the level comments. THe in-game time mtaches Dooty's time, 00:41, but then after the bad ending screen disappears, the game timer then shows 00:40.
