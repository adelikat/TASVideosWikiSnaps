There is typically an invisible trigger to activate them, and whenever we can, we avoid it because locked screens are time consuming to go through. The main method to avoid a locked screen is to jump over the trigger, but for the tutorial, we have a ceiling! After all of my attempts to skip the trigger, I did not manage to get past it.

If we do not do as we are asked, the locked screen will start again, until we beat them in the way required. These robots have an annoyingly long invincibility delay before we can attack them. It is long enough to be noticeable in the run, but I make sure to hit them at the very first possible frame. what matters the most is that we have beaten every robot when the last one's invincibility wears off.

At 0:28, we need to avoid a locked screen again, and this one gave me a lot of trouble. As I said before, locked-screens are activated by a trigger earlier in the level. I have not been able to locate if with 100% accuracy, but I believe there are two for this lock specifically. The first one we dodge at 0:25 when we punch slide as we bounce, and the second one at 0:28 when we charge over it. It is a theory of mine that doing a punch slide allows us to not activate the trigger, but I am not able to replicate this yet.

Right at the start, we go up above a locked screen trigger, and move on to the right. We continue for a while until 0:10 for the first locked screen that we have to fight. This one has a wide variety of skrulls and mechs, but no flying enemy. We are used to the attacks of Johnny by now, so going into detail won't be of use to you. The supernova we do at the start is to save time due to the spread of enemies which is too large.

It is meant to be an endurance fight, so it could take a while to do in RTA. We move on to the other locked screen at 1:05 and have to start it from the bottom up. Same types of enemies as before, nothing more to say here. At the end of the locked screen we do a supernova. The reason for this is that once we clear up half of the wave, a black skrull appears at the bottom level (same skrull than the snow levels boss fight). It would take way too long to go down there again, so special attacks are getting used.
