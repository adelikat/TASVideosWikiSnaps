	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This is my first TAS ever, the much awaited 102% completion of Donkey Kong Country 2 - Diddy's Kong Quest. The length is 318242 frames, 1:28:24, and the in-game timer of the game is 1 hour 12 minutes.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I've watched this game being played by others a lot when I was younger, and had the Gameboy version to play with, so I was very familiar with Donkey Kong games. When I discovered this site Donkey Kong Country 1, 2, and 3 were the first games I played to completion using emulators. After watching the amazing single segment 102% run on SDA, plus Sami's any% TAS I knew that this would be my first submission.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When I started I was not that good at it (plenty of negative criticism was received for my early TAS attempts) but after 7 restarts/test runs of the game, I finally had it mastered. I played this game exclusively using Frame Advance, which helped me to be able to load/create save states without trouble, and take the game as slowly as I needed, while creating a lot of precision. I now can't use a different reduced speed besides Frame Advance.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Many new tactics/glitches were discovered prior to and during the making of this run, most of them extremely useful, some not but still interesting.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Despite this being my first run, I realized that the completed run would be about an hour and a half, so I try to keep the audience entertained, especially during boss fights and some levels (Web Woods, Klobber's Karnage, Haunted Hall, etc.) whereas some levels were entertaining on their own, which helps.

	"New Tricks and Glitches
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"DKC2 has many interesting, different glitches compared to DKC. Many of them are not featured in Sami's any% run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Rolling Tricks:
	]b
	$LF
	"DKC2 has the same extended rolling tricks as DKC; but Dixie gets a unique rolling technique that makes endless rolls possible with her. By waiting 21-22 frames, without holding Y, Dixie will start her roll but, on the first possible frame you start another roll, and Dixie will continue to roll. But, this is repeatable, with no stops, for as long as you are moving in a direction with space, as long as you keep the sequence going by starting a roll at the first possible moment (usually when Dixie stops her roll, and her hair begins to curl.) This is used in Squawk's Shaft, and especially in bosses.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Team-Throwing:
	]b
	$LF
	"DKC2 introduced Team-throwing, where one Kong piggybacks the other and can toss that Kong up, forward, or up/backwards, making inaccessible areas possible to reach. The team-throw is very limiting- or is it? When the other Kong is coming back to land on the main Kong, 1-2 frames before he/she lands if you press "jump" you can jump again in mid-air, and perform another team-throw. This is extremely useful for reaching high areas much faster, and makes Castle Crush possible. Also, once a thrown Kong hits a monster both kongs become invincible.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Backwards-Walking Switch:
	]b
	$LF
	"This is a very interesting/difficult trick, where under certain circumstances, your movement before switching Kongs will cause the other Kong to walk backwards. The best feature of this is to enter walls- in some cases, you either shoot straight up really fast of can go through walls with a well placed team-throw. The trick is easy to perform once you know what to do, but moderately hard to execute beneficially- in my test runs of Chain Link Chamber I was able to enter almost every wall, and in only two cases was it useful, both of which are featured in the level (I was either ejected out of the wall or got stuck at all the other places.) The way I perform the second backwards-switch in Chain Link Chamber- mount/dismount the Kong quickly- is the easiest way to get a consistent backwards switch, assuming you are close enough to the wall.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Fun with the Animals:
	]b
	$LF
	"All of the animals behave the way they are supposed to- except in some cases. Rambi has an additional jump featured in his charge. Anytime when you jump in the air while charging, by pressing the opposite direction and jump at the same time on one frame, and the next holding jump and going the other direction, Rambi makes an additional jump, and loses his charge.
	$LF
	"Squawk's hit detection does not work intuitively- you can be inside dangerous objects/walls without being harmed.
	$LF
	"Squitter is very complex, and sometimes you can create two web platforms with no wait- very hard to do, and I don't know what lets you do it.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Goal Target Switch:
	]b
	$LF
	"The most featured glitch, the targets at the end of each level are sensitive to a Kongâ€™s height when landing, and this can activate the song sequence which is 4-7 seconds long if you jump on it from too high. But, under the right instance if you perform a switch, and the other Kong would normally appear is on the target, the game freezes for a few brief frames, the Kongs switch and head to the next level, which saves 30ish frames if you would normally have to do another jump from being too high, because a goal-switch does not activate the song at all. This is also an excellent way of switching between two Kongs, because a normal switch takes 66 frames in a level, so strategically if one Kong is better for the next level, a goal switch is very good.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Duck-Sliding:
	]b
	$LF
	"A minor glitch where, instead of jumping into the water, if you slide off the edge and duck, you will fall into the water at normal speed, and by holding 'A' you will rise in the water very fast.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Animal Extra Jump:
	]b
	$LF
	"When Squitter or Rattler gets hit, when you are the animal and not riding it, you have an invincibility period where you can take an additional jump.
