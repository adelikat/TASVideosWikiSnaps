	"You've received a message that Tyrabian mine layers have been spotted just outside the Earth's atmosphere. Intelligence reports indicate that the Tyrabians intend to conquer the planet without destroying it. The first wave of attack will attempt to destroy major military installations. The second wave will shut down the planet's major power stations. The third wave will crush any remaining pockets of resistance.

	"The mechanics and timing of this game caused me some problems in optimization. After awhile, I started to realize that boss's appearance was due to managing the appearance of the enemy mines. If you clear them out at the right time, the boss will appear. Playing around with this helped to find a faster solution.

	"Dealing with the boss was another tasks. Just because you see your weapon strike the boss...doesn't mean it actually caused damage. After awhile, I noticed that I was killing some faster than others. This prompted me to finding an address for the bosses HP. Well, address 0x1dc9 was that location...only it counted hits, where you must strike the boss 40 times.  In this run, you'll notice that I don't hit the boss 40 times though...instead I strike in certain locations to get double or even triple the hits with one shot. Having this HP address helped to determine when I have done that.
