	"2. Pre Battle RNG, less obvious. Pre Battle RNG determines what kind of behaviour the opponent will exhibit, aggressive and passive. Aggressive behaviour needs to be avoided, because aggressive opponents will fire projectiles at you at the beginning of the match. Being fired at will cancel your flamethrower.
