	"in the first stage, we use the fast walk teqnique here, which involves canceling a dash by doing one frame of sliding on the ground, this puts Buster in a state where he can walk with dash speeds.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The next room contains the first instance of the screen wrap. basically I have to skid in the upward direction, then jump and face a direction two frames later, this causes the game to think Buster is still running up a wall.  the more times you repeat this input the further down buster goes.  You can change the diagonal direction by either pressing L then R after the jump, or R then L.  In order for the wrap to work, buster needs to avoid the death trigger on the edge of the screen, and it requires some specific y position to work.  Sometimes I need to delay each skid by a few frames to get the proper position.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"the next room has a small change that I didn't realize you could do, by jumping out of a skid you can get dash speed while falling in the air, but what I didnt realize is you can do an air kick in this state.  by doing the air kick you can slow down your y speed, which makes it useful for when I do bunny hops near the end.
