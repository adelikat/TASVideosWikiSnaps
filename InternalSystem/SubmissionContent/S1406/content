Canceling out the long fall drop and canceling out the attack animation are definitely apparent and abused throughout this run.  Also Sypha can do something similar to glitch found in Castlevania One (the one in which critally hit a boss); she's able to critically hit a boss with the use of her Lightning Balls, right when she takes damage is the time it's used.  Enough of what to come, I shall now go into somewhat depth of the run's details.  Patronizing will occur as well as words repeated from the movie text from both the Grant Path and Alucard Path.
