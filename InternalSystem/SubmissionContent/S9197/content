		" The game is almost always run on PC, as loading screens are much quicker and there's far fewer of them. I went and compared this movie against the WR, side-by-side in a timeline editor with all the loading screens trimmed out and just retaining the gameplay. The TAS clocks in at 30:31.11 while the RTA run on PC clocks in at 35:53.29, so this TAS beats the RTA WR by 5:18.18 if we consider just the gameplay.

		" You have zero control over your aiming reticule besides moving it between badguys for it to autotarget. We will sometimes have to wait a second or two for the reticule to land on a badguy before we are able to hit him without wasting ammo. Bullets are also physics objects that take time to travel.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Melee combat is a pain in the ass. Enemies will block or get hit by attacks at random, with no rhyme or reason to their behavior. Sometimes on one frame they'll just block/dodge and the next frame they will get hit, with zero change in animation or with any cues to how they will act. We will spend time during every fight whiffing moves or moving around slightly while attempting to chain attacks (usually low kick) so we can try and get the fights over as quickly as possible. The most optimal way to get damage in every fight (except Lola as there are no solid walls) is to stun the enemy, launch the enemy with a kick combo into a wall, rinse and repeat. 
		$LF

		" We forgo every upgrade and collectible in this run, as they waste minutes upon minutes to get, without providing a bonus that our TAS powers cant compensate for.

		" Your starting Dirty Harry car is awful, with a low top speed. We will do our best to bail out early while manipulating traffic spawns to try and get one of the top speed vehicles (sports cars of various models with red bucket seats, they all seem to have the max speed) ASAP. The speed difference in cars is no joke, letting us shave minutes off our time. There are a few areas of the game where high-end cars do not spawn, where we will be stuck with the Dirty Harry car/delivery van. Chapter 4 also resets our ride, so we forego bringing a racecar to the end of Chapter 3.

		" Routing in this game generally consists of driving in a straight line as long as possible in order to get across the city. The streets are generally accurate to life, which for LA means we have plenty of long straightaways for us to build up speed, while pulling TAS drifts to maintain momentum on turns or swerve through traffic.
