	"This movie is not so easy as you look.In fact it need much dubug and rerecord.The game has the biggest randomness.The key to do faster is reduce enemy's HP,and we must try best to meet less enemy.We do not attack enemy at the first time.With Manipulates luck,I can level up fast.It can help me finsih enemy easily

	"There is a little skill with HAGGAR.Press "A=B",and press"B" after thirty frame,you can make him walk faster.
