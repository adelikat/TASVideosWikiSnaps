	" is a platform fighter game made by Greg McLeod under the pseudonym Cleod9 and published on Newgrounds in 2006. It’s a fangame based on the Super Smash Bros. series, drawing heavily from Super Smash Bros. Melee. Despite its glaring problems (such as extremely odd physics, having sonic OCs as playable characters, performance problems, Sonic OCs, audio inconsistencies, and above all Sonic OCs) the game caught on thanks to its ambitious large roster and being just fun. Its success would inspire its creator to expand on it with a sequel, Super Smash Flash 2, which is currently in development by a full team.

	"This level still manages to pose some issues, however. Most notably, we need to make it across the final pipe without colliding with the blocks above. We plan our jump routing in order to reach the final pipe at a good falling angle, allowing us to keep our speed for as long as possible.
