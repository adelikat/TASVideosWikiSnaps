	"Nobody is perfect. Not even me so I improved my earlier TAS by 11 frames in total, mostly thanks to the fact that Rash's (the green battletoad) actions are processed earlier than Pimple's. This means he moves/jumps/hits earlier and faster. Also to thank your votes for best NES TAS on my 1st and 2nd versions of Battletoads TASes (that I really appreciate and really wanted to show some love), I changed the background music again and changed the ending. Spoiler ahead.

	"When you die with one of the toads while riding a jet, the game resets the "objects pointer" and when you respawn, it will erronously reads values from the memory and try to load them as an object. If you wouldn't press anything, it would load values like "FrameTimeCount, LevelId" and other values as an object.
	$LF
]div

		"The first problem: there's 80 different objects with different parameters. This means that any value it reads (except 0x00 empty input), it will be spawned as an object.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"The second problem: most of the objects are very bad for this scene: either tries to warp the toads to the next level, or crashes the game instantly, but there's also many different ones like enemies with random parameters or changing between scenes (intro, reset, warp screen etc).
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"The third problem: the game is CPU/PPU cycle dependent. This means that the game very frequently processes undefined asm instructions and the slightest change in the movie file can make a desync at the very end.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"The fourth problem: when you spawn the object, the object pointer (what values will it read from the memory) also changes, so spawning the very same objects in different order yields in vastly diverse results.

	"You may ask, how comes I could manipulate the game earlier without these tools: this is because I used a visual test to replicate the events in the earlier movie and reimplement it with different order of spawning objects. But since I wanted to make the perfect TAS, I had to investigate and verify that I really finish it as fast as possible.

[div class=p 
	"While I tried to test a lot of things (and I could assure you that the real rerecord count for this project is around 250.000 rerecords (I used turbo A LOT) ), I couldn't find any way to trigger the ending with fewer frames. Now I don't even think it would be possible. It would take much more time to manipulate all the addresses that the object pointer erronously spaws rather than spawning them through P2's pad.
