	"Hello, welcome to my first tool-assisted speedrun. For those of you who don't know, Ms Pacman is a game in which you must play through different levels in the form of a maze, collect all of the dots, and avoid being eaten by the ghosts. I chose Ms Pacman as a game because I like it alot, it isn't too complicated to TAS, and there were no submissions of it. I personally do not believe that it is one of those "boring to watch" games, though others might differ in opinion.

	"This run didn't take very long to make (about 1-2 weeks), as it is a short game by the creators' intention. I know that there are actually about 139 levels total before the game bugs and erases the walls and makes it impossible to beat, but I'm 99% sure that level 9 is the last intended level since it is the last level before the "junior" cutscene, which is the last one in the game.

	"I think that this run turned out pretty well. I might have eaten too many ghosts, though (eating 1 ghost takes slightly less than a second), but it's hard to create a good route and not eat ghosts or go fast by avoiding it. Well, that's all I have to say. If I left something out of the description then let me know. Enjoy!
