	"Bionic Commando is side scrolling action game relying on a grappling hook as the main movement mechanic. Recently, a major skip was found by Pakuliittus that allows much of the final level of the game to be skipped.

	"The basic idea of the skip is that if you take damage from an enemy at the same frame you would otherwise take damage from a barrier, you will pass through the barrier, if your position is correct. Pretty simple but somehow was never figured out through all these years.

	"This run simply plugs this glitch into nElifox's original and re-syncs where needed since positioning is slightly different. Also, the enemy firing the bullet that you need to do the second skip shooots at widely varying times, this is the fastest  Icould get him to shoot, even though the tranisition to get there is not as fast as possible.

	"That's pretty much it. I'm always surprised how the RTA community manages to find all these things. This is another example of the 'do two things simultaneously that aren't normally expected to happen' type of glitch that seems to pop up pretty often. I'm sure there are many more out there, we just need to be creative (or lucky) enough to find them!
