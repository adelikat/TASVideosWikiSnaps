	"Rattan technique: I am not particularly clear about the specific principle of the rattan technique. The screen scrolling of this game always follows the movement of the little boy, which leads to the strange judgment of many things in this game. The rattan technique can make the little boy swing farther and higher. You need to move up and down the vine, which seems to be related to the Y-axis of the screen (it seems that there is a frame rule for the swing of the vine)

	"Level 3：1. Use a lot of rattan skills.. 2. As I said above, jump: When you release the key every time you jump, press and hold the key again, so that you can jump farther without changing the jump height. This makes me reduce the number of times I catch the vines. This technique can catch up with the elephant at the bottom and let me step on the elephant's back to collect diamonds....... Here is one thing I want to explain. "At 14748 frames", you will see that I killed the monkey and waited for it to drop the prop. It is worth losing about 20 frames to get the prop "darts". Because "darts" are the most damaging props in the whole game, it can bring me more benefits in the fourth level Boss battle.（get 564 frames）

	"Level 4：1. Use a lot of rattan skills.. 2. Optimize the route. "At frame 20924", collect the diamonds below first, and then collect the diamonds above. Here is a place worth explaining, the crocodile in front of Boss battle. If you don't use the tree-rattan technique, you will be slower than stepping on the crocodile. Using the tree-rattan technique to walk up is only 1-2 frames faster than stepping on the crocodile. The current publication does not use the tree-rattan technique to collect "slingshots" props to better deal with Boss combat. I am not sure whether this will bring benefits. I did not test.（get 632 frames）

	"Level 5：1. Use a lot of rattan skills.. 2. Optimize the route. From the beginning, we can see the Boss "bear" that killed the fourth level, and it becomes a small boat for us to ride. Usually, we need to go to the bottom right corner at the end of the map. Fortunately, there is a monkey not far from the starting point. We can use the monkey to make the little boy bear the injury and reach the platform where the monkey is located. I carefully observed the terrain again. I found that there are some birds flying around occasionally. So I carefully studied the rules of bird emergence. I found that the emergence of birds is very random. I tried to control a perfect bird to appear in front of the monkey so that the little boy could bear the injury earlier and land on the platform faster（get 4524 frames）

	"Level 6：1. Optimize the route, collect the diamonds above and then the diamonds below, because collecting from top to bottom is easier than collecting from bottom to top.. 2. Use attack techniques to bring better Boss combat.... Here is one thing I want to explain. "At 34283 frames", I lost about 1 second to collect the "darts" props, which can bring me more benefits in the Boss battle. Boos was killed after only using the shield once. If I don't collect this prop, Boss will use the shield once more and waste more time.（get 1076 frames）

	"Level 7：1. Use a lot of rattan skills.. 2. Optimize the route. Collect the three diamonds in the middle "at 40741 frames" first to avoid walking less. There are two portal doors in the lower right corner of the map. From the portal door at the bottom to the door above, you can avoid walking a short distance, because the speed of the portal is much faster than that of the little boy..... Here is one thing I want to explain. "At 43099 frames ," I accidentally found a bug. When running on the slope, if the boy is in a suitable position to jump to the slope, he can cross the slope and reach the bottom. However, this bug does not help at this level. So I looked at the next level and found that the ninth level can be applied.（get 664 frames）
