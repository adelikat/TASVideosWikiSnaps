	"Spyro: Year of the Dragon 100 Egg is fundamentally an “Any% No Sorceress Skip” category that was branched from modern Spyro 3 Any% when a skip into the final boss was discovered in 2013 saving more than 20 minutes in a 1 hour run immediately. In order to enter the Sorceress fight intendedly, which this category requires, 100 eggs must be collected so that it’s possible to initiate a level-unlocking interaction with Bianca, the Sorceress’s former apprentice turned ally-to-Spyro. There are 150 eggs in the game. 146 of them are accessible before entering the Sorceress fight, so we had plenty of options to choose from. In many cases, eggs were obviously fast or slow. We’ll discuss the logic and testing that went into deciding the final egg route after outlining some generalities related to the context of this TAS and the techniques used in the run.

More specifically, several enemies, fodders, and other objects have hitboxes that can be charged straight through in certain situations (most commonly for enemies and fodder, when they are in their death animation). By interrupting a charge while Spyro's hitbox intersects such a hitbox, the game will force Spyro out of the interaction, causing a usable displacement.

	"At its most basic, a squeeze proxy is very similar to a dead-body proxy: you cause Spyro's hitbox to intersect that of another body or surface. However, this time, another opposing body or surface hinders the "path of least resistance", forcing a displacement to a further point unobstructed by the opposing body. In other words: you cause Spyro to get squeezed between 2 or more bodies/surfaces and cause a soap bar effect (given you successfully apply MSC). Squeeze proxies can have the proxy power of a perfectly aligned horizontal proxy when 2 hitboxes are involved, and greater power still when 3 or more hitboxes are involved — though the game often refuses to move Spyro in such situations.
	$LF
	"Boundary/Re-entry Proxy:
	$LF
	"This proxy type is unique in that it takes advantage of the property of surface hitboxes being directional. In other words, instead of pushing Spyro away from the offending hitbox, the game always pushes Spyro in the direction of the normal of the surface the hitbox is attached to. It does not involve any interaction other than approaching said hitbox from OoB (and the usual MSC involvement). It is, however, worth mentioning that despite pushing Spyro inbounds, it is possible to remain OoB while still benefiting from a small version of boundary proxies.

During this sequence, Spyro is usually meant to move to a specific point in space (allowing a degree of error) and stop. In most cases, when Spyro finally lands from the glide, he will be auto-walked to stand in front of the subject of the ground trigger, rendering the glide unproductive. However, if Spyro glides over his intended stopping point, he’ll abandon his intent to stand in front of the subject and simply rotate in place to face the NPC or egg as he lands from his glide. This technique can be used to avoid parts of some of the lengthy end-of-level sequences by keeping out of the ground triggers used to progress through them.

Among the most important effects, the pause menu is inaccessible, the interaction with water surfaces is disabled (allowing Spyro to stay swimming when leaving water basins), and all warps/teleports are disabled, as well as some cutscenes — which can also strip Spyro of this Zombie state, for better or for worse.

Eggs that are in required levels and don’t require any in-level area loads are obviously fast without exception. This allowed us to create a list of about 90 eggs that we immediately knew were fast enough to be included and a separate list of around 15 eggs that we needed to test in some way.

We then engage that text box on the same frame we touch the Sunny Villa portal. We use the first available proxy within the level to gain enough height to reach Miles and then optimize the path to Miles with a boundary proxy forward from the hills. The path to the second egg, Vanessa, isn’t direct because we need to manipulate an enemy to move left before we collect her in order to set us up for a more efficient end of level skip. We use two more dead body proxies on the way to Vanessa and then a ground trigger jump to get behind the egg as we engage the hatch for a better angle after the hatch. Finally, we proxy to the end of level egg with the manipulated enemy. We use another ground trigger jump, then a glide to skip the second textbox of the end of level NPC, which allows us to access the pause menu earlier and exit the level.

	$LF
	"After being hit into the lava, Buzz returns to the arena performing a "buzzsaw" attack that follows Spyro around the arena until it ends naturally after a certain period of time. Buzz is programmed to curtail this attack when he is close to the lava, so, by positioning Spyro on the edge of the arena near where Buzz returns after being hit, we're able to halt his attack almost immediately. After Buzz has been damaged twice, he begins to spawn a defensive wall of fire around himself after his attack phase is completed. Conveniently, this can be neutralized by pulling it offscreen with the camera. Combining those techniques trivializes the boss fight even in an RTA setting.
	$LF
	"With some experimentation, we discovered a more efficient method for damaging Buzz as he returns to the arena involving using the window of invulnerability gained by taking damage in the lava to push Buzz back earlier in his animation than was previously possible.

Eventually, we concluded that there must be a fundamental difference between versions in how Buzz is pushed after being charged by Spyro.

We didn't clarify exactly what the difference was but believe that we can infer its existence with reasonable confidence.

We were aware that knocking Buzz as close to the arena's edge as possible (and in the direction of Sheila) allowed her to not only reach him more efficiently, but also favorably changed the height of her jump to attack him; however, there were recordings of a uniquely optimized first hit with an unidentified cause that we wanted to reproduce. We discovered that Sheila's movement is dependent on her radial distance from Buzz along the arena. Within a certain range (if you must know: pi/2-1 to 1 rad on her either side), she will stay still and, if Buzz leaves that range, she will move to follow him. We were able to recreate the optimized hit by leading Buzz barely outside of her range and then manually pushing him back into it as she began moving to follow him.

Later on, we’d be able to use a proxy from a headbash crate near Spooky Swamp to enter Sgt. Byrd’s Base from out of bounds. After a little bit of testing, it was evident that our theory was correct. Conveniently, with our route, we just barely had enough eggs (30) to unlock Bamboo Terrace before we arrived, so it wasn’t necessary to use an inefficient out of bounds for that level entry or to consider replacing a later egg with one in a Enchanted Towers or a Sunrise Spring level. Spooky Swamp’s egg requirement (25) was also a non-issue for this route. Normally, Sgt. Byrd’s Base requires 700 gems.

In this case though, distance is not the only relevant variable: camera direction also influences the definition of "close enough".

This subtlety allowed us to suspend the cycle under certain camera conditions and we exercised that power to force the NPC into its lowest possible position on the frame the antagonizing enemy was killed.

If Spyro is standing on the wall of ice as it breaks, he is moved along with it until his path is obstructed by the solid surface of the scenery, at which point he stops and flops to the ground. Amazingly, if instead we use a state transition to conserve this very high momentary speed, we can cause Spyro to be launched at unseen-before speeds directly toward the mountainside, and gradually slide up it. If we then use a charge to redirect the remaining speed forward, we can achieve an astonishingly quick skip to the end of the level.

	"Even after discovering this, we were unsure why the wall broke in the first place. It was clear that no shot from the cannon had touched it directly, yet it acted as if one had. With some further experimentation, we observed that the wall typically broke in that manner when Spyro was next to the wall and a shot from the cannon "missed" (that's to say, it was shot past everything and exploded based on its timer rather than by contacting a solid object). Curiously, we also observed that we could not reproduce the wall break if we did not have Sparx or had died at some point after entering the level. We concluded that, for some reason, when a cannon shot explodes due to its timer while the NPC is on the cannon, the explosion is applied to whatever happens to be first on the actors list — in this case, Sparx — and that the wall breaks in these situations because Sparx is near it. We confirmed this theory by placing Sparx in a different ice structure by hacking his coordinates and recreating the same situation. The ice structure in question broke as expected.”

Beyond that, one of our variants of this concept relied on baiting the plane thief first without killing it, letting it move through the level, and then catching it immediately after activating the slide glitch and being subsequently teleported to the middle of the level by its capture. Unfortunately, we weren’t able to do this efficiently because the thief recognized that we were there and turned around to avoid us fairly early. As a third inconvenience, once the slide glitch was activated, the flop/death planes in the main level were moved to the heights in the slide challenge, meaning that any enemies (mainly, a crystal bear we were intending to use to gain height) on lower sections of the level were automatically killed before we could arrive to them.

	"In specific situations, it had been observed that the Sorceress could damage herself with her own fireball attack. In the past, this had exclusively happened while Spyro was piloting a UFO. The fireball homing is broken and it's possible for the fireball to boomerang back to her especially when Spyro is circling her closely at her shoulder level as she attacks. We developed an early theory for recreating that boomerang effect without a vehicle by luring the Sorceress to the edge of the arena, proxying from Agent 9, and manipulating her to attack with a fireball as Spyro glided around her shoulder. Before we got around to testing this theory though, we saw a recording of the Sorceress damaging herself inexplicably while a player simply ran around the arena with the camera averted. It was clear that this was the best opportunity to achieve what we wanted in the fight, but, since we couldn't see anything apparently relevant to the hit and only had a recording, it was difficult to confidently identify the cause of the self-inflicted damage. We filed the information away and intended to revisit it to determine the cause when we finally arrived in Midnight Mountain.

	"However, while developing RTA strategies for the fight in an unrelated project, we noticed that we could somehow separate the Sorceress from her staff while on a cannon (which has a fixed swiveling camera) by turning the camera away from the Sorceress as she ran through her scripted fleeing patterns. Although this was on a vehicle and the video we had seen was not, to us, this was a breakthrough answer to what caused the self-inflicted damage. We suspected that the player who recorded the video of the self-inflicted damage had unintentionally managed to separate the Sorceress from her staff in a similar fashion and then coincidentally was positioned such that the Sorceress was directly between her staff and Spyro as she attacked using her fireball. Because the fireball was aimed at Spyro and she obstructed its path to him, she was hit instead and received damage from the attack. We theorized further that this could be done all the way until the conclusion of the fight with no restrictions; we just needed to stay in place at the appropriate spot and manipulate the Sorceress to select consecutive fireball attacks until she killed herself completely. After some testing, we confirmed this theory in full.

The fireball blast also has an expanding radius. Putting all this together, the required conditions for an optimal staff dislocation location and angle were:

	"The staff pitch should be -17° to -25° (pitch being the angle along side-to-side axis).
	$LF
	"The staff position should be close enough that the fireball blast core (hitbox on first frame) affects the Sorceress directly.
	$LF
	"It should be possible to move Spyro quickly enough so that the Sorceress is between her staff and Spyro when she launches her first fireball.
	$LF
	"Although already much quicker than playing the fight optimally with just vehicles, we realized that the space between each of these self-inflicted hits was longer than the optimal space between hits administered by a vehicle's weapon since, with these, the Sorceress had to both complete her damage animation and her attacking animation each time the technique was applied. As a result, we believed that it could be valuable to manipulate Agent 9 to shoot a tank down as the tank phase ended so that tank could be used for the remainder of the fight (most or all of the UFO phase). As it turns out, this theory is also correct, so we manipulated the most efficient tank to drop and used that one.

	"Another complicating facet of the staff separation is that the staff returns to the Sorceress immediately if Spyro gets too close to it while it's separated or if it's in view at any time after it separates. This made navigating the arena optimally to reach the appropriate position nontrivially complex.”

	"Summary: After exiting Dino Mines, we climb the stairs to the inside of the castle, speak to Bianca to open the door to the Sorceress fight, and enter to challenge the Sorceress. Once inside, “we manipulate the Sorceress to select her rushing attack first so that we can separate the staff sufficiently far away from her body. We use a proxy from Agent 9 to improve the path to the appropriate location across from the staff. After we reach that location, we manipulate the Sorceress to only select fireball attacks while we concurrently manipulate our desired tank to spawn after the cannon phase is completed. We then force that tank to be dropped as the tank phase is completed by the Sorceress and use it to complete the remainder of the fight, distancing ourselves from the Sorceress as much as possible to optimize our final decisive action.”
