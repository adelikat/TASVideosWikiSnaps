		"Kirby And The Amazing Mirror is the second Kirby game released on GBA and is one of the most unique and different 
		$LF
		"Kirby games so far. The story involves some sort of parallel universe in which some evil force has gained entrance 
		$LF
		"to the normal universe and things are just all over flip flopped.

	"The game is like Kirby - Nightmare In Dreamland (the Remake of NES Kirby's Adventure). 
	$LF
	"It uses the same sprites and same midbosses etc.. However, you are able to choose your own path and many abilities were upgraded.
	$LF
	"And there are other Kirbys controlled by the game that you can call if you're in trouble (not used in the run).

	"The game's goal is to collect 8 mirror pieces in order to enter the big mirror in the main hall where the endbosses are waiting for you.

	"Abilities were upgraded so that the wheel could bounce for example. I used the wheel as some kind of my main transport ability when I noticed that nearly all the rooms in the game were flat. The missile was only used if it was faster (like in the water area) or if I needed a grey block-breaking ability.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The run took me about 3 months in total and several reattempts. The most annoying part was the Dark Mind matches. Especially the 4th Dark Mind is hard to luckmanipulate. 
	$LF
	"I was unable to copy the last match from my 
	[a class=extlink href=http://youtube.com/watch?v=KawYf6U72zQ rel=nofollow

	" so that I was slower maybe. Or Dark Mind just acted different and there's no (big) difference in time.

	"Improving a run of such a game may be hard or easy, as the game is sometimes quite random. Your Kirby buddies are fooling around while you're going your path. In one of my earlier attempts I went through the great mirror to the endbosses with Red Kirby so that Dark Mind 4 was even harder to luckmanipulate.
