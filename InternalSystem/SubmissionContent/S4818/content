	"100% is defined as all transformations, all items, which includes every collectible in the game. This means GBA mode has to be enabled to get the Tinkerbat transformation.

	"Crouch Transition Extra Hit
	$LF
]p
[hr 
]hr
[p 
	"A bug with the way the game checks Shantae's state. Basically letting go of down while crouch attacking at a specific time will have Shantae stand up, and deal an extra hit. This is used to one cycle Risky's Ship phase 1, as well as once in the Zombie Caravan to hit an eyeball.

	$LF
]p
[hr 
]hr
[p 
	"While in base form, Shantae can jump up slopes and vines. This can be used to get the Heart Container in Scarecrow Forest early, along with a few other places here and there.

	"Faster Falling Right
	$LF
]p
[hr 
]hr
[p 
	"Letting go of the directional buttons right before Shantae goes off a ledge lets her fall 1 frame faster. This and the next two tricks only work when falling right.

	"Midair Crouch/Jump
	$LF
]p
[hr 
]hr
[p 
	"Pressing down after doing FFR makes Shantae crouch, which is retained as long as you hold it. You can then jump out of it. This is used occasionally, most notably in two of the genie chambers.

	"Lag Reduction
	$LF
]p
[hr 
]hr
[p 
	"Attacking in either normal, Tinkerbat, or Monkey form can eliminate lag. This adds up to about 200-250 frames over the course of the run.

[p 
	"Luck Manipulation
	$LF
]p
[hr 
]hr
[p 
	"Luck manipulation in Shantae is very unique in that multiple buttons can be used to do it, even when just running around. While this is impossible to do for lag, this can be used to change boss spawn patterns and attacks, and manipulate things like gems from enemies. It is used nearly everywhere.

	$LF
]p
[hr 
]hr
[p 
	"65 more gems were manipulated from some spiders. Friggin' spiders. I also grabbed a Heart Container, and took a detour for a Firefly. That Firefly would normally be taken later, but a route change made me take it now.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I bought 6 Exit Candies and a Flash Bolt (Quantity of 10) in the shop, and saved the game. Saving the game basically acts as a warp location if you lose all your lives.

[p 
	"Not many changes compared to the any%, aside from lag reduction and getting some gems.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The biggest change is fighting the boss, as it's possible to skip all of its damage animations except the first one. Saves a lot of time.

]p
[hr

[p 
	"I deathwarp to Water Town, but the day/night cycle would mean I'd have to wait 40 seconds to enter the Zombie Caravan. Instead I took a detour to get the Monkey Claw, which saves time overall.
