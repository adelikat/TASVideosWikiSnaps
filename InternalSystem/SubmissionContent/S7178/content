		"Stone Protectors is a 1993 British/American/French multi-media entertainment property consisting primarily of an action figure line and animated series. The series also had a tie-in video game released for the Super NES. It served as a late attempt to market the troll doll craze of the early 1990s to young boys. While not particularly successful, nor inspired by a prior medium, Stone Protectors generally followed in the same vein as contemporaries including Toxic Crusaders, Swamp Thing, and the highly popular Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

		"A kingdom built of crystals came under attack by the reptilian troll-like Saurians whose leader, Zok, desired the powerful crystals protected by the Empress. Zok broke into the castle and reached for the crystals only to see them explode into pieces and fly to Earth. After being thrown out the back door of a New York City club, an awful rock band known as the Rock Detectors found the five magical stones which gave them troll-like appearances and special skills (not the least of which is playing good music). This put them at odds with the music-hating Zok and his henchman Zink, collectively known as The Protectors.

Using the Glider Skip, the glider will act as if no enemy is on the glider flying into the screen, and if there is no enemy on that glider while on that screen, the game will skip it entirely. The reason the game will skip it is that the glider is meant to fly off of the screen anyway, so in the instance that the enemy isn't there the glider will fly off the screen.

	". To summarize: The "phantom hit" glitch can be used to easily save a significant amount of time on bosses, easily upwards of 30 seconds or more. Given that this is a known trick used in several boss fights already, just not to its full potential, and given that the known time save is quite high, this is still sadly a little outside our standards of optimization. I don't expect a new run to come any time soon either, and if one does, I expect it to be different enough all throughout to warrant a new submission anyway.
