I simply walked to another acre, and the game forcefully warped me to another exit at Fuwula Village, assend the mountain, repeat the glitch at the antenna tree up top, and finally walk all the way to Bulian site.

The reason is because the first village's house in the second screen is connected with a house in Fuwula village, so I can glitch myself up and exit at the house in Fuwula village. Since there's  nothing to do for 3 minutes, I wasted time by manipulating a whole  field of Diamonds, play around with the map, and ran around in circles. The battle at the end was to prepare the glitch.

I switched to Kokia as it does more damage to Potzal, which I'll use until near the top. You might think it seems unoptimized, but that is incorrect. Since the next phone call occurs 5 minutes later, I have time to do whatever as long as I can make it to the top. I somehow delayed the phone call at 10:00, even though battles don't delay calls. I recruit a level 49 Raigaleon to fight the 2 Bashou at Bulian Site. I named it 21337 (Too Elite) just because I have the time. I glitched into the door leading to the Antenna tree, so I can walk through walls and into the last area of Bulian Site.
