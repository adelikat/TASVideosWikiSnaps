	"My original plan was to get result 7, force the game to take me to Bulian Site as I walk to another acre of the map, and get to the boss that way. Unfortuanately, that type of glitching was only accomplished once by sheer luck, and is incredibily difficult to do.

[p 
	"So, I've changed my plan, and instead made the game to force teleport me to a door, where I would trick the game into thinking I was indoors, but actually outdoors. I simply walked to another acre, and the game forcefully warped me to another exit at Fuwula Village, assend the mountain, repeat the glitch at the antenna tree up top, and finally walk all the way to Bulian site.

	"The first place you appear in, it is where the CFT was first used to get to Fuwula village. The reason is because the first village's house in the second screen is connected with a house in Fuwula village, so I can glitch myself up and exit at the house in Fuwula village. Since there's  nothing to do for 3 minutes, I wasted time by manipulating a whole  field of Diamonds, play around with the map, and ran around in circles. The battle at the end was to prepare the glitch.

	"The destination of the warp. I skip talking to some Denjuu there as I do not need to activate the event to continue the plot. I switched to Kokia as it does more damage to Potzal, which I'll use until near the top. You might think it seems unoptimized, but that is incorrect. Since the next phone call occurs 5 minutes later, I have time to do whatever as long as I can make it to the top. I somehow delayed the phone call at 10:00, even though battles don't delay calls. I recruit a level 49 Raigaleon to fight the 2 Bashou at Bulian Site. I named it 21337 (Too Elite) just because I have the time. I glitched into the door leading to the Antenna tree, so I can walk through walls and into the last area of Bulian Site.

I used Raigaleon to 2HKO the Bashous and recruit them to fight Doomsday. Even though Doomsday is nearly 10 levels stronger, I managed to 2HKO him and beat the game.
