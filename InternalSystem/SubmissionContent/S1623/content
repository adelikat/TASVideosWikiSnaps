	"This is a TAS of Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island using the newly discovered warp glitch that requires Left+Right. It improves upon Spezzafer's last any% run by 333,741 frames, or 1:32:42.35. However, because this glitch is so severe and the tas skips a lot of action, we are asking that this tas not replace Spezzafer's but instead be placed in a new glitch category, at least until the 100% run of this game is finished.

	"So in order to warp to 6-8, we had to collect exactly 68 coins. There were a number of routes we considered, but eventually we settled on intro -> 2-3 -> 6-8 because of the large number of coins in the beginning of 2-3 and a hole that allowed us to die and leave the level without having to lose baby Mario. Other minor improvements came from utilizing a new acceleration method in which we press Left once, then Right 4 times, then Left, then Right 3 times, then Left, then Right 3 times, then Left, then Right 3 times, then Left, then Right 2 times, then Left, then Right for the remainder.
