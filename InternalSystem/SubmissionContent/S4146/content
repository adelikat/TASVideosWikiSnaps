	"Boulder Dash is a series of puzzle games made since 1984. The rule is simple: You collect gems the stage requires while avoiding enemys and various obstacles. Boulder Dash EX is a Gameboy Advance port of it, which adds its original physics like HP bar or an ability to rotate the map.

[p 
	"This doesn't help anything with improvement but it's convenient to know. Basically, during the main gameplay, there're 3 lag frames between each valid frame where you can put input. Input in lag frames will be ignored. Therefore, you don't really have to press the input in exact moment - if you press the key until the valid frame arrives, the result will be the same. The exit time also follows the 4-frame rule so all improvements are mostly a multiple of 4 (I said "mostly" because sometimes there's a random lag frame).

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Every time you beat the stage, the game shows 'Stage Clear!' message, drains the player's health bar to zero, and go on to next stage. This means the more health left at the end, the more time you'll lose at the sequence. Thus, it's desirable to take damages if possible.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"According to the research I've made, the player's health is set as 10000 hp at start and you gain extra 4 frames per 200 hp by draining. You can get this benefit until the healtch is lower than 6200 hp, so at most you can earn (10000-6200)/200*4 = 76 frames by this trick on every stage. 76 frames is considerably large interval so sometimes taking damage results in being faster than reaching the exit without damage. Good example is at World 4-11.
