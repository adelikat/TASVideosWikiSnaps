	"This is a game based on the online Flash game with the same name, released in May 2010. It's a point and click adventure puzzle game thingy were you become and agent of the EPF, a "secret" organization where you defend the Club Penguin island from evil forces, in this case, from Herbert "Senpai" P. Bear, a very grumpy polar bear. This game tells the story of Herbert and your times as a PSA agent, where you play 10 missions to know Herbert's lore and wreck his plans once and for all. This game focuses more on the touch controls, so all the action in the game happens on the bottom screen. This honestly is one of my favorite games of all time... really, not kidding. I love the music and dat amazing dialogue, and honestly I think this is an obscure gem for the DS console. I love Club Penguin (even though Disney is bitch to the game currently) for very personal reasons, and even though I have 18 and a half years old now, I still play it sometimes.

	"Well, where do I begin... I started this TAS on December of 2013......... yeah, I've been working on this TAS for more than 14 months, that's... a lot of time. Tecnically this TAS is my very first project ever on this site. Originally, this was a solo project, but then Jackhammers and wrenches ruined my motivation... until one day, one nice gentleman known as solarplex helped me with various sections of the game that I simply couldn't optimize. He helped me so much to a point we decided to work toghether on the project until now. :D

		" HUD Off Glitch: The most abused one of all, you click on a HUD menu and then with timing you click on an area or NPC and the menu will get stuck. This saves many frames on many cases.

	[li 
		" Puffle Scrolling Glitch: When the Puffle menu is opened, you can move the cursor with the D-pad and get out of the camera's view, when the menu is closed, move the D-pad and the camera will scroll really fast. This is not used too much for having a slow execution.

I later made a 19 frame improvement to this mission thanks to HUDing Off in the grappling hook room. You will see that in the Puffle Room I throw a snowball in the box to hit the target, basically this is a proof that this game has a very glitchy HUD.

After I give the Puffle enough Puffle O's, I use a small trick to exit the cave quicker. When I go back to the mountain, I use the Map to go to the Pizzeria ta get a pizza, this is faster than going to the Ski Lodge first.
