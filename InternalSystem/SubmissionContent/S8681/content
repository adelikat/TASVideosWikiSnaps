	"So in the submission notes for the most recent any% TAS, I mentioned the 'PAL Hidden Mansion Route' that clips out of bounds immediately after entering the Area 1 hallway, and maneuvers from the Kitchen to the Area 2 hallway, then to the Well in the Courtyard and clips into Altar, straight to King Boo. This exact route is still not possible on NTSC versions due to there being no mice to skew off of in Kitchen, but in this run we did one better! Thanks to a new application of a previously known technique (GameBoy Horror Clipping), we are able to clip straight onto Floor 1.5 immediately after entering the Area 1 hallway, which means we can clip straight to Altar just like in the previous TAS' without even needing to go all the way into the Courtyard Well. This saves over two minutes from the previous movie!

	"It was known that you could clip up or down using the GBH with a skew, but going left/right did not seem to work due to how angle-snapping works when you open the GBH. It was discovered by minimini352 that you actually can instantly snap your angle if you are holding up on the C-Stick during the clip, which makes it possible to clip out of bounds using the Area 1 hallway door. By pressing A to open the door as we are falling down into the Area 2 hallway, we can interrupt the fall and get put onto Floor 1.5, even being put past the right side of the door and thus eliminating the need to skew clip past it again.
