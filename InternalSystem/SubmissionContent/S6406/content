	"I did the zip faster holding Down button after jump to keep the speed in the air and enter to the wall faster. In the doors i did mini-zips to keep Strider as far to the left possible to pick up the item as soon as it appears on the screen.

	"Took me a while to understand the speed boost but finally did it, positioning the screen in the right place was hard too but i did as fast as possible. In the Cave part i did Slides slightly faster keeping the speed, taking damage pushed me a bit to make slides faster. Boss time, the Box fight was a bit faster too but i didn't die because in the next Stage I have to make a zip and with the death the values of the jump changes.

	"New zip!, you have to purchase the 'Jump' (Strider jumps higher) and you must jump as soon as possible to appear in the screen below. To make the Boss appears you need to position the screen a little to the right and down and then go to the mid of the screen to fight him.
