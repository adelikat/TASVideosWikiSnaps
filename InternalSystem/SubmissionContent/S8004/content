	"Floor is Lava is an optional game mode that makes touching the floor result in instant death. This forces the use of pin jumps everywhere in the run to get to the end. Thankfully the skip to the end gem doesn't involve touching the floor so we can use it in this run too.

	"With shooting the pins, the ideal thing to do is shoot downwards while holding the direction we need to go in. But this often is shot too far and so we have to resort to shooting it straight downwards which means the direction needs to be let go of for one frame in most cases. This means that pin jumps should be used to a minimum but sometimes an extra one has to be used if near the edge of a screen, otherwise there won't be enough time to shoot a pin and jump off it. In other spots, Nalle has jumps off a pin that higher than the ground she's jumping to which means she's accelerating downwards faster than normal so the direction needs to be let go of for at least a frame so that she actually lands on it.

	"The only part that people may question is regarding a floor touch around frame 1900. For whatever reason, a disappearing block does not kill and so that can be walked and jumped off making that section faster. None of the other blocks worked so I'm not quite sure why this block wasn't made to kill but I'm not complaining.
