	"While Soukoban is a fairly straightforward game, optimizing it isn't quite as easy. Using botting to get more optimal solutions than the ones known out there is pretty helpful. There's a weird quirk about how this particular Soukoban game works. This is what the US manual has to say:

[div class=p 
	"Each stage consists of 10 rooms but only the key rooms are needed to move onto the next stage. From what I can gather, the waits at the end of finishing a key room affects the RNG to check if that counts as the key room needed to move onto the next stage. This also means there's routing considerations for choosing which key room would be faster for clearing a stage, thus leading to the fastest 16 key rooms needed to reach the ending. This makes this submission look good overall to me.
