	"There are various small sound glitches, those are also present in maria movie, beside the outfit richter is the same guy doing the same thing in the same game, killing shaft.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"Richter movements are not stricly identical to PSX version, the high jump does go higher, and the "air dash" is slightly smaller (needing me to often use jump where it doesnt in psx).
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"Many rooms layout are different in term of proportion, this disable me to do many nice tricks you can see in the psx version (like in labs for instance).
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"The out of the bound trick in psx (castle keep) doesnt work on saturn, i could have use the one maria does in chapel, but due to lack of air kick and such, it would be considerably slower for him.
	$LF

	"By coincidence, maria and richter times are very similar. (18 frames faster for richter)

	"Due to some glitchs with early alpha version of the emu, i kept loosing rerecord count regulary, this took about 2 full week to produce
	$LF
	[br

	"The most improvable part i think is the castle keep (both reverse and regular ones), i keep using the airdash there will i should have try to floor dash more often
