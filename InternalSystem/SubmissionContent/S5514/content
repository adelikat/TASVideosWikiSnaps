The other six world bosses don't count towards the % count and can actually be skipped. However, only the second boss is faster to skip, because of the handy map warp in World 1. For the bonuses, the game counts them as obtained as soon as they are entered. It's therefore possible to press Start + Select, if you have finished the level, just when entering to practically skip the bonus completely.

However, if you only have one Kong on the map screen, you save 10 frames/level, plus that many levels have less lag with only one Kong.

If a roll is started when you are halfway through, you'll be zipped out. At the end of the stage, I skipped rolling into all four snakes. While rolling into up to four enemies will speed you up, each enemy you kill will pause the Kong's movement by two frames, or three if the game will also lag, and the extra speed didn't make up for the time it took to kill the snake.

Not really useful anywhere else however... And as Donkey Kong sucks, we sacrifice him again to get into the bonus. Here I use a nice combination of two glitches, which actually ended up being faster! I you end a bonus on a slope, Diddy will slide forward on the ground while he throws his cap and if you end a bonus with a jump, he'll jump very high straight up. This actually let him land on top of some platform off screen and actually made him land earlier than if he would have been on regular ground, thus cutting the animation shorter and saving time.

However, this also spawns a lot of problems... Mainly the level's camera. As you were never supposed to move this quickly in a water stage, the camera won't speed up to keep up with Expresso's swift movement.

	"This level ended up being very different than I first anticipated. By storing a JumpRoll, it can be activated again even while falling. This makes it possible to land on enemies beneath you to start the second, and also faster, JumpRoll. Enemies that drop down a hole will actually stay at the bottom before they are despawned. As you land on the enemy, Diddy actually never goes down to the death barrier, and can safely activate the JumpRoll. During the JumpRoll itself, Diddy drops 1 subpixel/frame. The roll is activated on Y-position -40 and drops down to -48 before reaching the bonus. This is the lowest pixel you can be before dying. So it's very convenient that the bonus barrel in the end is very low down, making it barely possible to jump up to it from this far down before Diddy dies.

A combination which was highly respected by me back when I was a scrub. We spent a lot of hours together researching the game and fooling around together in our many Skype and MSN conversation. I miss them :(. Thanks for what you have done for DKC TASing and my own growth <3.
