	"Power Rangers - Time Force is a Game Boy Color game that sends the police force of the year 3001 on a mission to capture a group of rogue mutants/cyborgs/ghosts/whatever, led by Ransik, and escaped to various points in time. After a quick stop at Arby's, the rangers recruit a new red ranger from 2001, Wes, after their previous one got rekt lmao

	"The red ranger is generally better at navigating levels, due to being able to use speed-boosting techniques more frequently. In fact, his forward special lunges him forward faster than by walking, making for a useful short burst of speed. The yellow ranger, on the other hand, possesses unrivaled damage output, making her actually better in levels with multiple or tanky bosses, such as in level 1, 3, and 4. She also happens to have a much better route through the maze-like final level.
