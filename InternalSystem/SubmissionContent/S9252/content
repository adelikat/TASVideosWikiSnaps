	"Woah boy, do I have a stinker for you. Panned in the press at the time of release on March 18, 2003, and winding up with the legacy of "worst game of 2003/one of the worst 'Batman' games of all-time", Dark Tomorrow has been rightfully relegated to the trashbin of licensed game history. Featuring a soundtrack that at times sounds like Symphony of the Night (and other times like babi's first garage band experiement), horrendusly clunky gameplay that apes from MGS/Tomb Raider/side-scrolling beat'em ups, underwhelming graphics and some of the worst stage design of it's genre, Dark Tomorrow fails to deliver on any level. An absolute chore to run RTA thanks to the controls, this movie aims to get through this stinker faster than WR on either platform.
	$LF
	"We will be aiming for the "Good Ending" in this TAS, which requires us to defeat the final boss and disarm the doomsday nuclear satellite. This is the typical RTA goal.

	"The game was released on GameCube and Xbox, with the Xbox version seemingly being a "1.01" type release, with small QOL and time saving level differences (some stages be cleared without handcuffing the thugs) enemy placement and camera placement is different throughout the game, bosses have much less health and take slightly more damage etc. As we are running on GameCube, our boss fights will take 3x~ as long because of their extra health + we will need to do some routing differences (primarily handcuffing/not handcuffing some thugs in certain sections).

	"As mentioned before, the gameplay and controls are CLUNKY. Batman runs like he crapped his pants with very stiff movement and a lack of sharp turning while running. Also, when we change camera angles, (which happens constantly) Batman is stuck running in the same direction we were just moving in for 1-4 frames, before we can let go for one frame in between and change our direction. If we change our direction immediatly without this little buffer, Batman will stop on a dime and shift his whole body in that direction, then start moving forward instead of just turning. You will see this at times when taking corners, where we aren't always as sharp as we would like to be. We also have to wait for Batman to rest his arms at his sides before we can open a door after running, so if enemies are nearby or we just left combat, you will see Batman stopping for just a moment before he can open the door.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Jumping also will ""normally"" make Batman stop for 20~ frames upon landing, however sometimes, for whatever reason, he just doesn't and will keep running right when he hits the ground. I tried to get this to happen as many times as possible but it is wholly inconsistent and I have no idea what causes it specifically.
	$LF
	"We will also be maneuvering around enemies as much as possible rather than fighting them, jumping over their heads if need be. Enemies have very wide hitboxes that you can not walk through, including on their KO animation. This becomes evident a few times in the run where our path is blocked by a thug finishing his animation.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"There's also 
	[b 
		"ICE PHYSICS
	]b
	" if you can believe it. In icy sections of the game, we will have acceleration to full running speed, slide on the ground when turning AND always have the jump recovery stun animation occur. This is annoying as in the ice canyon area, we will be forced to trigger the animation while walking due to level geometry, wasting time.
	$LF
	"Combat is equally as wonky. If you throw any attack without "locking on", you will punch/kick and deal a bit of damage while pushing the enemy back slightly. If you "lock on", you can do a 4 hit combo and a finisher(we never only do 4 hits, trying to reset while fighting a boss will get us hit). Batman will also freeze and do a hurt animation if he takes any damage from a boss enemy or gets hurt by a normal enemy when his blue armor bar hits 0.
	$LF
	"Generally speaking, we will be fighting bosses by spamming combos ASAP. Some boss fights however, allow us to stunlock the boss in loops of normal, non "lock on" attacks , letting us chain together lots of extra damage without always having to wait for the boss to get back up off the ground. This is finnicky however, with bosses able to just stop taking damage and go invincible when they please (Killer Croc in particular will do this).

Each time he wakes up, he performs a headbutt attack with a hitbox that encompases his whole body and slightly behind him, sometimes following up with a rear donkey kick.

				"The final boss fight with Ra's Al Ghul... just as bad as the rest of the boss fights. Standing up and fighting with the sword is a fool's errand, and Ra's will block 99% of the attacks and counter attack you, knocking you to the ground. The RTA method is to crouch, sit still and spam punch until one of you dies. We use this partially during the fight, as our sword has superior reach and speed to punches and won't ""normally"" cause a knockdown (sometimes it just does, so we stop attacking with the sword and perform another attack). We are also able to stunlock him in an extended loop of stray kick attacks, until his health gets below a trigger that causes him to become invincible and perform a flurry of slashes. We finish him off with a combo and that's the game! Our input ends before the combo does, on hit 3, saving us a bit of extra time.

Therefore, they will block your way for a while before they let you pass through narrow corridors. The fights that can be avoided are correctly skipped, and those who cannot are promptly finished. There is one death, but it is used to recharge HP and Bat-arangs required for the next section(s). After continuing, Batman respawns immediately at the same place.
