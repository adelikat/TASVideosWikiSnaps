	"As I mentioned above, to take a strike, the power is the most important factor. Each game has a characteristic e.g. a balls is easily sliced, a condition of a lane is bad, etc. Actually you can take a strike with full power, straight ball in 50% of the games, and with slightly sliced ball in the rest. The power and direction is decided by the timing you pushed the button, and the timing is slightly severe, so manually it's difficult to take a perfect game I believe. As this game is very old one, even if you take a strike >3 times it is shown as "Turkey" every time... it can't be four-bagger, six pack, etc...

	"From speedrun viewpoint, we can improve more by having more effective movement for opponents. In this movie I pushed the button as quickly as possible but if I delay the button and get faster result in opponent move, it must be the possible improvement. If opponents take a strike in every frames as well, it can be faster even though they say something like "Yeah" after that.
