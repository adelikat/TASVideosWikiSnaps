	"The unasked-for sequel to the Family Feud TAS, now with less N-words! This time around, a fourth round is also played, made possible by some multiplayer shenanigans and intentionally messing up a bit. This TAS has new questions being answered, complete with ridiculous answers and a breakdown of the text recognition program.

	"The text recognition program only checks if the letters of answers are in order, not what's in between, probs to account for spelling mistakes (also: you can usually replace 't' with 'd'). We can abuse this. Example: if the answer is 'ice', 'the incredibles' will also work. This is because the game reads it as 'the InCrEdibles'; it ignores the non-capitalized letters here, thus you are left with 'ICE'; a valid answer.

Since I don't see the quality of the feedback improving, I am cancelling the submission to dissuade further negativity. PP Unknown, I apologize for how this submission was treated.
