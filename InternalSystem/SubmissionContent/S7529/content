	". Movie time seems to show this run being 20 seconds longer than sparky's 100% TAS, but mostly because of the emulator difference. BizHawk has a really long intro, and produces way more lag frames. It's hard for me to compare and calculate it accurately, because lag differences happen everywhere.

Foot Parts are also useful on bosses like Web Spider and Gunner Sigma.
