	"Match-Up is a turn based memory game. The objective of the game is to match Mii characters that are wearing the same color shirt. A Mii's shirt color is hidden from the player until the Mii is selected. You can only select two Mii's per turn, if the two Mii's selected have matching shirts, you gain 2(+) points, and another turn. If the two Mii's dont match, you gain no points, and lose your turn. Whichever player has the most points once all Mii's have been matched or once all rounds have been played, wins.

	"A memory game naturally has RNG in it, and Match-Up is no exception. There are two random elements to account for: the Mii's shirt color, and the Mii's location. A Mii can have one of six shirt colors (Purple, green, red, blue, yellow, platinum), and a Mii can be located in one of 6 sections of the map. Every time you have to switch between sections of the map, a few seconds are lost due to the time it takes to fully scroll, so the best possible RNG would be 2 pairs of same shirt Mii's per section of the map, and the TAS comes very close. Out of 24 Mii's, only 8 aren't optimally located(24/24 has never been seen before).

	": We allow standalone TASes of separate game modes, but the minigames are not counted as game modes. Clearing a minigame doesn't complete the game. Now this game consists mainly of minigames, some of which are uninteresting when TASed, so this might simply be a case of a
