	"This game brings back a memory of when my dad was taking us to a new plot of land, that we were clearing out for the future plans of having a house built. I remember my dad, using his dinky Chevette to ram and pull stumps out of the ground. Well, there was one particular moment that he looked up at us, while me and my brother were laughing. He picked up something in disgust. We continued to laugh, until I realized that he was showing the very magazine that this game came from. Apparently, he used too much force and spilt a container of water that we had all over it. Once I realized this, I stopped laughing. :(
