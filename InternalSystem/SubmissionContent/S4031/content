	"My first TAS run. I felt like doing it since I haven't yet seen a full run on Impossible with glitch abuse. The beginning is a bit unoptimized since I was still learning how these TAS runs worked. But it turned out better later, and it's pretty satisfying to me for a first TAS.

	"The main reason the game is beaten so fast despite being on Impossible is a glitch that allows you to reload your "ghost savefile": unlike the other levels, pressing R on Impossible sends you straight to the Select File screen, but the game takes a while to erase your previous run (the time seems to be longer if you have all 3 savefiles), so pressing A sends you straight back to your file but in the initial section. Given that, the Warp Route works even on Impossible, just in a different way (and with less skipping). Since the Room of Divine Transportation is only seen once in this run, the only proof of that is me being able to go to the Minecart section straight after Dracula.

	"Now about the concept. This run plays on Impossible, which is the hardest difficulty. It has almost no checkpoints and prevents their abuse. It allows Game Over glitch in different conditions than the regular difficulty run, and it can skip different rooms than that. So both would be interesting to watch, which means both are expected to be submitted and will most likely be well received.

	"Glitchiness. I can not consider Game Over invulnerability and room skips game breaking glitches. They are just major, not game breaking. So they all should be allowed for Any% and Impossible branches. For the people who are distracted by those glitches' look, there must also be a 100% run, picking all secret items and avoiding warps and major glitches (namely, Game Over abuse and room skipping).
