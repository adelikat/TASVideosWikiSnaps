	": After looking over this and considering the goal sadly this will need to be Rejected. The issue is that the goal is not different enough from the standard fastest completion.  The only noticeable route difference is that the fire flower is acquired.  If we consider the other branches for Super Mario Bros. for NES there are lots of different goals that really change how the authors go through the game.   This does not meet the goal criteria, even if I think the optimization is ok although there are a couple issues.  I was considering Playground, but again the goal is also not different enough.  If the author of this submission wishes to submit another tas for Super Mario Bros., please ask for advice about the goal first.  This could point the author in a good direction and prevent wasting the author's time.  In summary this was a good effort though for a submission, but the goal was not different enough from fastest completion.
