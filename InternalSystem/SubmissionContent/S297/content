	"In this game you are a ninja who decides to clean up the 
	$LF
	"drug world. Also some evil guy has kidnapped a few kids ;), 
	$LF
	"which I don´t have time to save unfortunately. The game 
	$LF
	"itself is pretty simple. I remember completing this as a 
	$LF
	"child and then I ducked most of the game. In this time 
	$LF
	"attack there is no ducking because it wastes time. It´s as 
	$LF
	"fast as possible.

	"Some cool stuffs is all the martial arts you learn, or 
	$LF
	"spells or whatever. However, most of them are pretty useless 
	$LF
	"while running for the bosses. Art of invisibility is very 
	$LF
	"useful though because it allows me to go through enemies 
	$LF
	"without taking damage. This resulted in lots of saved time 
	$LF
	"because then I didn´t had to jump at unnecessary places 
	$LF
	"etc.

	"Also, in the sewers the screen MUST scroll fully to the 
	$LF
	"right before I can climb upwards. 
	$LF

[p 
	"Also, stuffs happen for reasons. At the first stage I use the Fire Ring at one enemy. Actually there are
	$LF
	"two enemies there. The other one is coming from above and to not mess up everything I had to deal with him also.
	$LF
	"The Fire Ring was perfect for that situation. Just so you know..

[p 
	"Those red guys gives me information if I grab them. It 
	$LF
	"could be useful if you played it for fun but now they are 
	$LF
	"just annoying. They also don´t give a darn if Im invisible 
	$LF
	"or not so I have to avoid those at all costs.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The final boss takes 4 different arts to kill and I think I 
	$LF
	"managed to kill him as fast as possible also.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Well that´s it. I like this game even though most of the 
	$LF
	"stages are kinda similiar to each other.

	"Enjoy it!
