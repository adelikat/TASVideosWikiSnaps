I knew right away it could be a pretty big time savings, but had to wait a few months to find out just how much. Not knowing where the extra keys would come from was a big source of uncertainty. Since key opportunities are spread throughout the levels I did a lot of testing to really nail down the route's details before I started recording.

	"Acquiring an item that lets Link damage enemies is the first big challenge for any swordless route. Prior TASs have focused on getting freely available rupees and buying either bombs or the blue candle. This TAS saves most of its time by getting bombs in Level 2, making use of an otherwise off-route room where a bomb shows up WITHOUT having to kill the room's enemies. As far as I can tell, this is the only such room in the first quest that is accessible without any other items.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"This approach saves a lot of time because we have to complete Level 2 anyway, whereas prior TASs forays to grab rupees served no other purpose and were followed by resets. Fortunately, it's possible to use those 4 bombs to get more and complete the level.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Level 2 doesn't have any major items we need (apart from that bomb!), but completing it first changes the best level order for the rest of the route (prior TASs went from L8 to L2 to L5). I tested many route variations, including an "early-wand" variant that would visit Level 6 twice (instead of Level 4). Since there's no need to complete L8 before getting the Whistle in Level 5, we can save L8 for last after getting the Red Candle in L7. Grabbing the Power Bracelet saves about a second getting to Level 5.

	"The wrinkle with getting bombs from Level 2 is that getting to the bomb room requires walking past 3 keys that would otherwise be on-route, due to having no weapon to kill enemies with.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"1 key is simple -- the room with the Moldorms (fire worms) is revisited on the way to the boss. The other 2 keys need to be replaced elsewhere in the run, along with the 2 extra keys a swordless route needs anyway (compared to any%) to get the wand, for 4 extra keys total. Figuring out where to get these keys most efficiently was a major factor in planning the route -- due to the screen transition time, taking even a one-room detour to grab a single key can take 9-12 seconds!
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Fortunately, I found 2 keys that can be scraped up while visiting the same number of rooms as the previous TAS. A different route to the raft in Level 3 nets 2 keys with a 1-room detour; the prior swordless TASs also took a 1-room detour but for only 1 extra key. I get the second extra key by clearing a mummies room in Level 5 that is on the route but wasn't cleared in prior TASs as the layout (large central island with a river around it) makes it very challenging to clear with bombs. Swapping to the wand after grabbing the Whistle lets me clear the room with only about a 3s delay -- much cheaper time-wise than using the Level 1 entrance trick (6s) or the detour-requiring Level 3 keys (5s apiece).
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"I did test whether the skipped keys in Level 2 would make it faster to get the Magic Key in Level 8. It was close in early testing, but as I found strats to get the extra keys more quickly it became clear the Magic Key would be several seconds slower.

	"With the sword, it is not possible to simultaneously hit an enemy with the sword itself and (at full life) the beam-sword projectile; the projectile shows up one frame after the sword itself stops doing damage. With the wand, however, there's a 1-frame overlap between the wand and its projectile. This can be useful both to reduce the number of enemy-invulnerability periods and to kill Vires (hopping bat creatures) for items rather than split them into bats.

[div class=p 
	"In this TAS, I use the technique to kill the Level 5 Digdogger in 2 hits (vs 4), several mummies in Level 5, some Blue Goriyas and Aquamentus (2 hits vs 3) in Level 7. Unfortunately, the technique only works for enemies damaged by the wand projectile, so it doesn't help for the longer Gleeok or Patra fights.

	"Link always walks on 8x8 pixel gridlines. When taking damage, the boost must also be along these gridlines. If Link takes damage at the intersection of gridlines, he can boost in either direction -- either up/down or left/right. If he's off the intersection, any boost can only be up/down or left/right. If Link's getting an undesirable boost direction due to being on/near an intersection, the walking glitch can sometimes be used to shift his position to get the desired boost.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The Walking glitch doesn't work to embed Link all the way into doors or the outer walls of the dungeon, but he can embed himself one pixel. For some rooms with doors this can save 2 frames on the room transition, though for bombed walls it can actually lose time by shifting Link's position away from the target room.

[div class=p 
	"In Level 9, I saved 15+ frames on the Patra before the old man room by using the walking glitch to get safely past the mini-Patras and into the doorway 1 frame faster.
