	"The TAS was originally done in BizHawk on a development branch of 2.2.1 that has patches which make its emulation accurate enough to be verifiable on the Game Boy Player console.  I have since finalized it in 2.2.2 and confirmed that the TAS runs identically in the official 2.2.2 release.  The choice to use specifically GBA as the emulated platform instead of GBC is due to the use of the Game Boy Player by the RTA Pokemon Speedrunning community, which has the same manip behavior as the GBA and GBA SP.  The TAS community would typically recommend running a GBC game on original GBC hardware emulation, but the ability to do a console verification of an input file made on GBA/GBP emulation combined with the standard in the RTA community tipped my hand towards building the input file for GBA/GBP.  Because BizHawk 2.2.2 is verified to have exact console accuracy in GBA mode, this TAS should be playable on any newer versions as long as there are no regressions with accurate emulation.

	"Frame = The smallest unit of time that can be observed realistically in emulation.  The game accepts some inputs on every frame (for example in nickname menus), some (in the overworld) every other frame, and some (primarily in textboxes) every 3 frames. GB/GBC games play back at approximately 59.7275 Frames Per Second.

	"(Current HP * 48 / Max HP) < 10).  Being in red bar cancels level up jingles when in trainer battles (worth 2.5 seconds per level up) cancels death cries (40 frames per death) and cancels text box clear jingles (timesave unknown, around a frame per clear).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Also, notably being in Red Bar removes lag from a different jingle that plays when a move is super effective or not very effective.  At face value, using a move with a shake animation is ~55 frames faster than a move with a flash animation.  This drops to 27 frames for super effective shakes vs normal flashes and 10 frames faster for not very effective shakes vs normal flashes.  However, the lag reduction from red bar makes a red bar NVE shake 26 frames faster than a normal flash animation, and a red bar super effective shake 34 frames faster.  On top of this, the act of changing moves typically loses 7 frames, making shake animation moves of any kind at least 12 frames faster than flash animation moves for the purpose of this TAS (19 frames if you don't have to swap back to using the flash move).  You also have to account for the length of a move name for exact timings, but that is not relevant to the decision making process.  Good examples of the use of this optimization are Double Kick shakes on the Route 3 Ekans and the 2nd Route 3 Metapod.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Color lag = The lag caused changes by colors in Pokemon Yellow.  Likely due to some flaw in the way that colors were hacked into the Pokemon Red engine to make Pokemon Yellow, color changes often cause lag.  This can be seen most clearly in a stutter that occurs on map transitions (for instance between Route 1 and Viridian City).  It also happens when the HP bars change color in battle and when a Pokemon is sent into battle in Red or Yellow bar, because the HP bar color is assumed to be green and then updated to Red or Yellow when the game notices that the poke is at lower HP.  The value of Red Bar jingle skips far outweighs the time lost to the color lag from the HP bar.  A good example of how we optimize for this is as Brock, where we intentionally low roll our first Double Kick on Onix in order to prevent hitting it into Red Bar with the 2nd use of Double Kick.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Gen 1 Miss = An oversight in the code for the accuracy check causes moves with 100% accuracy to still have a 1 in 256 chance to miss/fail.  This means that we can cause an enemy to miss even if they're locked into using a theoretically deadly move, or miss our own moves if we need to. 
	$LF

[p 
	"DSUM = A label for the predictable outcomes caused by deterministic behavior of the random number generator.  This behavior leads to an encounter cycle which constantly loops through the ten encounter slots in order.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Consecutive Input Delay = In Pokemon Yellow, if you press a button it needs to be released for a frame in order for it to be pressed again, otherwise the game will just see the button as being held the whole time.  This can be counteracted via a trick to reapply the relevant button press.  The key is to press a different button (typically a directional button) on the same frame that you want to press the initial button again, it will register a 2nd press of the initial button and not a hold of the initial button.  This is done when a directional input is used to reapply B while exiting shops (which can be done in RTA) and to reapply up/down in the fly menu and item bag.  The trick is also useful when B reapplies A to get on the Bike (also used in RTA), to deposit Pikachu (not useful in RTA), and to throw a poke ball from slot 1 (used in RTA).  In general it could be used to select any slot 1 bag item in the overworld or in battle, but the relevant ones are the poke ball throws and the bike.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Ranges = The damage formula in Pokemon Gen 1 is modified by a random number, rerolled until it lands between 217 and 255 inclusive. The move is multiplied by this number and divided by 255 to obtain a range of possible damage between ~85% and 100%.  Because we manipulate random number generation, we can manipulate these damage ranges to our liking.  Also, because of the way much of the 8 bit math rounds down calculations, the full calculated damage is only a 1/39 chance (217 to 255 inclusive is 39 possible rolls).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Glitchless = the category this TAS was written for.  I followed the RTA Pokemon Speedrunning community's ruleset for Glitchless, so while arbitrary code execution glitches like Brock Through Walls and Trainer Fly are disallowed, certain glitches that are not avoidable in RTA such as Gen 1 Misses are allowed, as well as oversights such as using Poke Doll on the Marowak ghost in Lavender Tower.  This ruleset is uncontroversial in the RTA community at this point.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Note: This TAS is a rewrite of my previous TAS in 1:37:21, which succeeded in saving 40 seconds from that TAS.  There are no known previous TASes of Yellow ENG Glitchless in any ruleset.  There is a somewhat improvable TAS of the JPN release, whose times are not easily comparable due to the text differences and (more importantly) the game does not have colors like the ENG release, meaning that it has no color lag.  As there were no TASes of the ENG game prior to these two, the main goal was to establish a very competitive baseline for TASes of this game and category.

[p 
	"The TAS begins by pressing Start, A, and Start on FAF for 2 segments of the intro cutscene and the title screen with Pikachu.  This strategy is borrowed from RTA manips; each input can be buffered for several seconds but the TAS can just press the relevant button on FAF.  We then press down and then Left+A when opening the options menu.  This executes "fast options," a trick where all of the options are set simultaneously because the Left press from opening the options menu is reapplied repeatedly as the game loops to display each of the options.  This trick also works with right instead of left, but left sets the options we need for the run.  Because the options are set instantly, you can press B on FAF once the options open and proceed to starting a new game.
	$LF
	"In general in the run I use the B button to clear text boxes so that I don't forget to use it to clear end of paragraph text boxes, which can be cleared faster with B.  The end of paragraph text boxes are notable by their lack of a jingle when cleared.  The key with the intro sequence is to then use A to choose to set your own name and then pick a single character name and press start on the following frame.  The same is done for the rival.

	$LF
	"After obtaining Pikachu (whose stats can be manipulated by changing the walk path to the catch grass or delaying frames before talking to oak to receive it), we lose to rival 1 in 2 turns.  The fight involves an 18 HP Pikachu gen 1 missing growl and Eevee critting tackle for 9, then Pikachu gen 1 missing growl again and Eevee critting tackle again.  We choose to gen 1 miss Growl instead of Thundershock because the "but it failed" text is so much faster than the "Pikachu's thundershock missed" text.  The necessary RNG for this rare fight can be found with relatively little delay because of the number of combinations of delay possible.  You can vary walk paths that obtain 18 HP pikachus, vary delays before opening the fight menu, delay the down or up press to get to growl, and delay selecting growl.  You can also introduce PrintLetterDelay, most crucially on the "Pikachu used Growl" box to look for gen 1 misses and independently on the "Eevee used Tackle" box to look for 9 damage crits.

We also use these tricks to manipulate the goalie NPC leaving room for us to walk up to viridian optimally.  We get the parcel and walk back down the right side through the grass because we know we can manipulate away the encounters and this reduces ledge hops, which lose 8 frames.

After buying the balls, we press B and then reapply it with a direction+B to begin leaving the shop, then press B 2 more times to finish leaving.

F attack is necessary for ranges, low+even defense is helpful for red bar in the forest and after Misty, E speed is necessary, and E/F special is necessary for damage ranges (both give fine HP but E is even so slightly lower HP which is better).  After encountering the Nido, the catch is done optimally with down->A to open items->B+A to reapply A and throw the ball.

[p 
	"It is one of the great miracles of this TAS that the DSUM cycle happens to allow for an L6 NidoranM with such a short wait and with an optimal walk path from Viridian.  It is pure coincidence that losing the Rival 1 fight with 2 growl gen 1 misses and 2 tackle crits leads to the DSUM cycle being set up perfectly, when we could theoretically have needed to waste as much as 10 seconds just to shift the encounter cycle or find a way to shift the cycle without losing time.

The stats we get are E2E3, mostly even for low HP DV and with high attack to give Nido red bar immediately and low special to help pikachu's crit damage.  The optimal fight to find is a Sand Attack fail from Pidgeotto, a T-shock crit for 14, another sand attack fail, a t-shock crit for 13, Pidgeotto gust crit to kill Pikachu, swap in Nidoran, Pidgeotto gust  max roll crit for 21 to put Nido to 1 HP, then Nido Tackle hit.  In the current TAS I was not able to find a 1/39 14 damage crit from one of the pikachu hits into a sand attack miss or a 1/39 tackle, so I crit the Nido Tackle to finish the kill.

	"On Bug Catcher 2 we swap Horn Attack to slot 1 immediately because Leer is useless in the TAS and then Horn Attack into a 4 damage tackle to set up perfect HP for Red Bar L9 and L10 and to survive Diglett's scratch in Brock's gym.  We intentionally avoid critting Caterpie on turn 1 to avoid color lag and the 2nd Horn Attack crits for a kill.  on Metapod we crit Horn Attack into String Shot Fail (maintaining Green bar on Metapod).  On any of the early fights where we can't kill a Metapod or Caterpie, String Shot fails are the fastest thing that the opponent can do, and they're pretty easy to find because enemies have a 1 in 4 chance to miss stat/stage modifying moves against you.  We then crit Horn Attack again putting Metapod into red bar and get string shot fail again and finish with non-crit Tackle to save a Horn Attack, which is useful in Mt Moon.

This means that there is no way to catch an L8 Sandshrew in red bar without losing a turn to one of the fights in order to take damage, and therefore getting Charmander as our slave for Dig, Cut, and Strength is faster even though you have to overwrite moves on Charmander.  Coincidentally, the DSUM also is in a reasonable part of the cycle to get an L8 Sandshrew somewhere along route 3 if in the future one were to find a way to get red bar for the catch without losing too much time.

It also lets us kill Sandshrew and Onix in 1 turn without crits.  On the way to Cerulean we walk in a specific path to manipulate good movement from the NPCs so that we can get to the PC efficiently, then we deposit Pikachu and use A->B+A to avoid consecutive input lag on the deposit.

It turned out the amount of text this strat involves in ENG, combined with the problem of manipulating 3 gen 1 misses in quick succession, made the strat much slower than just using 3 Bubblebeams, to the extent that it was more valuable to use them here than to cancel Thrash windups in other places.

	"It's been more than ten years from the last time a similar movie has been submitted to the site. Since then, many runs that make use of game-breaking glitches were published, overshadowing runs that don't. As a result, there is currently no active branch applicable for this movie. However, this doesn't mean that the branch is dead: providing that all the required conditions are met, the branch can be restored and this movie can be published.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The first requirement is clear goals. While this movie appears to follow an arbitrary ruleset at the first glance, it must be noted that it fits nicely into the "Forgoes  memory corruption" category, which is a sensible condition that excludes possible controversy.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The second requirement is featuring unique TAS content compared to the other branches. Counting all Pokémon Gen I games, we currently have 5 active branches: 
	[a class=intlink href=/2687M 
		""SRAM glitch"
	]a
	", 
	[a class=intlink href=/3655M 
		""warp glitch"
	]a
	", 
	[a class=intlink href=/2653M 
		""Gotta Catch 'Em All!"
	]a
	", 
	[a class=intlink href=/3358M 
		""arbitrary code execution"
	]a
	", and 
	[a class=intlink href=/3134M 
		""Coop Diploma"
	]a
	". Despite the amount, none of these feature much redaundant content compared to the submitted movie. Also, the goal for this movie counts as the 
	[a class=intlink href=/JudgeGuidelines#Trunk 
		"trunk
	]a
	", that is the basic branch from which all other branches are derived, hence the decision to leave a 
	[a class=intlink href=/Forum/P/467080#467080 
		"blank label
	]a
	".
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Apart from the branch matter, the movie also has to adhere to the Moons tier standards. For what concerns technical quality, there are no doubt that there has been put a lot of thought behind its making, resulting in more than enough route planning and fights optimization needed for typical Pokémon TASes. And on the other hand the entertaining quality is also high; the red bar has been appreciated since it adds more challenge to the optimization and breaks the audio funnily.
