	"If Sonic is running or jumping and has velocity over 1536, his velocity will be capped at that speed if forward is pressed.  Slopes give Sonic velocity beyond his "maximum" of 1536 when jumping at a decline.  By seeing this in the memory viewer, I refrained from holding forward until the speed returned to it's normal maximum.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Sonic accelerates faster in the air than on the ground, but every time his jump peaks, his speed lowers temporarily.  (This can be avoided by running into a ceiling during the jump)  Thus it's necessary to determine the best way to accelerate to maximum speed based on the environment and current speed.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"When rolling, Sonic has a speed cap of 4096 (approximately 2.5 * max running speed).  If Sonic is forced into a running animation, he can run faster than this, though he will be decelerating toward his maximum running speed (since -> cannot be pressed).  This technique gained a bit of time during very fast segments.
