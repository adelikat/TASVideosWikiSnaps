				"The amount of score collected can have an effect on some very rare random lag frames. The game sometimes lags for one frame, but it can usually be avoided by having a different score value or making some other minor adjustment. Sometimes the creepy lag frame will just change its location in time, but no matter what we do, it happens. The creepy ghost lag frame can even switch its timing so that it occurs during a score countdown, which is totally strange, creepy and stupid. A couple of times I was like... Wait a minute, it didn't lag here last time! What did we change? Uh, nothing much. Okay, lets try to change some "nothing" in the beginning of the game. Oh yes, the lag frame disappeared! No, wait, it is here, it just moved five seconds forward in time. The single lag frame is stalking us. Tool-Assisted Stalker!

One vertically scrolling screen is skipped by jumping out of bounds and getting a glitchy Y-coordinate on entering the screen. I would be interested to know whether there exists a faster strategy for defeating the final boss... If I recall correctly, there is a spooky creepy single stalker lag frame somewhere after the input has ended. Luckily the stalker didn't affect input lenght.

	"When I made my other Looney Tunes TAS, I was still very new to the concept of TASing. So RAM Watch wasnt utilized in the making of it. So now its been a while, and Aqfaq has now done a full TAS of this. I later contacted him about it and he asked if I could make it more entertaining. I didnt want to be cruel, so I agreed. So most of my input was actually just the bonus stage! I also did one part of Daffys Stage too.
