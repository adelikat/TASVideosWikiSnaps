	"Totally Spies! is a 2005 Game Boy Advance game based on the French Animated show of the same name. I haven't seen the show itself, I just know it is a rather divisive show for some of the content that is in the show. The game is split up into 5 stories, each with 3 or 4 levels. The game is essentially a glorified minigame collection where some of the levels resemble an interesting game while others are extremely basic minigames, not far off from what you would find in low tier shovelware. This game is definitely... one of the games of all time but the game does have good presentation to be fair (with good visuals and a solid soundtrack) and there are definitely worse games out there (like this gameâ€™s sequel). I do find the game to be kind of charming and most levels at least have some nuance in a speedrunning setting.

	"This game did of course already have a pre-existing TAS performed by Qwerty (which clocked in at 27:22) but the thing which really struck out to me is that the RTA WR was actually faster than Qwerty's TAS (RTA WR is 26:39 by swordsmankirby as of writing this). After finding that out, it made me want to go out of my way and make a new TAS for this game and here is that new TAS. The first thing I will mention is that I made this TAS completely from scratch, creating a completely new input file. I only really used Qwery's TAS to check what strats were done in their TAS and to see how much time I was saving. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"This TAS is around 4 and a half minutes faster than the old TAS and around 3 minutes 50 seconds faster than the RTA WR. I will admit that some of the timesave compared to the old TAS does come from using a newer, more console accurate emulator. The old TAS was done on an older version of VBA which had longer load times and more lag compared to real hardware. The extra lag was especially noticeable on certain levels where it can get really bad. I obviously can't fault Qwerty for this due to the age of the TAS but it is really unfortunate that was a disadvantage Qwerty had to work with and by using a much newer version of Bizhawk, that lag was reduced heavily, saving a good chunk of time in some levels in particular. Despite that though, most of the time save in this run comes from faster strats and significantly better optimisation. I fully respect Qwerty for going out of his way to TAS this game, I really do and I could tell that he put a chunk of effort into the TAS with his high rerecord count but at the same time, his old TAS was not particularly well optimised and I made it my goal to optimise this TAS as much as I could.

I did check the other languages but English was the fastest language. Italian and Dutch were the most promising alternate languages as they do overall have one less textbox than English but they still ended up being slower than English, not to mention the extra time it would take to select the languages. Dutch/Italian might be worth it in an RTA setting where textboxes cannot be perfectly skipped but for a TAS, they are not. And just as a sidenote, German was far and away the worst language, having a ton of extra text and textboxes compared to English. As English is the fastest language, I went with the US version for the TAS.

The platforming levels are by far some of the most interesting in the game but they are very wack. The platforming levels have some pretty wack physics, particularly with jumping. Double jumping especially has a lot of weird restrictions and odd physics. As an example, you can't double jump while you have attack invulnerability frames for whatever reason. When you combine that with turning around mid air being rather delayed and wall jumps being finnicky, you have some rather wack feeling platforming levels. There are some notable points to bring up about the platforming levels.

We can then drop off where the camera movement (after the text box) will end which will bring up Clover's text box, we can skip it and then we can immediately move, saving a good few seconds. This was not performed in the old TAS. We do have to be careful when performing this however not only because we want to reduce the camera movement as much as possible but if we activate the textbox in a specific spot, the game will softlock.

		"In this run, I managed to two normal bombs and no instant bombs in the 2nd/3rd phases. The old TAS got an instant bomb in phase 2. This better RNG resulted in my saving around 16 seconds compared to the old TAS. I did actually have to manipulate the RNG in order to get the right outcome but luckily for me, all I had to do to get this RNG is that I had to wait a frame before finishing the previous level. Any eagle eyed viewer may notice that I stood still for one frame just before finishing the last frame. This is why.

				"I heavily delayed the second grab and when I get the second grab, I intentionally don't finish the input. Instead, I keep hold of the last input for quite a while. I do not complete the input until the game lets me perform the third grab where I can then immediately grab onto Terrence for the 3rd and final time. This strat not only significantly reduces the amount of time it takes to grab onto Terrence but it also lets me input the grab onto him earlier which is pretty neat. If I finished the second attack just one frame earlier, I would not have been able to get the early 3rd grab. The final input I had to do did have a repeat input which was annoying but there was no fast way I could avoid it. I saved close to three seconds here compared to the old TAS.

	"And that is my updated TAS of Totally Spies with the final time clocking in at 22:58.443 (or 22:47.446 RTA). I am extremely satisfied with the final time. I knew I would probably get a run that was at least 25 minutes long but I didn't think I'd be able to cut the game down this far. There is potential for faster strats which haven't been discovered or better RNG manipulation but I am overall really satisfied with the final TAS and I think I optimised it pretty well. I know this game has some egregious downtime, it isn't a particularly fast game and the game itself is far from the greatest game out there but I still hope this run finds an audience who find the run entertaining and that it is an acceptable update for the TAS which is already on the site. I'm sure at the very least, fans of the show and those who have nostalgia for the game will likely get some entertainment out of this run.

	"Big shoutouts to Qwerty for making the original TAS and all the RTA runners of this game (especially swordsmankirby) for finding more strats and pushing the game further than even the old TAS did. If it weren't for the efforts of all these people, I may not have made this TAS.

When I read about your recognition of the existing TAS, being beaten by the WR...it just reminds me of all the discoveries that occurred in the Super Metroid community over a number of years. These discoveries eventually put the RTA runs past the early TASes. Of course, this has been reversed since then and now stands super strong over RTA.

	"From my analysis, tt wasn't so productive for me to examine your TAS against the previous one. They are quite different from each other and hard to match up. This just means you did a lot of great work that was very creative. The way I see it, this work stands strong enough and will probably not be beaten by RTA runs again...unless some big is discovered. Great job on the improvements!
