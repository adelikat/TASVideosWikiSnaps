	"The game polls the keyboard buffer once every 7 frames (0.1 seconds). That means it can take an excruciatingly long time (in TAS terms) to type out anything, and it is vital that the least possible typing be done. For example, having the hero run instead of walk is only worth it if you can save more than the 28 frames it takes to type "RUN<Enter>".  Similarly, finding the shortest way of entering commands is vital: "Hop" instead of "Jump", "Get Item" instead of "Get Equipment", and finding opportunities to just use the letter 'Y' to answer people's questions.  Furthermore, it is usually faster to use the mouse over the keyboard for movement and cancelling text boxes, but not always.

To help, I tweaked JPC-rr to allow for unlimited save slots by being able to change the save directory.  In making the run I used 1,029 different save slots.

[p 
	"The game starts with the threat level at zero.  On day 5 it increments the threat level to one, triggering the Fire Elmental attack.  When you defeat an elemental, it increments the threat level again, so defeating the Fire Elemental moves the threat level to two, returning the city to peace.  On day 8, the threat level is incremented to three, starting the Air Elemental attack, and it is incremented again to four when the elemental is defeated.  The pattern continues for the Earth and Water elementals.

[p 
	"A further benefit is the effect this has on the threat level.  On day 5, the threat level is raised to 1, cue: Fire Elemental.  But since we don't defeat the Fire Elemental, the threat level is still 1 on day 8, when it gets incremented to 2!  That means that days 8 - 11 are now spent at peace with no attack.  Day 12 increments the threat level to 3, starting the Air Elemental attack, meaning we have to skip the Day 14 Game Over check.  Unfortunately, due to the way the code is set up, the threat level remains at 3, requiring another skip of the Day 16 Game Over check.

[p 
	"Now all the Game Over checks are passed, there is nothing stopping us from hitting Day 17 and the caravan to Raseir.  Although it is easiest and fastest to just sleep to Day 17 from here, if you do so the game makes you sit through a long cutscene of you watching the sun rise.  This cutscene can be skipped by just leaving the city anytime after midnight on Day 17, so another round of map hops gets us to where we can simply march out of the city.  There is a small speed/entertainment trade off to be able to show that the Air Elemental is still trashing the city when we leave.  This costs approximately one second over the optimal map hops.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Although, there is no quick way of getting to bedtime, there is a TAS-only trick that can help speed things up a bit:  There is an interesting bit of code that is executed on screen transitions.  If the game clock variable is an even value, changing screens increases it by one.  However, if the game clock variable is an odd value, changing screens decreases it by one.  By watching this variable in memory, it's possible to change screens every time the variable is even, nudging the game clock forward slightly each time.  This shaves over 70 seconds off an unassisted run where you just have to stand around.  It also means when you first enter the city, it's faster to slowly walk to the Blue Parrot Inn to get to the door on an even clock value, than it is to quickly run and get there on an odd value.

	"From here on out the games in the series get longer and more complicated, and there may come a time when there is an advantage to start from a character file exported from a previous game.  Unfortunately, if I use JPC-rr to generate a verification movie, I don't know a way of exporting the generated character file from JPC-rr to a hard drive to be included in the actual run.  Would a DosBox video would suffice as a verification movie?  If not, what method would be needed to be able to start QFG3 (or later) from an exported character file?
