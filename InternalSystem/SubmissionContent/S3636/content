		""Ladder trick" 
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"Normally you're supposed to climb up ladders to the next room, but if the adjacent upper room is close enough to get to it with a full jump, Mickey appears in his standing sprite and allows you to do another jump.

[ul 
	[li 
		""increased jump height"
		$LF

		""breaking the running-pattern"
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"When you are about to pick up an item, it is advantageous to press the other direction or no direction at all, as opposed to running straight to the item. This saves 2 frames at almost every item.

		""Clockwork" Level:
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"A whopping 45 second shortcut is the reason i decided to tas this game. The cause for using this ROM instead of the other one, despite its disadvantage, lies in the setup of the shortcut.
	$LF
	"In this version, you'll get the deciding movement of the second topmost screw nut "naturally"(meaning you don't have to spawn and respawn this enemy in a whacky way), which more than makes up for the 30 lost frames in the previous level.
