	"Super Mario Galaxy is a classic, 2007 3D platformer in which Princess Peach is captured yet again and Mario is forced to go on a journey, collecting power stars, so he can travel to the centre of the universe and save his special one. In this TAS, Mario instead decides to terrify the local surfing instructor by breaking the game.
