	"From what I've seen of this and compared to the RTA record, this is a pretty straightforward game to complete quickly. There's small optimizations throughout that make this submission faster than the RTA record. I also found it interesting that there are apparently three correct items to finish the game and that the joke item is also the fastest of the group to collect.
