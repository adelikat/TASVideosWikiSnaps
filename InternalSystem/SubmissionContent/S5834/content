	"This is a top down dungeon crawler RPG.  Equipment, level ups, and story elements are all skipped.  The camera instantaneously rotates around Ares and always faces North/South/East/West.  Movement follows a grid system where Ares and monsters will stay within their square tiles and can only attack linearly (not diagonally.)  To reach the end, you must traverse 40 odd floors.  Bosses are varying degrees of skipped in this run.

They save so much time that the Real Time speedrun uses them even with the lowish success rate of frame perfect tricks.  This TAS was made to fix the success rate of those tricks and see what time I can get.
