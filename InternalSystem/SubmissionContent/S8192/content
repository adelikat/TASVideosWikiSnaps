	"Game & Watch Collection 2 is a collection of two classic games, Parachute and Octopus, from the Game & Watch series with a new game that combines the two, Parachute x Octopus. Starting with the first Octopus session, each cycle follows the pattern where the points gained during the Octopus session determines the reward for the following Parachute session, with each parachute granting 10 points at most.

	"This movie reaches the point (1000 mark) in Parachute x Octopus where the speed of parachutes and tentacles stops increasing. As a note, the difficulty increases only as the displayed score counter increases, which means the technical maximum difficulty settings don't take effect until after the inputs end.
