	"The solar system is under attack! Enemy Super-Dreadnoughts have been placed in orbit around each of the fifteen planets in this galactic sector. They are draining mineral resources from the planetary cores for use in their interstellar power units. Each Super-Dreadnought seeks out a different metal for its metal converter.
	$LF
	"Your Manta class Space Fighter will be transported to each planet in turn and it is your task to destroy each Dreadnought. First you must attack the defensive screen of enemy fighters, then you must neutralize the majority of surface deference before you land on the Super-Dreadnought's master runway. Once on board you must pull as many fuel rods as possible from the metal converters before you take off for a final strafing run as the Dreadnought vaporizes into the ether.

	"One of the problems, that kept me from moving on, was the fact that I didn't understand how to optimize each ship. At first, I thought the clearing of all stationary ships, needed to be destroyed. After accomplishing this, on the first ship, I was surprised to find out that I could land on the Dreadnought. Eventually, I discovered it was the attack waves that needed to be dealt with. After enough searching, I found an address that correlated to each wave. The final step was to find the most optimal way to eliminate these waves. One way, is to eliminate the entire fleet and causing it to de-spawn, which forces the next wave to emerge. Another way is to fly by them very fast and cause the same de-spawning behavior. With enough experimentation, I found a good balance to hold each wave attack to approximately 2 seconds...which is the shortest I was ever able to get. Applying this knowledge, I was able to destroy all 15 ships in record time.

I thought this run would be a good comparison, since my TAS is about half the time of this effort. Watching humans play this, is almost unbearable...since most players die constantly.
