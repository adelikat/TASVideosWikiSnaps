	"Normally, you're unable to re-enter a Boss Tower once you obtain its bell and exit back into the Main Hall (the entryway to it becomes sealed).  However, you can enter Cold Killer's Tower again by going through Dungeon #8 (also located in Main Hall) and finding its exit.  Before doing this though, you

	"Defeating Cold Killer a second time yields another bell, which is glitched.  From here, you must burn them both at the Holy Flame back at the Main Hall, before death-warping a second time.  Afterward, the glitch is activated -- which essentially places unlimited bells in your inventory.  Going back to the Holy Flame and burning five more bells opens the gate to Rubas' Tower (and burning MORE than five steadily glitches out your inventory and the game, itself!).

Normally, you need to obtain an item called the 'Magic Key' to pass through.  However, while these guards are impervious to damage, they CAN be momentarily stunned with your projectiles.  With enough well-timed shots, you can slip past them and save about 12-13 seconds, each time you journey through the courtyard.

	"For speedrunners, this trick can also be performed in real-time.  Due to doors in this game being skewed to the right, you will need to stun the guard on the right, instead, in order to slip through.  This is due to Prince Myer's slow movement in the beginning.  Once you have obtained the Hyper Boots, though, you can successfully slip past either guard.

	"My first trek through the Castle involved a major route change that saved about 28 seconds from hisatoki's run.  After defeating the first dragon mini-boss, I entered Dungeon #4.  This dungeon is very convenient for money grinding due to the close proximity of Orange Tower enemies and a shop that sells Orange Scrolls.  The Towers can be manipulated into dropping 8 Ludder each time.  Therefore, I entered the Dungeon with 60 Ludder (50 to start, plus two kills) to minimize grinding to a minimum.  Farming five Towers gave me enough to quickly enter the shop and purchase an Orange Scroll, immediately warping me to the Main Hall.

	"Once in Cold Killer's Tower, I worked my way about halfway up and entered one of the game's Secret Rooms, containing a pair of Hyper Boots.  In hisatoki's run, he spent a good 8 seconds standing in place and killing off all of the aggressive foes, taking significant damage in the process.  I streamlined this down to two well-timed damage boosts:  One to get the loot, and another to get outta there!
