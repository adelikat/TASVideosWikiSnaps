Starring Michael Jackson, the movie takes place in a world where the bad guy Mr. Big (played by Joe Pesci) wants to get everyone addicted to las drogas.  Michael tries to stop this plot and rescue the kids, or something.  The movie is REALLY REALLY weird.  There’s a scene where Michael turns into a robot and shoots guns at people as the robot.

When you free children from doors or similar hidden areas, you can jump as soon as you free them to start moving, otherwise you are forced to stand in place for a few seconds. You can also cancel out of these with a duck, which we'll later use to quickly drop through some floors.

If we save the kid that’s closest to the boss area, we can start the fight almost immediately.  If you are in position as the screen goes black, you automatically save 22 frames over the soonest you could get into place otherwise.

	"-Better RNG manip. There were several points across the run where we could save time, but just weren't able to implement it because we couldn't get the RNG back into a favorable place. See the end of 3-2, where we have to delay talking to the girl by several frames in order to avoid messing up the insane quick kill on the 3-3 boss. Better understanding of the systems behind that would definitely help improve this.

This is partially a continuation of the RNG manip, because there are a ton of different boss patterns to analyze and manipulate, and the sparkle glitch allows for many different approaches to each one.
