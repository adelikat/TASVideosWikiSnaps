	"To beat this game, I need 76 seeds minimal. Digging minigame is best way to collect them. In old run, I talkedã€€in front of clerk ham. Instead I talked him from left side in this run. This led to cut waiting frames for digging 30 seeds in 1st move (might be as well as 2nd one too). 38 frames saved.
