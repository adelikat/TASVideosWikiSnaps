	"A Koopa's Revenge 2 is a Super Mario fan game set in a parallel universe where Bowser and company are the good guys, while Mario and his pals are pure evil. After defeating Mario and his cohorts in the first game, Koopa sets off to a distant land where a kidnapped Bowser is being held by a mysterious robed figure.

	"This run is done on the 2.9.0 version of the game, which is the latest official release of this game. I say this because recently the developer created an unofficial release of the game, 2.9.0.2, which features a brand new "Speedrun Mode" with an In Game Timer for real time runs and it changes a lot of mechanics to help RTA runs. This version is much faster than 2.9.0, but since I was already far into the run I decided to keep going on the official version for the sake of my motivation. This version is mainly cosmetic, but it patches some of the tricks present in the 2.0 version. However, there are still a few that have slipped through the cracks but they aren't present in this run. One change which impacts this run is that the final boss takes 1 more cycle to die compared to the 2.0 version, and sadly there is no way to speed up that fight. The pipe that takes you to the underground section in the first stage was changed, which saves a few frames. One final change is that 2-3 features an autoscroller after entering the door for the first time, which takes 206 frames to finish. Although this version is slower than the 2.0 version, I chose it because it is the most popular amongst RTA runners of this game.

[div class=p 
	"As far as glitches in this game go, there are very few that are actually useful in runs. This TAS only makes use of 1 glitch in the level 1-2 to save 5 frames and that is corner clipping. Just like in most other games, with a very precise position it's possible to clip through the corner of any block in the game. This sounds very useful at first, but the main problem is that the developer actually coded it so even if you do clip inside a block, you remain stuck in the wall, as every block in almost every wall has its own separate collision box. The staircase in 1-2 is the only place that I found where you can clip inside and repeteadly wall jump to get out of the wall, in the rest of the staircases you just get stuck midway through. It is not fully understood exactly how precise the position to clip in has to be, since there are no tools for this game.

[div class=p 
	"To perform a wall jump, you need to jump at a wall and by pressing the Jump key while sliding off the wall, you will jump off it in the opposite direction you are facing from. However, this can be exploited to wall jump in the same direction you're going by facing the opposite direction you want to go in and then jumping on the first possible frame you touch the wall. So, if you are going right and want to wall jump to the right, you would need to press Left, then jump at the wall and press the Jump key on the first frame. This is very useful for clearing walls that are barely too tall to get on top of using a regular jump, or to simply gain more height. If you perform a reverse wall jump and the wall is high enough you can wall jump again, but this time it's impossible to do another reverse wall jump (unless you have the Water Flower power-up.

	"The Dragontail power-up not only has all the features that the regular leaf power-up has, such as gliding and the P meter which allows you to fly in the air, but it also has another useful ability that lets you turn into a heavy weight and descend very fast downwards. While in this state you are able to hit breakable blocks and even get power-ups, and you cannot take damage. While these perks are also useful for the run, the most important perk for this run is the fact that it kills all your horizontal speed instantly. I found that by pressing the F key to switch to the other power-up 3 frames before performing this ability, you are able to kill all your speed but skip the animation of the heavy weight, and with good positioning this is used right before doors or pipes to enter them instantly as you have to come to a complete stop to enter them.

]h4
[div class=p 
	"The Spiny power-up is located in world 2, and it's the power-up that saves the most time over the course of the run. Normally it takes 5 frames of walking to get to running speed from a full stop, however Spiny has the ability to get the player to running speed instantly by pressing Down + S. S can be held but it will delay the launch until it's released, so by pressing it only for 1 frame you save 4 frames every time you have to get to running speed using it, and since there are hundreds of cases over the run it saves a tremendous amount of time. It is one of the main places where the TAS really drifts away from the RTA World Record as it's extremely hard for a human to press Down + S frame perfectly and for a single frame this many times in a run. Another very useful perk is that it's able to kill most enemies in the game by stomping on them, no matter how high or low you jump, meaning you are able to keep this power-up for a long time. One final perk that it has is that it can break brick blocks and not bounce back, which is why we use Spiny in 1-1 for example.

	"Normally, when a textbox appears on the map screen (and inside the level in the case of Switch Palaces), it takes 6 frames for the text to appear, after which you can press S to clear it, taking another 6 frames to close. However, if you instead pause on the first frame after the textbox appears, the text doesn't appear anymore and it skips to the closing animation immediately, saving 6 frames each time. There is a textbox after beating any exit of 1-1, after beating each of the bosses, after unlocking Space Jump, Screw Attack and RC, as well as 2 textboxes for each Switch Palace, totaling up to about 20 textboxes, therefore this saves close to 120 frames in total.

[div class=p 
	"One of if not the biggest timesave over the World Record comes from the route which is completely different. Many levels in this game have more than 1 exit, so which exit is completed will be marked next to the level name. For simplicity sake, the normal exit will have 
	[b 
		"N
	]b
	" next to its name, and the secret one will have 
	[b 
		"S
	]b
	". If neither N nor S appear, it means the level has just 1 exit. Because the spare box can only store 1 additional power-up, and most levels require more than 2 power-ups to complete optimally, it was very difficult to come up with a route that satisfies all criterias. Another very important thing that we had to look out for are the day & night cycles. The game starts on a day cycle; if you beat a level or die, the world becomes nocturne, and beating or dying in another level will change it back to daytime. This is important because many levels in this game are different whether it's night or day, so to differentiate them, the night levels will have their name
