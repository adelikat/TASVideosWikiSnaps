	"This run improves on Rising tempest's previous TAS, however it is overall slower because it beats 2 additional bonus levels because most poeple wanted to see those included. For this reason, run doesn't end at or ever show the credits, i tried to make this work but it wasn't possible. Option was between doing all levels and ending at credits and i chose to do all levels. So instead movie ends at fadeout of final level.

Almost every level is completed in a time below what was believed to be the lowest possible time before run was started. I should also note that every level is a TAS record, i.e no level has ever been TAS'ed faster than in this run(not counting decimals).

	"The making of this run:
	$LF
]h3
[div class=p 
	"Originally this runs started when Jack(Rising Tempest) asked me if i wanted to be a co-author in an improvement run. Sometime after i started the Dam level and i simply kept going and finished it. At this point i hadn't had alot of contact with Jack and in the end i continued the run by myself. In the beginning, Simon used to do TAS'es alongside my own which was a big factor later on in perfecting alot of levels. We were able to compare runs and TT's and this made it possible to improve levels more than i probably would've done had i done it alone. When reaching the Surface 2 level Simon made his first contribution to the movie when i asked him to do the beginning of the level for me. On the next level, Bunker 2, i ran into some problems about halfway through the run and after countless attempts of trying to manipulate a guard holding a safe key, i gave up. At this point, Simon took over the whole run. He finished Bunker 2, and also did Statue and Archives levels. After this almost a year passed without any furhter progress. Mostly because this run aimed to beat all previous TAS records and the standing record on Streets was 1:51 by Simon which we thought was unbeatable with the control style used(because leaning can't be done which makes the Valentin strafing slower). However, roughly a year later Simon told me is was "about time" to continue the run so we made a try on Streets. Originally we planned to co-author the rest of the run but by coincidence, i ended up doing all the input for Streets. I also continued on with Depot and at this point, we decided that i'd do the rest of the game by myself. The times gotten here in the second half of the run were mindblowing both to myself and Simon and hopefully the rest of the communities following the progress. I managed to finish the run in only a few weeks after returning.

]h3
[div class=p 
	"This run is far better than i ever expected it to be. And while some minor improvements do exist, I consider this run to be as close to maxed out as Goldeneye can get. Some levels like Streets where luck manipulation is extremely heavy had everything going right and the time is so fast that i think it would be extremely hard to even tie. I'm very proud of how the run turned out and i hope everyone can enjoy it as much as i do myself :)
