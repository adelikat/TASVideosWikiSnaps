	"NYMX was working on the C64 port of the game on his own.  This prompted DrD2k9 to investigate the Coleco version.  Once each of us completed our own TAS, we swapped files and reviewed each other's work.  We each made improvements to the other person's TAS then swapped back again.  During all the back and forth, we decided to investigate the published A2600 run.  Using knowledge gained from doing the other two ports (and a bit more file swapping), we effectively did a complete reTAS of the A2600 port by testing alternative inputs room-by-room.  This resulted in improvements on every level through the run. As we each worked on and made improvements to all three ports, we are both authors on all three submissions.

Your helicopter is lagging behind your input rather heavily, and you can't go upward instantly after you've gone downward, so you just have to wait at the corner holding Up until it finally starts moving you up. In other places releasing the directional input for a while before you go up allows you to lend sooner somehow. All in all, I couldn't make those segments faster.
