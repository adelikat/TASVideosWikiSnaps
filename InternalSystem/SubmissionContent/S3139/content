	"This game is like a FC game, which called “Gradius”. My first was cancelled. Because of the empty action. So after I learned of the published run – adelikat’s Gradius. I tried this game again. And I used the whole weapons in movie, when I needn’t save time. So the entertainment of this movie was really high.

This was a pity. And if I didn’t come to the direct place, the time that system made the airplane to direct place was the same. Like stage 1, stage 2, stage 4.
