		"last submission
	]a
	".The most improtment improvment comes from a damage in LAS VEGAS.Hero can pass the power grid with this advantage.The other improvment comes from details and lag's reduction.Be careful,"RED ALERT" can be escaped,but we will loss more time.In the end of the run,I stop the record in advance,because that dumbass will take damage by himself~~~
