You can get powerups if you kill 4 straight aliens of the same color (red, blue, green, or black). These powerups (except black) are very destructive and can kill waves easily. You have a powerup bar that limits the amount of time you have on the powerup. You can hold R to stop the bar, but you cannot use the powerup when pressing R. The powerups are:
