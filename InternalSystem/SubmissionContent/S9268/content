	"This run uses all the same glitches as the previous run and more.  There are minor improvements throughout the run and a significant time save due to the barrier skips in area 12.  There may be methods to further manipulate the game by leveraging sub-pixel values or something else that is beyond my understanding.  Until I have that knowledge, this is as fast as I can make this route.

	"I would like to express gratitude to all those who support and contribute to the community.  I relied heavily on McBobX's 100% run as well as the any% run by nEilfox, Alyosha & Challenger.  I spent many hours meticulously progressing through each frame of their videos as I sought to optimize.  Your work was vehemently appreciated.  Thanks to everyone who plays bionic commando and to anyone reading this.

	": I've been mulling over this run for a while now. During my initial comparison, against the previous run, I saw issues that caused me to slow down with analysis of this run. Some of those issues were that areas are slower over the previous run. I had to step away and come back with a fresh new look at this, especially after having a private conversation with a staff member. Coming back to this for a second round, I still see that some areas are not up to snuff, BUT!! I'm chalking it up as a problem of RNG that gave the author fits on keeping up with the previous. Whether or not this was the issue, it appears to be the case. One instance, I saw an enemy on the end of a stage that didn't exist on

[div class=p 
	"So the run is overall faster, due to new techs and routes. Most of the time, runs are usually able to keep up with older ones...but I can think of a number of games that I've obsoleted where some areas can't be kept as fast, because you can't afford to delay too much movement in order to keep ahead.
