	"Iji is an action-packed strategic platform shooter with a detailed story, large levels with multiple paths, powerful bosses and lots of secrets. There are alternate gameplay events, dialogues and scenes depending on what you do, a wealth of extras and bonus features, and seven stats to upgrade through a leveling system. Iji herself has superhuman strength and abilities, and can crack Nanotechnology, use her enemies' most devastating weapons against them, and be a pacifist or a killer - the story adapts to how you play.

	"This TAS was made in Hourglass r81 on Windows XP (which I emulated using Virtualbox). The reason I ran Iji 1.6 is because 1.7 does not work with Houglass (or at least savestates don’t work).

	"The aim of this TAS was to complete the game as fast as possible. For this reason I used the easiest difficulty ‘normal’. On other difficulties you need more nano (basically exp in this game) per level, which would make the shortcut in sector 5 and the massive skip in sector X impossible. I use extensive RNG manipulation in most sectors to get the optimal damage boost form enemies / good crack RNG. Most of the run is fairly standard, the only real glitch is at Proxima (I still don’t exactly know what causes it to skip an attack after it gets hit by lightning).

This is only true for the MPFB and getting hit by any other projectile (rocket/splitershock) is slower than walking because the getting up animation is really long. Getting punched by the Tasen Commander is also faster than walking.

Accepting the truce adds 10 minutes onto the ingame timer but since this TAS is timed with real time, skipping the boss saves around 12 seconds (you would want to get the Buster gun and enough ammo to fight the boss and this would take extra time on top of the 9 second boss fight)

Since you have a high strength level you can use the Resonance detonator to kill the green Tasen Scouts. This can be done after falling down the long drop and in the long room and near the end of the sector to get some extra Nano for no extra time. In the long room I manipulate enemies to get boosted a lot. Right before the end I use a Nanofield reboot to get 5 Crack and 2 HP, which will be used in the next sector.

You need to crack Spread rockets (combination of the shotgun and Rocket launcher) in order to blast away the cracked floor. After this you need to switch to the MPFB as soon as you get it and blast yourself over the wall. This skips over half of sector 5. You need to be level 18 to get the Nuke to instakill Asha. This can be done by firing the nuke on the first frame of the fight. It is best to also hold left so that you get knocked back to the right towards the Supercharge which gives you 1 skill point.

Make sure to pick up the health and boost yourself again. In the room with the terminal you need to kill yourself. Make sure to only use rockets to do this as you need MPFB ammo later on. After knocking yourself over the gap with the Nuke it is time to fight Proxima. I get 2 Attack but this is technically not required but eliminates some RNG from the Proxima fight. For whatever reason if you nuke Proxima when it is in the correct position you can knock it downwards instead of upwards. If you shoot it at precise times and precise positions it will skip some attacks and the terminal will be operational instantly. I manipulate Proxima so that it is close to the electricity after I activate the second terminal. You need keep 1 MPFB round for the start of the next sector.

In the next room I pick up all of the MPFB ammo and try to nuke in a way that puts me close to the door. Once the door opens I switch to the Resonance detonator and blast the door.

Later I MPFB boost myself not only because it is faster but also because I need to take damage for the death warp at the end of the Shredder part.

	"Iosa part 1 is beaten by shooting her with Rockets and Splintershocks because they don’t waste any time and also MPFB where they don’t waste time. Mid fight I use Retribution – you need all 8 basic weapons, at least 1 ammo for each, and 5 or less HP currently left. Just after being knocked to the ground, rise while holding the Use key. If performed while Iji is still flashing from taking the damage that knocked her down, the skill will activate. This deals massive damage if you are on top of her.

This skips more than half of sector X and is the reason why you need 10 crack, Tasen and Komato. After dropping down and destroying the turret with the Resonance detonator, I crack the door which saves 20 seconds over going around it (this is not viable to do in real time because cracking would take too long and you would get hit). For the next part it is best to select the Rocket launcher and kill the Beast. In the final room before Tor I reboot my Nanofield for the last time, getting 10 Tasen and Attack, 3 assimilate and some HP.  The HP level needed is at least 4 but more is recommended in case you don’t get the absolutely optimal pattern.

	"And finally Tor. You need 26 MPFB ammo and 5 rockets. I shoot 5 MPFB shots per round (6 in one of the rounds), reflect the Chargeball, and fire a rocket before he flies away. I make sure to shoot the first shot before Tor lands otherwise I might not be able to get 5 shots off. The missile attack delays Tor’s next attack by about 20 frames and I manipulate him to only do it once (when I want to get the 6th MPFB shot). Also from all of the “transition attacks” (Mega missile (shoots balls), Death hail (shoots something from above) and Eruption (fast red wave)), Eruption is the fastest so you can save a few seconds if you get good RNG. This is the only transition attack he uses in this TAS (except for the very first one, which is always a Death hail).
