	"The original goal of this run was to achieve a time lower than 6:40, and thanks to several timesavers which AKA mentioned to me (the glitch we used to access Bowser in the Dark World, the glitch we used to get from there to the basement), this seemed more than possible. I also had some ideas of my own, which we put to good use, such as the alternate route in BitDW which saved about a second over the older route. The obvious thing to mention about this run, however, is that it finishes the game with zero stars, something which was previously impossible. It all started out with a theory which AKA had, which involved performing a backwards long jump on the stairs in the basement, and getting Mario wedged inside one of the pillars in the room with the Dire, Dire Docks painting, just like what we did after exiting BitDW. This proved impossible, as Mario had way too much speed to be able to move to the sides of the room. It was at this time that I began thinking about adding an extra long jump outside the door, because logically, this would still cause his speed to increase, and then did another one when I was inside, as I realised that this would cause his speed to increase even more. This gave me enough speed to break the DDD painting, but there was only literally one frame I could've long jumped on while inside the DDD room to have enough speed to break it. This discovery of mine took about 45 seconds off the overall time. Overall, I'm very happy with this run, it definitely seems a lot more optimal than the other runs which AKA and I have co-authored, probably because we re-did so many things so many times in this run.

	"During Rikku's submission, I wasn't too interested in doing another run. I decided that I'd only work on another run if there was a way to notably improve the current run. Firstly, I was utterly convinced that there was an alternate lobby glitch which was faster. It took countless revisions, but I eventually found one that worked. Secondly, I thought there would be a way to get quickly to the basement without re-entering BitDW. And last of all, I had a good theory on how to bypass DDD, although Swordless Link was the one who eventually found a way to do it, and it was a lot faster and smoother than I ever could have been conceived. Also, I knew that a few frames could be saved if diving was used over long jumping where applicable, although that alone wasn't enough to warrant another run. The main timesaver that I found was how to get to the basement door quicker. Although, again, I would never have thought that it would have turned out that good. We put an extra special effort into this run, but it was worth it in the end, and I hope that most of the viewers will agree. If you calculate the number of re-records per frame, then it has one of the most dense re-record rates on the site if you base the re-record rate on re-records per frame (since the game is 30fps), then this run would be third overall if you discard the ALttP glitched run.
