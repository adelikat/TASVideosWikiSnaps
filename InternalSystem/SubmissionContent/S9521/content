		$LF

				" This submission appears to be a recording of human play that used savestates to back up and retry certain portions of the game.  It lacks the precision that is possible when using the TAStudio tool.

		" End your movie on the last input necessary to get to the credits/endgame.
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" This submission has A-button presses beyond where they are necessary.  The last actual frame of input needed to get to the credits in your run is frame #86773 (the total #of frames for the movie would then be 86774 for a time of approximately 24 minutes)
				$LF
			]li
		]ul
	]li
	[li 
		" In conjunction with the previous point, don't have any empty frames of input at the end of your movie.
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" Due to the way our site parses input files, blank inputs at the end of a run will artficially increase the displayed time of the run.  In this case, the posted time of 27:45.92 is incorrect due to the extra blank frames.  This submission contains 13,254 blank frames at the end of the run.
