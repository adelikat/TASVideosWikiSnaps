	"Red Alarm is a 3D shooter using wire frame graphics. As a 3D game, this is the best Virtual Boy game. This is not an automatic scrolling game, so the player can fly around the 3D space freely. The mission is to destroy a computer called KAOS. There are 6 stages and each stage has a boss. The game ends if the fuel runs out.
