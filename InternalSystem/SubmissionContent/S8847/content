	" is a 1985 text adventure game based on the titular 1984 film, released by Adventure International. Loosely following the film's script, you play as Billy Peltzer, who's messed up big time and accidentally fed his pet moguai Gizmo after midnight. Now there's evil gremlins all over the city and he has to get rid of all them while keeping Gizmo safe.

From what I remember, of my own "Text Adventure" games, there was one route. I doubt that is the case with all of these types of games, but I'm going to chalk this up as a baseline...since I have no feedback and there is not much of a community for me to measure this by.
