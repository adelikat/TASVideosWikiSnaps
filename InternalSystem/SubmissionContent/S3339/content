	"Time Lord is what you might call a 2.5D platforming game (z direction is on a slight diagonal). It has a reasonably good engine, which is what attracted me to it. Unfortunately they managed to use a decent game engine to make a really crappy game. There is no blue police box, so we'll assume the main character is not The Doctor.

	"This is actually a fairly difficult game because the enemies are fairly unforgiving in some places, and the method to get a few of the orbs is outright cryptic. I would be surprised if many players got past level 3 in real time without a turbo controller. The mexican cowboy boss on level 3 does have health that regenerates, but with no on screen indication most players probably gave up not knowing if they were even causing dammage.

	"This game engine does lend itself well to a TAS and in particular a no dammage run. The act of attacking essentially turns off hit detection for enemies and enemy projectiles. You'll notice quite a bit of jump kicking because attacking in air doesn't impact speed. It is particularly evident on the last run up to the boss when I'm getting constantly bombarded by following enemies.
