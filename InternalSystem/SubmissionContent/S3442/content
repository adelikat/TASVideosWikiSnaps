	"This run aims to beat The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons in as little a time as possible. We achieved a final time of 1h 25m 57.217s (309433 frames). This run is the product of many years of work on the game. It's been attempted by various runners over the past 5 years, and the furthest anyone else got was the start of dungeon 3. This is completely understandable as TASing this game is extremely frustrating when it comes to enemy and item manipulation. This incarnation of the run was started in mid-late 2010, and was left alone for a long time at the end of that year due to lack of motivation. At that point, only Swordless Link was working on it. When he reached the end of dungeon 4, he decided to coauthor the rest with Tompa, who had significantly more motivation than him at that time. Tompa is pretty much the master of the Game Boy Zelda games, so his help in the run was crucial to making it as awesome as it turned out to be. Because of its tediousness and how smooth and optimal the final product looks, we are very proud of it.

[div class=p 
	"- Pitwalking: Probably the most useful trick in the game, this lets us walk across pits provided that there's one on either side of Link. The reason it works is because the game will try to drag you towards the centre of one pit, but if you push the opposite direction, he'll move across into the other pit, and the game will try to drag you into the centre of that one instead. By constantly rotating between which pit we are in while moving in the direction that we're heading, we can clear any number of pits. There are some limitations - for example, you can't stop end a pitwalk if there is an object above or below the pit "seam" you are on, on the land that you're headed towards. An example of this is in dungeon 3, in the room before the miniboss. Pitwalking across that section is impossible because of the torches on the other side of the pit.

[div class=p 
	"- Pegasus Seeds: These are obtained all over the place. They significantly speed up Link's movement and save several seconds on every screen they're used on. Because of this, they are manipulated wherever possible and used whenever it saves time to have them equipped (which is most of the time). Planning the ussage of them is not the easiest, as It depends a lot on if we can get them from enemy drops or not. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- Enemy manipulation: This is the worst part of the game by a long shot. Although the game looks very simple at first glance, the manipulation is a real nightmare. In most cases, the only thing that will change an enemy's manipulation (aside from wasting seconds of time) is slashing the sword, so generally, we have to find places to do this without costing time. These include while riding minecarts, while waiting for something to happen, and while jumping with the feather. Your actions from various screens past can significantly change the outcome of a screen various screens later. It's ridiculous. Other things that can affect manipulation are RNG, which changes every 2 frames when certain enemies (like bats) are on the screen. So in some instances, delaying 2, 4, 6, ... etc. frames on a screen with enemies can change the manipulation on future screens for the better. Needless to say, this was a real hassle to optimise, and it became even more tedious when we had to start keeping out pegasus seed count high.
