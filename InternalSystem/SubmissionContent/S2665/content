	"The final battle with Dedede is not necessary to unlock all of the secrets in the game, but it is required to see the ending, so I have included it for completeness sake. Besides, Kirby must defeat Dedede to fulfill his goal of restoring the beautiful starlit sky, right? I fight Dedede in normal mode rather than extra mode. In extra mode, Kirby deals half as much damage to Dedede, which prolongs the battle but makes it none the more interesting.
