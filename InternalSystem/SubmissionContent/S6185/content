You move faster when you jump instead of walk.  but sliding is faster than either walking or jumping.  if you jump as soon as your slide is done, you can preserve speed.  you can also preserve this speed if you jump again when you crouch and jump as you land.  but after you land again your speed reduces.  you also want to let go of the directional pad when you jump otherwise you lose the speed.

[div class=p 
	"So to explain a bit on how the quick kill works, we have to understand how it changes cycles.  the boss starts out moving up and down on the screen, once you reach the end of the room, it will continue to bounce until it reaches a certain point on the screen, it needs to be on the bottom right while moving upward to start an arch movement above Rick.  So how the quick kill is achieved is you notice that I dont move full speed to the boss, and instead pause then walk the rest of the way, this is so the boss wont immediately start it's arch cycle, as it still has a bit of time before it can move downward to position.  now while the boss is still in the first phase, hitting it will cause it to freeze for a second until it teleports back into the position it should be at, this allows use to make it miss the arch position, and we can keep hitting it until it's dead.

I got bored and decided not to wait and asked myself to make that movie file for the Japanese version, so I'm replacing the movie made for the USA version with the movie made for the Japanese version, so it's used in the final publication. I honestly only updated the header, that's all. Also note that I'm publishing encodes of this movie being played on both of these versions anyway. And while the previous publication uses 2 video streams, each representing its own game version, I decided to make 2 separate encode files each representing its own game version, and the version represented is represented in the hard subtitles represented in the encodes of the corresponding versions. But that's already plain and simple, and honestly I think this is stupidly obvious, like, as obvious as what I'm trying to say here is. Also keep in mind I'm not a native English speaker, so give me a break. If there's still something you failed to understand about versions and encodes, just ask away. Why do I suddenly feel as chatty as Samsara used to be in their notes? I guess it's because I'm obsoleting their movie, which alone makes me feel weird. I guess I must shut up already.
