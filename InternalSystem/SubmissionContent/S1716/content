	"I chose Mode B because it starts at round 4. Which is harder. Also, the high jump minimum requirement to be qualified is 2m36. In mode A, it's 2m26. Of course if I could, I would choose the hardest possible round. The value is increased each time the game is beaten.

	"3rd objective. Try to be entertaining as possible. That one is not easy because some things might be good for some people while it's bad for others. I think it's impossible to satisfy everybody. With a 2nd player, it's possible to do some things that is not possible during a 1 player run. 
	$LF
	"Note that in this run, I didn't do those "44 or 46 degree angle" attempt since, imo, it's nothing extraordinary and they are in other runs which are 4 years old and I think we already know what it does. 45째 is obviously the best in all events, except high jump which is different, of course. I wanted to do some new things.
