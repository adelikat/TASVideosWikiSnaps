	"With each increment in skill level, you are given less time to bomb all five targets and the alien spaceship AI gets harder. Skill level 5, the hardest skill level with a clear end, was played in the run. There is a sixth skill level but it is an endless survival mode. There are also the "Warp" keys which allow you to change your flight speed. Warp 3 (the fastest) was selected right as the game started.

	": Execution looks good. Feedback was shy and mildly positive, even though from all the currently published INTV movies, no one has more than 3 for entertainment. It's hard to expect this run to get Moons ratings after it's published. But Moons give more exposure, so there's a higher chance of at least getting

	" ratings, than if it's sent to Vault right away. I'm on the fence about the tier here, however it's a

	" goal, so changing the tier can safely be done anytime. Let's send it to Moons and see how it goes. Accepting.
