	"This movie quite demonstrate the timing can actually be pretty much identic between pcsx and psxjin, the time difference is due to extra "fake" lag that wasnt in pcsx-rr originally, it doesnt create a lot of difference by itself, the other difference is the rng seed is affected, so on bosses some time is lost.

	"It wasnt very complex to hex and resync the movie, thx to text movie format. Took only a few hours of work, there was probably less than 30 desync in total.

	"As for why theres no improvement, im not aware of any possible ones, given the very small ammount of touching on the input im safe to say its at least as good as old one, aside from rng seed of course.

	": This is a difficult decision. The main benefit of accepting updates would be more accurate runs. However, the key word here is 
	[em 
		"more
	]em
	" accurate as the limitations of emulators are well known. Updating, therefore, should be a matter of degree. It would be worthwhile where the differences in emulation are considerable, in this case the difference is only a few seconds. There is a potential downside to accepting updates: firstly, as in this case, they can be submitted by someone other than the original author, thus taking control of the work out of the author's hands; secondly, and similarly, it could result in users updating popular runs in order to one-up others and join in the glory of a particular run; finally, as said in the thread, I see no point in compelling our encoders to re-encode movies with no material difference. Also, 
	[a class=intlink href=/1411S 
		"Circus Charlie
	]a
	" was mentioned as precedent for updates. I don't think the circumstances are quite comparable. In Famtasia we had an unsatisfactory emulator of hellish proportions. PCSX sucks, but it is not quite in the same league. As stated in the 
	[a class=intlink href=/Forum/T/3365 
		"Famtasia obsoletion discussion
	]a
	" the purpose of striking-off these runs was due to the representation of TAS quality very early on, rather than a compulsion to have slightly better timing. Therefore, I do not feel bound by it. For lack of a compelling reason to accept 
	[em 
		"this
	]em
	" update I am rejecting this submission for not improving the currently published run.
