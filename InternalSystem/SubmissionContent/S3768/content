	"This run aims to complete all levels in the game, which includes the optional intermediate levels, and the now featured Multiball levels.  These only appear after collecting all rings on the map, thus those need to be gotten too.  This gives us a chance to see more than the any% route allows.

	"While the game may try to maintain a sense of symmetry, it somewhat fails.  This means that glitches need to be done slightly differently on each side, in case you were confused by the inconsistent methods to get through the top.  After a few detours, we can start the first of four ultra hard mysteries of where to find the bonus gates, for the now included multiball levels.  Very quick to do, just flip a ball behind the crab for massive damage.  Now although this may look fast, it's still the worst of the run sadly.

	"You'll notice that starting around 15550 that a trigger has a bad habit of lingering on screen.  Not a clue why that happens, similar effects can occur on other levels too, but thankfully it fades once we enter Multiball 2.  Speaking of which, despite all 4 multiballs being the same map, we can't just recycle the same strat.  They'll be some randomness to the initial cluck positions, forcing unique strategies each time,

	"New glitch here, any floor/wall corner can be squeezed into, providing a nice shortcut to the room below.  Useless in any%, since this is only really used as a fast backtrack method, which we don't need normally.  Now that Multiball-3 went smoothly, we can conclude that Multiball-2 wasn't just a stroke of good luck.  It must be that Multiball-1 was just poorly done. The game however is very unfriendly to hex, so can't really go back to improve it now.  Veterans will be pleased to see the return of the suicidal cluck on the boss tubes.
