	"Nothing much to say here.  This is a typical platformer, where you control Alice through twenty levels, most of which involve collecting keys and opening doors, often many per level.  Mushrooms allow Alice to shrink or grow, and occasionally only one type of size can be used to complete certain tasks.  The controls are set up much like the original Super Mario Brothers - A to jump, B to run faster.

	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"It’s not really clipping, but that’s the best name I can think of at the moment.  If Alice enters a wall or platform at a certain angle where she has part of her body (usually her head) overlapping, the game tries to eject her from the wall/platform...but ends up propelling her UP on top of the platform instead of below it.  This is used several times to land impossible jumps onto moving platforms.

	"Double Jump
	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"After landing on top of an enemy, the game registers Alice as being on the ground, so she can jump again after killing an enemy.  This is rarely used in this game (to get onto high platforms) since enemies are often not anywhere near platform edges, but it is used once or twice in the run.
