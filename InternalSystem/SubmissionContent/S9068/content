	"Because I'm going for "maximum score", I had to approach this game differently. This game increases speed every 20 bomb catches (I believe). Because of this, it is not prudent to start on the hardest level, since we would miss the easy task of catching bombs at a slower rate. Additionally, choosing the hardest level would only get us to a quicker end...because the speed still increases indefinitely. So...I start on the easiest level and play it out until I am no longer able to catch bombs.

	"The end comes when I can not wrap around or go directly to the final bomb. Even though this game was mostly BOTed, I did play with it manually to come up with a strategy to get a few more...something my BOT couldn't figure out.

	"There was no way that I was going to sit with this game and carve out inputs. Because I didn't know how long this game would run, I eventually figured out a script that helped me to put this game to rest...mostly. So about 99% of this was BOTed, while the last few bomb catches were done manually, due a limitation of my BOT. Basically, I played strategy to time the bomb drops for easier reach. Obviously, I couldn't keep this up too long.
