	"There is one glitch I found ,I called it double damage.Usually when boss takes too much damage he will stumble and drop so if you can hit him two times in same time the boss hp will drain out quick and will not drop on same damage he does normally.

	": This movie is a bit repetitive and not all that entertaining, but the audience response was pretty good (once all those no votes are changed to yes for the replacement). Given that the run is pretty short, I find that it's entertaining enough. I'm accepting this run as a first run for this game.
