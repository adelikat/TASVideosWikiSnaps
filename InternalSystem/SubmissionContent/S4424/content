	"Very unfitting to do another DKC3 TAS with cheats. Among the features of this TAS are:

[p 
	"Cheats: 
	$LF
	"Gyrocopter: I used this Gyrocopter to begin on Lakeside Limbo, but it would allow me to warp to different worlds 
	$LF
	"Invinciblity: With this code, you can easilly pass through fireballs and other enemies, including Baron K. Roolstien. 
	$LF

[p 
	"Glitches: 
	$LF
	"Warp glitch: When you have the Gyrocopter cheat activated, you can warp through different worlds. I first started on Lakeside Limbo, then I warped to Fire-Ball Frenzy before finally warping to KAOS Kore. 
	$LF
	"Rope dance: When you hang on ropes that are horizantal, pressing up while pressing B multiple times will allow you to do the rope dance.
