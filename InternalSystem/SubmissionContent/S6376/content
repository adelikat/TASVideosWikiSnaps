	"Meteos is a puzzle game released in 2005 that received general praise from video game critics, and was developed by Q Entertainment and published by Bandai and Nintendo, and was designed by Masahiro Sakurai. The game has many different planets, each with different field sizes, gravity and visuals.

	""It was a dark time... The existence of all planets was threatened by one: the evil planet Meteo.
	$LF
	"A stream of phantasmagoric matter flowed endlessly from the planet. This matter -called Meteos- crushed life and stole the sparkle of the universe. World after world fell... But then, by chance, three Meteos of the same type aligned. Fusing together, they ignited, firing the other Meteos in space!
	$LF
	"A defense strategy was formed: the civilizations of each planet launched counterattacks by fusing Meteos in different ways.
	$LF
	"Thus the last, desperate stand versus Meteo began. The Metamo Ark -a warship made of Meteos ore- set off as a bastion of hope, with the fate of the entire universe resting on a lone civilization's valor."

	"This TAS aims to get the True Ending of the Multi route Star Trip, which consists of reaching the top most Meteo node, called True Meteo, and beat it. The difficulty comes from the fact that in Multi, almost all fights will have missions, which you will need to complete in order to go to a higher node. Beating the mission leaves you the choice to go either up or down, while failing the mission (while still winning) forces you to go down.

	"The goal of each battle is to destroy every other planet (yeah we save the world but destroy every planet on our way, I don't get it either) and be the last one standing. The main gameplay is using the touch screen, you can drag meteos up or down, and the goal is to line up 3 (or more) meteos of the same type in order to ignite them. By chaining lines, the launch power become stronger and allows to send more meteos. Annihilation (death) is caused when a column without burned meteos gets too high for too long. As the game progresses, meteos drop faster and mercy time reduces, making large stacks becoming incredibly risky, however for a TAS, it obviously is not.

	"Surprisingly the longest battle in the run. 1 frame was wasted before starting the Star Trip in order to get Geolyte instead of Oleana, the latter being more floaty and slower overall. The mission here is to win under 2:30, which is quite easy to do, even at the highest difficulty (if you can survive). There's actually nothing to note about this fight. We clear the screen twice to defeat both planets really fast. However, I think there is probably a bunch of time to save here. Getting the AI to die can be extremely annoying, since sometimes I send them garbage earlier and they don't die, even if it is only 1 meteo less.

	"This fight was actually incredibly surprising. Firim might be one of the best planets to play, since the launches are fairly strong and the field is small. Managing to not clear the screen, I wait a bit to have more meteos, enough to actually destroy Hotted. However, failing the mission would bring me to Stray Planet, which is a 1v1 against Jeljel. The problem here is that the AI in this game is _a lot_ stronger in 1v1 matches, and I simply couldn't destroy them (or at least fast). I had to beat the mission here, which is to send 100 meteos. With 5 seconds left and 38 meteos to send, I barely had enough time to clear the mission before Hotted gets destroyed, giving me access to the Mechatropoloids.
