	"Also, this is yet another game I enjoyed in my childhood, and I found the secret level myself. Now for years I was reading mklip2001's posts and seeing his signature reminding me about my favorite game. When I found out real time speedrunners compete at this game in "best ending", after seeing 
	[a class=extlink href=http://www.twitch.tv/dxtrslab/c/2043037 rel=nofollow 
		"dxtr's world record
	]a
	", I was inspired to actually pick this project. But to make sure all is good, I wanted to beat the existing "any%" movie, and just reuse the tricks in "best ending" then.

	"At first I only tried to shave lag frames, and was 4 frames ahead at the first boss. This way, up to level 4 I accumulated about 22 frames of improvement just by removing random lag. Then I asked 
	(__wikiLink|user:MESHUGGAH)
	" in, and 
	[a href=/userfiles/game/27 
		"this started
	]a
	". We found out that some places were just not optimized enough, and some new tricks.

	"Boss 5 has an 8-frame rule, he becomes available only every 8th frame. MESHUGGAH saved 3 more frames at levels 1-2, but boss 5 ruined this improvement.
