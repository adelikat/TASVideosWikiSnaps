	"Also, this is yet another game I enjoyed in my childhood, and I found the secret level myself. Now for years I was reading mklip2001's posts and seeing his signature reminding me about my favorite game. When I found out real time speedrunners compete at this game in "best ending", after seeing

		"dxtr's world record
