	"Lada: The ultimate challenge is single-player driving game. The goal is to reach the end of the level (this game only has a single level). In the way, there is lots of traffic, some of it outright malicious. Fortunately, you have installed rocket launcher and machine gun to your car...

	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"The crazy driving is intentional. Its firstly very difficult to drive straight in realtime due to inertia, and secondly just driving straight looks boring, it looks better to drive like drunk and occasionally apply huge steering inputs. When concentrating fire is done, it is done, and no shot is missed (the shots that appear to "miss" actually connect outside the screen, as evidenced by score increase and explosion scrolling in or vehicle taking "less" damage before blowing up).
