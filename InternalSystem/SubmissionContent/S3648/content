	"Kaizo Mario World is one of the most well known hacks ever made. Created by T. Takemoto, this Japanese Super Mario World hack is well known for it's difficulty unique from SMW and SDW. The hack itself sparked the creation of an entire new genre of SMW hacks known as Kaizo hacks.

	"The literal translation of Kaizo Mario World is 自作の改造マリオ（スーパーマリオワールド）を友人にプレイさせる, or, "Making my friend play through my own Mario(Super Mario World) hack”, hence "Kaizo". The hack was originally intended to be played completely savestateless, though TAS runs of it are more popular. A common misconception is that TAS is arbitrary because using tools is the only way to complete this hack. This is proven false by

	"Running speed is picked up by the bullet bills, so we can keep running speed through the beginning. By picking up a bomb omb and bringing it to the end of the level, we can get a mushroom, which is useful in the next level. Time is saved by keeping running speed through the enemies and past the turnblock bridge.

We 6/5 through the dolphin parts and grinder parts, saving a lot of time from having to wait for the dolphins. I thought it would be possible to keep up P-meter at the end with the dolphins, so Amaraticando tried it, and it was possible.

We are able to jump across the top of the level early on by walljumping. The second half is played normally, since jumping across the top in that part is impossible.

	"Bowser's castle is composed of multiple mini rooms with different themes, much like the original SMW except harder. We start by walljumping to get to the grey platform earlier. I did this originally, but Amaraticando improved mine and got a corner boost in this jump. We were able to quickly slide past the thwomps in the next room by ducking. In the third room, we walljump again to get to the dolphins faster, saving some time. In the fourth room, Amaraticando saves a frame over my try by corner boosting. The fifth room has basic saw jumping.

In this hack, Bowser is invisible for the purpose of deterring victims even more. Since we have tools, we have no problem hitting Bowser, and we are able to use the same new innovative Bowser strategy found in the any% to save even more time.
