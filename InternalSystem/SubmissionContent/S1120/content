	"This run corresponds to Baxter's 
	(__wikiLink|1049S|first one)
	". I liked his idea of 2 separate TASes for Rockin'Kats but I've noticed that it's possible to improve two levels and boss battle - there were obvious flaws. But then Baxter proved that even some other levels can be improved, so I've done my best and finally managed to save some frames everywhere.

	"I think I wouldn't make frame-perfect TAS without seeing almost frame-perfect one. Baxter's run gave me tough milestones to compete. Too bad there's no way to move this run under mark of 1 minute. I tried everything I know, even disassembled several parts of code but got nothing... almost nothing, that's it.

	"If the run was just 2 frames faster, FCEU would show 1:03 time, but none of crazy things I tried could help to retrieve these 2 frames. So, after last two weeks I gave up. If it isn't the game's limit of improvement then it is my limit of patience.

	"The game is strange and unpredictable. It has much more factors to think about than average NES platformer have. And take into account this inhuman lag... That's why I won't say it cannot be improved anymore, sure there's little chance, but now to improve 1 frame you must spend insanely great amount of time, and it's not guaranteed that this won't make you lose several frames later (lag can accumulate by little portions). So, I think this kind of situation can be called frame-perfectness.
