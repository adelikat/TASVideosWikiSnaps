Note that in the next room, it is impossible to drop the red shell and start flight (as seen in the SNES any%) because of the way items fall in this version. In the next area, I saved 2 frames with a new strategy to cape spin the fish by the pipe. I also used a new strategy at the end, which saves 5 frames (the reason I had to use this strategy was because hitting the block with a cape spin causes you to loose time, since you have to wait longer to grab the key). Finally, I changed my swimming oscillation from 33/31 to 33/32 at the keyhole to save 1 frame (89) {161}.

	"Rather than flying through the stairs like before, I was able to slide through the stairs instead, saving 14 frames. This glitch is more precise; x position must have a small increase at a gap in the stairs. This means that x speed can be no greater than 47. Unfortunately, I had bad luck with the boo buddies in the next room, and I had to lose 5 frames to avoid them (entering the door later did not change where they spawned). Corner clipping the blocks saves 2 frames. I also turn around while grabbing the p-switch, as seen in the SNES any%, to save 3 frames (103) {327}.
