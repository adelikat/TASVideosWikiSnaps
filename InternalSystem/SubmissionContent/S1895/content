	"Okay, this is my second submission for this game (and certainly not second effort on it) and it's more than 18 seconds faster than previous published TAS and almost 9.8 seconds faster than Soulrivers' one.
	$LF
	"Of course, I used new slide trick, found by Soulrivers, but main improvement came from better tactics in certain places like last Forest level or first Blue Cave level, or all water levels.

	"I worked on every level, but I can't prevent some unexpected lags in this game. For example, in some cases score screen lasts a couple of frames longer. Or screen doesn't move for 1 frame while Buster is jumping. I tried to avoid lags, but still some of them have place in this movie.

	" As you can see at a frame 8979 Gene Splicer turns right and starts to leave and at a frame 8981 Dizzy's eyes appear, what indicates that he'll stop. I found that if Gene begins to run away later than Dizzy stops, Dizzy will turn into whirlwind one more time, so it seems movie shows the best time for beating first boss.
	$LF
	"Also Dizzy stops below the level of the ground - this makes his helmet to explode 2 frames earlier.

	]em
	" Gene takes last hit much later, at right, not left, point of his way, so Plucky Duck comes to his place for dialogue 2 frames earlier (thanks to AnS for this trick). It's because Plucky Duck moves slower when boss has been beaten.

	"And finally some interesting and strange thing that I've found long ago: at last Snow level stand on platform between last moving column and first snowmans and make very high jump (you should use Game Genie
