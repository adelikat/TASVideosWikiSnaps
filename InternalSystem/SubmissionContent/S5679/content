	"Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus is a classic 2D side scrolling platform game released in November 1998 on the PS1 and PC. This movie is 167 frames faster than the previous movie (59fps) due to a new trick found in Zulag 4, and a new trick used in Zulag 10!

	" Auto Turn Delay 
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This glitch works by standing on the edge of the ledge and pressing the down button quickly and run towards a spot where you would like to hoist down. You will need to press either 'left/down' or 'right/down' depending on which direction Abe was facing.

	" Stop Turn and Backwards Jump
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"By timing this glitch perfectly you can make Abe stop and turn. To set it up, Abe needs to be standing near a ledge (pressing up whilst tunring arround) you will be able to make Abe do a backwards jump. Notice that when you press the opposite direction to where Abe is standing at the incorrect frame, Abe will just jump up and stand. But if you time it perfectly, Abe will jump backwards and possibly jump to another screen. This will allow you to jump backwards to areas and skip certain areas. Sligfantry's video can show you how this glitch works: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIo1TJUBGlo

	" Roll into Walk
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This glitch is only done in TASes and that's what makes Abe TASes unique. With just one frame, from a roll, Abe can automatically go into a walk. This is handy for positioning Abe towards a lever or towards a wheel.

[p 
	"On QuikSaving and loading between certain frames, wheel lights can pause themselves temporary leading to a major skip glitch.
