	"This homebrew game is released in 2012 February by Stefan Adolfsson and David Eriksson. More info at 
	(__wikiLink|/Www.driar.se|www.driar.se)
	". It's about collecting all stars on 38 different levels. You can jump (A) and be faster (B). That's all.

	"The difference is a random crash bugfix and much shorter lag frames. This TAS would sync the same way if you would insert empty frames for the lag frames.

	"There's also a little bit odd thing... this TAS syncs in Bizhawk up to the start of the 18th level where an extra lag frame occurs, 8467th frame. Generally there's always 2 lag frames before a level starts except for this case at Bizhawk 1.4.0.
	$LF

[p 
	"To make this TAS sync in Bizhawk 1.4.0, you need to add an extra lag frame after showing the level number of 18 and 22.
