	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This run is the product of almost 3 years of on & off progress. It was started on August 28, 2011 and finished on July 3, 2014. I actually took two "temporary" hiatuses from not only this run, but from TAS'ing Super Mario World in general. My first official halt in progress started during the middle of Crystal Caverns 5, where I didn't return to the run until the summer of 2013. I only ended up TAS'ing until Sky World 4 before going into another hiatus. This one was shorter because after realizing that I had gotten so far into the run, I cannot let it go to waste, so I picked the run back up roughly 4 weeks ago. I painstakingly dedicated my time just to finish the run because I wanted to see the finished product, and I'm assuming that the viewers do too!

		"NOTE:
	]b
	" During my hiatus, TASVideos changed the official SNES Emulator to LSNES. The run was started in 2011, which was almost 2 years before TASVideos changed to LSNES, and I had already gotten nearly halfway through the run, which is why I finished this on SNES9X. I will be using LSNES from now on for all my movies that are going to be published on TASVideos.

	" Chuck-Eat Glitch
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This glitch is a (relatively) new trick whereby eating a chuck results in a weird sprite in reserve depending on certain circumstances. The most useful of these is a goal sphere. For an explanation please see the 
	[a href=/3407S 
		"Super Mario World any% comments
	]a
	". The reason I didn't use the glitch in this run is to keep consistency with the 
	[a href=/3849S 
		"96-exit run
	]a
	".
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Cloud-Bowser Glitch
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This glitch is was discovered a long time ago by ISM. It was observed that taking a cloud to the Bowser fight allows Mario to skip phases of the fight which would normally be unable to be skipped. This works because the cloud uses the same RAM address as Bowser. There has been ongoing controversy about the use of this run to obsolete the Super Mario World any% run as a variant of the Chuck-Eat Glitch is used to obtain the cloud, but can also used to trigger the ending credits, as seen in the current glitched run. The reason why I decided on using the cloud during the Bowser fight is because the cloud can be obtained legally in Super Demo World without using exploits or glitches. It also gives variation to all the traditional Super Mario World runs. However, it is very difficult to provide entertainment due to how the cloud is used to save time.

	" Possible Improvements:

[ul 
	[li 
		" Recently, a variant of the stun glitch allows a Reznor to be spawned, which could allow some levels to be completed much earlier. More information can be seen

		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" This game is unique compared to the original Super Mario World because it allows the player to store unconventional items in the reserve box. Planning out a different route than the one I used might allow different strategies to be employed. It is very difficult to plan out an over world path to follow because Mario cannot get out of the Star World until he beats the secret exit of a level. And once he beats the secret exit, the level becomes unplayable. Perhaps there is a better over world path than the one I used, which would allow further exploitation of this ability to store unconventional items.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Big Boo's Tower is easily one of the longest levels in the game. It might be possible to skip right to the boss via the spring-Yoshi glitch to get through floors. I was never successful in doing this trick, but that doesn't mean it wouldn't be viable in the future.
