	"It's been a long and arduous road, but we've finally gotten Umihara Kawase below 2 minutes. I think it's safe to say we've pushed the game to its limits. Here's a breakdown of the frame difference between my movie and Bob's after each level.

	"Keep in mind that this is one of those games which is 
	$LF
	"picky about desyncs. The first time you play the movie 
	$LF
	"it will probably desync. This is normal: just run the 
	$LF
	"movie a second time.

	$LF
	"2 and 8), but they're there. This movie meets the same 
	$LF
	"criteria as the runs in the past. Enjoy.

	$LF
