	"I had the idea of doing a TAS of this game since I started to speedrun it. I got the WR so i wondered what could be improved with it. This is also a not very known game, so it might be a nice contribution to the community.

	"This is a pretty straightforward game, the objective of each stage is to collect all hostages before you run out of time, then fight the stage boss.

	"I speedrun this game too, the strategy overall its all about doing routes and perfect cornering.

	"On this stage I have used a death strat, abusing the invencibility after the death respawn, the character can move through the holes on the ground. It saves a bunch of seconds. It takes a while to kill the boss on this stage, i've tried many times to frame-perfect kill him on the first cicle, but it's only possible to take the last hit on the beginning of the second cicle.

	"The boss on this stage is pretty difficult in a casual play and it was kinda hard on making the TAS strat too. I had to follow his movements frame by frame to make sure I won't miss a hit, also it's hitbox is difficult to reach, since you need to hit it right on the absolute middle.

	"This boss was a pain. He has few invicibility frames, but managing to dodge his projectiles while not missing damage frames was a lot of work. He takes 71 hits to die. This took a while.
