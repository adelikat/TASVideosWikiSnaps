	": In the thread some questioned if not improving existing records was permissable. In my opinion it is not, though case-by-case exceptions may be made (eg. the human record is questionable as it was in 
	(__wikiLink|1192S|Sonic Advance 3)
	"). This run does not beat all existing records and so if this run were to be published we would be providing content that is inferior to unassisted speedruns. This is contrary to the unique appeal of this website and should not be endorsed. Master of Pigs, if you choose to redo (and I think that you should) you should post WIPs in the forum thread so that your work can be peer reviewed. That way viewers can confirm that your work is of the highest quality and can point out ways in which it can be improved. Rejecting for not beating all existing records.
