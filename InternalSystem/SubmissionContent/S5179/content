	"As the beginning of the game and the easiest one stage, the all we need just run for our life and the fastest record. The stage has two fights can’t escape, one is samurai, and the other is ninja. In the stage we cannot get smoke bomb, so we should fight in normal way. Iaido cut play an important role because it can kick the entire enemy and have a high damage. In some place, we can go to the next area without defeat the enemy, use dash + attack+ dash can move in a quick speed. Because in the beginning of dash, we can have a fastest speed, then when the speed down, attack can cancel the part of the slow side.

	"Act 2
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Do not save after Act 1. We just need visit it as a bookmark to make sure in the future we can go back to use item. Then after a screen we can buy the charge mixture of 白菜鍋 , which can increase your ATK in 1min, mainly use for the boss which haven’t HP bar. On my way to boss, I fight three times with flying eyes for the level and souls. Because of that, I can equip a new blade with higher ATK. I also get a smoke bomb on the way, so that I can escape the ninja in the boss stage.

[p 
	"Back to the save point by using bronze mirror, walk aside we can find a hamal. We can use it to to skip some area and save much time. Because of the effect of the rest of 白菜鍋, we can kill some enemy in one Iaido cut. In this act, I set the bookmark in 尾張. This is an important place because it’s the most efficient way to move until act 5. When we arrive at the 美濃, we can buy many smoke bomb X9, 般若湯X7, and bronze mirror X4. On the way, we can eat 般若湯 to earn vitality. In the next screen’s branch, we can get the 天狗の面, which is an important stuff to help me equip the upper blade. In the boss stage we must fight with a couple of enemy, use smoke bomb to escape.
	$LF
	"Boss: we have enough level and 天狗の面 to equip a good blade, and use inherit ATK bug. At the beginning, boss will run away. We need use blade, catch behind her. When she is daze, change the long blade use the best combo to hit her. However, rebound boss’ arrow can give boss a considerable damage. Using time: 1min 14sec.

	"Boss: For change blade we don’t need enough level and souls. So we should fight with old one. Boss is very quick so we need use blade. This fight is a little special. We need reduce the orange bar by 10% 20% 10% 30% 30%, on the red HP bar, it will stepped on the banana skin and fall down, there are also many bombs can be rebounded to give she a huge damage.

There is also one place that if you don’t fight for long time so you can’t avoid. In the boss stage we can use the pass through bug. By this bug, Kisuke just can save a little time, but Monohime can save about 1min. We can also find 空蝉の籠手(strength +4).

When you enter that area, jump like the Mario, cancel the draw action when you crouch. It can save the draw time, but must keep jumping all the area. I don’t need set the save point because when I defeat the boss will send to the save point. On the stage we can find 修羅の面（strength+3 vitality+3）, but It need waste a long time and have no help for me so I don’t get it. In this stage, encounter enemy rate is high, so we need many smoke bomb.

	"According to the story, I back to the save point automatic, it’s also the best beginning, and for that we save one bronze mirror. Because of I almost use up all the smoke bombs in Act 6, so I spend all money to buy smoke bomb, other stuffs are useless. More and more approach to the end, the encounter enemy rate higher. For solve that, we must buy more smoke bomb. On the way, we can activate the last save point. So, go for the boss fight.
	$LF
	"Boss: because of the lack of the souls and level, we can’t get new blade. This boss is so stupid that you jump over his eyes, he will stand here and just waiting to die. Otherwise, stand in the certain place will not be attacked; it’s easy to manipulate decrement also. But if you want fight in a normal way, you will feel really suffer. It takes 1min14sec.

	$LF
	"Boss: before the boss I just left the last smoke bomb, don’t forget eat 般若湯 to add vitality. Then, we can get the final blade. Because the last blade and天狗の面, we can equip the blade without any ornament. But for a higher ATK, I also need equip空蝉の籠手.

	"Boss has two forms. The first one is easy because will get hit stun when he is beaten. When I fight the second form should depend on secret art of blade to let the boss stun in his final red HP bar. Then kill him as fast as you wish. It totally takes 2min31sec.
