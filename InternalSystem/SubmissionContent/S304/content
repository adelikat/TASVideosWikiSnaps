	$LF
	"ActRaiser 1 movie, but the simulation levels required more 
	$LF
	"timing and randomness than I was willing to put effort in 
	$LF
	"to.  This is played on the hardest mode* and aims for the 
	$LF
	"fastest time.  Hits are taken to save time occasionally.
	$LF
	"I apologize for how long the movie is, but there are way
	$LF
	"too many levels + there are mandatory periods upon entering
	$LF
	"and exiting levels that chew up lots of time.

	"The only two areas I am unhappy with and can not seem to 
	$LF
	"fix are level 4-2 (underground river) and the final miniboss 
	$LF
	"fight in the tower (the shielded lion-goat demon).  
	$LF
	"Otherwise, any parts where I take time to kill something, 
	$LF
	"stand still, or take a hit, it has been weighed time wise to 
	$LF
	"see if other options would be faster.  The last fight with 
	$LF
	"Tanzra had originally been over 2 minutes, so I decided to 
	$LF
	"employ a few strategies until I cut it to below a minute.
