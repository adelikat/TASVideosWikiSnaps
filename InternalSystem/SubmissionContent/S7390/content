	"I see glowing reviews, inclusions on "Best of All Time" lists, maybe something about that shopkeeper from Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars (1996), and I have to admit that I feel this is more than a bit overhyped.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Perhaps I'm a cynic, I'll admit that, but I'd also like to think that cynicism helps me stay consistent with my reviews. In a world where so-called "hype trains" are growing increasingly common and basic discourse is sadly diminishing, I believe this kind of cynicism is needed, and thus I will continue to let it inform me, despite the objections of literally everyone I have ever spoken to in my life. Personally, I don't need to be in any circle of film reviewers. I can find much more fun things to do in a circle as a group. Duck Duck Goose, for example.

[div class=p 
	"It is hard for me to speak of this film in a spoiler free way, as at a grand total of four minutes, 14 seconds, and 51 milliseconds, every possible event I could describe would be a spoiler. I can say there are twists. I can say there are turns. I can say the ending is shocking, but perhaps not in the intended way. I can applaud the film's creativity amidst a sea of April 1st releases that tend to all feel pretty derivative, but it is in fact that creativity that leaves it lacking in the sort of things that I'm looking for as a reviewer. It lacks a destination, shall we say. A clear goal, shall we say again. It doesn't have an ending, shall we say a third time. Also, uh, just kidding about that spoiler free part.

[div class=p 
	"I mean, it ENDS, definitely, in that the film reaches a point where it just Does Not anymore, but calling that a proper ending would be like calling me a proper film critic, and calling me a proper film critic would mean I would have been accepted into Circle of Criticizing Kino instead of being rejected, so in solidarity, I feel as though I have to reject this film in turn. From what? I'm not sure. Perhaps I am rejecting it from my mind. Perhaps this is just one long and unfunny metaphor, like nearly everything else I write. Perhaps the Circle should consider maybe changing their name for reasons I don't think I'm at liberty to discuss.
