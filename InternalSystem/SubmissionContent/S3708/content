	"Putty Moon, the place where all the putties live, has been taken over by an evil wizard named Dazzledaze. Putty has been banished from the moon to the planet below. To return to Putty Moon and oust the evil wizard, Putty enlists the help of some robots ("bots") to build a skyscraper that will reach up to Putty Moon.

[p 
	"Putty must rescue a certain number of bots in each stage to advance to the next one, it's not necessary to kill the bosses and it's better to avoid them as they add extra time on the tally screen. When your character has absorbed a robot, there is an icon of a blue robot in the upper-left corner, the numbers that say "In" and "Out" tell you how many robots you have brought to the ship and the stage finishes when "Out" is zero.

	"One of the objectives in this game, besides get rid of Dazzledaze, is making a high score. But, unless it's Tetris Attack, high scores are not very appealing, so I decided to play all stages.

	"The Gym is back after some wips starting from Putty Moon. I did a test starting from Technofear, and guess what? Yes, you can skip three stages and still beat the game like normal, talk about weird.
