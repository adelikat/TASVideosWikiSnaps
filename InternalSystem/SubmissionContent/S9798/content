	"Rayman is a 2000 Game Boy Color game in the Rayman franchise. The game is a 2D platformer similar to the original Rayman from 1995 although this game is its own thing. It's a good game with strong visuals and enjoyable gameplay once you get past the game's really... questionable renditions of Rayman 2 music. It's a game I have fond memories playing on my 3DS in my youth.

	"). This is a TAS I remember watching before I even played the game itself so it is a bit nostalgic for me but the thing is that while that TAS was impressive for a TAS originally made in 2005, it became very outdated and it has been for a really long time. Not only were new exploits found only a few years after the TAS was published but we are now even at a point where the RTA run has surpassed the old TAS. For years and years, I had hoped that this game would receive a new TAS but now that I have some TASing experience, I thought I'd take the task to TAS this game again and all I can say is wow... I was not expecting to save this much time...

	[a href=https://tasvideos.org/2429M rel=noopener external nofollow 
		"https://tasvideos.org/2429M
	]a
	"). If you cancel a glide and then immediately press jump, you will jump in mid-air which is normally not possible. This exploit is a bit weird as you have to set up the double jump, you can't just use it whenever. The main way to gain the ability to double jump is to jump while running off an edge. Double jumps are useful for both optimisation and skips, minor and major.

If you let go of A the frame after it registers the jump, you can do a higher/floatier jump (you can tap A for one frame or hold it and then let go on the right frame to get a floaty jump). This is not only useful for optimisation but buffered jumps are useful for the next exploit.

	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"This might be the most wild exploit and it was discovered by RTA runners. If you land on a moving platform on the last possible frame and then immediately run off the platform, you retain the momentum of the moving platform, even though you are not on the platform. This means that you can move faster horizontally or have significantly altered gravity vertically, depending on which direction the platform is moving. That sounds fun and all but where this gets really broken is when you grab a ledge, you keep the momentum and Rayman will move in the air in his ledge grab animation (known as a hang glide). When Rayman is in his ledge grab animation, he does not have a collision box so he can just pass through walls and floors (although he still has a hurtbox and getting hit cancels the glitch). This can naturally be used to perform some big skips in some levels. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"There are some intricacies of this exploit. It only works on what are referred to internally as "Trigger" platforms. These are basically platforms that stay still when you find them but they move when you land on them (so you can't do this exploit on constantly moving platforms). The direction you move depends on the direction the platform initially moves although there is more to it. If the platform is close enough to the camera and it changes direction, Rayman's momentum will change with the platform (so if he has upwards momentum and the platform switches to moving down, Rayman will gain downwards momentum). If the platform is far enough off camera, one of two things will happen: either the platform will keep moving but Rayman will keep the momentum from the platform initial direction or the platform will despawn and reset its position which resets Rayman's momentum. Whichever platforms do what depends on the exact platform and while the former are more powerful, the latter can still be exploited in certain areas. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The glitch can be cancelled in various ways, mainly by jumping or getting hit. While the former sounds detrimental, we can work around it. If you perform buffered jumps, you will keep the momentum so whenever we need to jump with momentum storage, we use buffered jumps. We can also use quick jumps and glide cancels to intentional get rid of the glitch which we do need to do in some areas as you cannot hit end triggers with upwards momentum storage.

	"And there we have it, Rayman on GBC done in 19 minutes and 16 seconds (18:51 RTA). When removing factors such as emulation differences (added boot screen, more lag due to being a more console accurate emulator), this is almost 9 minutes faster than the old TAS. When I started this, I assumed this would be a sub 25 run but I never in a million years thought it would be a sub 20 run. I am very satisfied with the final time to say the least and it makes my inner child happy to see that this game has a new TAS far beyond what I could have imagined and that I was capable of creating it. I don't think my child self could have ever imagined this happening.

	"I think there is room for more improvement. There might be more time to squeeze out of the auto-scrollers, I don't doubt that more lag reduction can be implemented and better Mr. Dark RNG should be possible but I am satisfied with the run for the time being. Mr. Dark's RNG seed changes whenever you make adjustments to the rest of the run and even the tiniest movement changes alter Mr. Dark's RNG during the fight and those two things are definitely a deterrent for me to improve this run but it is hopefully still a good enough improvement to become the new publication for this game. There are also levels like Ancient Forest 1 and 2 which have potential for huge skips but I wasn't able to find anything. If more big skips could be found, that would naturally be obvious room for improvement but for the time being, I incorporated every strat I could find/was already known.

It's also incredibly nuts how this submission improves on the old one by over 8 minutes, which is quite insane but understandable since that's the culmination of 15 years of new discoveries and refined techniques found by the Rayman RTA and TAS community.
