	"The purpose of this 1991 DOS game is to make bombs run across the board and into the goal. At least one bomb must survive in order to advance to the next level. The game has 30 levels in total; Some levels serve as bonus stages where points and extra bombs can be obtained. Level 13 is the latest stage you can select from the main screen.

It does not spawn if you get it in a bonus stage though (Level 18 and 24). In other words, you want score to go past the 1000-threshold only while in levels 18 and 24.

There are several reasons to consider starting from level 13 the legit technique: it is mentioned in available manuals for this game (although ports for different systems may let you skip to farther levels), mouse clicking is the primary method of playing this game, so clicking a certain clearly visible object can't be a "secret cheat combination", and finally, clicking on those old men looks like the only way to even start the game (at least the only one that's obvious enough to get to work first).
