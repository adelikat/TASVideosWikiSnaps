	"You can see SMB1, The Lost Levels and 3 go towards the right side but 2 goes towards the left side in 2's 1-1's boss fight to grab eggs.
	$LF
	"When SMB, The Lost Levels and 3 are running towards the right side, if the left button is pressed, their running speed will decrease. Pressing left doesn't necessarily force Mario to start moving left, rather it will still have Mario running towards the right, but slower with the left button being pressed.

	"When SMB2 has a character running quickly towards the right side, I sometimes have to press the left button so that SMB1, The Lost Levels, and 3 will go toward the left side.
