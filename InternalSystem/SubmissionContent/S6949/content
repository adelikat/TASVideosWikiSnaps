[div class=p 
	"2-4：In the third part, the opening time of core has four frame rule. Due to the good global timer, the number of pauses is reduced in the first part, and a four frame rule is obtained in the second part. At this time, Batman can no longer avoid the bullets in the third part and takes damage.(gains 13 frames)

	"3-4:I added the same skill as the last movie in this boss battle. Batman moves one frame in the opposite direction while punching in the air, so he can move behind the boss in the air ahead of time. (get 2 frames)

	"4-3:Two frames have been improved at the climbing wall of the acceleration belt. I stayed for two frames under the second flame car on the upper right because the movement path and transmission frequency of the flame car are affected by the global timer. If I don't stay for two frames, when I meet the flame car, it will increase a flame attack, which will cause me to increase the number of pauses, which will waste three frames. In the end, I reduced one lag and got back the lost frames.(gains 3 frames)

[div class=p 
	"4-4:Boss also has 4-frame rule. I used 3-4 skill in Batman's second jump to increase the number of air attacks. Using pause in boss 4 frame rule can make boss stop moving ahead of time and get closer to Batman to kill him(get 8 frames)

	"5-1:Batman killed two cars when he jumped on the second floor, reduced the number of jumps to get 2 frames, used new skills at the end of the second floor to make Batman jump higher to get 1 frame, and other improvements came from the climbing wall on the upper right(get 8 frames)

	"5-3:If there is no proper glitch, I think this should be the fastest way to kill a clown. Clown has a glitch that can trigger the ending quickly. If you use this glitch in TAS, it will increase the input time of the movie. It is very practical in RTA competition, but it can't get help in TAS, because the timing methods of RTA and TAS are different.(get 0 frames)
