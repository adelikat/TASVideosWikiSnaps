	"• Peelout/spindash release speed is controlled by how many times the buttons A, B, or C are pressed and how long the peelout/spindash is held before being released. The first button press sets the held peelout/spindash speed at 8 pixels per frame. Subsequent button presses raise the speed by 1.5 pixels per frame and each frame the peelout/spindash is held lowers the speed by 1/32 of the held speed value. The range for peelout/spindash speed is bounded to a minimum 8 pixels per frame and a maximum of 12 pixels per frame and the release speed only occurs in increments of 1/2 pixel per frame. Thus, it takes 5 button presses to release a maximum speed peelout/spindash.

	": This was, admittedly, a bit tricky to judge due to the code usage to unlock Team Hyper and the lack of current information on the hack. Even the project page, which I can't link because it distributes the pre-patched ROM, doesn't have up-to-date information: For example, it still lists Team Hyper as a future team addition, despite quite clearly being in the hack. As far as I can tell, the code is the only way to play as them, which is where things get a bit dicey for this submission.

	"We don't quite allow branches for every playable character/combination of characters/team in a game, yet. There's a good chance this will change in the future, but right now we don't have the staff resources to be able to manage that. Sonic games have generally been an exception to this, since the TASes are almost always very well-received, but with this being a ROM hack using a code-only team, feedback has been fairly limited for a branch that needs the feedback. That being said, I like this run! Where a lot of Sonic TASes just end up being how fast the TASer can set up a screenwrap to the end, the fact that it isn't possible in this hack makes seeing how levels are solved much more interesting to me. Everything's still fast, the different characters still make levels unique, and the hyper states still allow for over-the-top solutions at times, even literally at times (see Marble Zone). Audience feedback is naturally going to be lower for a ROM hack, especially one that's had quite a few submissions and publications as of late, so I don't mind making a judgement call here and saying it surpasses the entertainment quality bar.
