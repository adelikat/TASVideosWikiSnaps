	"Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon released by Konami for the Nintendo 64 in 1998 in North America.
	$LF
	"The story follows Goemon's struggles to prevent the Peach Mountain Shoguns from turning Japan into a fine arts theater. The plot calls for three cinematic musical features and battles between giant robots, like other Goemon games, it's peppered with surrealist humor and anachronisms.

	" is very long, in the run I basically followed the original walkthrough. But in the process I used somes tricks which are saved some time.
	$LF

[h3 
	"Tricks:
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"I used a glitch to enter oedo castle, it saved a little time. However I don't know specifically how it works.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Jumping climb, this is a very useful trick, it makes the hero jump on some cliffy slopes as shortcut. The greatest time savers are that I used it to skip the first impact battle and level 2 weapon.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"For some high platforms, attack while jumping will makes it much quicker for the hero to get onto the platforms. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Use Goemon's gold coin and Sasuke's cold kunai while jumping could makes they jump farther.

[h3 
	"Questions you may ask:
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Why did you collect so many ryoes in oedo castle?
	$LF
	"-Because I must buy something which is very expensive.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Is it possible to skip Sasuke's cold kunai in festival temple castle?
	$LF
	"-No, some platforms will not appear if you don't get cold kunai.

[h3 
	"Possible improvments:
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Some movements are not precise enough especially beginning part, Mitjitsu also noticed this. Honestly I found the longer jump trick when I've done half of the run, so it means I miss use it in the previous part... 10 seconds may be lost, no idea.
