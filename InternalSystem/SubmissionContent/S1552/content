	"Although my old submission just got accepted, I finished a new version in time before it got published. Overall, not much has changed compared to last time (http://tasvideos.org/1480S.html ), but some new techniques and optimizations amounted to an improvement of 7863 frames (roughly over 2 mins).

	"The major changes are:
	$LF

[ul 
	[li 
		" Using the "Spider Throw". This allows for very fast horizontal movement while traveling left. The Spiderball is required to do this, but it can be used much more effectively in combination with the Springball, which leads to:

	[li 
		" Getting the Springball early. I damage-boost up to where the Springball is before getting the High Jump Boots and stuff.

	"Minor improvents:
	$LF

[ul 
	[li 
		" Using the mid-air unmorph jump more. This mainly speeds up climbing vertical shafts.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Better use of the morphball when falling. For it has a smaller hitbox than unmorphed Samus falling times can be reduced in some occasions.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Avoiding Metroid Explosions. When exiting a room on the right frame, the Metroid Explosion animation can be skipped. There are some Metroids though where this manipulation is too expensive, and others where I could not get it to work for unknown reasons.

		" Improved Metroid battles.
