	"Despite appearing fairly simple, the game actually requires quite a lot of planning and luck manipulation. For platforming levels, any time you swing your hammer you slow down slightly, so the best movement most of the time is to simply avoid enemies. However some screens require killing all the on screen enemies to advance. In there sections, there is a helpful glitch you might notice where if you turn around just before hitting an enemy, they will recoil in the direction you are facing instead of away from you. The player can get two upgrades, one to improve your hammer and the other a helmet which acts as a free hit. Acquiring the hammer upgrade costs several seconds of animation, so it is not always optimal to pick it up if you are not going to need the extra damage. In the flying levels there are no upgrades and the enemy patterns are fixed, but enemy hit boxes don't spawn immediately and there is a cool down between shots.
