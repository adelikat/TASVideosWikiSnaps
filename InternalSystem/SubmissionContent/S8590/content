	"Super Contra is a run and gun video game by Konami originally released as a coin-operated arcade game in 1988. It was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System under the shortened title of Super C in North America and in Europe and Australia as Probotector II: Return of the Evil Forces. It is the sequel to the original Contra and part of the Contra series. The game stars Bill Rizer and Lance Bean, as they are sent to thwart another alien invasion. Both the arcade version and the NES version have been re-released on various other platforms since their original releases.

	"For this TAS I had to complete the game in the shortest time possible, but with one condition, not using any Power-Up, a very complicated challenge, only for one player, without receiving damage or any improvement.

	": While a "No-Powerups" branch would normally be an acceptable goal for Alternative class publication (assuming it garnered enough entertainment votes), this run has two problems.  The first issue is the lack of response of the run.  Only a few votes have been cast (though mostly for the good) regarding entertainment, suggesting minimal interest/engagement of this run;  this is admittedly a minor issue, and the current voting souldn't be the sole reason to prevent acceptance to alternative class, in my opinion.

	$LF
	"The secondary and more weighty issue is optimization, which was even noted in the forum discussion.  Even for Alternative class publications, we want to see high levels of optimization in the gameplay.  While we won't immediately reject a run due to suboptimal play that isn't obvious, this submission shows unnecessary slowdowns in a few places that are fairly easy to observe; some examples include but aren't limited to:

	"CyanTheGamerhog01, I know you're relatively new to submitting to the site; and I understand how having a run you've created being rejected can be discouraging.  So let me offer a suggestion that will help you improve your skills for the future:  when TASing a game that already has runs published on the site, watch those runs and try to implement strategies used in those publications in order to plan/improve your own TAS.  Depending on goal differences, some strategies may not be viable, but often optimization strategies will be able to carry over from one goal to others.

[div class=p 
	"TASing is a skill that develops with experience, so keep trying!  Feel free to rework the optimization on this game/branch combination and re-submit in the future, as I think it's a branch/goal that has potential to be worth publishing.
