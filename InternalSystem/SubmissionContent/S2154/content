	"This is an improvement of 464 frames or 7.7 seconds over zggzdydp's Julius version run of the game. I started this run a few days ago, after rewatching the published movie and noticed a room I thought could be improved by a different strategy. In this case it couldn't, but while trying out different stuff I noted that zggzdydp used a suboptimal way of travel, jumping for 4 frames between each kickdive, instead of 2 (which after testing turned out to be the optimal amount). This in combination with some new room strategies contributed to the biggest part of the improvement. The rest is from the boss battles.

[div class=p 
	"~1100 - Yes it was faster by one frame to slide here, it doesn't look like it, but it was.

[div class=p 
	"~2050 - Delayed the kickdive by a few frames to not enter the "crouching down after a big fall" animation.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"~2200 - I could have jumped farther here to clear the ledge with the uppercut jump, but hitting your head against the room let you regain control faster, so it was faster not to clear the ledge.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"~3300 - Delayed the uppercut jump a little so that I could do a kickdive first, this makes you keep a much higher speed during the uppercut jump.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"~3420 - Yes, it was faster to take damage here than to backdash past the enemy, you can't jump over it and it takes to long to kill.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"~5600 - Delayed the last hit on the headhunters second form by a few frames. This made the next head connect faster. It couldn't be done on the first form because she always backed when being hit, and jumping over to the other side halfway in would be slower.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"~6700 - It might look like it would be faster to manipulate the headhunter to die closer to the door, but I do pass through the door on the first frame I'm allowed to anyway.

[div class=p 
	"~8150 - Faster to take damage than to backdash past this enemy too.

[div class=p 
	"~9000 - I tried to go up through the outside, as I just had to repeatedly use the uppercut jump there, but it was slower.

[div class=p 
	"Graham first form - I was able to cut away one teleportaton by manipulating the last two patterns into longer ones, allowing me to hit him an additional time. This could have been used to cut away another teleportation too, but it would have been slower due to having to use the slower pattern every time.
