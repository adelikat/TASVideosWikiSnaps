However, the level is already loaded by the time the countdown ends, making the method used in this run the fastest: Jump, then hold <> when speed goes to 25.

	""Good" boo blocks are turned back into "bad" boo blocks on a timer. If the boo blocks happen to be "bad", nothing happens. This means we have to wait at a point, and allow ourselves for a walljump and some fancy jumping. A few frames saved thanks to optimising hitting the boo block changer at the end of the level.
