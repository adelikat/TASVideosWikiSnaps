	"Rhythm Tengoku is the Japan-exclusive first entry to the Rhythm Heaven Series. It is a collection of rhythm minigames released for the Game Boy Advance, developed and published by Nintendo. At the end of every minigame, you will be graded with one of the three ratings called Superb, OK, and Try Again. Earning an OK rating or higher will allow you to advance to the next minigame.

[div class=p 
	"A minigame can contain up to four criteria. Each criteria keeps track of how many inputs are available in a minigame, how many inputs the player can successfully hit, and how many inputs the player has missed. A criteria is assigned a # of inputs required to hit and a # of inputs the player is allowed to miss. The player must satisfy every requirement for every criteria in order to achieve an OK rating or higher.

	": This is a strange (as things are in Japan) game, where the player needs to press buttons at the right moment to clear stages. The performance is evaluated at the end of each stage, where a minimum set of timely presses need to have been performed to pass it. This movie passes all stages (minigames) with the minimal amount of presses.

[div class=p 
	"As per category choice, I would argue passing all minigames can be considered game completion, as far as I could understand with the game bein in Japanese, there is nothing else to do beyond that. However, the choice of 'minimum presses' is a strange, albeit acceptable one. For this choice, the game can only be classified as Alternative or Playground, with entertainment being the decisive factor.

	" perhaps performing poorly leads to a faster completion. However, any% is a bad category for a game that is, essentially, an autoscroller. There is no apparent evidence that doing better or worse leads to faster times. And even if that was the case, doing worse for the sake of time would result in a terrible movie. It is therefore hard to evaluate the entertainment factor here. The fact that this is an autoscroller can quickly make the movie monotonous no matter what the inputs are. This could be forgiven for a 100% 'perfect score' movie, as
