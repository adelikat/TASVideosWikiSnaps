	"I started this TAS not realizing how many autoscroll levels are in this game. I came up with a few tricks to shave time off of the already posted previous run. More time could probably be saved on the bumper cars, but I'm pretty satisfied with everything else.

	"Not much to say about this one. Shaved a few seconds off with some creative jumping. Walking off the edge of the platform will let you jump in mid-air. I should note that the roller coaster keeps you leashed to a certain area around the platform. Also, the third platform that you switch to doesn't exist until the second platform reaches a certain part of the track.

	"This level is the reason for most of my rerecords. Horrible controls. Horrible hitboxes. Horribly frustrating.

	"Most of my improvement over the old run came from this level. It's difficult, but possible to skip a sizable section by jumping over the water to a lower log, but it has to be frame perfect.
