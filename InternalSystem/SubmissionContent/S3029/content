	": For this game, forgoing the particular glitch to go out-of-bounds could demonstrate a slightly more "causual" route to the viewers, while it could be of some interest, does not help with the main aim of TASing - to demonstrate super-human gameplay. Meanwhile, the big plus as a side-effect of such a goal choice - showing more eye-pleasing Whip-Launching Techniques, is easily achivable by a "all bosses" or "100%" categorized movie using the same game character, and

	". Therefore, this published entry is considered unnecessary at the present time. However, future submissions that would feature both "all bosses" and "in bounds" could stand a chance of being accepted as a new entry, as the "all bosses" concept is of an interest here and shares common points with "in bounds" as both mean to take inessential side tasks set by the author.
