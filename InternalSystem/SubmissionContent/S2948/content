I couldn't believe how many frames there were to save - some came from correcting mistakes, some from refinement and some from new techniques. I expected this to be a something like a 3-7 sec improvement when I restarted... but I kept finding improvements, and this is the result.

	"The biggest weakness of this otherwise decently programmed game is the "save" screen - I mean the screen which complains that you don't have enough diamonds to save. Guess the gametesters only played this game with a lot of diamonds because this menu screen works outrageously. It allows you to avoid death floor (water or lava), pass through walls, skip item pick-up messages (saving time) and cause other slightly strange things which are probably not seen in this run because almost everything is skipped.
