	" Neither the PC-8801 nor the Sharp X1 had hardware scrolling, and adaptive tile refresh for PC platforming games wouldn't be introduced until 1990 with 
	[em 
		"Commander Keen
	]em
	", so this game plays as a series of single screens. That's bad enough, but Hudsonsoft also screwed up the movement physics, BADLY, and the game speed is also pretty awful. The Sharp X1 version is an improvement over the PC-8801 version with superior graphics, a scrolling screen transition instead of just blanking between screens, and better sound, but it runs even worse than the PC-8801 version speedwise, going about half as fast as a Mario 1 game should just at base, and lagging badly when sprites are onscreen. One additional benefit of the X1 is that X1 emulation is superior to PC-8801 emulation on MAME, "Good" vs. "Working" respectively. The only two RTA speedruns of this game to exist run the Sharp X1 emulator overclocked to 8MHz, twice its stock speed of 4MHz, but this isn't legal for our purposes and just risks eaten frames besides. Nearly every input frame in this movie is a lag frame, with input and a new render frame occurring an average of once every 6 frames, which is god-awful.

	" Jumping and crouching are both very laggy actions in this game, and pipes are very finnicky, so getting into one "perfectly" is just about impossible without losing the time you would save by needing to slow down in advance of the pipe. There is no flagpole glitch to cancel the flag animation because that's just how the flag works normally in this port, and hitting the bottom of the flagpole is faster than hitting the top, so just hit the bottom and make sure you don't get 3 or 6 fireworks. I have no idea if framerules exist; they

	]em
	" in the romhack TAS, the fire flower is more important than just skipping the bridge animation, and I would be getting it even if this game had functional warps; enemies get in your way in many ways that are impossible to deal with otherwise, but most relevantly, piranha plants hate you and will block you whenever you want to jump over or enter a pipe, and unlike NES SMB1, you can't do a precise jump against the front edge of a pipe to get over them, their hitboxes are too big. Also, the way I get the mushroom here 
	[em 
		"looks
	]em
	" sloppy, but that is actually no-joke frame perfect. Momentum is just too stiff in this game, seriously, and you can't sort of clip through the edge of a ?-block like you can in normal SMB to give a bit of leeway on collecting powerups.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"1-4:
	]b
	" Now that we have the fire flower, it's time to mention that it sucks and we will only be using it if absolutely necessary. Even with frame-perfect timing, letting go of run to throw a fireball kills your momentum way more than in SMB on the NES, and it does this ESPECIALLY in mid-air (ruining many jumps in the process). It was suggested to me that killing enemies with the fireballs could help mitigate the lag, but I decided that it just wasn't worth the speed moderation to actually aim and use, and using the fireball just spawns in another sprite anyways, so the best solution to lag is to just be fast and leave these screens as fast as possible. Also as you can see, fire bars just do not want to cooperate; while SMB Special has a bug where a certain frame of a counter-clockwise firebar can let you move through it unharmed, this is rarely available when you actually want it without taking too much of a slowdown compared to just crouching.

Finally, the wiggling at the end is the only way to fit down the hole (PHRASING!) thanks to the mysterious way that the hammer extends Mario's hitbox, I was not able to make it happen any faster.

The main potential improvements beyond optimized movement are more potential usages of running through firebars and possibly using fireballs to destroy some icicles, although it is not definite that either of these can be used to a super helpful extent beyond which that they already have.
