	"In TURK + JESSE battle, I have to deal with TURK first. TURK has a much higher stats than JESSE, and with his Nitro Port technique, I risk wasting a lot of time catching him if I let him escape. I used the Chains + Grand Slam to pin TURK in the corner, just within the hitbox while avoiding my Skaterz from activating. After that, JESSE is pretty easy to deal with.

	"Next on the list is MOJO. In this case, I encountered the rare Entrees gang type, which usually runs away from me whenever I approach them. However, since the game difficulty is set to Crazy, they don't run away as one would expect them to. So I had no choice but to deal with them as if I'm dealing with a normal gang type. Fighting MOJO is very similar to TURK, in that both of these bosses have similar stats when it comes to Stamina and Willpower.

	"After MOJO, we head on over to the Sauna. But before we run, I used the 4 Zeus' Wands I have bought to boost my Agility, which will allow me to run even faster. I cannot use Zeus' Wand early in the game, as it will mess up the timings of the "standing stunlock" for TURK and MOJO. I would like to boost my stats early on, but with the timings after the stats boosts wouldn't work well with Gravity. Along the way, we encountered RYAN event, where we can politefully decline RYAN to skip the battle.

At this point, with all of the battles thus far accumulated to at least 64 reputation points, I am able to recruit THOR into my posse.

With Acro Circus and Zeus' Wand pairing, I can quickly move around long distances in a shorter period of time. Here, I did not choose to update THOR's "strategy", as THOR has the ability to fly across the area. Thus, it makes no  sense for THOR to stick close to me.

	"I then enter the high school to begin fighting OTIS. This time, OTIS has a much higher willpower, meaning his recovery is faster than IVAN, so I have to set the in-game Gravity to the maximum level (+2). By doing so, the standing stunlocking technique becomes viable to defeat the optional boss OTIS.

	"With that out of the way, I exit the high school to finish triggering the final TITUS event. Here, you need to have a positive reputation and have to maintain enough reputation after meeting TITUS for the first time in Waterfront Mall, at least in the +70 to +80 range. Completing the TITUS event will unlock the ROXY event. Note that the TITUS event and the IVAN & TEX event are mutually exclusive. The IVAN event is also mutually exclusive to IVAN & TEX event, as triggering ABBY condition will guarantee you a positive reputation for IVAN, thus locking out IVAN & TEX condition. I have a hard time triggering the IVAN & TEX event as the only hint about this event is the unreliable "super low reputation" condition, which is pretty vague through further testing. The IVAN & TEX event is a boss battle where you get to fight IVAN and TEX together.

IVAN and THOR were going for the kills on the stunlocked DRAGON TWIN and made it possible for one of them to escape my clutches. The RNGs for IVAN and THOR to decide when to move / attack the enemy cannot be controlled no matter how much I tried manipulating my attacks.

The author has done their best to research what they can to get as many events as possible with the information that he has found and researched. If concrete info is found somewhere, like an official player's guide or a game specific doujin, that details ways to trigger more special events then a TAS that would implement them would obsolete this one.
