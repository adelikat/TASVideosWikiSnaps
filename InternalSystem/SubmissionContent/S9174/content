	"There's two key bugs that save time. First, clipping into platforms at particular heights -- and sometimes with specifically timed jump inputs -- causes Alice to clip up onto a platform she'd ordinarily not be able to reach. Second, Alice can chain jumps together provided the jump input isn't held too long, and provided there's enough of a gap between her vertical position and the top of the screen (i.e., she cannot chain jumps infinitely, like you can in Little Nicky... hmm, same developer...!)

	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/ninespaces

	" was about 70 frames ahead, at some random point. So if there is anything better in 
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/Induviel 
		"Induviel

	", then it would be the execution of individual moves. From my stance, this is not enough to discard this submission as saying, "It doesn't beat all times"...when in fact it does appear to. I would imagine that the two authors, working together, could produce an even higher optimized movie.
