	"This is my second submission. It's a speedrun of Super Mario Bros for NES. The European Version. I renamed it to Super Mario Bros (Euro). If you want to play this movie, download Super Mario Bros (E), rename it to Super Mario Bros (Euro).

	$LF
	"At world 4-2 I used the glitch. It's jumping backwards to object. You see I did it two times.
	$LF
	"At world 8-2 at the end I used the Bullet Bill Glitch. It's easy to do this glitch at USA/Japan Version of this game. 
	$LF
	"At world 8-4 I did a walljump at the second room of the castle.
