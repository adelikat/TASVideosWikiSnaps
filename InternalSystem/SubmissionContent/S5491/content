	": This is a good run, explanations of the decisions and their background helped a lot. This is also a branch that can be considered an any% speed record, which means it could be vaulted if necessary. But the quality of this game is extremely high, its gameplay is varied, despite of mostly being a beat-'em-up. The pace of the run is nice, and even the cutscenes add dramatism, regardless of your knowledge of Japanese. The beginning of the run is still a bit slow and not varied, which some viewers noticed, but later on the game shoots away and showcases all its potential. Accepting to Moons.
