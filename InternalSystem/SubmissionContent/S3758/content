	"Short answer: yes. 
	$LF
	"Long answer: much of this game is downtime. Re-records were spent mainly on locating sprite-pops, and going back to kill them using only 1 or 2 records at a time. Also, I was able to make this almost exclusively on a gamepad, and as such it was actually easier to do boom/basket frame-perfect refueling sequences (and other parts of the game) in real-time; I was able to do them on the 1st time every time because once the boom lines up over the basket (the "X"), it will instantly connect. During landing sequences little re-recording also was needed, as speed/altitude are able to be monitored easily while playing in "slow-motion" (I tried frame advance to keep speed at 288 and altitude at 200, but it is impossible to stay 
	[em 
		"exactly
	]em
	" on these targets), and only had to re-record a few times if I strayed too far from the target numbers. This is of little importance anyways as it does not affect the speed of level-end. Even if I had to redo a whole section, re-records did not add up very high, yet the TAS was still able to be fully optimized.

This new tier is great for the site because it can now become a nearly comprehensive record-keeping site; this is the only reason why I am re-submitting this, even if some people may think this should be officially published.

Also, since it is easy to do frame-perfect refueling sequences (once you know what you're doing), and it still looks just as good as TAS, it was unnecessary to use frame-advance for the whole TAS. However, most of the game was played in either slow-motion or frame-advance.
