	"In Yoshi's Island, the middle ring is a really nice feature in the game. If you activated it, the game gives you the ability to restart from there in case you die before reaching the goal. When activating, it also gives you up to 10 additional stars which can be a big help when playing casually. And as if that isn't enough, it also turns all the sprites on the screen into stars!

First it takes up all the space that could have been used by other sprites (which is the reason all sprites disappear), then it keeps going on until it corrupts important parts of the memory that the game uses for indexing its jumps in the code.

It turned out that going back left through the gate was faster than waiting for another shy guy to come out of the pipe to the right (since the first one turns into a star). It was also important to keep your speed down a bit to avoid making the red shy guy turn into a star, too.
