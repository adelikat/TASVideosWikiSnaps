	"This is a heavily modified hack of Rockman 6 done with completely new weapons, level designs, tiles, boss patterns and music from another games. A collaborative work of Rockman romhackers, this was formerly known as Rockman 6 Skype. This TAS tries to go as fast as possible using all weapons and mainly the Guardian Blade (Knightman's weapon) to save time in ladders and kill strong enemies.

	"This game is really different to the original Rockman 6 starting with a better Slide, in this game you don't have to cancel Slide like in the original game. You can change weapons quickly with Select button, Down+Select to change to the previous weapon, Start+Select to change to Buster, Start+Select+Up to change to Jet Adaptor quickly and Start+Select+Down to Power Suit. At the beginning of the game it's mentioned that the romhack is incomplete, that's because Mr. X1 and Mr. X4 stages are the bosses only, but in compensation for that, Yamato and Wily Stages are a bit longer than the rest.

There wasn't a lot of feedback, but whatever was there was positive, and by looking at gameplay I agree: the game is action-packed, fast-paced, levels have variety. It's probably not complete, but the hack authors have indicated that development has stopped, as explained
