I was wondering if the Japanese version of this game is framed as the enemy being the US, because it seems to me like it wouldn't be very popular in Japan if it were sold over there as the enemy being Japan."

This is because of a strange cheeze I only realized later: The hangars which spawn planes don't absorb the last shot that destroys them, instead, it just flies right on through. I don't consider these misses since they "did" destroy their target, but I made a point of using that extra shot for the rest of the movie.

I decided not to aim for 100% items, not only because I could find no FAQ on where they all were, but because I knew that if I aimed to get them all, I'd miss one or two and someone would call me on it. So, I simply decided to not worry about it: I'd just collect those I happen to find. Pay close attention to the powerups that pause the game- Most of the time I tried to make very surprising freeze-frames when getting these.

Users for the most part thought that it was repetitive and did not have enough variety. Updating Rejection reason from Game Choice to Entertainment.
