	"In this TAS, I take advantage of a technique that I only used a few times in my first submission. In the "Solomon's Mines" level, when I'm making my way to the third switch behind all of those lava pillars, I couldn't just jump with the Moon Ingot active to get to the wall I needed to wall-jump off of. Even though the Moon Ingot is super powerful and gives Larry lower gravity, it still faces challenges when it comes to on-demand height. In order to get enough height to reach the wall, I switched to the Scarab Ingot, jumped, and then immediately equipped the Moon Ingot, giving me more height in my jump. I didn't really think of this at first. If I remember correctly, I think I only did that to avoid hitting the lava pillar. I later remembered this quirk and realized that you could take advantage of this by using it to skip some ledge grabs. I decided to check the TAS again, seeing which ledge grabs I could skip.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Quick note: You don't have to use the Scarab Ingot for this, you just need to unequip the Moon Ingot before you jump. The later you re-equip it, the more height you gain. I'll just call these "Extended Jumps" for lack of a better term, and since I'll be referring to them a lot.

Previously, I said that you could avoid the ledge grab, but the cannonball hits you in mid-air if you try. Turns out, you can actually avoid it! By reflecting the cannonball down at the right time, we can avoid both the ledge and taking damage! I then start my charge on the left side of the platform, so I have to bounce on two enemies instead of one to reach the ramp. After stunning the enemy on the ramp, I actually land on its head and start charging my dash on top of it, since it's faster than jumping over it and waiting to land on the ground instead.

After clearing the vertical section, I jump on the sabre-tooth tiger and skip the next ledge grab, and then extend my jump to skip jumping to the left altogether. I skip the next ledge grab at the CurseWall, and instead of using the Cloud Ingot to scale the steps, I opt for an Extended Jump into a ledge grab. This saves enough time that I can actually defeat the sabre-tooth tiger with my LightBurst instead of having to avoid it.

	"Turns out that Extended Jumps also work when bouncing on reflective pads! I was able to bring the number of bounces in the first section down from 4 to 2! Unfortunately, I have to lose a bit of time when I pick up the Bull Ingot. In past runs, you could just shine your flashlight forward. The enemy would block it, but it would bounce you up slightly, allowing you to go over it spending too much time in the air. That trick doesn't work this time. Shining your flashlight forward stuns the enemy, which doesn't give you the bounce, and pointing it down would give you more airtime. This isn't a big issue though, since you can workaround it with a short-hop.

You can save 9 frames in "Discover the Moon", but the global cycle for the planes in the Kamunrah fight becomes very unfavourable, as there's a patch of fire blocking one of the switches. Really glad that I decided to revisit this again, because now we have 18 levels in less than 18 minutes! Think I'll leave this alone for a bit, but really happy with the end result!
