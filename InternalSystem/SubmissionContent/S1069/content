		"Volcano-4 takes advantage of a new trick. Due to a programming error, squashing a bug will cause the rest of the bugs in the stage to freeze for a few turns. I use this to drop a rock on a bug that otherwise wouldn't have hit it.
		$LF

		"Ocean-2 is the only level in this run that is slower than in the previous run- by 16 frames (1 step). This is due to a luck manipulation error I didn't realize existed- The first batch of diamonds refused to become collectable for 32 frames, whereas previously they became instantly collectable. Nothing I tried seemed to change this. I did, however, manage to improve this level's execution by 16 frames, so as to be behind 16 and not 32 frames.

		"The previous run was recorded from reset instead of power-on. When the run was published, Bisqwit (or one of his scripts) changed the movie to start from power-on, causing the currently published fcm to desynch at Sand-1 due to lag. This new movie correctly starts from power-on.
