	"This submission is for Drakkhen, a criminally underrated RPG for the SNES. The story is convoluted and has a few translation errors, but suffice it to say that bad stuff is happening and it's up to these 4 chosen humans to fix it by collecting 8 gems from the Drakkhen rulers, which only takes a little over 20 minutes.

	"Drakkhen was my first SNES game as a kid, so it holds a special place in my heart. I got the silly idea to TAS it, so here we are. The basic gist of the game is to save humanity by proving your worth to a dragon god or something, by collecting 8 gems from the princes and princesses of the island. Some of them are given to you, others are obtained through boss fights.

	"This TAS skips a lot of unnecessary things in the game, such as leveling up to a decent point, the use of shops, the use of certain magic, etc. During the journey you're given the most powerful weapon in the game for free, so we melee down the bosses instead of using spells. This leads to an interesting time loss/exchange that we'll get into later.

	"There are two main locations in the game; The overworld, and inside castles. The overworld has first person movement until you trigger an encounter, or walk on an area you're not supposed to like water or the flashing doritos. However, you can walk through those sections if you time it correctly. There's about 400 timers in this game so it only checks every couple seconds and not every frame. If you're in one of those zones when the timer loops, you will be forced out of the first person section and into the world to deal with whatever triggered it. Knowing this, we can skip all unnecessary encounters entirely by not being in the wrong place at the wrong time. There are occasionally minor hesitations and "wiggles" that I make in the overworld sometimes; these are for encounter avoidance, water walking, angle tweaking and so on.

[div class=p 
	"One major game mechanic is a day/night cycle. During the night, more dangerous enemies tend to spawn, including flying demons that spawn from sentient constellations if you happen to be looking the wrong way when a timer loops. We avoid these with the aforementioned wiggling and angle changes. There is also a castle later in the game that is only open during the dawn. If you are there at any other point in the cycle (mid day, night, etc.) then you are not allowed to enter. The biggest time save this TAS has over the current RTA leaderboards is that we can get to the dawn castle during the FIRST dawn, which is possible to do RTA but with a convoluted path involving warps (which don't advance the day/night cycle) and getting lucky with encounter avoidance. Day/night doesn't advance when you're in a castle or a menu. Since we can avoid anything we need to, we don't delay the cycle with warps and we get to dawn castle about 7 seconds after it opens. I'll explain important mechanics as I go

	"We start in the Earth region outside the castle of Prince Hordkhen. We send the mage in first. This game gives "exploration" XP for the first character to go through rooms in a castle. By having the mage run to Hordkhen first, he gets enough XP to level to 2 in the only overworld encounter we take. Hordkhen tells us to go east and talk to his sister, which we'll do after a little grind.

With the strength spell (gives a huge melee damage boost for 15 "on screen" seconds (does not tick down during lag, during dialog boxes, etc) and positioning we can kill these things nearly instantly after they spawn. We send in the priest and grind for slightly over 2 minutes to hit level 6 and gain Speed.

	"With speed learned, we book it over to Princess Hordkha in the eastern part of the earth region. When we get there someone tells us that Prince Haagkhen kidnapped Hordkha and we need to go tell Hordkhen. This trip introduces the first Flashing Doritos Skip. That section would spawn a dragon telling us useless story things, but ironically that dorito line is where we end the game. Anyway we go through it with the timer abuse which saves time vs going around. On the return trip we force an encounter of a gold cloak lizardman. They have a chance to drop a Thiefi's Staff which while equipped lets us just walk through all locked doors in the game (there are around 16) without having to have keys or waste time casting unlock (exception is drawbridge castle, Unlock magic is required to open it and we go there twice) and by getting the mage all the explore XP, he will level up by killing the monster. EXP is earned individually and not shared. We blow up the cloak dude and manipulate the Thiefi's Staff to drop by burning 2 frames before confirming the Jade screen since this re-rolls their second item drop.

We talk to Hordkhen and he's pissed about his sister and sends us to rescue her. He "Strengthens" our bodies, allowing us to leave the earth zone and go elsewhere on the island.
