	"Once again, Gargamel kidnapped 10 smurfs for no explanable reason, and once again, Hefty Smurf is going to kick his ass. But this time, he discovered that his enemies can give him a big favor by punching him. This movie improves my previous movie by 2451 frames, mainly by using new strats and better movements.

	"The maximum running speed intended is 560. You can push it at values greater than 1300 by taking advantages of damage boosts in some places. To keep the most speed possible, you have to jump as soon as you touch the ground, making some areas a real puzzle to optimize. In order to save his friends as soon as possible, the Hefty Smurf (also known as Masochistic Smurf) will take damage in almost every level. Stage by stage improvement is detailled below.
