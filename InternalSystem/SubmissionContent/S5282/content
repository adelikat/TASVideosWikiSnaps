	"Once again, Gargamel kidnapped 10 smurfs for no explanable reason, and once again, Hefty Smurf is going to kick his ass. But this time, he discovered that his enemies can give him a big favor by punching him. This movie improves my previous movie by 2451 frames, mainly by using new strats and better movements.

	"The maximum running speed intended is 560. You can push it at values greater than 1300 by taking advantages of damage boosts in some places. To keep the most speed possible, you have to jump as soon as you touch the ground, making some areas a real puzzle to optimize. In order to save his friends as soon as possible, the Hefty Smurf (also known as Masochistic Smurf) will take damage in almost every level. Stage by stage improvement is detailled below.

	"I used to go trough this level using a small damge boost by the first enemy. When the TAS was almost done, Turbofa found a greater damage boost, which openned a frame war to reach the platform at the end of the level without having to wait. This single level required more rerecord than the whole currently published movie

	"It is hard to understand why, but taking damage by the ladybug then hurt its body during the damage boost will give you a big speed boost to the right. I am still unable to jump over the fly at the end of the level

	"This level is actually harder to optimise than what I though : the flowers can sometimes give you more speed if you wait before entering them. Besides that the boss is few frames faster due to a new strat

	"At first you needed a present, then we found a way to use just the helmet, and now it is possible to pass the breakable wall by a simple damage boost. I also use the potion to grab the ropes a bit sooner, and a new start in the final rope section, to get a better boost than in the previous movie
