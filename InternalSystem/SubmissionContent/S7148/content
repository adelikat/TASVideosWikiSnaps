	"Mega Man X6 is a game developed by Capcom for the PS1, typically known for being rushed and poorly designed as it was developed in a year. Many parts are pretty unfair to a casual player where you can't advance certain spots by not having a particular armor or character.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"I have already made TAS of this game in all shapes and forms, but in this occasion I have something different which involves using both X and Zero in two separate screens and control them with the same input, few TASes of this kind really exists and righly so as they are particularly challenging to create.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Aside from the technical difficulties that involves creating a TAS of this kind, it is challenging to control both characters as they have a pretty different playing style. X likes to shoot from a distance and Zero likes to come close and slash with his saber. This means they both have different approaches for platforming and fighting enemies and bosses. X also can use multiple armors but in this case only the Falcon Armor us used.

[div class=p 
	"Something worth explaining is that normally it is not possible to use Zero from the very beginning of the game, you normally would need to unlock him first, this means an alternative was needed for this to truly be a "Two Characters, One Controller" TAS, and that is where the Mega Man X6 Tweaks projects enter.

	"It is a software mainly developed by acediez which allows you to patch the american V1.1 version of the game to do a lot of crazy stuff, one of them being unlock and use Zero from the very beginning by entering a code in the title screen. So two versions of the game were used:

	"The usage of a hack to allow for starting as Zero was a tad controversial in the thread. Some people sort of treated it as a form of cheating, but I disagree. It doesn't really make the game outright easier. In this context it was only done in order to allow this specific challenge at all. In that sense, this is a multiple game run with a hack of the original game as the second game.

	"However, I do not believe the usage of this hack should be at all acceptable outside of this particular challenge. The hackâ€™s one change is allowing for the usage of Zero from the start.

In the context of creating this specific challenge, this hack creates an entertaining experience and I think that should be acceptable.
