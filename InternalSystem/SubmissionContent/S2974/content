	"There is a shield bug that i found while doing the run, a shield come with 3 protect balls around me spining , when i lost 1 ball i can use the copter body to crush into enemy or bombs without harm, but if i hit solid surfaces like trees or floor i die instantly... So, after a while riding around the florest we reach Skullcap, Dr Derange henchman, i take advantage of the shield bug to make massive damage on him using the chopper, but first i have to take out some damage from him or else the shield will vanish and then i die instantly... after that we go to another temple(looks like a neighbordhood)

	"There is another bug/glitch I found while doing the run, you have to keep the right direction pressed for keep the speed, somes henchmen boat come from behind so u can use it to give a speedboost, after I reach the max speed i take a ramp (still holding right) then when we fall we just jump again and keep jumping until the end of the stage... this bugs helps save few frames because if i go the whole stage  on max speed then i should not complete on max speed because after the last ramp the screen stops and brings u to the next one but you have to be with ur boat on the water ... if its flying and the stages ends u should fall off from the screen like if it where an infinity hole... so thats why i take advantage of the bug to make the whole stage on the max speed and without problem from dying... after the boat we reach to Venice Sewers...

	": The general audience reaction is that this game is at best a 'weak yes' and at worst a flat out no. I don't think this has anything to do with the TAS, and simply game choice. This is unfortunate, because the super fast-flying boat was a cool glitch to find. The audience didn't seem to think that this overcame the other issue of autoscroller boredom.
