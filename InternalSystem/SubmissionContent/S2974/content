So, after a while riding around the florest we reach Skullcap, Dr Derange henchman, i take advantage of the shield bug to make massive damage on him using the chopper, but first i have to take out some damage from him or else the shield will vanish and then i die instantly... after that we go to another temple(looks like a neighbordhood)

	": The general audience reaction is that this game is at best a 'weak yes' and at worst a flat out no. I don't think this has anything to do with the TAS, and simply game choice. This is unfortunate, because the super fast-flying boat was a cool glitch to find. The audience didn't seem to think that this overcame the other issue of autoscroller boredom.
