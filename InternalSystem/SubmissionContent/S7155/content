	"For helping to get throught the whole adventure this game has for we gamers, god just hide along the game some 1UP mushrooms that give us more chance of live; concretly a 1UP mushroom in every level 1 of each world, beside 1-2 and 8-2
	$LF
	"Well, this is an extension category where you have to beat the game as fast as posible in any way while taking all the 1UP mushrooms in it before beating it, with the only restriction of not being allowed to level select (there is another subcategory that allows it with help of minus world), and here you have a TAS showing the whole path with precise movement in less than 12 minutes

	"- Reseting > in levels 1-2 and 4-2 you find the famous warp zones to go to diferent worlds; if you are in 2-1 and you have alredy took the 1UP mushroom, is a lot faster doing again 1-1 and 1-2 to get to the warpzone and go to world 3 than beating the whole world 2; this is what this TAS does, after some 1UP mushrooms in some worlds it resets to get again at the start and repeating a few times along the whole game 1-1 and 1-2 as well as 4-1 and 4-2 with the objective of getting multiple times to the wrong warp and going to all the worlds

	"- Dying > when youn reset, from the menu you normaly only can go to world 1 to start again the game, but there is a trick here; if you game over in any world, then when you are back on the menu you can start at the exact same world you game overed at mantaining A while so press start to enter the level, and this propety mantains after reseting; game overing in world 4, you can reset in worlds 6 and 7 and go back to world 4 in both, saving a considerable amount of time; note that only the last death for the actual game over needs to be in world 4, and it gets faster dying before the other 2 times in 1-2 after checkpoint area where you have a piranha plant beside your spawn place
