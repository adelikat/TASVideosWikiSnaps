	"All in all this run was played quite well and cleverly. The author really plans out how to save time. Unfortunately, overall, the hack itself isn't exactly presenting well designed areas, isn't too popular, and the audience found the play with it tedious and repetitive. Barely half the audience found it entertaining. Rejecting.
