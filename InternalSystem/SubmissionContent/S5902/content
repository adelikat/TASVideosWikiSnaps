	"All in all this run was played quite well and cleverly. The author really plans out how to save time. Unfortunately, overall, the hack itself isn't exactly presenting well designed areas, isn't too popular, and the audience found the play with it tedious and repetitive. Barely half the audience found it entertaining. Rejecting.

The run appears well made (which was even noted upon the original rejection).  While some optimization techniques for Super Metroid may have been found in the intervening years that could make this run faster, it by no means makes this run look sloppy.
