	"Guess what guys I did while I was stuck in Rockman 2 and had too much free time! Again the time has come when another Mega Man game has fallen even further. This my new run aims for a better  entertainment and speed values, making this run was impressed by my own imagination and other Mega Man games  and their authors. I planned this movie strategically from the beginning to its end to be sure what things are good to use in this run. I worked on this run the most during the summer because I had much more time to spend.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"I was not able to avoid making this submission which was caused by numerous little techniques (few frame(s) there and there), strategies and optimizations I found out so I decided to start everything from the beginning because I've always wanted to make optimal possible movies. This time subpixels (X,Y), charge counter and lag values are optimized, sometimes I had to search for a good  positioning (+to lose few frames) to attain faster time later on. So its not a good idea to aim for a highest values every time because you'll just end to meet your own grave before you even notice it, I recommend to test few low subpixel value combinations.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Movie required much time to play trough cause my previous movie was really optimized in the end and I had to face much more different luck manipulations, randomness and optimizations than in the past, that’s why my run included some weird/cool looking movements. I played and tested every stage with a different subpixel positioning to see if it is possible to gain few frames in some rooms. Working on this run was really exciting and much funnier to finish through when comparing to my previous experiences because my previous version had good, almost perfect manipulations throughout the run so I had to find many different ways in variable timings to solve puzzles to go forward and continue my progress and to surpass over my previous version in some places. I was really amused by manipulations (in stage data) because they were slightly more different than before and had more extra lag spots inside. Though I was able to solve these situations by some "little" changes in the end, but Blizzardman stage is selected 1 frame later to attain perfect manipulation and timing to its end, I wonder why that happened only there, check the Stage information section for more information.

	"Have you ever wondered why you can't perform something like you did in the previous movie? Here's some kind of answers for you. Even if you had the same manipulation, movements etc. there must be something that fails in the beginning or in the middle of the stage. It's just something you can't avoid so don't get rushed by these. It seems that every stage has own manipulation percents. If I recall correctly Blizzardman does have the lowest randomness count in its level data and other stages does have many other combinations.

There are also other great uses for subpixels when you are  testing something with them because you can sometimes land on platforms 1 frame earlier, subpixels were used throughout the whole run. (Example, see all ladder parts and beginning of Flameman stage).
	$LF
	"If you want to get high values while sliding on the platforms for subpixels or actually maximal as possible you just need to slide and stop and so on so many times to make subpixels to change and after that you'll have to remember to slide regularly so the game will keep your values like you wanted. Subpixels are used every place as possible. Sometimes they are avoided to save time.

After some time of investigation I found out that if you turn (right or left and jump) one frame earlier than you can jump and grab the ladders and press one frame for (left or right) and press (left or right) after that you'll get pushed by 1 frame forward by the corner. This trick is not used in many places because it appears to be that you'll have to get extremely great luck to gain time, even if you climbed the stairs faster there is a high change to get equally the same time caused by your Y position.

For example this heavily happens in Tomahawkman and in Knightman stages. (To test this yourself enter to Tomahawkman stage, TAS through first room and watch it with frame-advance to see what happens there, symptoms are random stopping and you can even stand on the air). For example in the end of Flameman's first room when flying enemy shoots its fire bullet towards to ground makes game to stop for a frame or two, this can be seen in a real time.

Also pressing right, left+down while sliding almost at every lag spot speedups bubbles..

But the main reason for level changing is that I though creepy lag affects to your charging time when you are sliding left & right, also Flameman battle does have much lag inside so I played it as a first stage in the previous run. But in the Windman battle there is much more space to slide and to charge your buster slightly faster than before, I'm sure you'll notice why I didn't slide all the time in some places that's why because I had to avoid going to any lag spots because stopping there will only cause a lag frame. This battle took about a month to perform and finishing out perfectly caused by thousands of different testing that was must to do. Also I had great luck when I entered to Windman's boss room, I didn't have to manipulate boss' movements at all by losing frame or two in lag spots to manipulate its movements, otherwise perfect manipulation pulled out.

Strategically differences can be found at room#1,  room #3, room#6 and from room#7 which saved time a bit, 6 frames in total. For a boss fight there is a strategy I found out after a week when I submitted my previous submission. You can manipulate Plantman not to jump its last jump. after that he runs around, as you can see there is a load of lag after beating the boss up however its still faster because you didn't have to wait for so long as the previous version did.

Well you can manipulate Plantman to run all the time from the beginning and he jumps only 2 times (first and last jumps) but because he appears to be almost left side of the screen it’s almost impossible to reduce lag and speedup those bubbles, so its even more slower than my previous battle.

So I tried to find a good spot to eliminate lag like I did in my previous movie but this time I found more advanced way to play with to save 12 frames over my previous version. This boss battle is really risky because almost every piece of your movements generates extra lag and your hit may delay easily like 1-10 frames away. I had to play this boss few times through and compare my other versions and I ended up with this one.

	"This must be the core of Mega Man 6's randomness, lag and other variable things... This stage was much more challenging to play through what I did remember or imagined. I just had to keep my eyes cool and test everything properly before continuing anything. This time around I had even more better luck manipulation and I was able to turn it to 23 frame lead! Also I abused the moving platforms like I did in the Mr. X Stage 2. I took couple of frames from the boss battle by sacrificing frame before entering the boss' room.

[p 
	"This stage is a bit similar than previous stage but not so challenging, in fact this stage is really simple to handle. As usual I tried to perform different kind of strategies to find new things out, most of them are based on the new, different randomness. I gained almost all of the time from the boss battle because there is a possibility to shorten animation screen time. You'll just have to defeat Mr. X in a correct position and place yourself at X value = 127,128 or 129, three of them are correct values to land.

	"An interesting stage with different kind of variables. I followed my previous steps and tried to optimize and change everything to see how the dragon boss will react, it turned out finely and I was even able to shave even more lag from the boss battle with my incredible luck! When I was going to enter to the boss room I had just to lose frame or two to succeed for a perfect battle.

[p 
	"Here we go again. This time around I had much more problem with the lag than I did in my previous run and test movies. Because of the bad randomness I had to lose 2 frames. I even tried to compare some different subpixel positioning if they would help me progress but they didn't. Also before entering to the long last room I dropped 1 frame earlier from the cliff not to lose even more time.

[p 
	"This is the climax of the wily's fortress where the entire robot masters lies ahead. As usual lag shaving and luck manipulations are the top priorities in the boss fights. Battles are somewhat looking same but there is a new technique used in Plantman's battle and it looks most likely same as I used in the Plantman's stage. This time around that technique saves almost up to 30 frames!

[p 
	"Short but somewhat epic stage and this ends the Mega Man series NES era after finishing Dr. Wily and his crazy plans to rule over the world... at least for some time. I tried to find many different strategies out from the boss battle but I still ended up using the same strategy as in the previous movie because there were nothing to do. Mhh, there were also other manipulation problems that couldn't be fixed until you lost frames in the previous stage. I had critically bad luck during the stage and the battle so I had to lose 1 frame somewhere in the boss room to complete that vending machine 1 frame later (caused by Y positioning) and in the boss fight I had to lose some time to get good manipulation. In the end this stage was 4 frames slower.
