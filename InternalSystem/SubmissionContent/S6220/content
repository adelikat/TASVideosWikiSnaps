	"This was not the best TAS I've done, I just wanted to bring something acceptable to TASVideos, and if that TAS is not accepted, I'll understand that it's not good enough, but at least I tried to make an acceptable TAS, and I do not care if do not post my TAS, I'll be happy to have done this project, the important thing is to be cool, not boring with awful audio, at least I tried to do something that sucks at that site, hugs

	"When submitting a movie, you go through

	". It says 
	[em 
		""Lots of tips on making a high quality movie can be found on the

		" page."
	]em
	" Guidelines aren't linked without purpose, they actually contain advices that help you improve your TASing skills. 
	[a class=intlink href=/Guidelines#DoPossibleResearch 
		"One of the chapters
	]a
	" starts like this: 
	[em 
		""The first thing you should check for is if other users on our Forum have made or tried a TAS of the game you want to TAS."

	" Indeed, we have a 
	[a class=intlink href=/Forum/T/4539

	[a class=intlink href=/Forum/P/472215#472215 
		"in the end of that thread
	]a

	[a class=intlink href=/Userfiles/Info/48382871918994311 
		"current TAS record
	]a
	" for this game. That's the movie you should have checked before starting this run. Because you fail to beat it, losing to it by several minutes. I made a comparison:

	"Your submission is even slower than 
	[a class=intlink href=/6031S 
		"this canceled one
	]a
	", by 1.5 minutes. So instead of losing to an existing record once, like in your 
	[a class=intlink href=/6157S 
		"Gradius III submission
	]a
	", you managed to break the aforementioned rule twice now. That's honestly impressive. But not in a good way.

	"Moreover, we have 
	[a class=intlink href=/MovieRules#NoSkippingToTheEndWithAPassword 
		"another rule
	]a
	" that says: 
	[em 
		""No skipping to the end with a password. The point is to beat the full game; skipping major sections of the game with a password defeats the purpose."
	]em
	" You got the "USA%" definition entirely wrong. I said in 
	[a class=intlink href=/6006S 
		"yet another relevant submission
	]a
	" you haven't checked: 
	[em 
		""This run uses a route that can be considered a valid any% branch here, because the password glitch is legitimate: it's not a cheat, since regular passwords are already doing the same thing, so there's no point for the developers in implementing such a feature in addition to them."
	]em
	" The allowed technique that lets you skip straight to USA is a glitch. Instead, you just go ahead and enter a password to reach USA directly, breaking another fundamental movie rule.

	"You still quite obviously don't understand what this site is about, regardless of all the links I provided you 
	[a class=intlink href=/6157S 
		"last time
