	"This was not the best TAS I've done, I just wanted to bring something acceptable to TASVideos, and if that TAS is not accepted, I'll understand that it's not good enough, but at least I tried to make an acceptable TAS, and I do not care if do not post my TAS, I'll be happy to have done this project, the important thing is to be cool, not boring with awful audio, at least I tried to do something that sucks at that site, hugs

	"Your 
	(__wikiLink|6157S|previous submission)

	(__wikiLink|MovieRules#SpeedOrientedMovieMustBeatAllExistingRecords|existing records)

	"When submitting a movie, you go through 
	(__wikiLink|Subs-List|this page)
	". It says 
	[em 
		""Lots of tips on making a high quality movie can be found on the 
		(__wikiLink|Guidelines)
		" page."
	]em
	" Guidelines aren't linked without purpose, they actually contain advices that help you improve your TASing skills. 
	(__wikiLink|Guidelines#DoPossibleResearch|One of the chapters)
	" starts like this: 
	[em 
		""The first thing you should check for is if other users on our Forum have made or tried a TAS of the game you want to TAS."
	]em
	" Indeed, we have a 
	[a href=/forum/t/4539 
		"forum thread for this game
	]a
	". And 
	[a href=/forum/p/472215#472215 
		"in the end of that thread
	]a
	" I posted a link to the 
	[a href=/userfiles/info/48382871918994311 
		"current TAS record
	]a
	" for this game. That's the movie you should have checked before starting this run. Because you fail to beat it, losing to it by several minutes. I made a comparison:

	"Your submission is even slower than 
	(__wikiLink|6031S|this canceled one)
	", by 1.5 minutes. So instead of losing to an existing record once, like in your 
	(__wikiLink|6157S|Gradius III submission)
	", you managed to break the aforementioned rule twice now. That's honestly impressive. But not in a good way.
	$LF

[p 
	"Moreover, we have 
	(__wikiLink|MovieRules#NoSkippingToTheEndWithAPassword|another rule)
	" that says: 
	[em 
		""No skipping to the end with a password. The point is to beat the full game; skipping major sections of the game with a password defeats the purpose."
	]em
	" You got the "USA%" definition entirely wrong. I said in 
	(__wikiLink|6006S|yet another relevant submission)
	" you haven't checked: 
	[em 
		""This run uses a route that can be considered a valid any% branch here, because the password glitch is legitimate: it's not a cheat, since regular passwords are already doing the same thing, so there's no point for the developers in implementing such a feature in addition to them."
	]em
	" The allowed technique that lets you skip straight to USA is a glitch. Instead, you just go ahead and enter a password to reach USA directly, breaking another fundamental movie rule.

	"You still quite obviously don't understand what this site is about, regardless of all the links I provided you 
	(__wikiLink|6157S|last time)
	", and the worst thing is that you're not learning at all. This submission is canceled and your submission privileges are revoked, as I warned you.

		"user file
