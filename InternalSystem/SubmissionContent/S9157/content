	": This hack can be found on RHDN, or for however long that site will still be up, but for now the hack is easily accessible. The hack transforms at least some part of each level despite some parts remaining the same.  While I would have liked to see something even more transformative for Batman, this does change things up some to provide a somewhat different experience to the original game.  Optimization looks good and the game does sync to the end.
