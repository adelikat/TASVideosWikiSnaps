	"Paper Mario, first released in Japan in August of 2000, is a role-playing game. Peach has been kidnapped by Bowser, who has stolen the Star Rod, which allows him to grant himself any wish. In order to counteract the effects of the Star Rod, Mario must locate the seven star spirits who, together, can stop Bowser's evil plans.

[p 
	[b 
		"Out of Bounds -
	]b
	" When leaving the ground in Paper Mario, the game begins to count the time spent airborne. After a couple seconds off of the ground, Mario’s fall will slow to a halt and his Y position will begin to rapidly increase. If Mario passes through any solid floor during this time, he will respawn there. However, if Mario remains in the air for too long, he will instead respawn at the position he was original at before he left the ground.  By using a controlled fall out of bounds, we can abuse this property to respawn on the other side of many obstacles in the game.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"NPC Clip -
	]b
	" In certain areas of the game, we can use the speed of a spin or applying other situational methods in order to move into the space between an NPC’s hitbox and a solid wall.  By then hammering to freeze ourselves in place or occasionally simply jumping we can cause the NPC’s hitbox to push us through whatever solid object they are standing next to.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Lakilester Clip -
	]b
	" If Mario is positioned precisely at a corner and faces away from the corner, he can then use Lakilester and clip through the corner. This is because when Lakilester returns to Mario, his speed causes him to land a bit behind Mario. This only works on some corners. A variation of this can occur when Mario tries to get on Lakilester while the two of them are separated by a large distance or while Lakilester is stuck behind an obstacle. Lakilester returns to Mario at a high speed and gets confused as to the route that he should take. Lakilester Clip has several uses throughout the run, including skipping the majority of two chapters.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Loading Zone Storage (LZS) -
	]b
	" Touching a loading zone while the control pad is neutral and then jumping immediately after prevents you from taking the loading zone until you stop jumping or do not reset the control pad to neutral right before jumping. This can be used to immediately leave an area after completing a task. In addition, by reaching a sufficient distance from the loading zone, we can use LZS to exploit a subtle mechanic which causes Mario to move toward the center of it. This allows us to enter the next area at such a highly skewed angle that we immediately fall out of bounds, bypassing obstacles by going underneath them.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Spin Canceling -
	]b
	" Spinning and then jumping after 16 frames (w/o Speedy Spin) or 21 frames (w/ Speedy Spin) is the fastest form of movement. In addition, it was realized that moving at a precise angle against walls will actually give you a speed boost. In addition, it will instantly cancel the end of your spin in one frame. You can immediately start spinning again afterwards. There are two different types of cancels which we refer to as short and long spin cancels. Short spin cancels are slightly slower than long cancels as you stop more frequently. Whether or not you get a short and long spin appears to depend on the direction that Mario is facing and the properties of the wall.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"RNG -
	]b
	" Within battles, RNG is based off of a frame counter. If we waste frames in different parts of a battle, and then attack the enemy on the same frame as before, the RNG remains the same (with the exception of the beginning of the Final Bowser fight). Outside of battle, frames can be wasted in different spots to produce different results. RNG is commonly manipulated in battle to change the Power Bounce cap. After doing a certain number of jumps, the game will randomly determine whether or not Mario can continue bouncing, but because you cannot delay or speed up Mario while he is jumping on the enemy, it is essentially determined on the last input before Mario jumps on the enemy. The exception is with the Goombario text glitch (explained below). Scrolling a text box back and forth while bouncing on Bowser in phase 1 changes the RNG of the Power Bounce cap, allowing us to deal 5 Power Bounces without wasting any time. Another use of RNG manipulation is with the Close Call badge, which allows Mario to sometimes dodge attacks from an enemy.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Quick Jump -
	]b
	" Before hitting an enemy, Mario has a crouching animation. Pressing A slightly before the animation starts will cause him to crouch earlier and for a shorter period of time, saving up to 1/3 of a second.

	"Tricks/Glitches Used in the Run
	$LF
]h2
[p 
	[b 
		"Jr. Troopa Skip -
	]b
	" After falling from Goompa's balcony and then entering Jr. Troopa’s Playground, we can use LZS to immediately take the loading zone after interacting with the bush with the hammer in it. This skips the Jr. Troopa battle, saving over one minute and twenty seconds initially, though some of that time is lost later on as a result of being at a lower level.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Black Toad Skip -
	]b
	" We can use an NPC Clip to get out of bounds and fall and respawn in the wall of the Post Office. Then we can fall again to pass behind the Black Toads and enter Chapter 1.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Kooper Skip -
	]b
	" The only method we could find to get out of bounds on this screen was by using LZS to pass through the back of the loading zone through which we entered. Luckily, this is one of the few loading zones in the game that does not have an invisible wall completely surrounding it. As a result of the crude method we utilize to get out of bounds, we are forced to continue using frame-perfect jumps throughout the entire screen until we can override the stored loading zone with the one that leads to the next area. This allows us to bypass one of the two remaining uses of Kooper.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Epic Timesaver -
	]b
	" Don’t ask about the name. Though the railing at the bottom of this staircase looks fairly short, it actually has invisible one-sided collision that extends all the way up to the top of the 2nd-to-highest stair. Luckily, the developers left the topmost stair completely unprotected. We can clip into the basement with a not particularly precise jump by falling into the top stair. From there, we can navigate out of bounds to the floor behind the door on the top floor, skipping the fight to lower the staircase as well as a time consuming Fortress Key.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Log Skip -
	]b
	" Now that we have everything we need from Chapter 1, we can now bypass the logs in Toad Town which prevent us from accessing later areas of the game before the first Star Spirit is rescued. This is done with LZS to perform a skewed entry and fall to the other side of the aforementioned logs.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Letter Skip #1 -
	]b
	" By clipping out of bounds, spawning on the room's seam, and falling to the left, we can store the loading zone while out of bounds. After respawning at our original location, we can do a few frame perfect jumps to skew the loading zone enough to fall out of bounds and spawn right by the letter.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Letter Skip #2 (Kooperless Letter) -
	]b
	" Using the same out of bounds clip, we can traverse the back seam in order to respawn on the elevated platform on which rests the 2nd letter. The last-remaining use of Kooper is thusly expunged.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Chapter 4 Early -
	]b
	" After manipulating rng to precisely position the Toad on the walkway on the walkway outside of Harry’s Shop we can use it to NPC clip out of bounds and enter the fourth chapter.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Calculator Fight Skip -
	]b
	" Defeating any Shy Guy on the calculator screen flags the Shy Guy that is carrying the calculator as having been defeated. After fighting one of the other Shy Guys and reloading the area, the calculator will be placed on the ground where it can be quickly collected.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Blue House Skip -
	]b
	" There is a blue house in toad town containing a pipe which is intended as a shortcut to the later areas of the sewers. It is normally inaccessible until Chapter 5 as the door is locked from the inside. Using a precisely positioned frame-perfect jump, this house can be accessed early, allowing us to skip straight to Chapter 5.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Yoshi Skip & Raphael Skip -
	]b
	" Using precise jumps, we are able to climb a tree and then jump over it to get out of bounds. From there we can navigate the seams and gain immediate access to the volcano. This skips rescuing the Yoshis and obtaining the Ultra Stone, which takes a very long time and would also require us to obtain Watt.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Ultra Hammer Skip -
	]b
	" While taking a loading zone, Mario is able to ignore collision. By using LZS on the loading zone at the top of the main room of the volcano and then standing next to the block which prevents us from progressing without the Ultra Hammer, we are able to use a loading zone to clip through the block. The transition into the new area is interrupted when Mario reaches the loading zone behind the block, which is taken instead. This only saves 5-10 seconds over acquiring Ultra Hammer as time will be lost later on, when we encounter blocks that we will find ourselves unable to hammer.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Flarakarry -
	]b
	" A precisely-positioned use of Parakarry can allow us to slightly clip into the wall and touch the loading zone behind it. This skips pushing a blue block all the way across the room, hammering a number of blocks, the Spiny Tromp breaking through the wall, and a small cutscene involving Kolorado.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Footrace with Kolorado the Quick -
	]b
	" In the room after Flarakarry is a short cutscene where Kolorado runs up and talks to you, however this cutscene will not start until he reaches a certain point in the room. Utilizing the new spin-cancel movement strategies, we are able to outrun Kolorado, skipping the cutscene.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Lava Piranha Skip -
	]b
	" By spinning between Kolorado and the wall, we can jump at the right time to NPC clip through it. For some strange reason, this screen and the screen on which you fight the boss of the chapter are actually one and the same, and if the room is not entered from the lower-left loading zone, the fight does not start. Once out of bounds we can easily reach the loading zone below, skipping the fight.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Lakilester Early -
	]b
	" By storing the north-west loading zone of the main area of the Flower Fields and then taking the loading zone from a precise position, we are able to do a skewed entry onto the next screen and land exactly on the seam of the area. From there we can proceed directly to Lakilester, skipping the acquisition of the Bubble Berry, and the item trading sequence leading up to it. This skip renders the chapter unable to be completed, as you skip items necessary to reach the boss of the chapter.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Tower of the Sun Early -
	]b
	" By using LZS through the loading zone at the Tower of the Sun, we can fall out of bounds and respawn right next to the sun, immediately taking the loading zone after talking to him.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Peach Warp -
	]b
	" The cutscene for escaping the volcano never goes away. It is normally inaccessible after completing the chapter, as the path that leads there becomes blocked by lava. This cutscene sends you outside Peach’s Castle, which then decides which cutscene to play based on your current game progress. So if you’re currently in the middle of Chapter 6, you are sent to the Chapter 6 Peach scene. And doing it again, during Chapter 7, sends you to the Chapter 7 cutscene. In this way we are able to skip the majority of both Chapters 6 and 7. It cannot be used to skip Chapter 8, as there is no Peach scene for completing that chapter. Now that we know this, it’s just a matter of reaching the volcano escape cutscene, which can fortunately done with a pair of Lakilester Clips. The first clip gets us below the lava, while the 2nd clip is required to get us around some invisible walls which now prevent us from crossing the next room normally.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Clippy -
	]b
	" For some reason, while riding Lakilester, we are able to open a menu on one frame immediately before entering a battle. If this is used to change partners after the battle, Mario will take on Lakilester’s collision, allowing him, on occasion, to clip through walls. This is used to pass the stone block in the sewers which prevents us from reaching the Ultra Boots, as we have never obtained a Hammer upgrade. Clippy allows us to jump onto the block, which is not normally possible, and from there clippy can be used to jump through the arch of the doorway. The metal block in the next room proved more of a challenge to clip through, however there is a side-effect of clippy that occurs when Mario attempts to jump back on Lakilester. Mario will immediately teleport onto Lakilester, with no animation, at Mario’s x and z position, but at Lakilester’s height. In this way we can teleport downward, into the block, and reach the loading zone behind.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Shooting Star Summit Clip -
	]b
	" Using a Lakilester Clip, Mario can fall out of bounds and respawn at the top of the Shooting Star Summit, instead of climbing to the top.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Block Clip -
	]b
	" Instead of progressing normally through the Chapter 8 basement, we instead head leftward, across the lava, toward the screen with the castle’s entrance. Using a precisely positioned tornado jump, we can get on top of the badge block. From there we can reach the entrance by using Parakarry. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Hub Room Clip -
	]b
	" The wall at the bottom-left of the stairs in the first hub room is not properly connected, and with the right positioning, Mario can walk right though. This saves a few frames as we do not have to climb the stairs. This does not work in the similarly designed room later in the castle.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Flood Room Skip -
	]b
	" The method for doing this trick used in this run was accidentally discovered while fooling around in the room. If you ride Lakilester on the water, and then ride him over into the hole that the spring came out of, Mario will fall through the floor. With precise out of bounds movement, we are able to reach the key on the top floor. At this water level, the loading zone to the next area is blocked by an invisible wall. By using the Hammer to obtain the key, we are able to avoid having to do additional clips in order to reach it.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Cannonless -
	]b
	" Using a Lakilester clip in a precise position along the second stair will cause Mario to fall out of bounds and respawn underneath the stairs. From there, Mario can spin up right and land on the seam of the room. This skips getting into encounters with all of the cannons in this room.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Goombario Text Glitch -
	]b
	" Pressing C-Down a frame before falling into the Final Bowser cutscene causes two text boxes to appear: Goombario’s text box and Bowser’s text box. We can press C-Down again to end Goombario’s text box, leaving Bowser’s text box on screen. Because the game registers that a text box closed, the cutscene advances while Bowser’s text box remains on screen. When the next event in the cutscene starts, we can advance the text box to end it prematurely. The text box that should normally appear at that point in the cutscene will then pop up while the cutscene advances further. This saves time because as the cutscene plays, we can advance to the end of each text box and immediately start the next sequence of the cutscene.  
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Luigi Skip -
	]b
	" After Mario returns to his house, he and Luigi leave to visit Peach at her castle. By holding down as Mario jumps up to the pipe outside of his house, the transition to the next screen will begin instead of waiting for Luigi to enter the pipe as well. As this ends the cutscene early, the portion of it where Luigi talks to Mario in Toad Town never occurs.

		"Mid-way through the run, we realized a certain order of events involving selling the Whacka’s Bumps and getting a Dizzy Dial did not actually work. After Chapter 4, you cannot talk to the shopkeeper until you go back into Chapter 4 and retrieve the key to the storeroom. We had to change the route a bit, which required getting more coins. Instead of the coins by the Koopa Troopa in the bush from Chapter 1 and the coin block in Chapter 4, it would be faster to retrieve the three coins on the spring by the Fire Flower in Prologue. This would save a couple frames.

		"There is a more optimal place to obtain the last Maple Syrup, but because of the Flood Room Skip, which no longer required going in an extra room that had a Maple Syrup, we had to get it from the next possible place. This then became slower to get than the Maple Syrup in the Chapter 8 room with the Dry Bones, but because of bad enemy positioning that we could not alter efficiently, we had to get it in the next best place, right after the quiz.

	"Kagemitsu - He worked very hard the past couple of years working on a TAS of his own, which can be seen here:

		" Part 4
	]a
	". His TAS became the framework for ours. Throughout the making of this TAS, we constantly asked, “How does this compare to Kagemitsu,” since he could be used as a good reference to assure that we were optimizing well. The difference between our two TASes is that he does not use the Kooper Skip or Spin Cancels early in his run. He also uses a different route.
