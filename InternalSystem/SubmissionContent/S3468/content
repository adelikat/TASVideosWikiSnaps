	"I had never played this game until I started TASing it last year. I had other projects at the time so I never really started a serious TAS attempt. I had a look at bobmario511 and Kyman’s WIP and found some improvements here and there.

	]a
	" by 
	[a class=extlink href=http://www.youtube.com/user/aleckermit rel=nofollow

	" was uploaded. I thought it was pretty good and that Chameleon Twist 2 would, like I thought, make a good TAS.

	"I then contacted aleckermit asking him some general advices about the game. He was really interested in helping me and had already uploaded a 
	[a class=extlink href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvhyZd7G27o rel=nofollow 
		"WIP
	]a
	". Funny enough, I didn’t even know about the speed power-ups present in the game (nor did bobmario511 and Kyman); aleckermit attempt was really fast paced and motivated me to start the project.

	"After countless retries in Sky Land, finding more and more improvements each time such as new death warps and insane momentum-sustaining techniques, we finally came up with a

		"big skip
	]a
	" and were finally able to finish Sky Land. Overall, we ended up saving 3 minutes and 10 seconds over bobmario511 and Kyman’s
