	": Hello Zain and thank you for the submission.  Tasvideos rules require accepting optimized tas movies, and this submission does not meet the optimization standard.  Generally optimization comes up when there noticeable issues in gameplay, or when known time saving tricks fail to be used.  A large part of judging is doing comparisons with existing speedruns and tases which I did do here.  Notably, these two movies 
	[a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzadcIC6ig rel=noopener external nofollow 
		"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzadcIC6ig
	]a
	" and 
	(__wikiLink|href=/3760M|implicitdisplaytext=3760M)
	" show that this submission does not make use of a lot of strategies and tricks available for a tool assisted speedrun.  In these two movies the authors have good movement with minimal pauses, and use Kirby's abilities to knock out blocks to good moving forward, as well as using powers that allow Kirby to move fast.  In this submission there are notable pauses and many fast movement abilities are not used.  Since this is a tas, the fast movement cycle trick used in the tas many years ago should also have been used.  While these two movies are not "glitchless" the time saved using glitch does not account for the time disparity.  Levels are minutes slower than their counterparts.
