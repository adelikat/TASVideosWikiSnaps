	"This run is a savings of 8377 over the previous run.  This game is a royal pain in the ass.  I absolutely regret ever picking it up ><  But after picking it up and realizing how bad the current TAS was I couldn't not do the run.  My first wip made it through level 3 before I figured out the bunny hopping trick and had to restart the entire run.  31500 rerecords on such a simple game is because of how unfriendly this game is for TASing.  I can't express how happy I am to never have to play this game ever ever ever again.
