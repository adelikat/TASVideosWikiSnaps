	"After finished some NES TAS, I realized that I never make FDS TAS. So I started looking for a suitable project. Arumana no Kiseki became my final choice. More importantly, it’s the first movie in the NES-FDS-Stars-Moons lists. At first, I just tried to improve it. With my further understanding of the game, this TAS has been improved more and more. The whole production process was not easy, but it was full of surprises. In the first three stages, I used more than 30000 re-record count, repeatedly overturned the previous progress. The route planning of the whole game has been very perfect in the previous TAS, what I have done is mainly to improve the details, minor changes in the route, as well as the weapon distribution in boss combat.

[div class=p 
	"The screen is not allowed to scroll horizontally and vertically at the same time. During the jump, only the horizontal screen can be scrolled. When the character lands on a vertical moving platform, only the vertical screen can be scrolled. As the character climbs the rope, the horizontal and vertical screens scroll alternately. If the character's abscissa does not reach the position of the rolling horizontal scroll, the longitudinal scroll rolls continuously while climbing the rope, and vice versa. Reasonable use of these techniques can save a lot of time. For example, at the end of the third stage, try to reduce the horizontal screen scrolling to get more vertical screen scrolling values. At the end of the fifth stage, the Y coordinate of the character is large enough, which continuous horizontal rolling can be obtained when climbing the rope.

[div class=p 
	"The free dagger only does 1 damage. The weapon of full screen attack is also 1 damage. The weapon that attacks 45 degrees above is 3 damage. Bomb damage is 5. The rest of the weapons do 2 damage. During the blink time after the character is injured, the bomb can't damage the boss, but other weapons may hit 1 frame ahead of time. The bomb uses a separate weapon system and the other weapons share the same system. After the bomb is thrown, you need to press the B key to detonate. When you have only one bomb left, you will automatically switch to the next weapon after throwing the bomb, which will cause you to be unable to detonate the bomb. If you throw away all the other weapons and there is only one bomb left, the bomb can be detonated, but it doesn't work, because the ultimate goal is not just to kill the boss, but to get the gem on boss's forehead.
