	"To achieve a never ending TAS, BizHawk 1.4.1 is required.  I coded in a movie parameter called loopoffset.  When this is present, BizHawk will loop back to this frame after reaching the end of the movie.  In this case, I put LoopOffset 1275 into the movie file.  It will play the first 1275 frames, then loop 1276 to the end of the movie endlessly.  Now the challenge is simply to find a segment of input such that the game will continue to play!
