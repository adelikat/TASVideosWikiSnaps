	"SaGa Frontier is a RPG by Square, released in Japan on July 11, 1997. The game was later published by Sony Computer Entertainment in North America(SCEA) on March 25, 1998. It is the seventh game in the SaGa series and the first to be released on the PlayStation. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"The plot of SaGa Frontier take place a science fiction/fantasy setting called the Regions, a group of worlds with varying degrees of culture, unique races, technology, and magic. The game allows the player to follow the exploits of one of seven protagonists, each with his or her own storyline and goal. The game's Free Scenario System offers a large amount of non-linear gameplay, allowing the player to freely travel between many of the Regions, interact with other characters, and take part in turn-based combat.If certain conditions are met within the battle, party members on either side can create combination attacks for added damage.
