	"It looks like this TAS took 3 years to make. Wow so long! You don't believe that yourself, don't you? There's no way a simple game as that needs that long. The reason it took such long time to make is because I'm a lazy fuck and never do anything and I'm proudly admit to it, because I'm not like the people who set their projects paused for 2+ years and then say it took them 2+ years to make. What you're still not convinced that no effort was put into this movie? JXQ did his run in 3 astonishing days, while I needed a lot longer due to being lazy. Also there're a lot of known improvements which where even known when making the run, instead of throwing away years of work and implement these I continued the TAS and ignored these improvements, also a trick (delayed exits) which would force me to ultra optimize every room with different entrance frame was ignored as well. See this run is definetely not optimized.
