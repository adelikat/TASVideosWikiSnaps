	" is an unlicensed NES game with an unknown release date, though it is speculated to have been released after 2008. Besides the latter half of the game settling once and for all the dispute on legitimacy of left+right or up+down input (seriously, just watch this run), it also features an assortment of 12 music tracks, which was enough to get the YouTube encode of this movie blocked in a few countries, including Japan and the United States.
