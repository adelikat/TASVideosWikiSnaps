I could not find any other viable method to manipulate RNG, so this was all we could do. What you will immediately notice, is that you can continuously roll without any loss of speed. This means that rolling patterns compared to the SNES version will be completely different in almost all the stages. When you jump, as well, you want to avoid holding the B button, because as soon as you hold the B button in the air, your speed snaps to 656, while if you delay holding the B button, your speed will gradually decrease to 400. You will want to hold the B button as soon as the speed reaches 676 or 656 (it won't make a difference). At the end of the stage, you want to hit the goal as far left as possible. Doing this gives you more speed when going back to the right because the game has to push you harder to bring you to the intended spot, which sometimes saves a frame. Sometimes it won't save any time.

				"This boss was hard to TAS. For the first egg, you want to wait with hitting the egg and instead face left when you hit the egg, while avoiding getting hit by Krow. This first hit is very hard and saves around 30 frames over the first WIP of this boss. For the second egg, you want to get on top of the nest. This is possible by repeatedly getting knocked back by Krow while he is still rising, ultimately bringing you to his nest. Depending on where you are, he will drop the egg far sooner than if you were on the ground. Facing to the right to bring you closer to Krow again, and down goes the second hit. The third and fourth eggs are pure RNG. In this phase, Krow will send off either fake eggs or a real egg. (Note: on the GBA version, you can only get up to 3 fake eggs per hit.) The third egg was manipulated by delaying the first roll in the first level. The fourth egg is luckily very easily manipulatable by delaying hitting Krow. After the final blow, we manipulate the camera and position in such a way that Cranky walks the minimum required distance.

				" This level also shows the introduction of ledge boosts. We don't exactly know why it works, but if you jump on the first frame your true Y Speed drops to 0 (your Y Speed is a constant 356(?), probably to keep the kong snapped to the grond), your speed goes from the usual 896 rolling speed to a 1280 speed. This saves several frames and is used whenever you have to jump after a ledge. It is often better to jump earlier but have this speed than to jump later to jump during a roll. Your X speed immediately gradually starts dropping to 400, so we hold the B button as soon as the X speed reaches 660. Ledge boosts seem to only work with max rolling speed as either Dixie or Diddy.

Of course if you can run to the boss while holding a cannon ball, that’s faster than throwing it. A difference between the snes version is once the 2nd phase starts, the hooks will spawn right away, rather than only spawning as soon as Kleever lunches at you.  However we still make him lunge because he needs to do it at least 2 times for the first cannon ball can spawn, and each time after that a cannonball will spawn with each lunge.  Since Cranky can only come from one side, we can easily roll to him after collecting the KremKoin, shortening the walking time for Cranky.

What we first do is we use a trick often used in DKC3 GBA: timestop. The way this is done is as soon as we reach a ledge and are about to fall, we want to team up. We team up and then we land into the water. Landing into the water interrupts the team up animation, and because time is frozen while teaming up and we never let the game finish the animation, time stays frozen. We have to do an animation that freezes and unfreezes time in order to unfreeze time, so we have to switch Kongs to do that as we can not team up. We hit the clapper, which freezes the water and snaps us to the surface. Water rises because we got into the barrel, and we then get snapped even further above to the midway barrel! We have to move carefully here, however, as it is possible to get warped back underwater. Doing this trick saves 50 frames compared to doing it normally. The rest is some more movement optimization.

				"K. Rool has some pretty long phases, they’re slightly longer on GBA for whatever reason.  The only major instance of RNG comes from the 3rd hit of the 1st Phase, were it’s best to have the right most cannon ball retract its spikes, getting this manipulated was done by purposely losing 2 frames in 7-1.  One major time save that was found was during the last hit of the 3rd phase, to purposely get hit by K Rool, getting hit is about 65 frames faster than his regular suction animation, meaning it’s faster to finish the game using Dixie after we haven't used her that much throughout the run.

		" World 3-5: it is theoretically possible to Wrong Warp in this stage. If you timestop the way it is done in Clapper's Cavern (6-3), anything currently on camera and underwater when timestop is activated retains its' hitbox. If a Warp or Bonus barrel retains its' hitbox, you can enter that barrel while timestop is activated. The game will never set its' Warp location, and you will visit the last visited warp barrel. You have 4 potential locations: the warp barrel, the first bonus, the second bonus and the third bonus. If you were to enter the second bonus game of a stage and then use Wrong Warp, it will put you in that particular bonus game, and when you end it by either winning or losing, you will then be put to the intended location of the second barrel of 3-5, which in this case is at the end of the level. Currently, it is only possible to wrong warp in 1-4 and it is utterly useless. The only missing requirement for this wrong warp to work is the fact that the bonus barrel is NOT in the camera while timestop is activated, so this remains a theoretical skip. It may also end up being slower. As a sidenote, if you were to do a Wrong Warp without ever entering a bonus or warp barrel beforehand, you softlock. Wrong warp is often used in DKC3 GBA speedruns.

It may be possible to go out of bounds in 6-1 without softlocking and somehow reach the end of the stage. The big take away however is that we skip Enguarde, so we already have to do a detour (you are too high if you take the shortcut and the team up animation ends before you reach the water), then try to find a spot to do all of this with rising water, go out of bounds somehow and skip the stage. This is slow and we weren't able to get this all to line up.

		" World 6-B: we completely missed something that, with perfect RNG(?), could save over a second. However, we can not get this perfect RNG. If you get a third cannonball in the kleever phases, as shown in Avanor's TAS, you can hit Kerozene far sooner. It is possible to get this attack on the first kleever phase, and to completely skip an animation. However, we don't know how it works and what causes it to spawn. The potentially fastest route is to get a third cannonball in both Kleever phases, which could potentially save a lot of time. The other potential result is a softlock. We are not able to get this to work, however.
