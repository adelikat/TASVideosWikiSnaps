	"In the previous movie I missed as many as two warps (4 and 5 levels), because I do not know about them. Nevertheless, I was playing faster because less used vine and used a warp in level 3-2 instead of 3-3, which saved a few seconds, though top climb was very long and difficult. But it was worth it! Of course, I could through this level a few more quickly using a fast jump on the stairs (like in the fifth level, I climbed the wall of the house), but it would affect on the next game, and the RNG on the fourth level would not give immortality.

	"At the level of 5-2, I saved a little frames by braking by hit his head on the ceiling (as though it may sound funny) and collecting rings with the "grandfather", which allowed me to not jump through the last cannon and fly at the right place at once.

	"At the seventh level, I was less fortunate. At 7-2 I could not use game glitch which makes player immortal until the end of the level (as in my previous TAS http://youtu.be/UWVEiAMj4g0?t=9m38s ), additionally RNG stubbornly would not give the desired prize (in this game they changes every 4-5 frames, which is pretty much), and some green floors I ran by getting damage. For this reason,  walkthrough of this sublevel took about a second longer. Also, I had to stay for a few frames in the previous levels before the exit door to "grandfather" did not rotate at the beginning of the next level (is responsible for this some variable), when I press Down + A. But on the final boss I have saved more than 10 seconds by fast scrolling text with "Turbo B" (FCEUX emulates this by short press B through a single frame).

	"Finally, in the battle, I struck the first damage to the boss earlier on 0.5 seconds with idle hit, which does not reduce life, but activates a timer at address $046A, which is responsible for the time that the boss is immortal, and at the right time I put him a second hit, which now takes a life.

	"In the end, despite all the difficulties, my movie ends at 9:30, what is much better than I expected.
