I tried to help out by listing the times from Nitsuja's run. Thats when I mentioned that I wanted to chat with him on Skype to discuss further improvements. Eventually after AR1, I managed to do some input for AR2. It was then I discovered I was half decent with Sonic TASing! So I tried to improve later levels, and with luck, managed to save quite a bit!

This finished movie was incredibly hard to make, but many people were looking foward to it since its probably the first ever complete run to not only challenge Nitsuja's published movie, but succeed at defeating it!
