	"Register Y was given Kuros' X subpixel position at a previous point. This block of code only occurs when the room designator (stored in $00B6) is 5 (the last bosses room.) The game performed this check just before this code is called. $033D contains the Y coordinate of Kuros' fireball. The check it performs comparing it to #$50 only fails when you launch a fireball behind you (by holding B and pressing the direction opposite to which you are standing.) Why is a fireball programmed to travel higher this way? I do not know. Anyway this skips the jump to $B25C, the normal exit point. Instead, we get a strange piece of code that tells #$C0 to be stored in $03A4,Y = $0435. $0435 happens to be Malkil's attack pattern, which ranges from 0-5. The game checks what pattern he is currently in, but ends the fight when it finds no match (being $#C0)

	"There are several jumps in this run that are not performed optimally. If Kuros jumps and lands in just the right way, he does so without crouching and therefore recovers his max speed slightly quicker. However despite my best efforts, I was never actually able to save frames due to these small improvements, due to subpixels and boss patterns being thrown off. The best example of this is the beehive trick. I had thought I saved a frame with an improved jump only to lose it once I reached the area where the beehive is ordinarily glitched away only to jump right into it. So perhaps there is a slim chance ~5 more frames could be saved in this run, if somehow these jumps could actually save time.
