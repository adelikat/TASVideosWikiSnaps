	"NitroGenesis had suggested me to do a Luigi run, so I did, later, I had made the Luigi run, but I had to waste 3 frames over Bowser, I was about to submit it, but somehow, it didn't work, a few days, I had made an improvement (which is this), my new movie was 1 second faster and improved the 3 frame loss over the 2 Bowsers.
