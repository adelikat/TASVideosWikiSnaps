When I started working on it 18 months ago, my goal was to have a final time below one hour, and I just barely succeeded. The human speedrun record for this category is 1:40:47.

	"Strategy for this run involved finding the fastest ways to destroy every building, using power-ups if possible. Many buildings are best destroyed from the roof, so it’s often a matter of climbing one building and then jumping along the rooftops to destroy everything. The level ends when every building has finished its collapse animation, therefore near the end of a level it’s best to destroy tall buildings before short ones. The average length of levels decreases during the World Tour section at the end, because of the availability of the VERN power-up.

		"Death Breath is the best random power-up in the game, destroying all buildings in front of George that are visible on the screen. Manipulating it to appear as often as possible is an important part of this TAS. Grabbing the Death Breath power-up gives three “uses”, and a maximum of five “uses” can be stored.
		$LF

		"Hot Loogie instantly destroys one building. Grabbing the power-up gives three “uses” of Hot Loogie. More importantly, if George has any uses of Hot Loogie stored when grabbing a Death Breath power-up, those are added to the number of times Death Breath can be used. So it’s typically ideal to have two uses of Hot Loogie saved up when grabbing a Death Breath, to reach the maximum of five.

As there are other ways to end levels and one such method can potentially end a number of the 100+ levels a faster than total destruction, this submission wouldn't technically be an "any%" run. However, the game giving a very clear indicator that every building is destroyed after every level gives a very clear indication of something that can be considered full completion. For now I'll leave the "100%" branch label as it works fine enough and makes it a bit clearer that this falls under the Standard class of publications.
