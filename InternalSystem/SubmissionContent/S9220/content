	"Egg Mania: Eggstreme Madness (2002) is a puzzle game developed by HotGen and published by Kemco. The game's main mode, "Egg Mania", is a head-to-head battle mode where the player competes against the computer to build a tower using falling build pieces in order to reach the balloon quicker. The individual pieces are one to five blocks large, come in different shapes, and can be rotated to fit the situation. The stage is eight blocks across, and completing a line adds bonus blocks to the tower. Other than building pieces different items drop as well. They can either improve the player's situation or mess with the opponent. First one to reach the balloon at the top wins the round.

Because I have perfect knowledge of what blocks will come and the ability to construct my tower in an optimal way, and because of frame perfect movement I am able to do it faster than otherwise possible, but a speedrun of this game plays almost the exact same way. There are a few levels where perfect movement allows me to place blocks at a speed which enables combos that would be impossible to achieve in real time, but that is about it.

The stage is eight blocks across. Completing a line grants bonus blocks to the tower depending on how many blocks of the final piece were used to clear the line. If only one block is used to complete the line, one bonus block is placed atop the first column from the left, two blocks give two bonus blocks in columns 1 and 2, and three blocks give three.

If the first line is completed with one block, and the second line is completed also with one block, first one, then two additional bonus blocks are placed on the tower (1+(1+1) + (n+3) and so forth). The bonus blocks always start from column 1, going all the way across to column 8, then start over from right to left, from column 8 back to column 1. This pattern continues indefinitely.

[div class=p 
	"Completing multiple lines at once gives the total amount of blocks used to complete the lines times how many lines were completed. The largest pieces are five blocks, but no more than three blocks in any direction. This means the largest amount of blocks an individual line completion can give is five blocks times three lines (5x3=15). However, bonus blocks from earlier comboing are also multiplied, meaning that if a player has a running combo of eighteen blocks, and clears two lines at the same time using two blocks, they are awarded forty blocks (2(2+18)), or five full bonus lines.

Rather, the player controls a character (an egg) that has to grab the falling crates from the sky first, and then move to the position on the tower where they want to put the piece down. The player character can move sideways and jump, and combine the two to jump sideways. A jump can be prolonged by holding up on the control stick, and a fall can be sped up by holding down. The player character can also drop down from the tower, either landing in a hole or in the water below. The 'A' button activates a held crate (placing pieces/activating items), and the 'B' button discards held crates.
