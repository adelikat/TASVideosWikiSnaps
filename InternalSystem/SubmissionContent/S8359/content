		"Spider-Man
	]em
	", known more commonly as 
	[em 
		"Spider-Man 2000
	]em
	", is a 2000 action-adventure game developed by Neversoft, probably more well-known as the developer of the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games. It was the first Spider-Man to be done fully in 3D and in general still holds up rather well in terms of plotting and level design, unlike a few of its direct sequels.

		$LF

[div class=p 
	"Web swinging in this game on the surface appears a bit more rudimentary then what would become standardized with Spider-Man 2: The Movie: The Game, although the basics remain the same. Essentially, web swinging works by determining a point directly in front of Spidey as a 'swing target', and if Spidey is close enough to that target he will swing to it with a press of the R button.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"There's three variations of swinging: slow swinging, fast swinging, and web zipping. Slow swinging is when Spidey takes two webs to reach a target, and while slow and generally avoided it does allow for traversal without losing height. More common in the run is fast swinging and web zipping, however, as they're both very quick to execute. Fast swinging happens whenever a swing target is close enough to Spidey to be completed in one web swing, and web zipping can generally happen when Spidey is extremely close to a wall or floor while in a standing state, although there's some exceptions.

		"Clipping
		$LF
	]dt
]dl
[div class=p 
	"Clipping refers to a variety of methods used throughout the game in order to get out of bounds, but in the majority of cases refers to using Spidey's webs in unintended ways to push him out of bounds, be that via an object or holes in geometry. Essentially any indoor level is susceptible to clipping, and in many cases the loading trigger for the next level is present somewhere out of bounds, often independent of cutscenes that play before them.

		"Web Dome Ascension (WDA)
		$LF
	]dt
]dl
[div class=p 
	"For whatever reason, the N64 version of the game has a glitch that allows for Spidey to ascend when using a web dome on the edge of a platform. After ending the web dome, it's even possible to jump out of it since the game temporarily considers Spidey to be on the ground at the end of the animation. This is used in a few levels for traversal and out of bounds movement.

	"As this game is 3D, optimizing its movement is exponentially harder then it would be for a 2D game, especially considering factors such as lag and optimal angles to reach swing points the fastest. Thus, it's likely that there's still frames to shave off in every level, but doing so would take far more time then it's worth.

	"For any theoretical new skips, ideally a way to fully skip Subway would easily allow for a sub 20 minute time, although attempts to do so have so far been fruitless. The Black Cat cutscene at the end of Stopping the Fog would also ideally be skippable, but again attempts have been fruitless.
