	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"There is a glitch that allows going through a floor at a certain unintended spot (at screen {x7, y6} in the map linked above). The floor at that spot is special, because it is supposed to open after the princess is saved. However, the blob reacts to the floor already as if there was a gap. I feed the blob a jelly bean to form a bridge over the "pre-supposed gap" and then I cancel the bridge immediately. The game now thinks momentarily that there is no solid ground, because the blob bridge was canceled. This results the player falling through the floor. The glitch does not require that the blob makes the bridge over the exact spot where the imaginary gap is. It works even when the blob is off-screen, eats the bridge-forming jelly bean and cancels the bridge.
