	"Here is Mortal Kombat II at its finest.  This movie shows off some interesting combos, only some of the best glitched fatalities (can't fit them all), and a couple bugs in the enemies' AI.  This time around there is no code used nor is it played on the easiest difficulty, 'Very Easy'.  This movie aims for showing off as much of the game's aspects as possible so that's why it's much longer than the published one.

During waiting I decided to mess around with a manipulatable little Baraka.  You'll see that Baraka seems to be stuck in the ducking position which I believe happens because the invisible projectile is still in the air and because Baraka was busy blade swiping he is forced to try to duck under the projectile which never passes him, this isn't the last time I do this.  I take this time now to mess with a defenseless Baraka before I slam him to the ground and perform a Glitched Fatality.  Because I used Scorpion earlier this round, I use him again to 'Finish Him' which makes Baraka fly over a headless Scorpion (or so it seems.  His head is floating) but Baraka is still burned to a crisp.  Also it's the fatality that can be done anywhere so I do it as close as possible and it also always makes the 'Toasty' guy say Toasty at the end of the round rather than randomly.

Then I morph into Kintaro, punch the body in half, and the torso goes flying right into the invisible projectile which then distorts Jax's body and makes him sink further than the ground will let you stand.

Because I back Kitana up so far I justify the glitch starter really close to her and jump backwards waving my fist as if to laugh derisively at her and then complete the glitched fatality with Reptile's.

	"In order to start the glitched fatality you must be Johnny Cage (either as a morphing of Shang Tsung or just straight Johnny).  Then you must do his high knee bolt (which is <, v, >, High Punch) twice consecutively (one then the other on the first frames possible).  Now there is a trick to this and it is as follows:  you must be on the farthest side of the screen (you'll see that if both players are as far away from each other as possible that one is closer to being off the screen than the other, you want to be where that one is).  You'll know if it is done right when the second bolt doesn't appear from Johnny (in some cases, if you do the second one too early it doesn't work so it is always good to do the second one on the last possible frame).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Now to justify this glitch (make it easier to read where the invisible projectile is) you need Johnny Cage to do one of his Shadow moves (either the kick or uppercut).  Where ever Johnny lies, after the kick or uppercut, is roughly where the invisible projectile is.  Now to better know where it is you can either find it by having your opponent walk into it, ruining it or you can use fireball/projectile by either Shang Tsung, Liu Kang, Reptile, Sub-Zero, Kitana, Mileena, Baraka, Scorpion, and Rayden (for some reason Jax's doesn't work and I believe it ruins the glitch but I may be wrong).  That's all there really is to it besides positioning your victim.

[p 
	"You'll see a double friendship in this movie which is a bug in the game's programming.  The way to perform this is to use Scorpion and do his aerial throw on the second player (or first player) when they are very low on life.  Before they hit the ground start inputting the button combinations of either a friendship or babality with that falling victim.  Then finish the button combination on the correct frame in order for it to work.  Now that the victim is trying to make peace you can either kill them, do a friendship or babality (depending on if you didn't use any punch buttons.  Babalities and Friendships can only be done if don't use any punch buttons).  Thanks pirate_sephiroth for this great discovery.

]p
[p 
	"Some bugs of the enemy's AI I uncovered are pretty interesting and useful.  It seems if and when you are performing the glitch starter for glitched fatalities that you can get your opponent stuck in a ducking formation.  The easiest way to do it is to already have done the glitch starter (the two high bolt projectiles, consecutively) but then manipulate your opponent to throw a projectile or do a time costly move (Baraka's blade fury or Kitana's Fan lift).  When their projectile comes toward you ready the use of another high bolt (do the directionals but don't press high punch yet) and then when it hits you wait a few frames and then do the shadow kick.  By the time the CPU recovers they will have tried to duck the projectile but because it never passes them they are doomed to be stuck in the ducking position until they are struck.  They sometimes will still block attacks and may slam you but other than that they are mobile.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Another bug in the AI (which can be used in normal, non-glitched play) is the CPU is stuck backing up.  The way to do this is relatively simple it just takes a few tries.  First get you opponent a pretty good distance away from you (not too far though, my movie shows some of these instances so check it out to see it clearer).  They must be walking forward toward you in order for this to work.  Then on the correct frame jump towards them without doing anything.  If done correctly they should be stuck in a loop of backing up until you do something offensive.
