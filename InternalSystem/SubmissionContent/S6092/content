Rolan's Curse features a password system used as form of progress storage: instead of saving the data into the cartridge, the games gives you an 8-charater password that can be used to resume your game after resetting the console. Here is the data contained in the password:

Long story short, after the first six kills, the game will enter a loop that makes the third kill guaranteed to give a drop, and the sixth kill instead is guaranteed to never give one.

	"In this game, one can set arbitrary amount of hitpoints (and tweak other stats) using the in-game password system. The password serves to save the player's progress and automatically updates after every important event, allowing to return to the situation where you stopped playing. There is no trace of internally defined difficulty modes. Using the password to poke your stats can't serve as am objective difficulty mode. So just like there are movies using passwords to gain unfair advantage, this movie gains unfair disadvantage, which is even impossible to gain during normal play. This does make the game marginally more difficult, but the arbitrary nature of this setting at least means this movie can't go to Vault where this branch belongs.

So even if there was an in-game difficulty mode doing exactly what this movie does via the password, it wouldn't be considered justified. In addition, such a movie isn't different enough from the existing movies for this game, so even if it was entertaining, it wouldn't deserve a separate branch.
