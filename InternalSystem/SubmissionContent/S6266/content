	"The Lion King II is a bootleg mega drive game from china.  I first learned about this bootleg from jontron: https://youtu.be/0ghGWWfzq-o?t=332

[p 
	"after finally finding a working rom for this game, I started to tas it.  I didn’t expect to find some neat glitches with it (though I should have, considering it’s a bootleg)

	" Stage 1
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"a pretty straight forward level.  one trick I do at the end is a swipe hover.  if you continuously swipe in the air, you can delay your y movement, making your jumps longer.  I can do this to jump over walls.

	" Stage 2
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"I halt in a few places to do a standing jump instead of a running jump as it gives me enough height to jump on ledges, if you swipe when you do a standing jump you can get back up to speed.
	$LF

[p 
	"if you hold left and right when near a wall, you can clip into it.  this only works if you are clipping into a wall from the right side.  it skips a few areas where you have to climb up.
	$LF

[p 
	"near the end I was able to clip into a ceiling of the china wall which saved 500 frames from going the normal way.

[p 
	"straight forward as well, some areas where I clip into walls and the like.  not much to explain.

[p 
	"you cant enter any doors unless you kill all the enemies in the section you're in.  I take the closest path to the exit so I can clip into a wall and reach the exit

[p 
	"a nearly 4 minute auto-scroller with not much going on.  there are some blimps in this stage that are interesting to say the least.

	": This movie is pretty well optimized and makes good use of the poor programming that went into this game. The game appears to be well known enough and, as you pointed out, was featured on a very popular YouTube channel, so I would say it's notable enough to warrant publication.

	"As for the tier, this is a borderline case. The viewer feedback was somewhat limited but positive. There are some uninteresting parts, but I think the glitches are enough to push this over the edge, and the idea of a lion rapidly spinning to phase through walls delights me. Accepting for Moons.
