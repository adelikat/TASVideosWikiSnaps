		" Jumping to keep running / flying speed 
	]dt
	[dd 
		" When running full speed at mid-air, releasing "forward" will not slow you down until you touch the ground.  Similar to flying, the frame which you release will determine your actual speed, which can sometimes be faster than running.  By jumping on the first frame possible, this speed can be kept up, and the process can be continued as long as the level layout allows.  Similarly, when flying, let go of "Y" and you will keep flying speed, which can be maintained by jumping in the same fashion.
		$LF
		[dt 
			" Fast air-catching

			]dt
			[dd

				$LF
				[dt 
					" Floating through upward slopes 
				]dt
				[dd 
					" Similar to jumping or flying through stairs.  By holding an item and floating up at an angle shallower than the angle of the slope, it can be passed through.

Some pipes do not have this ground immediately available, and the key can be used as a temporary platform to allow access.  It's also possible to bring the key with you through the pipe by holding X or Y a frame before heading in the direction of the pipe.

	"A Quick Note About Lag
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Fadeout lag was not optimized in this run.  It's not noticeable to a casual watcher, and it does not lower the entertainment value of the run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Standard lag resulting from an overloaded SNES processor was generally optimized within the scope of each level.  Exceptions were made when something looked really cool, in order to make a long run like this more interesting.  It's possible that lag could be further reduced by playing previous levels differently, as the level lag in this game seems to be as random as the fadeout lag.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"For example, a stage in Water World was improved by 50 frames.  By the time the run was re-played (hex-editing didn't work due to different lag patterns within the levels) and caught back up to Sky World, it was actually 100 frames behind the previous run that included the Water World error, because many levels in Crystal Cavern had more lag, although they were played with the exact same strategy.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In this way, the goal was to optimize each level based on its "starting state".  It's possible that entering the level with a different starting state (based on the entire play of the game up to that point) may allow that particular level to be completed faster due to less lag, but that's a ridiculous goal to try and aim for in a run of this magnitude.  This also means that while some strategies may be technically faster, the lag they would cause makes them slower overall.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This also means that small improvements may or may not actually improve the length of the run as a whole, as far as the frame count goes.  A better method of measurement in this case would be the individual level timers.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Level-By-Level
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Answers to common specific questions on the run can be found here.  The time remaining and total time is shown for each level, along with additional comments for those who like detail.  Levels larger headings are recommended by the authors as the most interesting levels to watch.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Misty Island
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This world is played quite differently than the rest, mostly because Mario doesn't start out with a cape.  Several levels use a continuous jumping glitch to acheive speed slightly faster than running - a trick discovered by Flagitious.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" 1. Misty Island 1 (366/400)
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Pretty nice level to start things out, introducing a slightly less-forgiving level design, and also a group of Enemy-Only blocks.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"2. MISTY ISLAND 2 (258/300)
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The jumping glitch isn't used here until after bouncing over the pipe with the shell.  Using the jumping glitch beforehand doesn't gain enough time to make up for having to run back up to top speed, because a bit of steering to the left in midair is required to make it over the pipe.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" 3. Misty Island 3 (267/300)
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Fun stomping!  Ducking allows for coasting under the flying plant.  Grabbing the Flower here is more to put it in the reserve box for later - it saves a lot of time in the Desert Pyramid.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" 4. Misty Island 4 (Secret) (169/200)
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"A throwback to Super Mario 3, the secret exit is where you might expect.  Getting the cape here would require getting it before falling behind the white block, as Mario cannot contact other sprites after that, and it is slower than leaving it for the next level.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" 5. Misty Island 4 (177/200)
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Nothing really special to this level, except that it has the cape.  Using the goomba is quicker than using the koopa shell.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" 6. #1 Misty Castle (Secret) (376/400)
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"It's not possible to fly regular before spin-flying up to the top passage.  It's possible to gain flying speed once up there and jump to the pipe about 30 frames faster than was done here.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" 7. #1 Misty Castle (356/400)
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Sticking to the ceiling is fun!  It will be used many times throughout the run.  This level is pretty standard procedure, flying over, under, around and through (!) obstacles.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Desert World
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Now is when the game graphically starts to look like something you wouldn't find in Super Mario World.  This world contains one of the most well thought-out levels of the game: the pyramid.  The order the levels are done in seems strange, but was done to have the appropriate items in the reserve box for each level.  (There is one improvement to be made that was discovered since then - details in the individual levels.)
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" 8. Salty Isle (264/300)
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This level demonstrates a common frustration with flying - the screen doesn't follow Mario up after the initial ascent.  In fact, only a certain distance above the screen is available to travel off-screen as well.  Navigating through bricks and flying koopas can be difficult without the help of sight!
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" 9. Desert World 1 (369/400)
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Another normal level with some fun enemy bopping.  This is one of the many backgrounds used from Super Mario All-Stars.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"10. DESERT WORLD 2 (SECRET) (331/400)
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This level introduces a little fun with the key.  First, it is thrown and regrabbed to retain faster flight physics.  Later it is dropped to keep flying speed as long as possible before having to run up to speed again.  Near the P-switch, it is rebounded off the wall to keyjump off of.  From there it's a race back toward the beginning - note the walljump!
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"11. DESERT PYRAMID (SECRET) (566/700)
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Here is a good level to show off what the key can do.  The blue blocks in this game can only be destroyed with firepower, which was kept in the reserve box.  This route is around 30 seconds faster than going to the top section of the pyramid.  The end uses quite a few jumping tricks with the P-switch and key, and ended up looking pretty cool.  Also above the ceiling - flying, throwing, and regrabbing the key off-screen is a huge pain, but saves a lot of time.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" 12. Yellow Switch Palace (189/200)
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Yay, you can jump off these switches too!
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" 13. Desert Pyramid (627/700)
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This level is done out-of-order from the optimal map path, because soon afterwards, reserve firepower will be traded for a reserve feather.  The run is similar to the secret exit, up until passing by the key.  The P-switch is hit as late as possible without losing time - the coins to the right after diving down the shaft are normally a solid wall.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"It was later discovered that there was a way around this level order, so the walking taken from completing this level early is removable at the cost of 30 frames later, saving around 90 frames in total.

	$LF

[pre 
	$LF

[p 
	"At the end, the shell is taken to put a feather in the reserve box, which didn't cost any time.  Getting 50 stars cost 3 frames.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" 15. Desert World 3 (382/400)
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"A few frames were saved by grabbing the ice block off the pipe while jumping to fly.  Getting hit during flight doesn't slow Mario down, and makes the drop to the final pipe a bit faster.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" 16. Desert World 4 (358/400)
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Normally, this level requires activating two cloud lifts to slowly carry you through the level.  There are invisible coin blocks above this level, preventing flight over it.  Not a big deal, since it can be flown under.  And by taking the P-switch and jumping off of it, the first Pokey at the end of the level can be jumped, which allows flying speed to be kept.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"17. #2 DESERT CASTLE (SECRET) (243/300)
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"By flying down through the Enemy-Only blocks at a frame-perfect angle, they can be passed through.  The reserve feather is used in the second room to turn a near autoscroller into something much quicker.  The flight can be improved near the final spikes by about 30 frames.  Note how the ground-pound sends the koopa into the vine block, and then it is used to kick against the wall, and finally bounce off of.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"It was later realized that keeping the flower and switching to it just before running on the spikes would also put a feather in reserve, which in combination with the improvement over doing Desert Pyramid in the more optimal order, was the 90 frame timesaver.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Desert Secret
	$LF

[p

]p
[h3 
	"18. #2 DESERT CASTLE (250/300)
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Keeping the shell in reserve saves more time than using a Fire Flower on the boss.  The second room was replayed several times improving little parts, and the result is quite nice, as the final room is played very quickly, despite all the obstacles.  Also, the shell dropped at the end would kill that Thwomp if the door wasn't entered so quickly!
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Water World
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Water sure is a lot slower than land.  As a result, this world is less entertaining than the others.  A few timesaving tricks were still found, and having a bit of underwater action does add to the variety.  Optimal map paths have trips to Desert Secret inserted, because swimming with a shell is much faster than normal swimming.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" 19. Water World 1 (261/300)
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Using the shell here saves nearly 20 seconds, easily offsetting the time it took to get.  Not too much else to this level, although it's been played many times, and was a HUGE pain to optimize.  Different circumstances when entering the level could cause an improvement of 10 or so frames.  Also notice how when underneath the screen, the koopa escapes from his shell, but does not harm Mario.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The level wouldn't hex-edit, due to different lag/randomness.  Sometimes, hitting an enemy with the cape spin while holding an item ends up losing the item hitting the enemy, regardless of the frame used (unless you slow down a bit) due to randomness.  The problem arises later with cape spins in general - they don't always face a certain direction on the first frame (or any subsequent frames) of the spin.  It's more like this: Frame #n, if cape spun on, will have the cape animation in this certain way, regardless if it's the beginning or end of a spin.  It can be a pain.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"When holding an item, it isn't necessary to hold forward to have forward velocity.  The game must use that as a check when floating toward an incline, because it allows for a huge shortcut in this level.  Dropping the key also helps reverse the momentum quicker, a trick discovered by Stefan.

The animated backgrounds cause so much lag that the strategy for completing these levels is often based on what causes lag and what doesn't.  In this way, the levels are measurable by their frame count or by the timer count, depending on whether or not you think lag should "count".

The pipe at the beginning prevents Yoshi from entering the level, so the only solution is to fly through the whole thing, which turned out looking very cool.

A coin is taken near the beginning, this is to leave the way open later when a P-switch turns those to blocks.  There are around 200 frames of avoidable lag - a fish near the beginning wasn't killed (due to that cape-spin randomness) and ended up causing lag when backtracking to get the silver P-switch.  (Although this lag also made the P-switch last longer than it should have, so it may not save as much time as thought) There are small improvements to be made when traveling near the top of the level as well.  The section with the blue P-switch and beetle ended up looking pretty good.

Finally, the shell and P-switch are thrown, and the shell is bounced off of, while the P-switch is regrabbed, and the pipe is entered in midair.

	"This level heavily abuses the "fast climbing" glitch, the result of which is very similar looking to the fast climbing in SMB2.  In several places, the screen has to catch up, so normal climbing must be resumed.  In other places, the screen can be tricked into continually trying to catch up with Mario by standing on high ground for more than one frame.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"On the first 25 floors, there is a lot of spinjump flying.  This is because the exits to many of the floors are on the opposite side at the entrance, and so speed must be kept as much as possible to prepare for the next floor.  Since it's not necessary to fly here, catching ground for a brief moment is not a problem, and the screen follows while zooming up the chains.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"On 26-50, the story is different.  There are munchers on many of these floors and flying regular from chain to chain is the fastest way (usually).  This means normal climbing must be used to let the screen catch up at times, because if Mario lands, he loses his flying.  Whenever there is solid ground,  re-flying was tested to see if it was faster or not (since the screen will automatically catch up while running).  Sometimes it was, sometimes it wasn't.  Much of the action is above the screen on this section as well, which had the benefit of flying through areas with less lag, or less enemies on the screen (Thwomps were often avoided this way).  For example, on the 40th floor, a walljump was used to reach the chain, and moments later, a Thwomp stomps down from where this took place.  This works because the screen is frozen at a position where the Thwomp has not yet been loaded into the level.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"51-75 wasn't as bad.  The first 10 floors are just pipes.  There are several points where spinflight is used to hit the ceiling.  This isn't a mistake, it's used to affect the duration of the flight later, so that landing on the above ledge happens as early as possible.  After flying a bit, the screen scrolls up for a few floors, unable to catch Mario, because the chains allow for climbing faster than the screen can scroll.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"76-100 is a nightmare to play.  If you want to see it better in the emulator, turn off transparency effects (the '9' key).  There is much more lag in this section than the other 3, which makes frame-precise jumping up the chains much more tedious.  Floors 80-87 have areas that seem improvable individually, but keeping flight until the end is the most beneficial way to do them as a whole, which requires slowing down on floors 80 and 84.  The last 10 floors fly by, the screen desperately trying to catch Mario.
