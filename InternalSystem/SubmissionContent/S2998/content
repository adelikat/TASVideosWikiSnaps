	": The majority found this less entertaining than the previous movie, and I have to agree. I felt the previous movie had more fluid combos, demonstrated more stage specific fatalities, an additional glitch fatality... While the continuing to move after the round was interesting, it doesn't outweigh the others. Rejecting.
