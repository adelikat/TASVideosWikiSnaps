	"in this run Shinnok use to become other characters and combos vary slightly, there are also new ones that have been found to: Two Men Down, continue moving after finishing the round, camera glitch and many more and playing Master II as the destiny.

	": The majority found this less entertaining than the previous movie, and I have to agree. I felt the previous movie had more fluid combos, demonstrated more stage specific fatalities, an additional glitch fatality... While the continuing to move after the round was interesting, it doesn't outweigh the others. Rejecting.
