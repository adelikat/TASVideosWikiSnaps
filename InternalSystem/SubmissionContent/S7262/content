This time, I implemented glitches that save time as many as possible while forgoing any forms of out of bounds, wall zipping/clipping. I made this TAS on experimental core but I didn't see any critical different emulations so I decided to submit. It syncs on Bizhawk 2.7.0 too.

The core choice, to me, was never an issue unless it lacked determinism, and given that I was easily able to sync all 3 hours of this movie, it gets a pass from me. It may still be listed as experimental in BizHawk, but I see no reason not to accept runs that use it from now on unless major problems arise. The trickier thing is the glitching, particularly the sprite over glitch, which one could consider as stretching the definition of "inbounds" with the way it ends up being used.

While it does remove progress barriers at a few points using the sprite over glitch, these barriers are naturally removed as part of the game's normal progression anyway. In a way, I'd say this glitch is on the same sort of level as the stutter stepping used in the published run, in that it simply finds a new way
