	"The Brood, an ancient race of dragons, is all but extinct. Their power was so strong that they had to be killed. A, the last one of the Brood, is awaken after 400 years and he wants to know more about his people.

[p 
	"Well aware of his fearful power, A uses it until he becomes strong enough to rely on his physical power. After which he manipulates luck to an indecent extent, using frame-by-frame advance to pulverize his foes, and even the final boss. It may be a little anti-climactic, but it's much quicker this way

	"So, this is my first PSX submission. This was also the very first PSX RPG I ever played. Although not as interesting as BOF 2, BOF 3 is still a good game, with interesting plot twists, a good soundtrack and customizable characters through masters (although only onw, Bunyan, is shown).

		" Althought fights can't be totally avoided, they can be greatly delayed. For some reason, walking along the edge of the screen keeps the monsters away. Also, in very narrow corridors, using the defense stance keeps the party from engaging combat (is it a glitch?). Finally, starting to walk one frame before a combat would otherwise occur delays the combat. Sometimes, the party can start running again without fighting. This explains the sometimes weird walking patterns I sometimes take

		" Although A (Ryu) is a dragon, he never uses his power after getting his revenge on Balio and Sunder. Instead, he uses Super Combo, a technic taught by his master Bunyan (who makes A a killing machine with higher attack). Normally, the most skilled players would be able to press 7-10 buttons one after the other in order to attack foes. But thanks to frame-to-frame advance, the skill can be pushed to its limit (32 hits). When the button is pressed influences the amount of damage

		" Dodai : Momo had to start the fight. Her ice chrysm makes a lot of damage. Also, she learns blind (for later) and double blow to speed up the fight. When the Dodai is almost done, A comes in, uses the Ivory dice from the Tower and doubles his level!
