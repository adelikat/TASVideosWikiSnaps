	"So a couple days ago, MarioAtWork submitted their nice run of this game, and admitted in the submission text that they knew there were secret Cans of Beans! But couldn't find one of them, and so didn't know what they unlocked. Their run made the game look fun, and I had ideas of where to look for dem beans. So, interest piqued, I downloaded the rom from the owner's website and played through it myself. I;m thinking about Thos beans

	"I found all of the cans and the minigame they unlock. Not too special on its own--but I did stumble across a few engine quirks that could be used to make a slicker, faster run. Agonizing over the thought of the world missing out on these amazing findings that will finally make me popular, I decided I had to make a 100% run of this neat little homebrew. It's a quick, snappy experience I enjoyed, even if I keep mentally replacing the words "Jacked Up" in the title with something else by accident

	"Pressing A as you land can cause the game to react like you jumped without your character actually leaping into the air. Spikes flip and rotating coins move. If you're jumping up through a passable floor, the time frame is long enough that turboed presses can cause multiple flips without a single actual jump, though this usually will just cause more lag with less practicality. This trick can also be done on the very first frame of any level--I guess the game considers you airborne for exactly one frame before you can start jumping.
	$LF
	"If the block you're landing on will have spikes on it after the flip, you can walk right through them without being affected! Note that spikes attached to blocks nearby that don't flip will not allow you to walk through them also, though.
	$LF
	"So in a game based around spikes flipping with every jump you take, you can imagine how manipulating game states without forcing your character into the air can change up level strategies and speed things up quite a bit.

	"If you are inside a block, the game will force you out. If you are at almost the height of a platform that you can jump through and start to fall, the game will force you up onto the platform. If you do the latter in a spot where a you will be forced into a solid wall, the game won't make both checks, and you can sit in the wall if you don't move left or right. Jumping will have the block force you upwards out of itself, usually straight inside another block. Repeat this enough times, and the game can even force you completely out of bounds! Unfortunately, I was only able to find two places in the whole game where this trick can be used: During the second stage of the final level, which takes exactly the same amount of frames as just jumping normally, and during stage 6, which takes you out of bounds to where you can not make your way back inside, softlocking you until you bring up the start menu and restart or exit the stage. I have included a gif of that second usage for the reader's perusement and amusement:

	"The first use of the Landing Spike Swap occurs after the first jump here--by bringing up the spikes early, I can make sure they disappear when I make my actual jump, giving me more space to touch the coin and the ground sooner.

	"One thing to understand about screen-wrapping is that the game doesn't keep your x or y coordinate when it wraps you. It snaps you to a nearby grid coordinate. This can make movements awkward as in most pits or tunnels, it doesn't matter where your character is, they will always come out the other side in exactly the same spot. However, your character does maintain their x/y momentums, though! so in some cases it is wise to get your aerial drift speed to max before you fall through the screen, saving frames on the other side even though you appear in the same location as otherwise. 30 frames saved.

Typically the ideal path here is to walk away from the coin that starts in the center, and jump towards the rightside will it will magically appear in front of you. However, I found that by doing a First Frame Landing Spike Swap, then jumping, then doing a Landing Spike Swap while still close enough to the ground for the game to think I might be landing, I was able to manipulate the coin through all three possible locations for this stage, and right within range of my jump! 18 frames saved off a 58 frame stage.

Usually, coins are too far apart for this to matter, but here, the top two coins can be placed so close together that you'll collect one and fall right through the other emptyhanded.

I redid every level so many times--every time I walked away for ten minutes, an idea would spring to my head and I'd have to go back and implement it. This game would not be so painful to resync if the lag wasn't so stupid and unpredictable. Honestly, if someone else figures out how to reduce lag as much as possible, they could save a bunch of frames over my run. At this point that's just an extra layer of complexity to this TAS onion that I'm not going to cry over chopping out.
