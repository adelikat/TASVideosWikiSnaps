	"One Button Vania is a Flash game released in 2014 that was developed by Tommy Nordered and composed by Michael Marhal. It follows the story of a knight who gets recruited by a clown (I know he's a jester but the game calls him a clown) to collect the medals and save humanity! But as it turns out, the clown was manipulating you into collecting the medals in order for him to become powerful, you then have to defeat him in a battle to save the world.

	"The main appeal of this game is the fact that every action, from jumping and swinging your sword, all the way to random stuff like growing flowers are done only using a single button (that being the mouse click). This may sound like an uninteresting game to speedrun, but it gets way crazier than you might expect!

	"The game has a specific route, that being: First the fire area, then the water area, then the wind area and finally the green area. Without using glitches, the only possible deviation from this route is that you can tackle the water area whenever you want. The route I take has some differences: Normally, you can't get to the wind area without the Lantern, but by using a clip in the fire area, I was able to enter it just fine, this only means that I have to do the wind area before the green area. Not only that, but due to a glitch that uses the cloud that allows me to do the water area faster, it's also better to go to the water area after the wind area. The route I end up taking is: Fire -> Wind -> Green -> Water, I decided to do the water area last because of a music glitch that would be annoying to hear throughout the rest of the run.

		[dd 
			" This is the first boss that is RNG dependent, the positions where he teleports are completely random, and they can only be manipulated through time. I tried to take the most optimal path possible through the light posts, but the most optimal path was impossible due to the fact that he teleported midway through the path, forcing me to go through a slower path.

				"This boss is just a simple race, I tried making it as fast as I could, but if there's one area that could possibly be improved, it's this boss. I tried skipping it by clipping into the ceiling, but there's an invisible wall that just drops you to the left side, softlocking you until the Eye wins the race.

				[dd 
					" The least interesting boss, I just drop as early as possible every time. However, in the first hit, I somehow found a way to slow down the Knight in the last jump, allowing me to jump earlier and save three frames, I could now find a way to do this for the other hits.

					[dd 
						"The only boss fight to be skipped. The way the actual fight works is that there are mines dropping from five holes, and what you have to do is go to these holes and lure the skeleton into attacking you, making it unintentionally hitting the mines, it wouldn't have been a long boss fight, but skipping it is obviously faster.

						[dt 
							"The Clown

						[dd 
							" The final boss is pretty interesting. The way it works it that one the three points in his hat will randomly flash, and you have to hit them with your sword to damage him, every time you damage him this repeats until he dies. If you take too long, a different point will start to flash. The thing that makes this fight unique isn't the problem of hitting the points as fast as possible, the problem is moving in a way so that you can hit them on the first frame possible, I was able to do this almost every time, aside from the first one and one where I unfortunately had to wait a few frames.

	[dd 
		"In this game, the walls, ceiling and floor don't extend past the loading zones, that means if you find a way to enter these areas, you can do some wild stuff, one of the examples in the TAS is the lantern skip in the fire area, where by using a shield, I'm able to prolong the time spent out of bounds, allowing me to go through an area I was not supposed to enter yet.

			"Loading position manipulation

		[dd 
			"By jumping or landing from a jump before a loading zone on some areas, you can enter the next room higher or lower, which opens the gates for potential tricks. Unfortunately (depending on how you look at it) it ended up being used way less that I thought it would. The jumping version was used to enter the wind area without the lantern, and the landing one was only used in the beginning area for playaround.
			$LF
			[dt 
				"Floor clip in the beginning
			]dt
			[dd 
				"The second floor clip in the beginning area is very odd, this is because of the fact that if you land from a jump, you'll sometimes clip through the floor. My theory is that the platform is really thin, and the gravity is strong enough to push you down to the point of clipping through the floor, it didn't save time, but it looked cool.
				$LF
				[dt 
					"Ceiling clip/Upwarp
				]dt
				[dd 
					"This is definitely the most useful glitch in the game, it allows for many tricks to be performed, but first, I should explain how it works. The first step is to enter inside of a ceiling from below, this can be done in many ways, those being using the cloud, swimming, using the flowers or even just regular jumping. When successfully performed, two things can happen: You either change direction, which is already useful, and clipping through ceiling, these are called "upwarps". When you enter a ceiling from below far enough, the game warps you to the top of said ceiling, and there's no limit for how high it could be (I got upwarps as high as three screens). This is used a lot of times in the run, it allows for the much faster completion of the underwater area.

However, I don't really count this as time loss, mostly because it's something completely out of your control and has nothing to do with the TASing process.

I could've used the shield to delay the entrance to the arena frame by frame, allowing me to manipulate the boss without wasting too much time and allowing me to do the better path.

			[dd 
				" By jumping in a corner, you sometimes get pushed slightly to the direction you were walking. I only started using them in the green area, but since each corner boost only saves a frame and the fact that they are only possible sometimes, this means it wouldn't have saved much time if I knew it from the beginning.

I was unable to replicate this, and after some testing, I figured out that it was an issue in Ruffle itself that prevented me from performing it, I was forced to use a slower (but still fast) method for clipping. This trick is only possible on the standalone Flash Player. It would save roughly half a second.
