	"Nine of your best men are suddenly trapped by an enemy attack, using force fields. Your only hope is to find a way to deactivate them. But the pursing enemy forces don't have a perfect plan, as they have laid out security consoles, that grant access to these variant force fields. The only problem...is that they are hard to find, in the winding maze-like caves. Its up to you, to locate these console for the necessary security clearness . But watch out! Aliens are all around and have come to take you down, as they exert their authority over your mining operation. The stronghold of the enemy has risen, and you must prevail! - NYMX (I had to come up with something, since I can't find an article. LOL)

	"Here is an awesome game that I never knew anything about. Every since the cancellation of the magazine series, Compute! decided to let the Gazette continue alongside the parent series. Eventually, they would start disk only issues...eliminating the need for typing in any programs published that month. I never knew about this disk series, and I'm saddened by this...as I would have loved it when this game came by. It is amazing!!

My original attempt, which was finished and about to be submitted, was played out as the game was intended. No glitches, but utilizing deaths to help navigate the caverns a bit quicker. As I searched for more frames, I ran into a strange occurrence and saw my ship clip a platform. I was asking myself, "Why did that happen?". After continuing, I started to see more of this...because I was doing all that I can to cut more time. Eventually, I saw a number of things that was happening that led to me finding a way to clip and pass through walls...thus glitching the game out in a number of places.
