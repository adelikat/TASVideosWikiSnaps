	"Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike is the notable rendition of the closing of a great series as a whole. It's well known for it massive juggle combos from EX moves and regular ones, late 90's competitions, great music, and fun characters to play as.

	"I ridicule the AI in most fights even so much at one point making them looking like they are the player, and I'm the CPU. I exploit hitboxes and make them miss attacks from Twelve's location compared to theirs.

	"Pretty much every fight does have some AI ridculation, but my fave that I put was Hugo's and Q's. It's funny watching a grab only attack character trying to to grab you numerous times and miss.

[p 
	"I cancel some of their moves from grabs or certain attacks.

[p 
	"There is heavy luck manipulation that most of my fighting TAS work has so I never get blocked or parried unless it's intentional for a certain reason to get an attack in. Well I let you in on it.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"For most of the fighting games. The enemies have no ability of seeing of where you are like we do. It's Only thing they know of is boundaries. Different characters have bigger or smaller one's depending on attacks. If you are in their boundary they will attack or block. If you are not they'll go to your pre determined one based on what the game provides that character. Another luxury they have is reading inputs. This is another thing that can be used at your advantage to confuse the enemy.

[p 
	"Pixel perfect distances gives the AI some fogginess of whether you can attack or not. This where linking a nice combo, super, special or juggle comes in. Instead of relying on just a corner to do your bidding.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Jumping forward and backward makes them either lunge forward at you or wait for you at the bottom to hit you. Missing a special or trapping yourself can make the AI initiate a super regardless of it is smart or not to do so. However missing any regular attack does not. I tried that with Dudley on my own time and no matter what attack I did he would not bait his corkscrew blow to a parry except a special which I can't parry from trapped frames.
