	"For most of the fighting games. The enemies have no ability of seeing of where you are like we do. It's Only thing they know of is boundaries. Different characters have bigger or smaller one's depending on attacks. If you are in their boundary they will attack or block. If you are not they'll go to your pre determined one based on what the game provides that character. Another luxury they have is reading inputs. This is another thing that can be used at your advantage to confuse the enemy.

	"Jumping forward and backward makes them either lunge forward at you or wait for you at the bottom to hit you. Missing a special or trapping yourself can make the AI initiate a super regardless of it is smart or not to do so. However missing any regular attack does not. I tried that with Dudley on my own time and no matter what attack I did he would not bait his corkscrew blow to a parry except a special which I can't parry from trapped frames.
