[p 
	[em 
		"Zoda's Revenge: Startropics 2
	]em
	" is the 1994 sequel to Nintendo's 
	[em 
		"Startropics
	]em
	" published in 1990.  The game is set a few years after the events of the first: Mike has moved back to Seattle, Steve has resumed his work, puzzling over the things he found in the first game, and the alien children are living back on C-Island.  One day, Mica contacts Mike via telepathy to tell him about a weird dream she had.  This sets Mike on a time travelling adventure, meeting a handful of generically famous people, in order to gather together several magical Tetris pieces that have some connection to Argonia.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Aside from the change in tone and setting, the mechanics were also given an overhaul.  The overworld sections are virtually unchanged, and the dungeons are presented similarly, but the dungeon controls are very different.  Mike is no longer restricted to moving within a grid, can walk and attack in 
	[del 
		"nine
	]del
	" eight directions, and is given two main weapons to upgrade instead of one, the Blade and the Shockwave.  The first, which I'll call your Blade weapon, has a slower attack rate and limited range, but does more damage per attack and does not downgrade when you take damage.  The second, the Shockwave, has a longer range and faster firing rate, but does less damage per attack, and gets downgraded when you take damage.  These two are supplemented by limited-use weapons picked up in the dungeons.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Personally, I regard this game as vastly inferior to the first, but that's a different discussion.  At least it makes for a decently good TAS.

		"Improvements

[p 
	"This movie completes the game 22,715 frames faster than Sami's record.  Improvements come from new shortcuts, better combat strategies and choice of weapons, new bugs, and greater overall precision.
