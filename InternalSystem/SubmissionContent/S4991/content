	"I have finish test this movie about two questions by mklip2001. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The first question: "Why do you get the green dinosaur at the end of World 1? Is it faster than the red dinosaur?"
	$LF
	"Answer: The red fright boss is 25 frame hit 2 HP, the green fright boss is 43 frame hit 4 HP, and red is too high, have some place eat fruit. Crucially, two places need to discover hidden egg, green it will come out, and red need two times.

	"My English is bad, so I make a video to show.

	$LF

[p 
	"The second question:" In the last world, there's a cave stage where you ride up a cloud to skip the rest of the stage. However, at that point, you're really close to the exit anyway, so I would guess that the cloud-riding animation takes longer. How much time does that cloud save? "
	$LF
	"Answer:I compared the if I skip two routes. The results are surprisingly similar. But in fact, you provide the route of the save the 2 frames.
