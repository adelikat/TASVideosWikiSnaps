Furthermore, once depleted or under 25%, the boost meter will start filling back up to 25% where you'll be able to use your boost again. This 25% threshold is also very important because at the start of each subsequent "auto-scroller", you are unable to start moving until you can boost. So ideally, you want to finish the first two "auto-scrollers" with 25% boost to be able to move immediately on the next "auto-scroller".

	": This is a well done TAS. However, the action does get somewhat stale and repetitive over time, with large parts of the action really just coming down to repetitively jumping over or through places. Ultimately, there's just not much in the way of creative action or movements that would make a movie like this really stand out. The lukewarm viewer response also seems to reflect this. On the whole, it's not really enough to make a Moon - as such, accepting for the Vault.
