	": This run begins from a snapshot for no apparent reason which is against our rules. It uses a hack, and therefore that also is being judged. While the hack seems like a cute Mario game for casual gamers, it does not seem to offer much in TASing potential. Hacks need to standout by making very encompassing use of the game engine, and provide a unique experience. As for the run itself, it looks like it can use a lot more work. I don't know this hack well, so my perception may be inaccurate, but with some more effort, it should be possible to cut it down to under three minutes. Reception has also been very poor. Rejecting.
