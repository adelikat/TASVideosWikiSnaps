	"The main goal of this run was to get everything in the game (100% completion) as fast as possible. Getting all the items (even though I don't use most of them) is necessary to acheive the "good" ending, and also makes for a more entertaining video, I believe. My main chances to shine were during boss fights. The bosses in this game are (for the most part) highly manipulatable, making many of the normally frustrating bosses look extremely simple.

Hippogriff 1 was probably the fight that I spent the most time on in this entire run. He usually flies up and out of range, but after several long attempts, I finally got him not only to stay down where I could hit him, but not attack at all, and die close to the ground.

Ovnunu comes out of the slime when the mini-eyes are destroyed, and only when his pulsing slime reaches its midpoint, giving me a bit of leeway with how fast I kill the mini-eyes. I use Ground Gargoyle because his standing shot (as opposed to his jumping shot; you'll probably notice the difference) is twice as powerful as the normal fireball.
