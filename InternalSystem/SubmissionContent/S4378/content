		" Stage 6 - There are conveyer belts that speed you to the right or slow you down so I take these into account. Here I use a glitch, where holding up-left while jumping right for some reason allows Elmo to pass through the platforms that would normally block him from below. I use it twice here for a nice time save.

		" Stage 7 - Pretty straightforward, just go right and avoid damage. I do barely make the jump over the butterfly though.

		" Stage 8 - Just a matter of jumping to the top of the building. There doesn't seem to be any clever way to shortcut there from the left or below or anything.
