I was not able to really manipulate the elevator patterns as it seems they move on some fixed timer and they were moving pretty much like they were in the old run.

Not too many to make it repetitive and enough to show off some of the difficulty that the game offers. When I began TASing this run, I thought that the first level is sufficent for showing what the game has to offer. So, if you people and the judges think, that one level is enough, here's a shorter version of the TAS:
