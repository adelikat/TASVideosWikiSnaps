	" In the case this movie gets published, I must let you all know that the in-game music will get copyright claimed if an encode gets uploaded to YouTube. The temp encode had to be edited to accomodate this (yes, GameStop couldn't afford making their own generic chiptune music for this game, either that or they were too lazy).

	"This TAS forgoes the use of an exploit in Flash Player. By utilizing the Ctrl + Enter hotkey, it basically skips the whole game straight to the ending cutscene in about 2 seconds. I couldn't get that to work on ruffle anyways, but I thought it was worth pointing out.

	"Careful health management and damage boosting is pretty important here. You only have 4 hearts, but you can pick up hearts throughout both levels. Even still I deliberately choose not to take damage from certain enemies so I can get damage boosted later on in the second area. The first falling carrot in the first area will push you back, while the second one will boost you forward. The same thing applies for the falling stalactites in the second area. I have to slightly slow down during the first falling obstacles due to this. I slow down slightly during the rising bubble segment in the first area, otherwise I would've died due to the fact I couldn't land on the second bubble earlier. Momentum from damage boosts can't really be preserved for longer even when in midair, at least from my initial testing.

	"At the end of the first area, you have to dig a hole at a specific spot, while the Duolingo owl's evil older brother starts attacking you. In the second area, you have a proper boss fight against this bird. He moves in the same oval like pattern everytime, so there's nothing you can do to speed up or slow down the fight. The objective is to make sure the stalactites fall down onto the boss. I make the thing fall as soon as possible. Do this 3 times, and the boss is dead, opening the path to the treasure room.

	"You want to enter the little tunnel at the end while running at full speed. Slowing down (by either turning at above a certain frame window, or just stop pressing the left or right key) is not wanted, and another way this happens is when I hit a wall. So running at full speed instead of hugging the wall is faster; about 4 frames faster, in fact.
