	"S.T.U.N. Runner was a 1989 arcade racing game developed by Atari Games. The goal is to race through futuristic race tracks that consists of a lot of tubes while dodging obstacles out to slow you down and time you out. The main selling point of the arcade game was

	" which gives an extra level of immersion. This Atari Lynx port was released in 1991 by Atari Corporation and retains a lot of the game's mechanics and experience, outside of losing analog control and a few mechanical bits. This submission is about the Lynx port of the game.

	"Many months ago, I made a preliminary TAS of the game just going through all of the levels from the start. Towards the end I found an important enemy manipulation technique that helped maintain speed. However, the first instance of implementing that was close to the start of the game so that meant redoing most of the game from scratch. As that was demotivating, I occasionally went back to fix up a level to then proceed to drop it for weeks. Once 2025 rolled around, thanks to the 2024 TASVideos Awards showed that a grand total of

	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Atari|href=/6223M)
	" 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=publications|href=/6282M)
	" were made. Since that didn't quite sit with me in terms of a big chunk of gaming being underrepresented, I finally sat down and finished up implementing the improvements and resyncing the RNG to make a version of the S.T.U.N. Runner TAS that I was happy with.

	"The best way to maintain speed when not boosting is to be in the center of the road as much as possible. This avoids the curved sides of the road as this always reduces the speed of the car. I'm pretty sure this isn't how it works in the arcade version. Also worth noting that there are some situations where getting on the side is done to avoid something that would slow down the car further, mostly with the parts of the track with missing road bits.

	"Shockwaves destroy all enemies and most hazards in front of the car and some bit ahead of the car. The game starts the player with none and must be earned. There are some tracks that have a shockwave or two but not enough to stock up. The main way to stock up on shockwaves is to reach the star quota on a track. This makes collecting stars important as it allows for getting though some situations without losing any speed. This can't be done on all tracks as some quotas can't be met without getting on the sides of tubes and slowing down.

While it's possible to  prevent them from shooting there's situations where no manipulation can be done to avoid getting hit by the homing missile. This makes shockwaves invaluable for getting them off screen as soon as possible as aiming the car's gun up to shoot only works if the flying ship is close, which is the distance where the homing shots would've already missed.

While there's also the Marlboro game on the Lynx that I could've done, I can't personally make a TAS that advertises cigarettes.
