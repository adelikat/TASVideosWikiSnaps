	"Fun note: I discovered a soft lock! When fighting Gouki, kill him on the second round, and press any 4 buttons on all 3 frames before the PERFECT would flash. The timer freezes, noone can move and a second player can no longer join the game. It essentially turns your arcade cabinet into a jukebox.

Most of the matches were the exact same thing over and over again: Combo opponent into corner, juggle them with claps, end with a super. That's not the most entertaining thing in the world. It could, technically, be a decent speed strategy, but you weren't aiming for speed, with all of the parrying/blocking and the long, unbroken combos and juggling opponents after death. So it fails to be a playaround and it fails to be a speedrun. In the future, spend longer than a day on your TASes, don't just knock out one after another and hope that people will eventually warm up to them. You have re-records: Use them! There's at least one moment per minute that just feels like you worked with the first thing you got rather than even attempt to get anything different: The biggest offender was the Hugo mirror match that completely broke near the last hit. Why?

This may be a step forward from the last two submissions, but that step forward is still a long way behind something we'd publish. Good luck.
