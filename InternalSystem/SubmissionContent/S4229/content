	"This is yet another Sonic Advance run and yes, it is with Knuckles again! This is a 576 frame improvement over the previous run. While it doesn't make use of the Ultra Dash, it also uses its fair share of glitches that gives Knuckles a pretty good chance at beating the game in record time.

[p 
	"Angel Island 1 is one of three levels where a glitch had to be exploited for a faster time. It also the only death in the run. There is a change in the beginning of the level which lead to a faster path to the loop where the glitch is used.

	$LF

[p 
	"Ohh Egg Rocket, how I still and forever will hate you so! This run made use of a glitch that pushes Knuckles through the floor and causes the level to lose solidarity. Thus making it possible to complete it in one go.

]h4
[p 
	"This is where I use a glitch that I had found a glitch which causes Knuckles to be pushed above the cannon and eject myself out of the wall and make it into the boss area, thus putting me close to 4 seconds faster than the last attempt.
