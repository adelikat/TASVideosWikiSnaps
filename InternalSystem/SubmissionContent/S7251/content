	" discovered last year saves nearly 5 minutes on its own, and that wasn't anywhere near the only new trick discovered since Karaage's TAS. It's hard to even compare the two runs because of the sheer number of new timesaves found over the past 4 years. I watched both runs side-by-side up through Chapter 2, and nearly every stage I watched between the two runs has a new route, a new skip, a new method of performing a skip, tons of little things that should be adding up to a lot more time save than this, but are ultimately moot because of the suboptimal movement all throughout the run. Some of the movement and strategies in this TAS are behind even current RTA standards: The Fracktail fight was pointed out as being full

	"Just beating the previous full game time using new strategies is not enough. Every individual section, every room, every text box, every little bit of movement should at least match the best known run. A TAS like this, one of a complicated and technical game of considerate length, should not be rushed. Study each run you can find (both other TASes and RTAs, even non-WRs) and make sure you're not losing any time to them, redo each little section over and over until you can't possibly improve it any more, ensure that every single thing you do is as fast as the game will allow. It takes a while, but it's definitely doable.
