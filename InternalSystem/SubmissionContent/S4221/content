	"I started this project thanks to Barhunga, he asked if I want to TAS this game (knowing I'm TASing SMB2) and I decided to give it a try. Right in the beginning keylie joined the project too and the progress was really fast all the way to the end. I probably wouldn't have been able to do this without the huge effort from keylie and diddykong14 and the support from Barhunga, for keeping me sane. I had a really great time TASing this game, probably the best time I will have for a long while. It's a bit sad it's over now, I will really miss working with these people. :( Anyway, it feels very unreal I was able to handle a project like this (two of them at the same time, actually) and get it finished.

	"I started to work on this TAS after seeing Nahoc’s amazing WIPs and the great potential this game has for TAS. After doing a few stages, however, I realised how hard TASing this game was, mainly because of manipulating collisions. Also, the level of optimisation on the human-made ILs was very high, it was difficult to beat the WR times on many stages.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Anyway, the TASers from SMB2 came to this game, and everything was much easier to handle. byrz did an amazing job to coordinate the TAS, by providing savestates and grabbing WR times and videos in a nice spreadsheet. I had issues with desyncs because I used the 32-bit version of Dolphin, and the movie file made to work on the 64-bit version, so the savestates were really useful.
