	"Trojan is a kinda simple game. You play as this great warrior who has faboulus powers. Basically this means he can walk forward and strike enemies with his sword. He also has a shield and the power to jump.
	$LF
	"Despite the fact that it is simple I really like this game. It's sort of hard because you are limited to a few movements but it's still not that hard to control.

	"It's been more or less a year now since I started with time attacking. I really sucked back then ;)

[p 
	"This run is almost a minute faster than my previous run which I thought was pretty good. It was not apparently.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The improved time is basically from better boss fights. I used new strategys against every boss and also manipulated some of them to act like I wanted.
	$LF

[p 
	"The second last boss, King Shriek, is a bit different than the others because before he/they appear they toss small stones all over the place. I didn't want to get hit by the stones but I made sure I could strike the boss/es as soon as possible, thus it resulted in some necessary waiting there. Also, they are not vulnerable before they come out from the wall so the waiting is necessary anyway.

[p 
	"I make two stops to pick up power upgrades. This is good because it allows me to spank bosses really fast and it's worth it. Where I pick up the second I also gets a speed upgrade for the rest of that stage.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Oh, in stage 1-2, where I pick up the first power icon you might see a small delay. This is caused bu an invisible wall. However, any other thing that I tested was slower than this and also it's good for avoiding that mini-boss.
