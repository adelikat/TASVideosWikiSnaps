	"Trojan is a kinda simple game. You play as this great warrior who has faboulus powers. Basically this means he can walk forward and strike enemies with his sword. He also has a shield and the power to jump.
	$LF
	"Despite the fact that it is simple I really like this game. It's sort of hard because you are limited to a few movements but it's still not that hard to control.

	"The improved time is basically from better boss fights. I used new strategys against every boss and also manipulated some of them to act like I wanted.

	"The second last boss, King Shriek, is a bit different than the others because before he/they appear they toss small stones all over the place. I didn't want to get hit by the stones but I made sure I could strike the boss/es as soon as possible, thus it resulted in some necessary waiting there. Also, they are not vulnerable before they come out from the wall so the waiting is necessary anyway.

	"I make two stops to pick up power upgrades. This is good because it allows me to spank bosses really fast and it's worth it. Where I pick up the second I also gets a speed upgrade for the rest of that stage.

	"Oh, in stage 1-2, where I pick up the first power icon you might see a small delay. This is caused bu an invisible wall. However, any other thing that I tested was slower than this and also it's good for avoiding that mini-boss.
