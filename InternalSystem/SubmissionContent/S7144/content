It means that when the car travels on Snow or Rain element tracks, the car sets a timer where if the car travels too fast in one direction, it starts a slipping animation.

Currently all the tracks I want to have something work, I haven't been able to at all, no matter what I throw at it. So to keep me sane while going at, I have to rely on 'old reliable' so to speak tricks, to keep me from going insane on the inside.
