	"While nothing technical goes on in this run, necessarily, a big thing is how to control the movement. You don't necessarily have velocity in this game, only acceleration, turning the entire game into one big ice level. Flying is the fastest way to travel, with walking probably being the slowest; however, you have an energy meter that determines how long you can fly for. Because of this you'll see me walk at times: this is to build up that meter for whatever I need, usually a very high door or other.

	"If you play the game frame by frame, you may notice the occasional visual glitch where it cuts to a destroyed version of another screen. This happens once in this run for 2 frames. I have no idea what causes this, and it happens for the weirdest reasons. Once I had it happen when I flew into a card at a slightly different angle, so who knows.
