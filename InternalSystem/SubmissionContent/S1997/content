	"In this run, I ran with a new route which is very different from the previous one. Compare to the previous route, there is no waiting time in this one, I arrived at the towns in the day time which the guys with crystal are there. And I got a powerful whip (morning star) very early in the route, some mansions were finished smoother. A shortcoming of the route: it needs to collect lots of hearts to buy items, so I had to kill many enemies in beginning and a few more enemies in Laruba mansion.

	"New glitches: in Rover mansion, I warped to a secret mansion (in fact it's a part of Laruba mansion, but no enemy in it), this is a good shortcut for completing the mansion. In Brahm mansion, I used "off stair glitch" after bought the oak stake, then I zipped into the wall to go out and save my time. In some mansions, I killed a few enemies to reduce lag.
