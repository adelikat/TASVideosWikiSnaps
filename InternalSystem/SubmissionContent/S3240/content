	"The Dokoshira Door glitch was used to complete the game quickly as discovered by the Bulbepedia group. This run was complete on a Virtual Boy Advance using the Game Boy as oppose to the Super Game Boy setting. I enjoy the Game Boy version without frames better. I don't know how anyone didn't apply this glitch to a tool assisted run earlier. This Dokorshira Door glitch is not offered in the Pokemon Red US version. The Dokorshira Door glitch works on Pocket Monsters Yellow as well.

	"The door through Gary's house teleports you depending on the steps you take.  There is another teleport spot that takes you past lance but you have to walk a lot further. This sacrifices a non glitched ending for speed. The glitch is achieved by hitting select on the field of Oak's Parcel. Then cancel twice and get into a battle between the two towns. In battle go into the pokemon menu. On charmander hit select with nothing else. If done correctly it will glitch out the screen. Then you can try a variety of step to teleport a wide variety of places. It's a very versatile glitch that is the only possible way to beat the red version this quickly.
