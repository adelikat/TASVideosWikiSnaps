[h4 
	" Wrinkly's Save Cave
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"A strange bug will occur if you exit Wrinkly's Save Cave before her offer to save your game; after you collect 15 Banana Birds you can only enter her cave if you're not using a vehicle, but your percentage will be 102% instead of 105%. Also, if this bug is active, visiting any Save Cave other than the one on the world map will cause the game to lock up. It's a bad glitch to find out about at the end of an hour and forty five minute run.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" The Bonus Coin
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"If you press the jump button before you touch the Bonus Coin, you'll grab the coin and jump afterwards. If you happen to jump into a wall, the screen will start fading, and you can save ~15 frames.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" The Camera Trick
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Scrolling the camera away from some items or enemies will cause them to not spawn when they're supposed to. This is a strange property of DKC 3; if it's not on the screen, it doesn't exist. 
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" The Steel Keg Trick
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"It's used to defeat Koin. Hold one of these with the Y button, press the jump button and when the kong is about to jump release the Y button and press down. Another special property of a keg is that it will remain in existence much farther offscreen than enemies do. In this manner, a keg can be thrown and will travel past an offscreen Koin, bounce off a wall, and hit him in the back when he spawns. This trick is mentioned as the "camera trick" throughout the submission text.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Kong-Fused Glitch
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"In Kong-Fused Cliffs it's possible to climb up ropes faster than the camera, not as useful as in the any%, but it still saves time.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" The Green Banana Bonus
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"It's the only type of bonus that must be manipulated throughout the game, and depending on the stage the manipulation is a little different, but it's usually done delaying the frame you enter the stage, but most important; you need to be lucky. I'll explain in each stage how lucky we were in this run.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" The Boomer Glitch
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Exit Boomer's cabin as soon as you confirm the payment for his bombs, enter his cabin again and you'll still have enough coins to pay for his last explosion. The same idea can be used on Bazaar if you have 50 Bear Coins, buy the mirror, then exit and still have about 8 coins left with which to buy the shell. However, performing this trick doesn't save enough time to warrant using it, as collecting 5 extra Bear Coins to have a total of 55 adds a trivial amount of time.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Bramble's Bungalow
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"We must press the B button in the first possible frame to skip a long conversation with Bramble, but a lag frame occurs at the same time forcing us to enter his bungalow twice, it's still faster than the conversation though.

	" Lakeside Limbo
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The sunny boardwalk along the lake is littered with items, but we just need a few of them. First bonus; Collect 50 Stars. The strategy to collect the DK Coin here is pretty simple; just throw the barrel behind Koin. There are 4 Bear Coins in this stage, but just 2 are optimal to collect. Second bonus; Grab 15 Bananas (very good luck). Unlike the any%, it's not useful to use the warp barrel in most of the stages.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Doorstop Dash
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Getting through this creaky, old shed will take more timing and coordination than Lakeside Limbo. First bonus; Collect 60 Stars. Second bonus; Find the Coin. The strategy to collect the DK Coin here's a little different; we know that Koin can only be defeated from behind, but not in this TAS. There are 2 Bear Coins in this stage, but it's not beneficial to collect any.

[p 
	"Here's our first Banana Bird, and a sequence of button presses is needed to free it. There's a frame rule before each press; 32 frames.

	" Tidal Trouble
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"You'll have to work against the tide in this stage, but Kiddy's Water Skip will help in tough spots. Koin is right at the start of the stage, and it couldn't be easier to defeat him. First bonus; Collect 30 Stars. Second bonus; Bash the Baddies. There's 2 easy Bear Coins to collect here, so let's get them all. A sacrifice near the end was necessary to avoid a character switch in Murky Mill.
	$LF

[h4 
	" Skidda's Row
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The slick conditions and sudden snow storms give players a taste of the advanced challenges waiting atop K3.  First bonus; Bash the Baddies. Another easy DK Coin to collect, no advanced technique required. Second bonus; Find the Coin. There's 3 Bear Coins to collect here. 
	$LF

[h4 
	" Murky Mill
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Dark and dreary Murky Mill is infested with roving packs of repulsive rodents. Ellie won't go near a rodent roaming beneath the swaying light, so let's play the stage without her. First bonus; Bash the Baddies. A camera trick was used to collect the DK Coin here. Second bonus; Find the Coin. There's 3 Bear Coins here, but just one was collected.

	" Belcha's Barn
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Belcha is a humongous barrel that haunts the deserted barn at the far end of Lake Orangatanga. Belcha's weak spot is his stomach, throw some bugs in his mouth and he'll be history in no time. A Bonus Coin is our reward for defeating Belcha.

]h4
[p 
	"These tall trees are inhabited by a gang of unruly chimps who chuck acorns at anything that moves. Fortunately for the kongs, it's possible to make some of those acorns fail to spawn. First bonus; Find the Coin. Koin is a little hard to find, but easy to defeat in this stage. Second bonus; Grab 15 Bananas (nearly perfect luck). 2 Bear Coins, but none collected.

]p
[h4 
	" Riverside Race
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The stopwatch in the bottom right corner compares your time against Brash Bear's best. First bonus; Grab 15 Bananas (average luck). Second bonus; Bash the Baddies. A sacrifice is needed to reach the DK Coin, but since Kiddy is more appropriated for the next stage, let's switch to Dixie first. 3 Bear Coins, and none are worth catching.
	$LF

[h4 
	" Squeals on Wheels
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"You'll have to climb up through the entire labyrinth to trigger the switch that will open th final door, but it's too time consuming, so let's take a short-cut. This is the first stage where a warp barrel can save time. First bonus; Collect 20 Stars. Second bonus; Grab 15 Bananas (pretty bad luck). A sacrifice is faster than a team throw to reach the DK Coin, but it will also save time in the next stage. Only 1 Bear Coin here, but it's completely out of the way.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Springin' Spiders
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The namesake Springin' Spiders of this tree trunk test will help you reach the upper branches. The warp barrel saved some time here too. First bonus; Collect 30 Stars. Second bonus; Grab 15 Bananas (pretty good luck). There's 6 Bear Coins in this stage, but just one doesn't waste time to collect. Unlike DKC 2, it's not possible to use Start+Select to exit the stages in DKC 3, so, as in the previous stage it was used after the DK Coin was collected to save time.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Another stage that you normally play as Ellie, better not use her though. Hey, this is the last stage with those warp barrels, so let's use it. First bonus; Find the Coin. Another camera trick to collect the DK Coin. Second bonus; Collect 10 Stars. Again, Start+Select was used to exit the stage.

[p 
	"Arich, the giant arachnid ruler of Kremwood Forest. The strategy to defeat him is pretty simple, to pull it off is not; bop him in the jaw four times with a barrel and he'll give us his patch. With this patch Funky will be able to fix his broken Hovercraft.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The Krem Company factory operates around the clock, and Karbine is there to ensure that the Kremlings keep their noses to the grindstone. 4 Bear Coins, 2 collected. First bonus; Bash the Baddies. Second bonus; Grab 15 Bananas (excellent luck). The steel keg trick was used to grab the DK Coin. A sacrifice saved some time to reach the last rope, but it will force another sacrifice in the next stage.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Demolition Drain-Pipe
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Don't follow your instincts; follow the bananas, but if it fails, load your latest save state. 7 easy Bear Coins here. First bonus; Bash the Baddies. Second bonus; Collect 20 Stars. Dixie is not the best kong for the next stage and a sacrifice is usually faster than a normal switch. Koin will shove the kongs if they try to steal his DK Coin, but with a well timed throw we can take some advantage of this.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Ripsaw Rage
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"There are no side paths to explore here, so just try to stay ahead of the runaway saw. Do you remember that if it's not on the screen it doesn't exist? Well, you'll see some examples here. 3 Bear Coins and we must wait for the saw anyway, so let's grab them all. First bonus; Find the Coin. Second Bonus; Grab 15 Bananas (doesn't matter). The DK Coin here is a good example of the camera trick. 
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Blazing Bazukas
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Take a tiptoe through the TNT in this high-tech, high-explosive factory. 2 Bear Coins collected out of 3. First bonus; Find the Coin. To collect the DK Coin here Squitter must touch the Switch Barrel. Another sacrifice saved some time here. Second bonus; Find the Coin.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Low-G Labyrinth
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The Kremlings have somehow reduced the force of gravity in this maze. Up to this point, we hex edited some of our old wips into the run. A sacrifice helped reach the first bonus barrel faster, and since Kiddy is the best kong to collect stars, it was a good sacrifice. First Bonus; Collect 80 Stars. 7 Bear Coins, just 2 collected. Second bonus; Bash the Baddies. The DK Coin here is weird, pretty similar to those color glitches of DKC 2.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Kaos Karnage
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The great and powerful Kaos is not the one to let his Krem underlings do all the work. The strategy to defeat him is more sophisticated; well timed team throws can keep the monkeys right above his head, ready for the next stomp. After six stomps (in fact, there's eight stomps, but two are for manipulation), the first ski is ours . Regrettably, his helmet took a little longer to explode in this run, there's may be a way to manipulate it, but we couldn't figure it out. If you find out how to manipulate it, ~20 frames can be saved here.

	" Bazza's Blockade
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Bazza's Blockade isn't a tough level if you learn to watch the wild ways of the creatures swimming around you. First bonus; Find the Coin. There's 4 Bear Coins in this stage, but only 2 don't waste time to collect. Second bonus; Bash the Baddies. After the no animal sign, it's important to keep a certain height to enter the cave in the first possible frame. Nothing special about the DK Coin here.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Rocket Barrel Ride
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Booster Barrels are flaming contraptions that fling their occupants skyward at high speed. First bonus; Collect 20 Stars. Parry, the Parallel Bird is essential to clear the second bonus. Second bonus; Collect 60 Stars. There's two ways to collect the DK Coin here; with a camera trick or with the steel keg trick, both are equally faster.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Kreeping Klasps
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"These animated barrels of TNT hang around all day, waiting for someone to land on their line. First bonus; Grab 15 Bananas (excellent luck). Second bonus; Find the Coin. To collect the DK Coin, a camera trick is the fastest way.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Tracker Barrel Track
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"These barrels are great for nabbing coins and dodging high flying enemies. 3 Bear Coins here, 2 collected, but the first one with a camera trick. First bonus; Collect 70 Stars. A sacrifice after the first bonus saved some time here. As Ellie, you can press the R button to control how high the barrels will blast you. Second bonus; Bash the Baddies. Pressing the jump button cancels Ellie's drinking animation saving some frames. Throwing the steel keg near a waterfall have some weird results, it can even lock the camera, but in this run it saved some frames to collect the DK Coin. 
	$LF

[h4 
	" Fish Food Frenzy
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Feed your fishy friend Nibbla as you explore the depths. All 2 Bear Coins collected. First bonus; Grab 15 Bananas (average luck). Second bonus; Bash the Baddies. Switch the kongs near a door or a barrel and the next kong will enter it before the switching animation ends. Another opportunity to use the momentum when collecting the DK Coin.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The Klasps in Krevice Kreepers are more intelligent than the boring barrels you hung out with in Cotton-Top Cove. Dixie can climb ropes a lot faster than Kiddy, but since we need to do a team throw to reach the second bonus, it's not useful to switch here. First bonus; Collect 30 Stars. Poor Koin, he'll never know what hit him. Second bonus; Find the Coin. A sacrifice saved some time here, but also in the next stage avoiding a normal switch. There's 2 Bear Coins here, but none was collected.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Terraway toboggan is the fastest and wildest ride in K3. First bonus; Bash the Baddies. 6 easy Bear Coins to collect here. Second bonus; Collect 50 Stars. Okay, that was a stupid way to collect the DK coin, but it was faster than walk in the snow holding the steel keg.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Barrel Drop Bounce
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The four-barrel waterfall jump is one of the toughest series of leaps in DKC 3. Another steel keg trick saved a lot of time to collect the DK Coin here. First bonus; Grab 15 Bananas (very good luck). Dixie can't throw Kiddy to an upper platform and Kiddy can't reach the second bonus barrel, so we must do two switches, but it's still faster than the normal path. Second bonus; Find the Coin. There's only 1 Bear Coin here, but we just passed by.

There's a frame rule in the second bonus; 65 frames between each shot, but on the third shot we must wait 86 frames to shoot again, so we can bash all the other baddies in the first possible frame. Second bonus; Bash the Baddies. Another DK Coin collected with momentum.

Another stage with lots of camera tricks. Squawks must squeeze through some Buzzes to collect the DK Coin here. There's 5 Bear Coins in this stage, only 1 collected. The second bonus is the reason why there's no sacrifice in this stage, Dixie would've taken twice as long to finish it. Second bonus; Collect 40 Stars.

There's a weird glitch that only happen here; the kongs can climb up ropes faster than the camera, but unfortunately, this prevents them from entering the Bonus Barrels. First Bonus; Find the Coin. The hardest part in the DK Coin collection here was to control the camera, as the camera will only "break" when a Kong is above the camera and sufficently far to the left or right (only possible at the top). Second bonus; Find the Coin.

The sacrifice after the first bonus saved a lot of time here, pretty much like in the any% run. The strategy to collect the DK Coin here looks kinda simple, but there's some meticulous calculations involved. We found out after the movie was completed that the Bear Coin collected with Parry is 10 frames slower to collect than the one in Tyrant Twin Tussle (I'll explain wich one there).

We got a decent luck manipulating the Boo Barrels in this run. First bonus; Collect 50 Stars. The sacrifice to reach Squitter's crate will also save some time later in this stage, as Kiddy is pretty useless after the second bonus. second bonus; Find the Coin.

A switch before the first bonus is extremely useful, as we must sacrifice one of the kongs to save time here and Dixie is the best kong for the next stage. First bonus; Bash the Baddies. Collect the DK Coin here is not as complex as it may look. Second bonus; Grab 15 Bananas (average luck). Time to sacrifice a kong, as said before.

But sometimes we can lure the Koindozers into a position where they can help us reach a higher platform. 3 Bear Coins here, but just 1 is optimal to collect. First bonus; Collect 30 Stars. Second bonus; Grab 15 Bananas (average luck). We need Bazuka's help to collect the DK Coin here, and the timing to touch the Switch Barrel was just great.

[p 
	"The purple substance in this pipeline will reverse your play control. There's 2 Bear coins here, but none collected. First bonus; Bash the Baddies. Dixie's sacrifice is needed to start the fight in Kastle Kaos as Kiddy, as we need to sacrifice a kong again there, and Dixie is the best kong to fight K. Roolenstein. Second bonus; Collect 30 Stars. The steel keg trick proved to be very useful to collect those DK Coins.

Roolenstein will be crying like a baby and we can pocket another Bonus Coin. Time to talk with Diddy, Donkey and Cranky. The game can now be restarted with the progress saved.

[p 
	"Boomer's specialty is blasting stuff, which is why his brothers hid him in the Lost World. We need to hire Boomer to blast the rocky roadblocks. It takes 85 Coins in order to open all locations in the Lost World, but in this run he will make a special discount and it will cost only 52 Coins, a bargain. We must find five Cogs from here on, one on each stage to fix a strange machine in his cabin.

	" Stampede Sprint

]h4
[p 
	"Stampede Sprint is the fastest side-scrolling level in the game. First bonus; Grab 15 Bananas (good luck). Second bonus; Grab 15 Bananas (average luck). Tip; if you don't want to get dizzy it's better to fix your eyes on Ellie, not on the environment. There's just 1 Bear Coin to collect in this stage. The sacrifice near the end is needed to manage the kongs. Third bonus; Grab 15 Bananas (average luck). The no animal sign will transform Ellie into a steel keg, better not waste it, or we will have to redo the level to collect the DK Coin. Here's the first Cog. Also, it is possible to skip the Ellie barrel (again), but it doesn't save time, for once.

	"A trigger-happy Bazuka sits at the bottom of Criss Kross Cliffs. First bonus; Grab 15 Bananas (good luck). The team throws in this stage are the reason for that sacrifice in Stampede Sprint. It's pretty difficult to collect the DK Coin here with momentum without touching the Switch Barrel. Second bonus; Bash the Baddies. There's 3 Bear Coins in this stage, but we don't have time to collect any. The second Cog is here.

Well, this is the one to collect instead of the one we collected with Parry in Ropey Rumpus. A well placed web and the DK Coin is ours. First bonus; Collect 40 Stars. There's 6 Bear Coins here, but just 1 was collected. Second bonus; Find the Coin. Those twins are really annoying, a sacrifice is the only way to save time here. Third bonus; Grab 15 Bananas (bad luck). Another Cog, the third one.

	"Swoopy can help and hinder your progress through the level. First bonus; Find the Coin. Second bonus; Grab 15 Bananas (average luck). Watch the DK Coin collection here is a little disturbing. Another sacrifice to reach a Bonus Barrel faster, like the one in Low-G Labyrinth. Third bonus; Collect 20 Stars. There's 3 Bear Coins here, but the run is almost done and we don't have time to waste with those ones. The fourth Cog is here.

Depending on how you kill those Buzzes the rocket will slow down considerably, avoid using the main engine to kill them is the best way to finish this stage faster. It's supposed to have 4 Bear Coins in this stage, but we don't know where the fourth one is hidden. There's no Bonus Barrels in this stage. Kiddy can collect the DK Coin here a lot faster than Dixie. And here it is, the last Cog.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Here it is, the fiercest fight in the entire game. The gears in Boomer's Bomb Shelter yanked the anchor loose on Baron K. Roolenstein's secret submarine, the Knautilus. Like in Kastle Kaos, a sacrifice is needed to manipulate the barrel placement. To win, we must bonk K. Roolenstein in the back of the head 10 times. After the seventh hit we must avoid the electricity arcing across the room, but unfortunately some of those come from the wrong direction in this run. If you find out how to manipulate it you can save ~70 frames here. Anyway, the last DK Coin is ours and we can head back to Funky's Rentals.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"My involvement in this run was not equal to Dooty's, but at the same time I've come to know this game much too well in the couple years that I've TASed it (off and on). Most of the games (dismayingly few) tricks and glitches were discovered by either Tompa or myself. As far as actual input is concerned, Tompa and I had a WIP that covered up to Low-G Labyrinth. Dooty took this, edited some of it, and commandeered the rest. He learned how to TAS this game well a lot faster than I did, which was very impressive. As mentioned, there are improvements. The biggest one that I know of is to ignore the second Bear Coin in Ropey Rumpus and collect the one in Tyrant Twin Tussle after the Squitter barrel, but this saves a trivial amount of time in a compartively long run. If I can think of anything else, I'll be sure to add it.
