By making a simple program that can calculate future RNG values, I was able to determine how often certain minigames were changing it (multiple times per frame in many cases!).  Using this and TASStudio's user-friendly interface for input allowed much better RNG manipulation than Senshin-san's previous run.

While I did get a tad tired of some of the more boring minigames, I must admit it definitely has its moments. I initially was leaning towards Vault but then I thought more about it and felt that the playaround in the Piranha's Pursuit minigame is the kind of thing we look for in Moons runs overall. The published run has an entertainment rating of
