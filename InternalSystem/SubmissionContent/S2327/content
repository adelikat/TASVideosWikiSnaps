	" by 981 frames. The improvement mainly comes from better use of the B-Up transformation and this improvement can be seen mostly in levels 1 and 5. This game is not particularly hex-friendly so I needed to redo some sections from scratch and I also redid sections that I felt could be further improved and so frames have been shaved here and there, but I won't bore you with the details.

	"Trip World is a very underrated game for the Nintendo Game Boy, and is one of my personal favorites on the system. The game lends itself well to TASing; the gameplay can be seen as a mix between Little Samson and Gimmick! (which is hardly surprising as the game is from Sunsoft) and level layout is similar to Mega Man. The premise is an age-old video game clich√©: your character (in this a puffy rabbit/pikachu kind of thing) must rescue his kidnapped girlfriend from an evil dude.

	"The character is originally armed with only jumping and a kick, but as you progress through the levels you can pick up fruit to transform and gain new powers for a limited time. The powers are as follows: Flower Power-Up, he grows a flower on his head and can fire seeds at enemies to immobilise them, never seen in this run; Shrink, he shrinks to small size, but other powers remain the same, never used; Grow, he grows in size, but kicking power is disabled, never used; Ball, he transforms into a ball and can bounce and travel at high speed, used extensively; Mouse, he turns into a mouse and can tail whip enemies from a greater distance, he must also be in this form to transform into his final form; Final, his legs grow long and he shoots energy bombs that kill all enemies in one hit. He can also transform into other things by pressing B-down depending on the level, although the only one useful in this run is his Fish transformation.

				" I waste a lot of time waiting to transform from the ball. This is because the ball can't do damage and therefore I can't defeat the mini-boss. The ball allows such fast movement that it is still worth getting it. Also, it would be faster waiting to transform in the boss chamber, rather than beside the fruit. The fruit, however lets me transform into the mouse, which in turn allows me to transform into the final form, which is ultimately faster.
