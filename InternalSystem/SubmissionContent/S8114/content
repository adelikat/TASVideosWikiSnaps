	"A New Year, new starts and a new TAS! That's right! A new Oddysee 100% PSX TAS is here thanks to a new strat discovered by Mirky now like to be called (TheStratMaster) on my Twitch streams. and Ultrastars3000, our longest serving French speedrunner in the connumity!  The biggest change here are some things that I do in the Paramonian Temple, similar to what I do in one of the rooms in Bonewerkz. More info below.

	"Often abbreviated as DDG it makes Abe invisible and can corrupt his sprite and eventually become invisible if he rolls into a bomb or jumping over a greande, allowing him to get past things that would kill Abe. Abe will die if he falls of a ledge or gets zapped. A video made by Sligfantry can show you how this glitch works:

	"By timing this glitch perfectly you can make Abe stop and turn. To set it up, Abe needs to be standing near a ledge (pressing up whilst turning around) you will be able to make Abe do a backwards jump. Notice that when you press the opposite direction to where Abe is standing at the incorrect frame, Abe will just jump up and stand. But if you time it perfectly, Abe will jump backwards and possibly jump to another screen. This will allow you to jump backwards to areas and skip Zulags. In a 100% run it will allow you to get to secret areas quicker and it skips a section of StockYards Escape after finishing the secret area. Sligfantry's video can show you how this glitch works:

Alternatively, there is a new tool developed by NASJ whhich allows us to TAS Abe and re-record inputs. See his video below
