	"This is the hardest part of optimization. In TAS conditions you can make actions super fast, but the AI might act differently. It's very tricky because literally everything has an effect on the AI's decisions on what to do on its turns. I moved my units to specific positions, I can hold X during the AI's turn or simply delay my attacks to change its targeting.

You can prevent it if you make a unit die in water, on minefields or if you just deal a massive amount of damage (60+) so the unit will blow up instantly.

	"You can make Anti-P Mines blow up even if you use only one of them on a pillbox (or potentially other artillery too). If you lay a mine from the slope, it makes the mine hover, which forces it to blow up, so you can attack something else on the same turn. Saves a turn on Glacier Guns.

	[br

	"Instead of the Grunt, the AI thus will use his Gunner first. This is important since they have the bazooka, so they are likely to act faster than units from any other career path, so I'm totally fine with letting them act.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"On my second turn I move to another corner of the map and throw gas to poison two Grunts. This walk wastes a little bit of time, much less than letting the AI's Grunts act instead. Poisoning both Grunts forces the AI to skip the next 2 turns.

I originally thought that dying in water is faster than getting extra death animation, which is correct unless you use animation cancel, which I didn't know about in the old run. However, if you kill more than one unit, letting them die in water at the same time is faster than 2 short death animations.

	"On my first turn I used a jetpack to grab the unique "Anti-P Mine", then used a trick to blow up the left pillbox. Usually, a single mine won't detonate, but placing one from the slope makes it hover in the air, which makes it blow up after my turn. After this, I used a cluster grenade to destroy another pillbox. Both cluster grenade and Anti-P mine explosions are RNG, so I wanted to grind combined inputs for both actions until I'll be able to force both units to die in the water, wasting 17+ HP while they try to get back to land.

	"On my second turn I move my Hero to the left corner and kill the first Gunner with a bazooka. The purpose of this movement is to hide my Hero from the artillery and manipulate the AI to deal maximum damage to my Pyrotechnic and some damage to the shelter on the next turn. I sacrifice my unit instead of moving him to safety because it's faster.
	[br

	"The shelter is weak on the 3rd turn, so I can OHKO the AI's Hero inside with an airburst now.

	"On the AI's next turn he can't deal any damage to my units from the artillery, so he has to jump out and grab some loot. The closest one is a jetpack. He doesn't have time for other boxes, so he has to attack at the end of his turn. It makes him a very vulnerable target, which was his final mistake.
