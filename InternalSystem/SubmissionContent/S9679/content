	""Astro-PANIC!" is a fast-paced, high-speed, all-machine-language game. The object is to defend your cannon, maneuvering it left and right as alien saucers dodge and dive in a relentless attack.

	"This game was published in February 1984, via the very popular magazine for the Commodore computer series. It was a monthly issue that provided articles for many different things. Some of which included, BASIC programming tips, Machine Language Tutorials, "Type-In" games, review of software, and more. The author, Charles Brannon, was a great contributor to the magazine for many articles and programs. Astro-Panic was one of his most popular games, written completely in Machine Language.

	"This is a remake of my original submission, where it removes the "Trainer Screen". This was back when I didn't know that the companion disks were available for download. In addition, the optimization was improved but I don't know by how much...due to it being changed from PAL to NTSC.

	"This game is an absolute RNG nightmare. Every frame can adjust an enemy ship, when its about to bounce off a border. The variations were enormous and prompted me to attempt a BOTed run. After checking a number of BOTing techniques, I realized it was not going to be an easy task...so I attempted to approach it manually. Recently, I finally decided to get this version ready for replacing the existing publication, where it uses a "Trainer Screen".
