It seemed to be a good, old fashioned platformer that didn't aspire to greatness it knew it couldn't achieve, and had enough visual flair to be a decent TAS.  After burning through several other projects I finally got around to doing this one after no one else really tried (or had tried but failed).

It even lags for no reason at all, often seemingly invisibly.  Trying to hyper-optimize this game would be a task for the truly insane, so I didn't worry too much about it.  I managed to get through it, and I'm fairly pleased with the results.  I am happy that I could squeeze it under twenty minutes as well.
