	"I came across this game while perusing various Youtube videos.  It seemed to be a good, old fashioned platformer that didn't aspire to greatness it knew it couldn't achieve, and had enough visual flair to be a decent TAS.  After burning through several other projects I finally got around to doing this one after no one else really tried (or had tried but failed).

	"It's been sort of a frustrating task because of the dodgy engine underneath it.  One of the more frustrating aspects was that it accepts input unevenly and unpredictably.  It even lags for no reason at all, often seemingly invisibly.  Trying to hyper-optimize this game would be a task for the truly insane, so I didn't worry too much about it.  I managed to get through it, and I'm fairly pleased with the results.  I am happy that I could squeeze it under twenty minutes as well.

The way the game is emulated causes some weird desynchs to happen: unless you start playing the movie immediately upon opening the emulator, you'll get stuck here.

The blast radius between the wall and the bomb is bigger than the one between Ardy and the bomb, so Ardy can place himself between the two safely.  Unfortunately, this doesn't work in later levels.  Also, I have to jump into the wall as it's blowing up because otherwise Ardy will be stuck pushing an invisible wall for a bit.

[p 
	"There were a few ways I could have messed with the cutscene right before fighting Beecroft, but all of them were slower than the normal approach.  Fighting Beecroft involves using a mirror to bounce his machine's shots back.  Hit him and you get another volley.  Hitting the second shot of each volley moves you onto the next, so I had to hit at least the first two of each round a quickly as possible.  Before he starts firing I decide to push and pull on the little robot that's supposed to hurt you on contact.

	"The stack of boxes is another opportunity to abuse the game's collision detection.  Ordinarily you're supposed to pull them out and jump on them; I thought doing this would be a frustrating endeavor due to the game's weird physics.  However, I found that those weird physics would be of great service: As you jump into them, you'll clip onto some ledges, giving you a two frame window to jump.
