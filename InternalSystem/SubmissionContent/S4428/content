I would then turn to the run comments, the earliest of which were based on misinformation, the latter of which had little what to say regarding the game, although it was not very positive either. I gave this run some time for more comments, but none materialized.

	"Since the game does increase in difficulty for later waves with more distractions from the pterodactyl, and spawning enemies which move considerably faster, I am deeming this run incomplete. Several more waves need to be played, and a later cycle must be reached. Rejecting.
