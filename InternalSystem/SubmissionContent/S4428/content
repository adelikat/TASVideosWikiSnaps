	"I beat all unique waves (see how the platforms disappear and then get back at the second egg wave), then let the AI kill my heroes. Some fun occurs during that extra time (like, NPCs suicide twice and feed me their eggs, there also might have been a 
	[b 
		"pterodactyl suicide
	]b
	", but enemies were faster), also you can see how the game looks normally.

	": Normally, for situations like these, I would ignore the votes in the poll, as it's clear many are voting based on misinformation. I would then turn to the run comments, the earliest of which were based on misinformation, the latter of which had little what to say regarding the game, although it was not very positive either. I gave this run some time for more comments, but none materialized.

	"Regarding the run itself, while I find it to be executed well, for games like this, the 
	[a class=intlink href=/Vault 
		"rules
	]a
	" state the criteria for completion is as follows: "Games that loop endlessly can still be defined. The completion point is one where there is 
	[b

[p 
	"Since the game does increase in difficulty for later waves with more distractions from the pterodactyl, and spawning enemies which move considerably faster, I am deeming this run incomplete. Several more waves need to be played, and a later cycle must be reached. Rejecting.
