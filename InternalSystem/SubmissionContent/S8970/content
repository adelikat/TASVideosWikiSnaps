Also if you shoot your gun fast enough after clearing the first screen of the minigame, it won't count against your ammo, which means this level I can go from 900 points to 1000 points.

Whenever the stage allows, some extra inputs are made for entertainment purposes, which adds to the experience. As far as I can tell, the author also shoots for (pun intended) for the highest score, but it's not clear to me whether this is the absolute possible maximum.
