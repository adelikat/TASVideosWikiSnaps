	"This is a nice puzzle/action game that lends itself well to a TAS. I was pleasantly surprised by the number of levels that could be completed with a strategy different from (and faster than) the one apparently intended by the designers, whether by exploiting a glitch or just doing something unintuitive. My aim was to get to the credits as fast as possible, ignoring all 'bonus' levels (those that have to be unlocked by going through a differently-colored exit portal and don't reward eggs upon completion). A 100% run is evidently impossible since in world 5 one of the bonus levels does not unlock itself properly after entering the bonus portal, but such a run would also require a lot of repetition of certain levels to unlock the extra levels, and in my opinion ultimately end up less entertaining than an any%.
