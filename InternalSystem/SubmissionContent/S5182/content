	"For comparison, I compare my level times with MechChicken's 2P any%, and Allbeert's 1P any%. In 2P, you can multitask and thus collect items and kill bosses slightly faster. However, in 2P you'd also need to collect 2x the items as the 1P run; a herculean task to be sure. As the times below will show, a 2P run will not be able to compete with a 1P run, and the 2nd character is basically just dead weight, as 1P can do nearly everything faster.

Unfortunately, this was actually almost identical to the 2P run in terms of frame count. I figured, if an optimal run to the second victim wasn't actually faster (and in fact would be slower because the "Extra Victim Bonus" message on 47), I could save some frames by fighting more efficiently instead, as I did on Monster Phobia. It's pretty similar in time however, it might be worth considering going for the 2nd victim just because fighting the spider boss is a pain.

Skeleton Keys are a necessity for some major shortcuts, but we can just say they are also worth at least 100 frames (definitely more, however, because you can skip mini-bosses).

Let's be generous and assume that we could have collected the key later instead of a shoe. 11 shoes would be worth 700+ frames. We are down -195 frames, a net savings of over 495+ frames by slowing down to shop here.

	"If I stop, or backtrack for a few steps for seemingly no reason, what I'm doing is manipulating the RNG. By causing enemies to spawn or despawn by moving the camera, among other things, you can get slightly better RNG. A good example is Level 5 Weird Kids on the Block, where I need to pick up 6 chests, and sometimes the fastest way to advance the RNG to a good number is actually to move in a very careful, but funky looking pattern.

	" and the 
	[a class=intlink href=/2785M

	". The reasoning behind this is mostly because of the 2p run falling off in entertainment value since its publication, with only 4 ratings (thus, low interest) and an average entertainment of 6.1 (lower than what we'd expect from a Moon run). We can't push it down to Vault since it's not eligible, so I think it's safe to let it be obsoleted for now. If a much more optimized 2p run comes along and it gets good enough feedback, then we can bring the 2p any% category back, though if that happens I'd like to see some more discussion on the merits of having both 1p and 2p any% runs.
