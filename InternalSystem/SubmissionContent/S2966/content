	"This run is of Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition, which is an expansion to the GBA port of Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. These two games try to recreate the new gameplay style and atmosphere of the PS2 DA faithfully, and mostly succeed. TE is different in that it has mostly new characters, new gameplay modes, a better A.I. and some other small fixes which don't matter enough to be listed here. I first thought to make this run of Deadly Alliance, which I played long before even trying Tournament Edition. I had found morph combo glitches using Shang Tsung's character, who can morph into any other unlocked character in the game, and also a way to play as him before even purchasing him from the Krypt. A quick, entertaining TAS in theory! But TE turned out to be a far better game overall, since the DA artificial intelligence is about as engaging to fight as a wet sponge, and TE has better characters and more exploits. Oh, and Shang Tsung is in that one too.

[div class=p 
	"This is a run that doesn't aim for speed, just trying to show many unlikely fighting situations, frame precise trickery and glitches. Most common things used to create interesting fights were: playing with taking/avoiding damage, symmetry, repetition, changes in pacing, mirror matching, strange morph combos, "breaking into third dimension momentarily", doing special moves to wrong directions and just doing unsorted small glitches here and there. Tried to make all the fatalities worthwhile by subtly glitching them up as well. There's an own "tricks" section below.

]h3
[div class=p 
	"According to GoodGBA, there exists three different roms for this game, none of which has a (!) symbol in its name. After some testing, I thought hIR was the best choice for doing a TAS, first by the virtue that it is not a bad dump (unlike b1), and secondly because it is free of a "cracked intro screen" (unlike hI). All the roms have the same graphical glitches in the profile menu, but I don't know if this is an emulation error. Gameplay-wise the three are nearly identical. But there is one oddity which caught my attention...
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Roms hIR and b1 seem to allow unlocking Sektor and Drahmin quicker than what is "normal". As you can see from the verification movie, only two Tag matches on Hard-mode unlock them, first Drahmin, then Sektor. As far as I know, in normal circumstances you'd have to play Normal-mode Tag mode through once to unlock Drahmin, and Hard-mode Tag mode through with all characters available from the start to unlock Sektor. I mostly saw this as a pleasant surprise as it saved many hours of playing Tag-mode for me, and it doesn't really affect the run itself... does it?

[div class=p 
	"Two characters remain locked, Reptile and Noob Saibot. For some reason, Shang Tsung can't morph into Reptile in this game, so there was no need for unlocking him. Then, Noob Saibot is basically just a palette swap of Scorpion with a few different special moves, and isn't important enough to be unlocked. Well... to be clear, Sektor is just a palette swap of Cyrax as well, but he has the dreaded teleport punch which no other characters have, and some unique Shang Tsung morph combo possibilities. Definitely a (red) barrel of fun.

	"About tricks and mechanics:
	$LF
]h3
[div class=p 
	"Morph combos work like this. In this game, Shang Tsung can morph into another character in the middle of an attack. After morphing, the new character continues from a respective "frame" of a respective attack of his own move list, sometimes leading to new combos that are not normally possible. But sometimes the moves just fizzle out uselessly, or nothing might happen. But... and this is the last but! Sometimes you get access to disabled moves, or even fatality animations in the middle of the fight. This is why I think it is definitely a glitch and not a "feature". I went as far as cataloguing almost all of the possible options that this trick allows, and kept the list at hand when I was devising combos in this run. Unfortunately there is a slight cooldown from doing anything after having morphed, which limits your options somewhat.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Doing moves to a wrong direction works like this. It's easy to have your character have their back towards his or her opponent, by just jumping over the opponent for example. Normally the game fixes this and makes you face the opponent properly again if you take damage or press L or R just once. However, if you press sideways and L (stance change) at the same time, or press sideways and A or B, for just one frame, your character does not change directions. It's not easy to do this in real time. Normal attacks that are done in the wrong way can be turned around at any time, which is useful for jabbing your enemy in creative ways.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The "breaking into third dimension" is this. The game is effectively set on a 2D-plane. Sometimes the characters can go out of that plane, due to a lack of space for example. This makes moves miss more often than hit and cause slight graphical glitches to occur. I don't know how to explain this mechanism better.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The game restricts juggles pretty heavily. More than 3 "heavy" hits and the juggle is cut off, and more than about 4 "light" hits or jabs cuts it off too. So, the focus is more on making a juggle look cool instead of it being practical, after all, this is a TAS. Jump kicks are the best way to begin juggles, so they are used pretty often. A backwards jump kick is even better since it has a smaller cooldown, especially useful for doing special moves (which have to be done from idle).
