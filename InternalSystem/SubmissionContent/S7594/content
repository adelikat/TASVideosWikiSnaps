	"Fire Emblem: New Mystery of the Emblem: Heroes of Light and Shadow (ファイアーエムブレム 新・紋章の謎〜光と影の英雄〜) is the 12th game of the serie, and the only one since Fire Emblem 7 to not be released outside of Japan. It is a remake of Fire Emblem 3, using the same engine than Fire Emblem 11 which was itself a remake of Fire Emblem 1. Storywise, it is a sequel of Fire Emblem 1/11, with some extra chapters and recruitable characters added compared to the original.

Also in Lunatic, some useful items (Warp Staff, Silence Staff, Silver Card) are replaced by less useful ones, and dragons have 1-2 range instead of only 1. Once the game is completed on Lunatic difficulty, the Lunatic' difficulty is unlocked, also known as Lunatic Reverse or H4. This difficulty is exactly the same than Lunatic apart from one major difference, which is that enemies will always strike first, even on player phase. It is considered one of the hardest difficulty in the franchise.
