This TAS saves 35 seconds over the average GameCube loading times in Nightfire speedruns.

The difference between the two is that Classic Bond has move/turn mapped to the control stick and strafe/look mapped to the C-stick. This is very similar to the 1.1 control scheme in Goldeneye: 007, and it was intended to be used by people who preferred moving and aiming with a single analog stick. However, the Nightfire control style is very similar to modern shooters, with move/strafe bound to the control stick and look/turn bound to the C-stick. The advantage here is that you can move with the analog stick and aim with the C-stick, which makes the movement and aiming look much smoother.

When the weapon cycle animation finishes, Bond will stand up inside the object, which causes him to be pushed through the floor. On top of this, it’s also possible to store a clip and use it later. The possibilities are endless. Floors, walls, and objects are non-existent unless James Bond says otherwise.

I turned this off because it’s better for me to change weapons manually than letting the game do it on its own. Next, I take a few extra frames to turn on the widescreen setting. Nightfire has excellent widescreen support, and it makes the game look way better. Widescreen also makes it easier to keep a certain NPC on screen in the Double Cross mission, which I’ll talk more about later. After that, I start the first real level in the run on 00 Agent difficulty.

[div class=p 
	"The Exchange starts off very straightforward, but gets more complicated as it goes on. For the first minute of the level, the only goal is to get from point A to point B as fast as possible. The fastest way to do this is by strafing forward/left or forward/right. Much like GoldenEye, strafing is way faster than moving straight forward. This continues until I get close to the end of Drake’s Party, which is where I execute the first glitch in the run. After I start the cutscene where Drake talks to the party guests, I’m going to clip through the floor and go straight to the end of this section, skipping the meeting with Dominique and fighting a bunch of guards. The type of clip done here is a bit different than the method I explained above. This is a faster, frame-perfect way of clipping, but its use is limited. For this clip, I crouch, then immediately stand up again while pulling out a gadget. This delays the standing animation by roughly one second. If you press the crouch button again exactly two frames before this delayed animation ends, you will fall halfway through the floor. Then all you have to do is walk into certain objects to push yourself entirely through the floor. In this case, I start the clip, fall halfway through the floor, then walk backwards into a chair that will push me all the way through. This clip saves four seconds over the previous TAS.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The last section of The Exchange is the most complicated one. At the start, there are two routes you can take. The previous TAS jumps toward the guards and goes through a series of rooms until it gets to the room with the safe in it. This run, however, takes a slightly faster route by going out the window, then entering the safe room from the outside. This route is about half a second faster than the inside route. When I enter the building, I mash the jump button to go up the stairs a bit faster. When you go up stairs and slopes, you slow down a little bit. But pressing the jump button temporarily puts you back up to full strafing speed.

	"Once I enter the safe room, I immediately go for the body armor. This is necessary for survival. Then I use the laser to melt the hinges on the safe. Contrary to what you might expect, the laser has a very short range. I move while using the laser to make it a bit more entertaining. Once the safe door falls down, I can jump at a precise angle to get pushed through the wall. When an object falls on top of Bond, there’s a chance that it’ll push him away very quickly, and it can sometimes push you through walls. Unfortunately, this is the only place where this technique is useful. It saves hardly any time, but it looks awesome.

I have to wait for a little bit before the boss fight starts, so I shoot some enemies and deal damage to Zoe to make the waiting a little more entertaining. The boss fight is a chopper that I need to shoot with 6 rockets. I start shooting the rockets as early as possible so they’ll hit as soon as the chopper spawns. The mission ends as soon as the 6th rocket makes contact.

Throughout the level, Zoe will slow down to give Bond time to shoot all the enemies. If you shoot them too early, Zoe will slow down and never speed up again. If you shoot them too late, Zoe will wait longer to speed up again. So this TAS shoots every group of enemies at the perfect time to maximize speed. There are no glitches in this level. This part of the run is all about movement optimization and entertainment, and Gamerfreak did a great job at that.

	"Enemies Vanquished has a major out of bounds glitch that saves over a minute. At the start of the mission, aleckermit does a very optimized drift and starts driving the other way. When he gets to the wall behind the starting point, he shoots rockets to disrupt the road barricades which allow (with RNG) to lift the car’s front end up enough to make it onto the side of the road where you’re not supposed to be. The out of bounds space in the driving levels acts very strangely. Basically, whatever height/angle you’re driving at when you enter empty space will be retained until you go back in-bounds. While aleckermit is driving toward the end of the map, the car is tilted downward because that is the angle the car was at before he went out of bounds. This was done on purpose as the loading zone at the end of the map is lower than the spawn point at the start. That way, he will be going down the hill as he goes out of bounds, meaning he will be driving directly toward the loading zone, instead of having to spend 6 seconds dropping vertically onto the load zone as the previous TAS did. The boss fight at the end is rather straightforward. All you have to do is eliminate the enemies as quickly as possible.

[div class=p 
	"The first section of Double Cross involves escorting Mayhew to his secret bunker. However, he has a deathly fear of the Yakuza and won’t move until they are taken care of. Mayhew is odd in that he requires some enemies to be dead before he progresses, and others enemies he’s fine with them just being stunned. The first 3 Yakuza to spawn are mostly random. They can spawn in a few different places, but this run gets the best possible spawns. Mayhew will quickly move to the next area once they are killed. This TAS saves seconds over the previous TAS in this section alone because aleckermit discovered that Mayhew moves faster when he is on-screen. However, it’s not possible to keep Mayhew on-screen the whole time, since you have to go to the last room and kill a bunch of guys before he slows down. The widescreen setting saves a small amount of time here since Mayhew stays on-screen for a little bit longer. For the last room in section 1, aleckermit throws some stun grenades to immobilize the remaining enemies.

	"Section 4 is easily the most luck-based part of the entire game. The ninja requires 2 sniper headshots to kill, but he takes reduced damage during his acrobatic animations and also cannot be finished-off during these animations. Most of the time, the ninja will start with a flip, then he’ll attack, then do another flip. These three actions have a few different animations of variable length. As you might expect, this TAS gets the shortest possible animations in each phase. Most commonly, the ninja does a series of backflips when he spawns. However, there is a small chance he’ll do a cartwheel to the side instead. This is very rare, but that’s not an issue for the TAS. When the cartwheel ends, aleckermit shoots the ninja in the face. There are 3 types of attacks the ninja can do next. He can shoot you with his gun, slash you with his sword, or throw a flashbang grenade. The flashbang grenade is the shortest attack, so that’s what this TAS gets. Then he’s luck manipulated to do another cartwheel to the side. Aleckermit kills the ninja after the second cartwheel. In total a few seconds were saved over the previous TAS here. So the whole fight goes like this: Cartwheel, headshot, flashbang, cartwheel, headshot. Alec spent a lot of time manipulating luck in the ninja fight and it certainly paid off.

When the alarm goes off, turret guns will open up from the ceiling and shoot at you until you find a place to hide. If you don’t get out of sight quickly, the mission will fail. The next objective is located in a room with no cameras or guards, so Bond can hide from the cameras and turrets long enough to avoid failing the mission. The objective is to install the Q-worm virus on the target computer. After doing this, there are two ways to get to the next area. You can use the decryptor to unlock a bunch of doors to get to the security room, or you can climb into a vent to gain access more quickly. Because this is a video game, we go through the vent. In the making of the previous TAS, Gamerfreak discovered that you can climb through this vent much faster if you crouch before the grapple pulls you up there. Bond will be standing inside the vent with his torso going through the ceiling. This allows him to temporarily move at full speed when you normally wouldn’t be able to. The only remaining objective here is to unlock the door and proceed to the next area. You’re intended to use the decryptor to figure out the code to unlock the door, but the TAS doesn’t need to do that. As long as you know the randomly-generated code, you can simply type it in to unlock the door.

	"In the outdoor area, Gamerfreak shows off a really cool clip that allows him to clip inside the elevator. This allows him to clip inside the building slightly faster than the previous TAS did. There is a new route for the indoor area that saves time over the old TAS. In the back side of the indoor area, there is a computer that takes time to boot up and become accessible. So after opening the door to that room, you have to wait for a few seconds before you can complete that objective. You have to wait for so long that it ends up being faster to open the door before going into the offices, then coming back to complete that objective. However the previous TAS opens that door at a later time, which means more time is spent traveling to and from the office. Opening the door to Mayhew’s office is the only time the decryptor is used in this run. Even if you can figure out the code, it won’t work unless you use the decryptor first. I’m not exactly sure why some doors need the decryptor and some don’t, but I believe it’s because the game generates a code for doors like this when the decryptor is used. There are other places in the game like this, but this is the only one we can’t clip around.

At the start of the level, I equip the micro camera and jump down a vent where I take a picture of the jetpack prototype. This is the first of two objectives required in this level. Now the only thing left to do on this map is to get to the door at the end. I do a clip to get out of the building, then I run over to the next building where I do another clip to get inside. This is a really important glitch because it allows me to skip climbing up the guard towers to get inside, saving precious time over the previous TAS. The textures inside the building aren’t loaded, but the collision is still there. The textures will load once I get to a certain point in the building.

While I’m turning to get on the seam just outside the level, I no-scope a guy from across the map. Then I quickscope another guy while walking along that seam. All I have to do to load the next area is jump to a specific spot in the out-of-bounds space. The 2nd objective is very similar to the first.

Turning the camera around while driving past the mines is a hilarious thing Gamerfreak did in the previous TAS, so I did the same thing here. I also shoot some torpedos that narrowly miss some mines just to show off. At the end of the level, I take a little time to grab some body armor before the boss fight.

However, driving through it at a certain angle makes it where the barrier doesn’t slow you down, for some reason.

I also shoot the SUV’s before the screen fades out so they do less damage to me. Section 2 is mostly an autoscroller. Much like Alpine Escape, I shoot enemies at specific times to maximize my speed.

At the start, I open the vent and shoot a few times to alert the guards in the next room. As a result, they open the door for me. Next, I switch to the remote mines and throw them to a certain spot. These will be useful later. Now I need to get to the security center as fast as possible. I threw a frag grenade in one of the hallways to manipulate some enemies in the next room to open another door for me. Besides that, this part is pretty straightforward. When I get to the security room, I need to use the laser to destroy two terminals. After that, you’re supposed to activate a glowing red computer to destroy the servers in that room, but that doesn’t actually have anything to do with completing the objective. The only reason to do that is to unlock the door and get out. As you might expect, this TAS simply clips around the door and proceeds to the next objective, saving 18 seconds over the previous TAS. When the security room door opens, all the enemies I ran past earlier will despawn and tougher guards will start spawning instead. However, because I chose to clip past the door instead of unlocking it, all the enemies I ran past will still be there and even more enemies will start spawning. If that wasn’t enough, every enemy is now aware of my location and they are very mad. I can’t even begin to describe how hard it is to survive this part of the level on 00 Agent without despawning most of the guards. But difficulty isn’t an issue for the TAS. With a few clean headshots and a bit of luck manipulation, the enemies are no match for James Bond. Also, remember those mines I placed earlier in the level? Those mines are used to kill Rook, the mini boss, instantly. Placing those mines at the start costs some time initially, but it ends up being faster overall than shooting him in the face a bunch of times. “Pain only makes me stronger, Mr. Bond!”

	"The rest of the level is mostly skipped thanks to a few major glitches. The first is known as “Silo Skip”. As you can probably guess, it allows us to skip most of the silo area. The newer, faster way of Silo Skip used in this TAS allows us to not only get to the end faster, but it also lets us skip using the decryptor to unlock a certain door, which saves a few seconds. After the loading screen at the end of the silo area, I clip past the first door in section 3 to save about half a second over opening the door normally. Then I go up to the 2nd floor so I can clip past a locked door on the other side of the room. This is faster than unlocking the door by a few seconds. After jumping into the hallway on the other side of the locked door, there is only one thing left to do: Kiko Skip. Normally, you’re supposed to proceed through the level as intended and wait in a long and boring scripted scene where Kiko taunts the player repeatedly. You have to wait here for over two minutes. After the two minutes is over, you can press a button to kill Kiko and complete the mission. This button is accessible before the two-minute waiting section but nothing happens when you press it. This is where Kiko Skip comes into play. If you clip around a very specific area in the room before the button, you can press the button before the waiting section and end the level immediately. In that area, there is a trigger that makes it where the button does nothing when you press it. But clipping around this trigger prevents that from happening, allowing us to skip the entire boring two-minute waiting section. It’s really awesome that this works because it made countdown a really entertaining level instead of a really boring level.

	"I want the screenshot to reflect how broken this game is. Here are 3 screenshots that demonstrate that. The first one shows off a major glitch in a driving level, where you drive out of bounds to the boss fight. The second one shows Bond walking on an out-of-bounds seam while putting on sunglasses.. The third screenshot is similar to the second one but without the sunglasses. It shows more of the out-of-bounds area, so it’s easier to see it even in a small thumbnail.
