In fact there are very few enemies I'll actually be killing during this TAS - most of those robots. There are only two ways to run past enemies; jump over them, or attack them so that they are "stunned" and run right through. The quickest way to do that in most cases is to jump and slash with Wolverine's claws. The only time when it's not optimal is if you're too close and the jump would bump you into the enemy's hit box before slashing him, or attacking in a different way sets up the RNG of an enemy next to him.
