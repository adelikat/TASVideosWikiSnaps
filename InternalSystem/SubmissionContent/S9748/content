		"Beck is the character from Mighty No.9. If you play this game, you would immediately notice that it is a Mega Man clone, with Beck replicating Mega Man's features.

		"Unlike Gunvolt, Beck has a buster shot as his main weapon, and he can dash instead of double jump. While this removes some possible glitches such as screen scroll zip, his dashing ability can clear all stages quicker than Gunvolt, hence why this run is a lot faster.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Beck also has an air dash that's trigged after charging the buster. It is not that useful but can help skipping some puzzles.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"The downside of Beck is that he doesn't kill bosses quickly, similarly to Gunvolt. Beck can only shoot regular pellets, while Gunvolt has his beam that can whip out bosses in less than 5 seconds. However, this game's hitbox can allow as many shots as possible to hit the boss. This can speed up the boss fights noticeably by dealing 3 shots per cycle, instead of just 1. Thanks to Greenalink for mentioning that to me!

	[li 
		"On 3DS version, for some reason, they didn't add an animation to Beck after he clears a level. While this is irrelevant to gameplay but it saves some time compared to Gunvolt as he has an animation at the end of each level.

		"One thing to note before explanation is that the start of sliding animation is slow as Beck gets stuck for like 4-5 frames. Shooting before sliding instantly initiates the sliding animation, thus during the entirety of the run, I keep shooting while sliding. With only 3 shots possible on screen, managing this trick is mandatory, thus sometimes I shoot to the opposite direction to keep the momentum.

		"Boss fight was simple. Thankfully the amount of enemies destroyed was good for an optimal first move. This significantly helped me optimize it. However, it is hard to control the boss RNG during the fight, thus his jump at the end was not the best outcome, but it is much better than his Sunshine Nova dash attack which is a lot slower.

		"This level only has the boss fight, meaning it is almost impossible to manipulate first attack. Unfortunately, I got the worst start which costs 4 seconds. I tried to manipulate it from previous stage with no success. The pattern only changes if the fight starts a lot late, making the those 4 seconds seem optimal. I tried to do something funny there at least but I'm not sure how to save them. I'm leaving that as possible improvement for future runs (if possible). The fight on its entirety ended quickly enough!
