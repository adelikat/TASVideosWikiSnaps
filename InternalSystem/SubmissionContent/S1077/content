	"Ristar is a game where you control a Shooting Star. It has two different stories depending on the version you play. In this version, the Japanese one, You're to stop the Evil Greedy Tyrant Greedy from corrupting the worlds by creating an artifical BlackHole that drains the happiness of other worlds.

	"This movie was fun to make. I enjoyed playing a game I played a long time ago and when I didn't see a Ristar Submission, I thought I'll go back into a nostalgic trip and play Ristar. Luckily I remembered how to grab stuff. Otherwise that'd might have been difficult.

	"I decided I wanted to do it on Hard Mode also to increase the challenge of the game. After all, I find that the harder the game, the more challenging it was. (Also in the japanese version, the scene in Elykiki/Freon where he uses Skiis is cut. So are the shoes in Rewope/Automaton. So it'd be a bit faster than the American version.)

	"I think people might like the result because it shows quicker ways of beating some of the bosses. Like a quick way of defeating Adahan. (Well.. not that quick, but quicker than what I seen most people do.) Beating those annoying Bird things in Sonata/Neuos at the end of stage 1 before they stop and bob their heads so you can't hit them or Riho when he's in the air and not near the ground. (Also I was impressed myself on the speed Greedy fell when I took a couple of practice shots!)

	"Some parts of it were difficult. (Neuos/Sonata 1st Stage was VERY difficult. That and Neer/Flora's Dark Woods stage took the most savestates!) But that made me all the more determined to do it. To test to see IF I could do it.
