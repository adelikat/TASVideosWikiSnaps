	"Taking clamage gives Zero temporary invincibility and interrupts  Zero's movement like attack recovery. It is used to saving time in boss battles and prevents from taking more damage. Recovering health pauses all in-game actions for a short time, so I didn't recovering Zero's health at all.

	"Most of the Ex skills were used in the same way as that in the published run by computerbird. But I used Gale Attaok to substitute for triple saber slash. It spends less time than triple saber slash even though it can give bosses higher damsge. And I didn't use Burstishot because it will cause too much Lag sometimes and it can't be used in boss battles.Maybe many people think 1000slash isn't useful,but it really saved much time.Although it was used for few times.

	"If Zero hit enemies or other things with Z-saber or Recoil Rod (except Throw Blade wave,SaberSmash elecrictity and SoulLauncher),it will pause all in-game actions for 4 frames. So Zero should kill enemies with Buster shst. And I beat the boss,Omega,in a different way from that in computerbird's published run.

Maybe I will make a MMZ run in the summer hoilday. I’m just in grade 9,so I may make some mistakes in the article.Please rectification it.
