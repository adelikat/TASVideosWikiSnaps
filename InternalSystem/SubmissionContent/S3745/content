	"Here's one for the new vault section of the site. It is an old, bad game from my childhood. I completed this run back in 2007 on an old version of FCEU, but I did not submit it because I felt it was greatly lacking in entertainment value. Recently, I saw that the site now has a vault section, so I quickly patched in a few improvements and I think it's good to go.

[div class=p 
	"The story is that you're an agile and cunning Flash Gordon ripoff named Dash Galaxy, and you've been stranded in an alien habitat that looks like a giant rocket, I guess. The only way out is at the very top (??), so you have to navigate the 25 floors of this hostile environment in an effort to reach the exit before you lose all your lives. If your lives are depleted, there are no continues; you're just dumped back to the title screen.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Each of the 25 floors in this "alien asylum" consists of a pointless Sokoban puzzle room with 4 doors. Each door takes you to a sidescrolling action level, where you must collect blue beer cans (actually switches) to exit the room again. If you can do this, the door will lock and you will have completed the stage. It's not necessary to complete any level, and indeed you can just exit back through the "elevator" square in any Sokoban room to progress to the next floor, but sometimes there will be important items like keys and bombs in the levels, which are needed in the Sokoban rooms to unlock force fields and destroy blocks. So it's wise to explore the rooms on each floor and collect items. Sometimes, there will also be warp points which will take you to different floors. Some warp points take you forward, others take you back, and trial-and-error is the only way to figure them out.

[div class=p 
	"In the action levels, there are various perils like pits and enemies. Pits will instantly kill you, but enemies will only suck away your oxygen. You will only die if you run out of oxygen completely, but your oxygen meter is refilled every time you enter a new stage.

[div class=p 
	"For another thing, for someone named "Dash Galaxy", he sure moves as stiff as a rock. The movement and jumping physics in this game are 
	[em 
		"absolutely awful
	]em
	". Basically, Dash can walk slowly, or he can run if he walks for long enough. He has 2 different kinds of jumps: the high-jump, which can be activated if he is walking or standing still, or the dash-jump, which activates if he is dashing. The high-jump has ridiculously slow horizontal motion. The dash-jump has a very long range, but it cannot be controlled in mid-air at all (its path is fixed until it is done), and it only gets 1 block of height. So, the action stages become more like puzzles as you have to try to figure out which kinds of jumps you need to make from which positions to reach the desired items. And, as you can imagine, platforming games with such rigid physics are very frustrating to play.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Finally, while all that alone may have made the game "below average" but not "awful", there is one thing that pushes it through the edge: the nonlinearity. When you get to floor 9, you will find that the exit elevator 
	[em 
		"completely disappears
	]em
	", leaving you to search for a warp point in the action stages that will take you elsewhere. The only available warp point takes you back to 
	[em 
		"floor 3
	]em
	", and you will keep looping through those floors until you happen to find the warp point on floor 6 that lets you actually progress through the game. And it only gets worse from there; the warping puzzles create an evil, aggravating labyrinth that could invalidate hours of difficult work. At one point, you have to actually warp 
	[em 
		"backwards
	]em
	" in order to progress. Oh, and did I mention that warp points take away all your items, too?
