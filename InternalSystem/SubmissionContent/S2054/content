	"Ecco: The Tides of Time is the sequel to Ecco the Dolphin, and has been one of my favorite games for a long, long time. Like Nitsuja did with the original, I made the mistake of thinking that this game would be easy to TAS, got disabused of that notion rather quickly, and only managed to complete the TAS by writing a few special types of autofire into gens. Ecco is a dolphin that controls like a tank with a jet engine. He can get up to very high speeds, but his turning radius is large to begin with, and is greater than the size of the screen at top speed. Additionally, hitboxes are quite difficult to determine just from the game graphics, there's an entire set of levels that involves navigating along mostly dry-land while the gravity changes almost at random, and many levels are sprinkled liberally with obstacles or enemies that will kill you instantly upon contact. Additionally, this time around Ecco must jump through hoops in long 3D levels, and rebuild the Asterite from a single pair of globes.
