	"Jumpman is a platform game originally released in 1983 for the Atari 400/800, but was also released for ColecoVision (as well Commodore 64, Apple II, IBM PC).

	"I chose this game to TAS because it is a surprisingly interesting platformer.  The Game consists of 12 levels, each with its own unique twist.  I chose hardest difficulty because it is the fastest speed and the most challenging for a real human to do (virtually impossible), win win for a TAS!

		" If you get yourself into a ceiling/floor/wall enough, Jumpman will rise up through it, I use this extensively to save time.

		" You can jump up the "down vines" to go up them

	[li 
		" If you die, your dead carcass will flop around randomly until it falls to the bottom of the screen.  If you get items during this time you keep them.  If you get the last item during this time, the level still ends.  Several levels I save time by dying in order to get to the last item quicker.  The reason this is useful is that if you jump too far/long without touching something, you die, so jumping down from a high platform to a lower one is lethal
