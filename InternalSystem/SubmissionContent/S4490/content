	"This is my first completed TAS project and my second completed TAS of Strider. I did this run mainly for fun and to showcase the new set of tricks that I & the Strider community have discovered over the past year. Enjoy!

	" Midair walljump
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Whenever Hiryu does a neutral jump he will 'store' a walljump. This jump can then later be used in midair for a brief moment after walking off a ledge. It jumps further and is slightly faster than a regular jump.
	$LF

[h4 
	" Wallclip with a normal jump
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Hiryu can continuously go deeper into a wall until he finally clips into it by first being right up against it, press away+down or up and then press the direction of where the wall is. Repeat until Hiryu can start zipping. 
	$LF

[h4 
	" Wallclip with a neutral jump
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Hiryu can instantly clip into a wall in midair under the conditions that he does a neutral jump while having speed. This works when he preserves speed after running down a slope or by doing a midair walljump with no previous d-pad input in midair. 
	$LF

	" Slide up slopes
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Hiryu can (depending on his position) extend his slide up slopes by not holding left or right.
	$LF

[h4 
	" Instant acceleration jump
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Hiryu can make instant acceleration jumps when he is sliding up slopes by pressing back and then jumping at the correct time.

	" Pausefix the camera
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"If Hiryu's Y pos is correct (Y=23 for max camera bump) and you pause and unpause the game, the camera will shift upwards and enable you to get to places that you normally would be unable to with just a regular zip.

[p 
	"Sliding up slopes & wallclip with a neutral jump action. It's quite tricky to get the correct camera position to make the zip work after running down the slope. At the end I intentionally suicide which ends the level 58 frames faster compared to not dying. 207 frames saved.

	"I gain control 43 frames earlier becaused I died in Australia. You can just barely avoid hitting the speech trigger of the guy who warns you about Yugderisal by doing a midair walljump and slide as soon as you land. I defeat the final boss in one less jump by dealing 40 damage to him (except for the first jump where I deal 30) on each jump instead of the usual 30. 416 frames saved.

	"Strider is surprisingly difficult to optimise. I have most likely overlooked some things due to Strider being Strider. A lovely game.
