	": This hack has been fairly poorly received, and I have to agree. The layouts are uninspired, and there isn't much added to the game to set it apart from the standard SM64. A hack should really demonstrate something far and above what the standard game offers. Thus, I'm rejecting this for game choice, regardless of the optimization level.
