	"We did here in the game Super Mario 74 a Rom Hack from Lugmillord a zero star run. 
	$LF
	"That sense is here like in Super Mario 64 that you get Stars to defeat later the last bowser. 
	$LF
	"The only differences is here that, that game have 151 stars instead of 120 stars.

	"We found here BLJ´s and Side BLJ´s the that game can beat with 0 stars, too. How in Super Mario 64.

	"At start the Side BLJ at brigde help us to go thought the 10 stars door. That save a lot of time. Instead of get 10 stars.

	"The BLJ to the second Bowser Course (Bowser's Aquatic Castle) Is a very simple BLJ. With it was it possible to go thought the 50 star door. With a right angle was it possible to get a lot of speed. That save a lot frames at this point.

[p 
	"The BLJ to the 3rd and the last Bowser course was very useful. We have going the 2 oblique walls with a the (C up) and then slipped from the edge above. So we was in the location, to use this speed for going thought the last door.

	"We have also try the fastest way to the key doors. But it can be, that maybe other strategies save more time than the ones we use.

	": This hack has been fairly poorly received, and I have to agree. The layouts are uninspired, and there isn't much added to the game to set it apart from the standard SM64. A hack should really demonstrate something far and above what the standard game offers. Thus, I'm rejecting this for game choice, regardless of the optimization level.
