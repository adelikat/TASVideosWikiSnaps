The only optimization is hitting the A button as soon as possible to get your wind (Which that A press is also on a delay for some reason), and your goal is to get 2500 points at least to pass the event, so I tried to squeeze as much fun out of it as possible by getting exactly 2500 each time (There weren't many combinations to get there)

	"The goal is pretty easy to understand: reach the second loop in the fastest time possible. All of the necessary work to get the minimum scores in non-timed events are done well without wasting time and the speed events are done swiftly. While it's possible to end inputs early by about 1400 frames it takes longer in real time due to waiting on the time out fouls. This goes against the intent of this submission going for how RTA runs go so the inputs to quickly foul out the 2 other high jumps are fine to stay. Overall, nice work!
