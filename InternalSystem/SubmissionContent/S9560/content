		" The lantern cannot be picked up at the beginning because the game hasn't been running for more than 5 seconds. There's a mechanism that prevents an object from being picked up if it's been found recently. Most players and speed runners will never experience this mechanism as it only occurs after a cold start and timers are not reset when a new game is started.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" After taking the stairs or tunnels (in the attic or cave), the player sometimes immediately returns to the previous room/floor. This is due to the game running faster than it should. One way to alleviate this issue is to optimize/delay things a little (as this is related to FPS periodically going up and down) or to enter the trigger from a slightly different angle (this works for the cave entrance). If you're unlucky, you'll need dozens of tries to get it right.

	[li 
		" It is not possible to edit a previous segment as the slightest change (even if it has no direct impact on gameplay) will 
		[em 
			"always

		" result in desync. This is because libTAS / PCem are not in sync (more on that later).
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Similarly, optimizing interaction with inventory is difficult because the number of frames to do something varies (e.g. moving the current item down may take 2 or 5 frames).

	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"Some of the problems reported above are due to the fact that the game is not synchronized with libTAS.
	$LF
	"One frame in libTAS will translate into 2 or 3 frames in AITD. Additionally, a new frame in libTAS will almost always starts in the middle of a frame in AITD (not at the beginning).
	$LF
	"This is because libTAS runs at 100 FPS to match PCem's 10 ms increments, whereas the game runs at 70 FPS. The game uses vertical synchronization, but this is a kind of spin-wait that cannot be detected by libTAS. On top of this, there's a bug in the game that causes FPS to exceed 70 FPS every 2 seconds (e.g.: 70, 292, 69, 287,...). The game should cap at 70 FPS.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[code 
		"PCem v17+st-2
	]code
	" can be used to improve this. This is a special version that allows a specific framerate to be used in libTAS (to match the game's framerate). Using this version and a patched game executable (to cap it at 70 FPS), make game frames to be 1:1 with libTAS. This makes everything much easier to control (and in finer gradients).

	" is used as it seems to be the best configuration for this run. Using a slower CPU (eg: 
	[code 
		"Late 80s
	]code
	") slows down the run considerably as 2D backgrounds take longer to load. Using a faster CPU (eg: 
	[code 
		"Late 90s
	]code
	") causes FPS to go really high every 2 seconds and prevents the player from running (even with frame advance). 
	[code 
		"PCem v17+st-2

They would also remember how hard it is to make it out alive; many different things are there to kill you mercilessly. But above all things, how long the game takes to solve. You can play it for weeks until you beat it without assistance. And even with a walkthrough it might take you a few hours to get it done.
