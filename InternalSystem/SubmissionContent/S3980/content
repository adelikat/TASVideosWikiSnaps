	", which Feasel found when we were route planning for his speedrun.  I was starting to research and route plan to improve the currently published TAS, which is way out of date, but I decided to work on this first because it is easier to make.  I originally intended this not to replace the currently published TAS, but I realize that its new route will be too similar to this TAS, but slower due to health recovery and leveling, so I would be okay with this replacing the current TAS.  The reason I used the J version is that I could not find a way to make the infinite HP easter egg work with the U version.  However the infinite MP works with either version.

	" Luck manipulation
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This ended up being far more tricky than I initially thought.  One way this is done is to delay the screen transition by entering the screen from a different position or not moving if the first is not available.  The other way is by killing a monster which then advances the RNG by various amounts when the monster spawns.  This manipulation affects the possible RNG manipulation on the next screen, so I had to do the testing in larger sections, each had many possibilities, so I had to do lua bot testing for much of it when I could.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I manipulate the stronger monsters to stay out the way because each time I stop to do an attack on the monster, it costs 6 frames.  This adds up really fast, especially because I spend almost the whole time at level 1.  The weaker monsters cost only 1 frame to attack because I don't have to stop walking.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The path I took is mostly dictated by RNG manipulation, but I took a path that reduced terrain damage when I could.  Each square adds or reduces a 1 byte terrain counter by a various amount, and is affected by the current level.  When the timer overflows, it adds an HP, and reduces an HP when it underflows.  It probably doesn't make a difference in this TAS, but if it did, it would only save 2 frames.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I had to lose approximately 142 frames to get the luck manipulation where the monsters stayed out of the way.  Killing monsters that take more than 1 hit wastes too much time, so that is avoided when possible.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Here is the explanation for each section, and frames lost for manipulation:
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Infinite HP Setup and RNG Manipulation -- 51
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"In order to setup the infinite HP, the following must be done, in any order: 2 demo screens (waiting on the main screen), 3 invalid passwords, and 4 game menu in the game.  The 4 game menu are the only ones that make sense to group together for speed.  Because the order that I do those affects the starting RNG (further complicated by adding in delays), I started using a lua bot for testing.  I later found out that I can reset, which made testing easier even though I had to restart testing, and also saved around 10 seconds by not having to wait for the game over and invalid password animations, and a minor saving by not having to load the demo screen.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The reason I manipulate the RNG is to get the best placement of fairy 1 and the key, which is set when the game starts.  The best is the key in chest 7, and fairy 1 in tree 8, which I was able to obtain by adding in 51 frames of delay.  There is technically a 3 frame faster overall RNG which has the key in chest 5, but because it results in less available paths in the key cave, it could easily end up slower since 1 delay is 4 frames.  Also, key 7 looks better since there is no backtracking.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Sword Cave -- 12
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"On the way to the sword cave from the start of the game, I learned that I can manipulate the RNG by where and when I enter the screen, which means I can manipulate the RNG without losing frames.  This meant that I had to continue bot testing because of all the possible combinations.  I ended up delaying 1 time which cost 4 frames on the way to the cave to manipulate better enemy positions.  I lost 8 frames inside the cave.  4 from starting on top of a wisp, 2 from a wisp attacking, and 2 from a HP refill.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Roper Maze -- 5
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"I was able to get a pattern that kept the ropers out of the way since they take more than 1 hit.  I had to delay once for 4 frames, and I ended up killing a kobold, costing 1 frame.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Key Cave -- 0
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"By having the key in chest 7, there are 6 available paths, which makes it really easy to avoid enemies, so this cave was perfect.  As mentioned before, had I chosen key chest 5, there would be only 1 path, which would have made this more difficult.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Fairy 2 -- 2
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"I had an HP refill here, which costs 2 frames. A refill had to happen at some point due to terrain damage, so I suppose it shouldn't count.  It is faster by 4 frames to walk into a tree from a square below, so I manipulate the tree to be at least a square away.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Ring Cave -- 19
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"I have to kill 3 goldams (and no ladyams) in order to make the ring chest appear.  I initially delay twice for a total of 8 frames to avoid getting hit by the first goldam, which ends up being 2 frames faster overall.  I delay once for 4 frames for RNG manipulation.  I get hit once by the second goldam, losing 4 frames because it cause an HP refill.  I couldn't attack it from the side or back to avoid damage.  I run into the ladyam, losing 2 frames.  I use attack mode (for no frame penalty) for later on.  The third goldam was perfect.  Coming back, I run into the ladyam again, using attack mode.  Because I had used attack mode before, this kills the ladyam, and so I only lose 1 frame, for a total of 3.  
	$LF

[h3 
	" Jewel -- 1
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"A slime was in the way, but that only loses 1 frame.  The path in the graveyard minimized the bad terrain as well as manipulated the zombies away.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Fairy 1 -- 0
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The way to get the temporary MP is to get the sword and then without save-reloading (which also resets the position for fairy 1 and the key), enter the screen where fairy 1 is located.  The tree for fairy 1 was chosen back when the game was started.  Again it is 4 frames faster to run into a tree from the square below.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Fairy 3 -- 0
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"To get fairy 3, you must kill both wizards with a wave magic, which only shoots horizontally.  Its speed is the same as Jim, so the X position is irrelevant.  The reason for the y position is that the fairy transport is extremely slow, so each y position lower on the screen costs 20 frames.  Manipulating the RNG is important here and also for the next section.  I couldn't bot test this because I had to do manual analysis for the wave.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Grave Vandalism -- 46
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This was a pain because I had to find a pattern where all blackams and skeletons were out of the way. This is the best I could come up with from manual testing and is the only place where RNG manipulation is obvious.  There could be a better pattern, but it is too hard to test every pattern by hand.  In the maze, I lost 2 frames from an HP refill, and 8 frames because a blackam attacked twice.  After the grave is broken, the reason for moving to the right and the 2 delays is to get the skeleton that just spawned to move to the right, which costs 32 frames.  It is faster than fighting it.  I delayed once for 4 frames in the Varalys room to wait for the skeleton to get out of the way.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Water Dragon -- 0
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"There are a few ways to get the fastest dragon battle.  The easiest way is blindly attacking to the right because of infinite HP.  I took a path that showed off a little.  I wanted to get the dragon more to the left, but that didn't work because it ends up adding up extra waiting.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Luby and Maze(Again) -- 2
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This is a simple section.  There is luck manipulation to get the blackams out of the way in the maze and also for a good Varalys position.  This time a blackam attacked one time, but because of the extra HP from gaining a level from fighting the dragon, I did not get the extra delay for the HP refill.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Varalys -- 4
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This battle is also simple with infinite HP.  I suppose there could be a better Varalys, but this is pretty darn good considering I got this with no delaying for the luck manipulation.
