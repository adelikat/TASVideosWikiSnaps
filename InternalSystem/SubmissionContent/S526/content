	"I used Gens for this video. Didn't use any warps or passwords. Abused the collision area a bit. I don't use death, but I did take hits. I simply aimed for the fastest time possible. Game was beaten in about 38 minutes or so.

	"Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is the continuation of Sonic the Hedgehog, but this time, adding in one of Sonic's most famous sidekicks, Miles "Tails" Prower. Again, Robotnik is threatening the world with mechanical robots ranging from rediculous to extremely annoying.

	"The movie wasn't terribly hard. Save States helped alot to get alot of my mess-ups and turn them into something more. Most of the 'stunts' that I pull off generally were out of pure luck, and didn't require a save state, since I pulled them off flawlessly. Generally, without even trying.

	"As for someone liking the result of the movie, I wasn't totally aiming to please everyone, since this was generally a first-movie, done on a bit of free time. I also plan to do Sonic the Hedgehog 2, with all emeralds, as fast as possible.. and attempt to cut the time down dramatically on this movie. I know I make a few mistakes, and by watching the movie, I realize I can work on several problems that, at first, seem relatively minor, but in the end, can shave off several seconds to a few minutes.
