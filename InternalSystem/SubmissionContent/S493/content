	"Metal Storm is a lesser known action platformer/shooter game for NES. It looks like an average game, except that you have the ability to reverse gravity and walk on the ceiling (similar to one level in Megaman 5, but can be performed any time). This allows for unique level design, such as endlessly repeating vertical stages, and all bosses require using this ability to get past them. A difficult game, due to one-hit kills (without the armor item, which absorbs one hit), yet it is rather short in length.

	"I think my movie makes the game seem much more fast-paced and action-filled than it really is. The normal enemies aren't challenging by themselves, just their placement is.
