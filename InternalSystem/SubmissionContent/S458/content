	"Double Dragon II is a classic fighting game with an all-powerful move, the dreaded flying knee.  When going for time you must use the knee frequently, but this movie uses other moves whenever possible to make it more entertaining.

	"Finally, a few explanations:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"1. In level 4, right before the elevator, I intentionally get hit back by the first Linda.  If I advanced the screen any more then they third would have appeared on the left side, and going across and back would cost more time than what I actually did.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"2. The knee and upper-cut can only be performed after landing from a jump or after getting up from the ground.  That's why I constantly jump into the spikes in the second half of level 4.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"3. On level 7, I get hit a few times on the vanishing block parts, such as when I jump into the fire.  I played with other possibilities though, and that really was the fastest way I could come up with.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"4. Towards the end of level 8 and in the final boss I just knee on the right side of the screen.  I realize this is a little boring, but it's by far the fastest way to get the job done.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"5. Getting hit at the same time I administer the final blow was intentional.  If people don't like it though I can take it out.
