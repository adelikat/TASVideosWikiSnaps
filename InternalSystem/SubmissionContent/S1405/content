	"The main reason for this improvement is better gameplay at the castle, which constitutes over half the movie length. For example, there was a lot more abuse of the "sliding crouching punch" bug, which enables me to walk off ledges without falling for a short while, or to crawl without slowing down. The bug was present on the previous run, but underused.
	$LF
	"About 3 seconds of the improvement was simply because of frame advance. The other movie was really old, and frame counter/advance wasn't used (I believe it wasn't available at the time).

	"Most janken matches are skipped by pausing the game right after the opponent has finished talking. It's a bug.
