	"A long, long time ago the World was in an age of Chaos. In the middle of this chaos, in a little kingdom in the land of Hyrule, a legend was being banded down from generation to generation, the legend of the "Triforce"; golden triangles possessing mystical powers.

	"One day, an evil army attacked this peaceful little kingdom and stole the Triceforce of Power. This army was led by Gannon, the powerful Prince of Darkness who sought to plunge the World into fear and darkness under his rule. Fearing his wicked rule, Zelda, the princess of this kingdom, split up the Triforce of Wisdom into eight fragments
	$LF
	"and hid them throughout the realm to save the last remaining Triforce
	$LF
	"from the cluthes of the evil Gannon. At the same time, she commanded
	$LF
	"her most trustworthy nursemaid, Impa, to secretly escape into the land and go find a man with enough courage to destroy the evil Gannon.
	$LF
	"Upon hearing this, Gannon grew angry, imprisoned the princess, and sent out a party in search of Impa.

	$LF
	"herself surrounded by Gannon's evil henchmen. Cornered! What could

	"All was not lost. A young lad appeared. He skillfully drove off

	"Gannon's henchmen, and saved Impa from a fate worse than death.
	$LF
	"His name was Link. During his travels he had come across Impa and
	$LF
	"Gannon's henchmen. Impa told Link the whole story of the princess Zelda and the evil Gannon. Burning with a sense of justice, Link resolved to save Zelda, but Gannon was a powerful opponent. He held the Triforce of Power. And so, in order to fight off Gannon, Link had to bring the scattered eight fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom together to rebuild the mystical Triangle.

	"Gannon and save the Princess Zelda? Only your skill can answer that
	$LF
	"question. Good luck. Use the Triforce wisely.
