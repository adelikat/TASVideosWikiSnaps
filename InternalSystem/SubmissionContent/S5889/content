	"Capsule warps: in this hack there are no bosses, only the capsule is directly at the end of the level, since there is no boundary limit the capsule can be recharged and used again, this executes some extra code in the game that is present in the normal S2 but not can be executed (because in the default S2 the boundary is activated), this makes it possible to skip some levels.

	": So what is this run up to? You left the intended path of holding right and managed to get right faster by not holding right as much. I would be down for accepting this movie if you had at least left the up button pressed down for much longer than that. Right, but that didn't happen so we have to move on. If we had to rank the hacks, this one would be far down on the list in terms of variety and quality.
