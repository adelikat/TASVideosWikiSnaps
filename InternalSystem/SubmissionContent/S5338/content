	"The World Tree is in shambles, and you (henceforth named the Faxanadude) return home to figure out what to do about it.  Doing something about it involves dying, talking to the King, climbing a tower, dying again, pestering some old dudes to do their jobs and get the fountains flowing again, entering the World Tree and suffering through the poison mist, dying again, talking to some other dude for a key, running around the branches of the World Tree to collect

	"It's done.  It's finally done.  I've asked so many questions about this game along the way:
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" Can I skip all of the enemies until Forepaw and just farm up there?  No.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Can I just use magic all the way and then get the Glove and use it to farm?  No.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Can I get a second pair of Wing Boots and sell them to buy the Long Sword and save time?  No.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Is there somewhere I could sell a potion at a reasonable profit to save time?  No.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Can I clip through walls?  Yes, but it is useless.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Hey, what's this box at the ... oh.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"I started the run after reading a bit of the source code (thanks to sp's partial disassembly of the game) and discovering that some enemies can be manipulated to face left or right by knowing the current state of RNG and pressing A on the frame where RNG is queried.  That turned into an 18 frame savings against Lord Tom's run, but threw off RNG for the entire rest of the run, meaning that enemies decided to be less helpful (until convinced otherwise).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I also started the run with the idea of getting together enough Golds to buy the Long Sword and use it for the rest of the run.  However, everything I tried turned out to be a lot slower.  Getting a second pair of Wing Boots in the Tower of Fortress (just after Forepaw) was promising, but set me back quite a ways, and then buying the actual sword and selling the boots cost me nearly thirty seconds overall.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The biggest time save in the run came about a month ago, when I was describing my Lua script to someone in my Twitch channel, had to restart playback, and realized that there was a hitbox on the first screen of the game.  Building up enough speed to jump over it, I avoided the introduction to the game and saved 12 seconds.  That gave me the motivation I needed to power through every other setback and get this finished.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"It should be noted that the rerecord count is incredibly low - seeing as the file that ultimately finishes the game is called Faxanadu v13.tasproj, I had a few false starts.

[p 
	"As discussed above, there is a hitbox that falls from the top of the screen; building up sufficient speed lets you jump over it and save 12.5 seconds when optimized.
	$LF

[h4 
	" RNG Manipulation
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Some enemies (not all of them) advance RNG when they have to make a decision.  By holding or not holding A during this RNG poll, you can influence the direction those enemies face.  This means that enemies can be convinced to not jump off of ledges, and to not turn around underneath you.
	$LF

	" Enemy Invulnerability
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Enemies go invulnerable for eight frames after being hit by the Dagger (and probably any Weapon) and four frames after being hit by Deluge (and probably any Magic).  These two timers do not count down at the same time -- Weapon invulnerability will count down first, from eight to zero and then Magic invulnerability will count down from four to zero.
