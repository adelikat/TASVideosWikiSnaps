	"Dottori Kun was a game created to circuvent a Japanese law stating JAMMA cabinets were not allowed to be sold without games in them. As a result, Sega created this game in 1990, a very cheap to produce PCB, most notable for its ridiculously small size. (see http://www.jammaplus.co.uk/forum/uploads/5912/DSC02277.jpg)

	"There is only one technique for luck manipulation in this game. Normally > turns automatically at a corner when he hits a wall and there is one avaible space to turn next to him. However, if you turn manually instead of automatically, you will still get the same result and luck will be manipulated. Because of the ridiculously scarce spots to do this (12 per level) sometimes to manipulate good outcomes in future levels you have to redo earlier levels. This game is nontrivial.
