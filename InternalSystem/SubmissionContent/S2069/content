	"I chose this game because I think this game is easy. I didn't have to think about many things (such as route planning). But I have to say it's hard to perfect it. I didn't do well in many places. Although there are many small problems, I'm satisfied because this game is so long but I finally finished it.

	$LF

[p 
	"Movement: I think my way for moving is fast. But I found I can use A instead of LR when cancelling dashing to falling down the platform at almost the end of the game and that will be faster in some conditions ... what a pity.
	$LF

[p 
	"Randomness: that's what I do the worst in the movie. When many small enemies came from left and right, I don't know what to do. I just let them go. Maybe 4 enemies in a group is the fastest way, but I don't know how to control the randomness. The boss fight is also random but I think it is a lot easier to control.
	$LF

	"Buy things: thanks to the game, I didn't collect the chips on purpose but I still got 263 chips after finishing the stage 4-2. I realized I had to buy the battery until I almost got to the end of stage 5-1 so I had to go back to play this stage again ... the battery makes the HP double and running into the bombs is so cool.

	"Start drilling and stop drilling at a certain time: this game's attack system is strange. Sometimes, starting drilling early and stopping drilling early can benefit a lot. I found this after finishing stage 2-2...
