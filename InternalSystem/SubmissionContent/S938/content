	"this games EXTREMELY easy in spite of what the FAQ i read said.

	"the first and third level bosses (Puripurikun & Totto Patto respectively) appear and disappear at a set pattern, nothing i can do about that.

[p 
	"the first boss has to be "struck" between the last blink and when it fully reappears (when its not there). 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"the third boss seems always vulnerable as i can strike almost any time and still hit him when he appears.
	$LF

[p 
	"the second boss and the last boss (Bukku Bakku & Bandora) can be hit so that they never even get to attack you.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"the fourth level boss (Griffozer) looks a bit messy because i jump away and then back in to hit him. apologies, but the game has a large collision detection.

[p 
	"the power coins merely refresh energy, so they're not necessary (from what i'd gathered).

[p 
	"when using the standard weapon (gun), standing is the only position to slow you down. hence why i either leap or quickly duck, shoot and get back up. it may slow it a bit, but no where as much as standing.

[p 
	"the jumping remains at a constant height, sadly. so some of the platform jumping (Black Ranger's level notable) looks bad.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"and sadly, you never truly encounter the green ranger, be it rival or ally (*pauses for a moment of shared sadness*).

[p 
	"and why would you the consumer like this game? nostalgia most likely. power rangers/super sentai is something that most people can remember from childhood or even now (be those good or bad memories).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"why you won't like it? no green ranger to control or battle, no real use of the zords/tribal guardians in the main game, no scorpina/lamia in the main game.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"oh, and the rerecord count being so low... its prolly because i did a preliminary run prior to this.
