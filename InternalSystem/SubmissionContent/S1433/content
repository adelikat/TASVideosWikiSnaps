	"Here's an improved version of the Zelda 2 'glitched' run. I would describe the process of making this movie as 'tedious'. I tried pretty much everything I could think of in pretty much every room to get Link's movement just right. Hopefully it's as good as possible.

	"On to the improvements:
	$LF
	"From the start of the game through the end of the jump cave, 50 frames are saved over the published run. Most of that (I've lost my earliest notes) are from a better overworld getting the trophy, and using jump in the cave.  2 frames are gained from exiting the palace to the left, and one or two frames are gained in a few other places from better movement.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Because of the change in timing of the two runs, the overworld between the jump cave and palace 2 was a nightmare. It seems like I worked on this sequence forever. I wound up losing 13 frames against the published run and I happen to think that's pretty good considering how unfriendly it was.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"I gain 30 frames in palace 2. 10 frames are from passing through the first door better. 20 frames are from using a key on the second door. A few frames are lost getting the key and a few frames are gained from better movement.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Nothing much happens until I use jump to get downstab. I get to the door 8 frames faster, make the teacher appear 10 frames faster, and gain a few frames here and there from better movement.

[div class=p 
	"From the start of the hammer run to getting the hammer, 5 frames are saved from small optimizations in various caves. 35 frames are gained by dying faster. It is possible to get the hammer a bit quicker, but the axe isn't as convenient and the 35 frames are lost.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The great palace was a lot more complicated to make than it looked from the start. My notes are literally just a list of room numbers and frame counts for this level (made sense as I was playing, but useless now). 73 frames are saved overall from optimizations throughout the palace and 10 frames are saved on Shadow Link.
