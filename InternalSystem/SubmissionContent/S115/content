The gameclock stops whenever you take an item and so on. :P you can easily check that in the end of the movie/game :) I can agree if he beats the game at 51 min in the game(Gameclock) and not at real time. And if he did with 100% item collect at realtime, Wow, im impressed.:) I can guess.. or I am nearly 99% sure that they mean gameclock. :)
