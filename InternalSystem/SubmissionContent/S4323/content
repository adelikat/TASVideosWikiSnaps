	"This is a 3 minutes improvement on the current run. It was played on easy to reduce lag and also to shorten some boss battles. Some new tricks were found, as i redid the run. I am hoping this will obsolete the currently published movie and also find a way out of the vault.

	"I had found out, a while back, that you can maintain your speed, by pressing right on one frame then left on the next. This can only be done on the ground so jumping cancels the trick. Another thing i found, while fooling around, is entering walls. This is done only with the safari suit. When you get close enough to it, jump towards the wall. Then go down then jump again continuously. Once you are in the floor, you can go right pretty easily. If, on the other hand, you want to go up, for a long distance, you are better to use the western outfit. When dashing in the wall, you will go straight up if pressing the opposite direction.

	"Spawning the second player, at the beginning of the stage, saves a good amount of time, since she will appear in the middle of the screen. All the lag caused by sprites, in this level, was reduced, thanks to easy mode. The boss has half the hp so 3 2xhits instead of 6.

	"I changed outfits as soon as i got the sweeper, to avoid jumping over enemies. This allows me to keep speed momentum. It also allowed grabbing blocks for the boss battle. Playing on easy means no more waiting for the swinging bars, as blocks are placed to prevent falling. The boss was hit sooner than the previous run, thanks to the blocks. It also gives more damage than a jump hit. On easy mode, he dies in 4 2xhits and on hard, he dies in 6.

	"My favorite boss of all "sigh", the turtle... He has 6 life points, instead of 8 on hard. He can only be hit by 1 player and is pretty hard to manipulate. I managed to make him pop out on the side that i want... Let's just say, he is the main reason i switched to easy.

	"In the first section of this stage, the middle screen spawn is useless, since you need to use the first downhill to reach max speed.Minnie takes the lead, since she reaches full walking speed before the hill. 
	$LF
	"At the top of the tree, an improvement was found. It turns out that taking damage to jump on the spikes (while invincible), is faster than climbing up the branch. The second section was done with one player to avoid the wait and finally the last section was greatly improved, by avoiding most gushers. The damage i take, at the end of the stage, is purely for entertainment, (for all you mouse torturing freaks) as i do this ONLY to manipulate the next boss battle.  
	$LF
	"The boss Has a small improvement also, aside from taking 4 hits instead of 6. I managed to hit him sooner and not take damage. I can't say, how many frames i shaved. My first run was on snes9x 1.43 and i don't think the times are the same.

	"No more suit swapping, to get through the blocks, in the scrolling part, as dying is much more effective. I tried zipping in the ground, instead of going downhill but i never got faster than simply running down. Having a player spawn, in the next section helps the spike to fall faster. You would usually use the "hookswing" if that is a word witch i think it is not. The boss? Well... Spoiler alert!!! There is no boss! I skipped him by zipping through the wall that leads behind him. So... Yeah! A little improvement here.

Only two hits and he is done. I could have started the battle later, to have him bring out his head low, but he would have then started walking. This way he comes out twice in a row.
