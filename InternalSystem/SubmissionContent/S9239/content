However, I know it can be very slightly faster. If I used the spring to jump to instead land on the second step and then jump to continue, it could be done 2 frames faster, however, when I tried recreating it after trying other things, the fastest I could get was 2 frames slower than jumping to the last step directly. I think this was the hardest stage to make just because of the beginning.
