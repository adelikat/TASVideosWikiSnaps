	"Sonic Chaos in 14:28.55 with all emeralds. I felt that collecting the emeralds would be the only way of making this movie remotely entertaining, as many of the strategies used are, while more optimised in this run, very possible in real time.

	". However, the reason for this is that the PAL version of this game butchers the timer such that for the same input it only takes 5/6th the time. I elected to use the NTSC version, which provides a faster and (hopefully) more entertaining movie.

	"Additionally, the timer in this game acts similarly to the one in Sonic 2 (carries over subseconds from previous levels) so that can add on up to an additional second.

	"This game moves a bit faster than Sonic 1 and 2 for the SMS/GG, as Sonic gains two new moves: the spindash (down+1) and the peelout (up+1). The peelout is faster, but has its disadvantages, namely, you cannot roll once you start a peelout until you either jump or brake (or get hit, I suppose, but that's just a more extreme form of braking :P).

	"Oh, and as with many Sonic runs on this site, bonus screens take up way too much time. It's not as bad as either of the first two games though.

	": When planning my special stage route, there were three certainties: Sleeping Egg 2, Aqua Planet 1 and Aqua Planet 2. All three had 100 rings practically on the TA path, which made planning very easy. The next two were trickier; I opted for Electric Egg 1 which has a row of six ring boxes, even though collecting them is rather slow, and this. This level required a very specific route to get the 30 loose rings in addition to the easy seven ring boxes.
