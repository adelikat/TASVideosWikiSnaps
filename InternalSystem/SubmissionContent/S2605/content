	"This game moves a bit faster than Sonic 1 and 2 for the SMS/GG, as Sonic gains two new moves: the spindash (down+1) and the peelout (up+1). The peelout is faster, but has its disadvantages, namely, you cannot roll once you start a peelout until you either jump or brake (or get hit, I suppose, but that's just a more extreme form of braking :P).

	": When planning my special stage route, there were three certainties: Sleeping Egg 2, Aqua Planet 1 and Aqua Planet 2. All three had 100 rings practically on the TA path, which made planning very easy. The next two were trickier; I opted for Electric Egg 1 which has a row of six ring boxes, even though collecting them is rather slow, and this. This level required a very specific route to get the 30 loose rings in addition to the easy seven ring boxes.
