		" Keys are optional: due doors being objects and not tiles, its physics had some issues in 1.0, you can clip into them with some clever statue positioning and completely skip taking its respective key;

		" A normal jump, holding A til its peak, can move you up to 0x1F pixels and 0xC subpixels in Y, but if you hold A for 7~16 frames, then release for 1~5 frames, then hold A again, you can reach a bit higher, up to 0x23 pixels and 0xB subpixels if done optimally. This alone can sometimes save a character swap, and other times can be combined with character swap grid snap to reach higher places. I found this trick at level 19, so I redid a bunch of previous levels and managed to save 48 frames overall;
