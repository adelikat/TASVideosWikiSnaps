	(__wikiLink|displaytext=my TAS|href=/4563S)
	" from several years ago in this hack was accepted today, I concluded that it's worth submitting this other TAS as well :)

	"This is Super Mario Bros. Enhanced glitchfest/playaround. I don't have much to comment on here. It's just me playing around, doing crazy things and some glitches with everything the hack gives me. This TAS does not cover all the levels (because otherwise it would be too long), but it has a good part of them. Things get even stranger when I manage to catch Yoshi (there is no Yoshi before world 9). And that's it. Have fun and laugh, if possible :)

	": Very entertaining tas making full use of bugs and tricks from both the original Super Mario World and this Super Mario Bros: Enhanced Edition.  A massive amount of playing around is down in almost every level to an impressive extent and when yoshi comes in the glitches start intensifying.  This has good feedback from watchers and is an easy accept for me. Note that I am changing the goal from "glitchfest" to "playaround" since that is the typical goal name and will help people searching for playaround tases.
