	"VVVVVV is a 2D platformer where you flip the gravity to rescue your crew members. There are 20 collectable "Shiny Trinkets" hidden throughout the game. There is also a no death mode which cuts off your gameplay if you die once.

	"As the no death mode disables all cutscenes and dialogues (which you wouldn't be able to read anyways), I'll briefly explain the plot:

	"You play as Viridian who is the Captain of a spaceship. Suddenly there is a "dimensional interference" and the Captain and his crew try to escape through a teleporter. Unfortunately everyone is sent to a different location and it is your job to rescue the crew members.

[p 
	"The game allows you to flip even one frame after you left the ground, which might be the reason why you can go through inversion planes (the lines that flip you automatically) when they are close to the ground.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Platformers usually set your speed to 0 once you hit an obstacle, VVVVVV is a bit different.
	$LF
	"Your speed is adjusted to the distance to the obstacle. For horizontal movement that means if it is 5 blocks away, your speed is set to 5.0. If now the obstacle is away (e.g. you got past it because you were moving vertically, too) your next speed will be 6.0 and you didn't lose time even though you hit the obstacle!
	$LF

[p 
	"The same goes with vertical movement to the point where it can actually save time to slow down horizontally (usually when there are small stairs).
