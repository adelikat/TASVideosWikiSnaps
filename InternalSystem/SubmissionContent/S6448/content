	"At first glance it looks like a pleasant wooded glade on a peaceful, mild day. Watch out! It's a giant spider! RUN! You don't know how it happened;you don't know how you got here, but, unfortunately, you've wandered into the FORBIDDEN FOREST! You'll find a bow in your hand and a quiver full of arrows on your back, as well as four more full quivers on the ground beside you. You're going to need them. The Forbidden Forest is a place on this world but certainly not of this world. It is a place of unrelenting terror and trial. It is ruled by the dreaded Demogorgon demonic king of monsters. He will send in his horde of grisly creatures against anyone who dares enter his realm. And if by some miracle, or your own skill, you should vanquish his army, you will have to face the Demogorgon himself. A word of encouragement: no one has ever returned from the Forbidden Forest alive!
	$LF
	"There are five different areas of the forest in which to do battle and you may enter any one of them at any time by running in either direction as they flow into each other, creating one large forest. The moon slowly crosses the sky as you go from late afternoon to the dead of night. Together, these features offer multiple and varied environments. Within this ever changing arena, you will face four increasingly difficult levels of adventure with seven different challenges in each level. Fight your way through bloated bees and winged dragons and killer skeletons, and more, to come face to face with the ultimate terror- the Demogorgon!

After redoing this level multiple times, I discovered that I could not improvement my time cut...even though measures were taken to shot frogs earlier. This is when I decided to research a RAM address that counted enemy kills. After about 2 days of research, I discovered 0x41...which kept a running total throughout the game. My discovery turned out to be very interesting, as there were times that I was killing two frogs at once...without the visual evidence. It was at this point that I redid the stage for the last time, where 2 kills with one arrow was an absolute must.

I made this discover after trying to redo one of the kills and noticed that the death scene went much longer than my previous attempt. That is when i started trying to understand the situation and it appears that a certain percentage of his body must be removed before the scene ends. Well, I affected his RNG during the cut scene and was able to cut off 100's of frames for each kill.
