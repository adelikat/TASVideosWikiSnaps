Only real optimization here is jumping off the boat early and jumping off one of the billboard poles to hit the level end trigger from below the platform, rather than doing the intended wallrun across the billboard.

	"The goal on this level is simply to obtain text storage and leave, the fastest way to do that is to skip the factory interior (the walljumps you see from the blue ramp) and talk to the NPC Grick through the wall. This enters the grick dialogue and drops Noid to his death, allowing him to move around with a text box up after respawning, something not normally possible. Once I've obtained text storage I can simply leave the level.

	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Clamp is the name of the function that runs whenever Noid enters the grounded state. Normally this is a way to track Noid's position relative to the center of the object he's standing on. When finishing a dialogue, the Noid is put into the grounded state for 1 frame, no matter if he's actually grounded or not. In that one frame, the clamp function runs, but because the Noid isn't really standing on anything, the offset from the last thing he stood on is applied to whatever is currently directly underneath him. This means I can transfer the offset from one object to another and teleport. In this instance our two objects are 'The Entire Damn Level' and the tiny little stop sign. By applying the offset of the former to the latter I can warp very far away. The rotation of the object being warped from appears to matter aswell, hence yanking the stop sign and warping at a specific point in the animation was necessary.
