[div class=p 
	""Amagon, the most decorated Marine, was assigned a mission by his commander to investigate a strange, moster-infested South Pacific island, from which no man has ever returned alive.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"With a machine gun as his only weapon, he took off by plane and crash-landed on the island's beachhead.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Amagon, with his unique ability to transform into the huge Megagon, there begins his mission to become first to conquer the island.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"See and experience the amazing adventures of our hero, Amagon!! His rescue ship is waiting at the other side of the island." 
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"It took me long enough but I finally did it.  I was finally able to redo my Amagon run.  I would like to thank you all for telling me to redo this run, because each time I watched the run I submitted last time, I saw how sloppy it truly was.  I can't believe I thought that would get published.  Anyway, this is the new version.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"I used the edgeboost trick absolutely everywhere it would let me.  I tested every edge I came to to see if I could edgeboost.  If I do not use the edgeboost it was because I was unable to.  Either the ledge wouldn't let me or boosting would result in death.  
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"I used different tactics on most enemies.  I was able to save a ton of time by using frame advance to fire as fast as possible and kill more enemies with Amagon.  I tried to avoid transforming into Megagon as much as possible because it takes over 200 frames just to transform.  Not to mention it is much tougher as Amagon because 1 hit = death.  Megagon was used mainly to kill bosses.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"About Megagon: Amagon can transform into Megagon when he gets the Mega Key. The Mega Key is dropped by enemies you kill. Once you have the Mega Key you can transform at any time by pressing 'Select'. Megagon has health and can take hits as long as he doesn't run out of health. His health is determined by how many points you have when you transform. 5,000 points gives you one notch on the health bar, so if you have 25,000 points when you transform you will have 5 notches on the health bar. Megagon has two attacks: a close range punch and a ranged energy blast. The energy blasts costs health to use (1 notch) but is very powerful. I take out most bosses with it.

[div class=p 
	"My previous attempt finishes the game in 68772 frames.  This run finishes the game in 66456 frames.  I saved a grand total of 2316 frames because of better optimization, using the edgeboost much more often, and less use of Megagon.
