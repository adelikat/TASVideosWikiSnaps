	"Gain Ground is a game about robots killing cavemen and cavemen killing robots, or at least that's what it looks like.  The actual story makes even less sense than that.  It's an overhead run-and-gun arcade game  where you fight enemies in 5 different time periods with characters from a similar range of time periods and a boss every 10 stages.  The first version was an arcade game, the Genesis version has major gameplay differences and also contains an extra round not seen in the arcade version (round 4).

	"Many enemies can be hit by multiple attacks of the same type in the same frame and will be damaged multiple times, allowing them to be killed with fewer invulnerability cycles.  This can be set up by hitting an enemy with a diagonal and cardinal shot at very close range, getting an enemy to path into the shots, overlapping an enemy with multiple shots on its wake-up frame, or having both players shoot it at the same time.  This is used moderately in round 2 and extensively in round 5.
