	"As Wikipedia puts it "The game is a significantly cut-down version of Abe's Oddysee, with only a few similar levels and a condensed plot." You play as Abe, a little dude who wants to escape from being imprisoned, from RuptureFarms. It was released in 1998, a year after the original. The game is essentially a trial and error platformer. The game is composed of 3 stages/levels, with the second being non-linear allowing you choose which order you complete the six stages within the world. Interestingly enough the game has a language called Game Speak, which within this run is only used twice, each time on the same screen.

	"Within the run I occasionally use a glitch, which gamefaqs refers to as "Super Jump" but I'm gonna call it the 
	[em 
		"Pause Jump Trick (PJT)
	]em
	", a programming error left in by the programmers. Essentially when you jump, pause the game while in mid-air and unpause, and the game will repeat the jump animation allowing you to get double the height (if jumping up) or horizontally. In my test run of the game I found some uses for the trick, two of which, I thought, were pretty entertaining, but on my second playthrough I found a faster route (one being only 4 frames faster while the other over 200 frames). Some other 'time savers' were used within the run. If you find a spot you have to jump multiple times in a row, just hold down the jump button. If running off a walkway would lead to dropping down and you need to go the opposite direction, start rolling right before you fall off, saves around 3 frames each time. Another note to mention is that running is the fastest way to get around, assuming you were on a screen with no thing in your way, rolling is 3 to 4 frames slower.

On the second half of this stage I possess a slig and kill as fast as possible. The hanging bags in the air contain rocks or meat. In this case a rock.

The 'password' pipe here isn't needed as it is a 'Game Speak' pipe which tells you in what order you need to input commands while talking to the NPC (the only one in the run). Hold select once on the screen with the NPC and it activates the Game Speak screen, simple order, Up Up Down Down, Right. Doing so gives you a ability to make all the mines on the screen explode. Run up grab the lever, run back down, get the ability again, activate the torch switch then hop into the pipe and exit.

	"A thing to note is the meat/rock bags, when jumping/walking into one, the game either decides if it falls to the right, or falls to the left. So if you go frame by frame that would explain why I stand still doing nothing for a few frames. On this matter, the very last tube/pipe I hopped into, for some reason if you hop into it automatically, it brings you to a different spot than the end screen, so delaying here is needed to do so.
