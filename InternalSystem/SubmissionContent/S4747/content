	"This stage hosts the first Treblor (or “Buzzard”) encounter. Dodging his projectiles is very slow given Jay’s limited movement, so the best option was to gain higher ground. In Easy and Normal modes Treblor is a lot less likely to fire directly at Jay, but rather scatter the projectiles around more.

	$LF

[p 
	"The issue with killing them on the run is that they only accept damage after they’ve begun descending from a jump. All of this meaning that I have to momentarily stop to shoot them, all while maintaining what forward progress I can make.

	"At the end of the stage Jay meets an unshelled Skraaldian. Just before, Jay can pick up the Noisy Cricket. While it is powerful, you only get 3 shots with it. Normally Jay is supposed to be blasted back after each shot, but crouching negates this.

	"Here we are introduced to Vemaxes (the trilobite-like aliens). Their movement is based on a timer so damage is unavoidable in this stage if you want to keep moving (and you do). The death here is specifically done as soon as Jay hits the level checkpoint that respawns him basically where he dies. Essentially, more than two hits need to be taken, all of them after the health pickup in the stage. Why not go back for the pickup?  Well, it’s much slower for one, plus I would have to re-take the damage anyway so the death done in this way saves a lot of time.

[p 
	"The Treblor encounter here is a bit tricky. This game decides to have Treblor above Jay at all times, yet the only way Jay can shoot upward is with that slow turning shot that leaves Jay open to attack. Basically, there’s not much technically with this fight, but it took a number of tries just to optimize without taking damage.

	"The jumping here is a nightmare due to how often you have to jump to get onto 1-inch tall platforms only to fall back off. One thing of note is that the ladders can be clipped onto from a distance to save a few frames per application. One thing that may not be immediately obvious is that the platforms with the fans on them one-hit-kill Jay.

	"The Treblor fight here speaks for itself. The actual boss, which looks a bit like an Ixion, has a set firing pattern based on when the level is loaded. Thankfully the enemy jumps a fair bit which allows Jay to get three shots in during that round.

	"The Noisy Cricket in this stage has infinite ammo. So basically this boss comes down to a game of following Buzzard and pounding him with the Noisy Cricket shots.  After Buzzard is dead Jay has to shoot the cocoon with Kay in it to end the game.
