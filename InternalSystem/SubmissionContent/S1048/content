	"I suggest that if my movie is published, it replaces BOTH of the currently published movies. Bob Whoops's 100% version should be removed from the site because it does not meet its goals i.e. it's not really a 100% run and it does not get the best ending. The quality of playing is also pretty poor from today's perspective. If the movie was submitted today, it would be rejected immediately. I am not planning on making a 100% run.
