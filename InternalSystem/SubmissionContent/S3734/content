	"Spider-Man for the Atari 2600 is a very simple game. Spider-Man must climb a building and stop the Hobgoblin. However, bad controls lie in his way. After he reaches the top of the building, he is sent to the start of another building which is the same as before, but with a different shade of colour.

	"This TAS displays inhumane reflexes to help Spider-Man reach the top. Anyone who has played this game knows how annoying the controls are. This TAS was made to test Atari TASing, but if you know the game, it will be fun. It's also funny to see Spider-Man stutter like this.
