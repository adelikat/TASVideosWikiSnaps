	"Unfortunately, it would appear you are confused on how submissions work on TASVideos. TASVideos does not operate a leaderboard like RTA speedrunners may be accustomed to. Rather, it operates a record keeping database. When submitting a movie to TASVideos, you are asking for it to be entered into this record keeping database. This is often in the form of a 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=publication|href=/Movies)
	". Alternatively, it can placed in 
	(__wikiLink|href=/Playground|implicitdisplaytext=Playground)
	", but that is reserved for movies with esoteric goals; submissions which do the fastest completion of a game, which this submission goes for, cannot go to Playground. In either case, they must follow the movie rule that speed-oriented submissions

	", which allows for any movie file, regardless of whether it beats any records (or if it's even complete for that matter).
