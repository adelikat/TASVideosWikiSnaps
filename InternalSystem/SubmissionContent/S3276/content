	". His run used an improved way as starting a chain with one explosion. This game have a glitch, when you are doing chain you can get extra points (same with chain bonus) by erasing other blocks. So more points can be gained by reducing starting explosion. I managed to gain approximately or over 25000 points in every 13 chain, it saved time.
