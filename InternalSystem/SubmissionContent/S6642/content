	"For RTA play the cycles of the viruses are fast enough that they are effectively random. For TAS on the other hand we can make sure to only bother hitting viruses that will really be effective. Hitting a virus that will die in a few frames and doesn't affect new spawns is just a waste of time. Being effective with shots is the primary source of speed in this TAS.

	"The only real trick is the abuse of the corners. When walls meet at a corner you can shoot through if aligned properly. This includes the room entrances, so it is possible to screen wrap the shot. This is really only used in a couple of places in this run.

[div class=p 
	"Stage 2 introduces us to CMs. There is a cooldown to worry about after you use it before you can move again. I use one in a room that starts with a lot of viruses, then another in the last room. There is one half-tile virus spawner in this room that stays solid unlike the others in the game. Regular shots don't work on that tile, so as far as I can tell a CM is required.

	"The 3rd room I visit I use a CM, there are 2 virus spawners so neutralizing one is pretty helpful. In the 5th room there is a CM I can't avoid, but I use the bounce off the wall to switch back. The 6th room has 2 spawners and no CM, and it isn't wort backtracking or losing the Super Gun I don't think. I do a screen wrap shot at the end of the room that actually saved a cycle just barely.

	"I use one CM before I grab the super Gun, and a second because i can regrab the Super Gun right away. In the 3rd room i shoot through a corner gap in the walls. I didn't expect to death abuse in this run, but I actually checked into i in the 6th room. I grab and use and use a CM, then backtrack for the Super Gun. The respawn point is right next to the item, but with the long animation the death is still slightly slower.

	"I did quite a bit of scripting to find advantageous and effective shots, but the set of possibilities is pretty large. I'd be surprised if there are no improvements at all, but I don't know of anything I've left out. With the rules by which the viruses spread it is possible that individual rooms could be improved and the rest would sync, but it isn't something I tested.
