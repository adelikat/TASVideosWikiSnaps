	"This is a TAS of the USA/Europe version of Pokémon Red, finishing with a in-game clock of 1:41. The emulator used for recording was VBA 1.7.2 (Nitsuja rev. 10), and the run itself was completed over the course of approximately one month. Throughout the run, only three pokémon are collected: Charmander, Gyarados, and a Pidgey.

	"As with the previous movie, this submission is also aiming for the fastest time to become the Pokémon League Champion, and does so 15,632 frames faster than the last. In general, this new time can be attributed to several changes in tactic:

[p 
	"The majority of the manipulation in this game comes during battles. Manipulating critical hits, adjusting damage, manipulating misses, etc. I have tried my best to ensure that all delays are as short a possible, and watching full speed they are hardly to be noticed. I also had to manipulate three 1/256 misses this run: Lt. Surges Raichu, Lorelei's Lapras, and Gary's Blastoise in the very last battle. Other things were manipulated too, such as the location of the switches in Vermillion Gym, causing people to move, etc.

Fighting the Lass is what triggers Gyarados when I return to the lower level. I also use the Poké Doll trick again.

I attempted doing the office building first, but to no success. Although I was able to get through alright, I used all of my Hydro Pumps doing so, which defeats the whole point. So, I did in fact end up having to teach Strength without Surf. To mitigate the loss a bit, I switched the Surf HM up to the top while learning Strength. This had a nice side effect. Namely, that I was able to do Blaine before Sabrina without losing menu time, because the item menu cursor was up near the top when I needed to Escape Rope out of the Mansion.

Once by using the Poké Doll trick to skip the Game Corner completely, and once by swimming to Cinnibar from Pallet Town instead of going through Seafoam Islands. Both previously published runs do both of these as well.
