	"TearRing Saga (ティアリングサーガ ユトナ英雄戦記) is a tactical RPG made by the creator of the Fire Emblem franchise. The game features a lot of Fire Emblem elements and is often considered as a part of the serie. One of the most notable feature is that at different moments of the game, you must split your units into two teams, each of them leads by a lord, either Runan or Holmes.

	"I started thinking about a TAS of this game back in 2013. However due to serious emulation issues on both PSXjin and PCSX-RR, I could not properly do it. I was still able to plan most of the route and also try to figure out how the RNG works in this game. With the release of PSX support from Bizhawk on july 2015, a TAS of the game was finally possible with the main emulation issues cleared (there is still on a regular basis around 5~7 consecutive lag frames, but I don't know if it's a little emulation issue or just how the game works), though it takes some time to find a good RN seed for the map 06 rare event.

Long story short, the game uses 624 consecutive double words to determine the next 624 RNs, and when the last RN is used, it creates 624 new double words solely based on the value of the 624 previous ones. By trial and error, I managed to recreate the way it works. For those interested, you can find it on this lua script :

The capped stats on Str/Skl/Agi for an unpromoted Lionel are 20/19/19 (as opposed to 22/21/21 for a promoted Lionel). 19 Spd is barely enough to double the boss on map 22, and he shouldn't have troubles doing his job on the other maps. The main issue would be the map 35 boss, as 19 Mag Sierra + 20 Str Lionel is 1 point short a killing him, so I would need an alternative method (Mel strat or Loffaru strat).
