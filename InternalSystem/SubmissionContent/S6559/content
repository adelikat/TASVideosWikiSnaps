	]br
	$LF
	"I can't go back. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Why? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"You wouldn't understand. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"What wouldn't I understand? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"No, no, no. It doesn't matter. Hakuna Matata. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"What? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Hakuna Matata. It's something I learned out here. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Look, sometimes bad things happen 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Simba! 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"...and there's nothing you can do about it! So why worry? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Because it's your responsibility. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Well, what about you? you left. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"I left to find help! And I found you. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Don't you understand? You're our only hope. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Sorry. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"What's happened to you? You're not the Simba I remember. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	""You're right; I'm not. Now are you satisfied?" 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"No, just disappointed. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"You know, you're starting to sound like my father. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Good. At least one of us does. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Listen! You think you can just show up and tell me how to live my life? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"You don't even know what I've been through. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"I would if you'd just tell me! 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Forget it! Fine! 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"She's wrong. I can't go back. What would it prove, anyway? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"It won't change anything. You can't change the past. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"You said you'd always be there for me!... But you're not. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"And it's because of me. It's my fault.... It's my ... fault. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Come on, will you cut it out? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Can't cut it out. It'll grow right back! 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Creepy little monkey. Will you stop following me? Who are you? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"The question is: whooo... are you? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"I thought I knew.... Now I'm not so sure. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Well, I know who you are. Shh. Come here. It's a secret. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Ernh! Enough already! ...What's that supposed to mean anyway? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"It means you are a baboon-- and I'm not. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"I think, you're a little confused. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	""Wrong! I'm not the one who's confused; 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"you don't even know who you are!" 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Oh, and I suppose you know. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	""Sure do; You're Mufasa's boy!" 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Bye! 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Hey, wait! 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"You knew my father? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Correction-- I know your father. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"I hate to tell you this, but he died. A long time ago. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Nope. Wrong again! Hah hah hah! He's alive and I'll show him to you. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	""You follow old Rafiki; he knows the way. Come on!" 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Don't dawdle.... Hurry up! 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Hey, whoa. Wait, wait. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Come on. Come on! 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Would you slow down? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"STOP! Shhh. Look down there. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"That's not my father. That's just my reflection. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Noo. Look ... harder. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"You see ... he lives in you. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Simba . . . 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Father? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Simba, you have forgotten me. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"No. How could I? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"You have forgotten who you are, and so have forgotten me. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Look inside yourself, Simba. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"You are more than what you have become. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"You must take your place in the Circle of Life. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"How can I go back? I'm not who I used to be. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Remember who you are. You are my son, and the one true king. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Remember who you are. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"No! Please! Don't leave me. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Remember... 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Father! 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Remember... 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Don't leave me. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Remember... 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"What was that? The weather-- Pbbbah! Very peculiar. Don't you think? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Yeah. Looks like the winds are changing. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Ahhh, change is good. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Yeah, but it's not easy. I know what I have to do. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"But, going back means I'll have to face my past. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"I've been running from it for so long....Oww! Jeez-- what was that for? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	""It doesn't matter; it's in the past!" 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Yeah, but it still hurts. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Oh yes, the past can hurt. But the way I see it, 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"you can either run from it... or ... learn from it. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Hah! You see? So what are you going to do?
	$LF
	"First... I'm going to take your stick. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"No, no, no, no! Not the stick! 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Hey! Where are you going? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"I'm going back! 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Good! Go on! Get out of here! 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Hey. Hey, wake up. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"It's OK. Whoa, whoa. It's OK. It's me. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Don't ever do that again! Carnivores, oy! 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Have you guys seen Simba? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"I thought he was with you. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"He was, but now I can't find him. Where is he? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Ho ho ho ho! You won't find him here. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Ha ha. The king has returned. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"I can't believe it. He's gone back! 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Gone back? What do you mean? Hey! 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"What's going on here? Who's the monkey?! 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Simba's gone to challenge Scar. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Who? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Scar. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Who's got a scar? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"No, no, no. It's his uncle. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"The monkey's his uncle? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"No! Simba's gone back to challenge his uncle 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"to take his place as king. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Ohhh. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Simba, wait up! It's awful, isn't it? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"I didn't want to believe you. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"What made you come back? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"I finally got some sense knocked into me. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"And I've got the bump to prove it. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Besides, this is my kingdom. If I don't fight for it, who will? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"I will. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"It's going to be dangerous. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Danger? I laugh in the face of danger. Hah ha ha haa! 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"I see nothing funny about this. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Timon? Pumbaa? What are you doing here? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"At your service, my liege. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Uh.. We're going to fight your uncle ... for this? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	""Yes, Timon; this is my home." 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Phh. Talk about your fixer-upper. Well, Simba, 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"if it's important to you we're with you to the end. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Live bait. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Good idea. Hey. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Come on, Timon-- you guys have to crate a diversion. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"What do you want me to do? Dress in drag and do the hula? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"If you're hungry for a hunk of fat and juicy meat 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Eat my buddy Pumbaa here because he is a treat 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Come on down and dine 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"On this tasty swine 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"All you have to do is get in line 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Aaaare ya achin' 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Yup, yup, yup 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Fooor some bacon? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Yup, yup, yup 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Heee's a big pig 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Yup, yup, yup 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"You could be a big pig too. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Yup, yup 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Nala, you find my mother and rally the lionesses. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"I'll look for Scar. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"SARABIII! 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Yes, Scar? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Where is your hunting party? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"They're not doing their job. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Scar, there is no food. The herds have moved on. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"No. You're just not looking hard enough. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"It's over. There is nothing left. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"We have only one choice. We must leave Pride Rock. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"We're not going anywhere. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Then you have sentenced us to death! 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Then so be it. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"You can't do that. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"I'm the king. I can do... whatever I want. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"If you were half the king Mufasa was you would neve-- 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"I'm ten times the king Mufasa was! 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Mufasa? No-- you're dead. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Mufasa? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	""No; it's me." 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Simba? You're alive? How can that be? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	""It doesn't matter; I'm home." 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Simba? Simba! I'm a little surprised to see you... alive. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Give me one good reason why I shouldn't rip you apart. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Oh, Simba, you must understand. The pressures of ruling a kingdom... 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Are no longer yours. Step down, Scar. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Oh, oh, ye-- Well, I would, heh, naturally, 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"heh-- however, there is one little problem. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"You see them? They think I'm king. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Well, we don't. Simba is the rightful king. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"The choice is yours, Scar. Either step down or fight. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Oh, must it all end in violence? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"I'd hate to be responsible for the death of a family member. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Wouldn't you agree, Simba? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"That's not gonna work, Scar. I've put it behind me. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Eh, but what about your faithful subjects? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Have they put it behind them? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Simba, what is he talking about? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Ahh, so you haven't told them your little secret. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Well, Simba, now's your chance to tell them. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Tell them who is responsible for Mufasa's death! 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"I am. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"It's not true. Tell me it's not true. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"It's true. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"You see, he admits it! Murderer! 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"No! It was an accident! 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"If it weren't for you, Mufasa would still be alive. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"It's your fault he's dead.... Do you deny it? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"No. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Then ... you're ... guilty! 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"No. I'm not a murderer. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Oh Simba, you're in trouble again. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"But this time, Daddy isn't here to save you. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"And now everyone knows why! 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Simba! 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Now this looks familiar. Hmm. Where have I seen this before. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Let me think. Hmmm... hmmm. Oh yes, I remember. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"This is just the way your father looked before he died. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"And here's my little secret. I killed Mufasa. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"NoooooOOO.... MURDERER! 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"No, Simba please. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Tell them the truth. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Truth? But, truth is in the eye of the beholdllgkkk! 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"All right. All right. I did it. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"So they can hear you. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"I ... killed ... Mufasa! 
	[br

	$LF
	"Problem? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Hey, who's the pig? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Are you talking to me? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"- Uh oh. They called him a pig. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Are you talking to me?! - Shouldn't 'a done that. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"ARE YOU TALKING TO ME?!? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Now they're in for it.

	"You don't deserve to live. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"But, Simba, I am ... ah ... family. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"It's the hyenas who are the real enemy. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"It was their fault-- it was their idea! 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Why should I believe you? Everything you ever told me was a lie. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"What are you going to do? You wouldn't kill your old Uncle...? 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF

	": We usually require authors to pick the hardest difficulty, in order to include additional game stages or make the resulting movie more visually (and technically) impressive, however it isn't the case for this game. Here, the only differences are the amount of lives at the start and the enemy HP amount, which doesn't bring much additional merit to a resulting TAS. In fact, there is no need to death abuse, and the bosses require repetitive strategies for being beaten anyway. So it's fine to use the easy difficulty for this game.
