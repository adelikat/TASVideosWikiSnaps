	"making it go as fast as possible. It is an improvement over iiro2's 
	$LF
	"TAS done in 4:59. I've added fast acceleration and flagpole glitch. In the
	$LF
	"rom I use, there are two levels 8-1 and 8-2 where when you do the flagpole glitch
	$LF
	"it zooms you to the other side of the flagpole. This glitch does not work on 
	$LF
	"any other version of this game including the USA version to my knowledge and 
	$LF
