	"This game has two main modes. First, 3D fighting game. It is famous because FF7's characters entry this mode. Second, dungeon RPG. Structure of floor and dropped item are different in each play. This run plays dungeon RPG. For details about this game, please read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehrgeiz

	": The feedback is rather mixed on this one. I watched this a few times and, it must be said, that this is one of the most repetitive TASes I have ever seen. This goes beyond merely using the same moves over and over (although that is a problem with the battles at the end) as the gameplay consists of the character repeatedly running through the 
	[em 
		"exact
	]em
	" same room in 
	[em 
		"exactly
	]em
	" the same way for minutes on end. The only positive feedback is some who found it 'silly' or 'funny', but this seems to be something of a niche opinion and outwith this there is little else redeeming this run. This is a classic example of a TAS that is too repetitive to be accepted and the votes seem to reflect this. Rejecting.

	"Encoders can use Eternal SPU Plugin 1.41. It syncs well with this run from my experience.
