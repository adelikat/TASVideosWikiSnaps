	": The feedback is rather mixed on this one. I watched this a few times and, it must be said, that this is one of the most repetitive TASes I have ever seen. This goes beyond merely using the same moves over and over (although that is a problem with the battles at the end) as the gameplay consists of the character repeatedly running through the 
	[em 
		"exact
	]em
	" same room in 
	[em 
		"exactly
	]em
	" the same way for minutes on end. The only positive feedback is some who found it 'silly' or 'funny', but this seems to be something of a niche opinion and outwith this there is little else redeeming this run. This is a classic example of a TAS that is too repetitive to be accepted and the votes seem to reflect this. Rejecting.
