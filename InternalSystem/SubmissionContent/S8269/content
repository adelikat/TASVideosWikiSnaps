	"An obscure versus game in the Tetris franchise. The game was only released in Japan on Christmas Eve, 1993. This game is similar in structure to Puyo Puyo than Tetris, in that you face named opponents instead of nameless CPU opponents. It also has a power-up system, whereby if you clear a line with a yellow orb in it, it increases your powerup meter. Every character has a different range of powerups. There are three types of powerups activated by 1, 2 or 3 orbs respectively. The game contains seven battles against the main opponents, one against the dragon (the fake final boss) and one final battle against the Queen (the real final boss), totalling nine battles.

	"Obviously, you want the blocks to be as close to the top of the screen as possible, as it means the CPU player has less time to flail, saving many frames. But you also want to activate your powerup as soon as possible to save frames. I think I've struck a balance here, but I think with better RNG my TAS can be beaten.

	"You preferably want the CPU to end with a line piece, as even if there is a one block hole in the barricade, they will not rotate it. I think it's because in the limits they are given, they simply don't have enough time to rotate it. What fools
