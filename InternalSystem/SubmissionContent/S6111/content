[p 
	"First of all, EZGames and Garbi have started this run back from January. Garbi had made a movie of this category before, and they were improving this game during some months. At the time, I was looking this game for some things, such as finding addresses to BizHawk and a possible way to reach that post-boss exit door of "The Crypt" stage through zipping (I considered this for some years). I tested and managed to reach the door only once (but was different), and soon getting another problem with the blocked acess from the lower path of the boss room.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Since I was interested with this game, EZGames asked me about the project, but I totally forgot to ask him (and this game) because I ended busy working on Cadash (remotivation, and I switched to TAStudio - because TASing 2 players is definitely tough). My plan was to finish on a month or two, but problems appeared starting with the last boss (I spent a month trying to optimize) and the revisions (2 months). Despite painful work, I learned experience with TAStudio I've used not only for this game, but for my future projects.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Back at June 21 - Since this game isn't easy to optimize, I thought that the run would be finished with more weeks (at the time when the "furnace stage" was completed). The Cadash run was pratically finished, so 4 days later...
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"All bosses finally comes at TASVideos! I watched the run, but after the second time, I decided to test some things and ended finding more than I expected. Initially some mistakes, almost everything would be redone because I started to learn the mechanics of the game. During 2 months and a few weeks, the stages were a lot improved thanks to better optimization, new tricks, skips, and even finding some shortcuts!
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When the crypt was nearly reaching the final product, I finally realized that a zip on that wall of the lower path of the boss room can be possible by reducing speed to 2 + perfect positioning and pressing the attack button in order to clip the wall (all of them needs to be performed with a short distance), allowing Gomez to reach that boss! Actually I discovered the possibility a week before, on the 7th room of the crypt. Additional 1m40sec were saved. But before, I decided to finish the remaining improvements so after implementing that skip, only resynching the input would be necessary.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Even without that, the crypt was the most improved of all stages. If you are interested to see the crypt stage without skipping directly to the boss, here's the movie file (1m22sec were improved at the time): http://dehacked.2y.net/microstorage.php/info/1906333843/AddamsFamily-allbosses-improvement-v8.0.bk2

But recently (a month ago) I finally managed to do this, saving 4 seconds but delays the game ending so much that I decided to create an alternate movie file: http://tasvideos.org/userfiles/info/50474140063816859

If you accelerate for 7 frames from a stop, you won't make it to 2 pixels a frame. This would seem useless, but if you stop after you accelerate for 7 frames, and then start moving again, it only takes 1 frame to get to 2 pixels a frame (the counter doesnt reset itself). You can do this with the 16 frames and 24 frames too. So if you optimized the counters enough, you could get 4 pixels a frame in 3 frames.
