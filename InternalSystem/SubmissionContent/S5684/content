	"The SNES RoboCop 3 is a traditional single-player side-scrolling game. It was developed by Ocean Software and had what many considered to be extremely difficult gameplay. Well they arent wrong, this game is impossible to dont take any damage without tool assisting, frames tricks and cpu manipulation. The run is focused in taking 0 damage, but it still beats all the Youtube speedrun times. I will explain every level here :

	"Level 1 : In this level, i had to manipulate the cpu many times to dont shoot yet ( even in the screen ), so i could kill then before i get the damage. The machines shoots a bomb who follows you in the entire map ( i tried to do a run making them following me but in some parts i had no ways to escape it ). Jumping bullets here is the only way to escape the damage. In the Motorbike part, i had to walk back to jump both of them, wasted some time here to keep the non damage challenge ( it can kill you in less then 1 sec ). The boss part is just a wave of rocket guys and those just shoot if you take too much time to react, feels like a bonus game.

	"Level 2 : i could saved some time jumping in the elevator1 before taking the extra ammunation, but i would suffer the wave rocket guys . In the elevator2 part,i had to kill the red robots or it can instantly kill you, i cant jump to the ground earlier or you'll die, in an exactly frame i could skipe the elevator2 part by jumping then and taking no damage. Same as level 1 boss wave, i have an robot assisting me, so i saved some bullets for later. In the rock smash machine part, the only way to dont take any damage here is tool assisting to get the exactly frame to jump and run. I skipped some enemies here because theres no reason to kill them. The boss part could be fastest if i taked the damage in his dash attack to shoot more.

	"Level 3 : Well the only run is focused to dont take any damage, you dont need to kill the explosive mines,in the Boss part, duo to a glitch in his dash attack, i hit alot of times without taking any damage and killing it fast.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Level 4 : I like to call this the Castlevania level, you need to get 2 keys to open the doors and continue the level, so i did in the fastest time without taking any damage . The rats part is the hardest one, i dont know why a mouse can damage Robocop, and if you let it damage you, it can easily take 50% HP in less then 1 sec. I tried too many times here to find a way to escape them and continue the no damage challenge. The Ninja robot boss is only defeatable by punching them, so to dont take any damage i had to stop sometimes punching, still fastest in the youtube.

[div class=p 
	"Level 5 : Same as level 3, you need to survive only, dont need to kill anything. The boss part was focused in a fast way but without taking any damage. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Final level : Same as level 4 ninja robot but its 2 of them, so due to a discovered glitch by me, one of the robot was easily defeated, and the other was no deal at all.

	"Lame ending for a extremely difficulty game, this entire run do a fastest time in the Youtube ( the best one is 25 minutes and taking alot damage ) and the real focus is not taking any damage or dying, i will do a speedrun in the future, but i started doing the impossible gameplay first.
