	"After seeing a video post from Bluslider in the Shinobi Speedrunning forum I decided to experiment with the infinite jump technique he found.  After seeing easy improvements possible I worked at it and got a good portion of it done.  Then I saw Cl√©ment D's TAS attempt on youtube which used some techniques and gave me a couple ideas.  After even further experimentation I found a couple glitches which I used to save more time.   This including two ways of performing ceiling clips one of which I encountered on accident which led to large time saves on 7-2 and skipping most of 8-2.  Here are the most important glitches.  The various states of movement and such may require a graph of some kind.

Here you can see some input reading from the ninja on the other side of the door so I use some manipulation on him so he shoots while standing.  To have that happen you have be pressing ULR instead of UDR in order for the enemy to think you are standing while you are moving forward while crouched.  You have to then go forward enough to hit another trigger to unlock a hidden door that leads to the next mansion.  When double jumping above the traps there is a slight gap that allows me to fire a kunai wheel while I hold the double jump animation.  There is a slight penality when you use the forced double jump UDLRB but it saves more time than normally double jumping.  This hits the hidden 50 kunai pickup and a ninja.

	"When moving forward walking or crouching, damage is prevented from projectiles with a couple exceptions like the last boss's hair attack.  This blocking mechanism can be used to block damage from the red car, although to fully go through the car requires turning around at the last minute.  This trick is also used to walk through half of the 2nd boss.  Blocking will actually damage some bosses too.

This stationary crouching pose if you use Hold State and forward will move you for 1.5 pixels per frame. Alternatively holding the double jump state is better.

However with some Hold State tricks you can be moving while using a backward jumping attack that is normally only seen when you have no kunai.  When you have no kunai there is also a projectile characteristic.

	"While in the double jump state you can shoot out an arc of kunai up to 8.  You can use this multiple times immediately afterwards, but should you already have kunai on screen the number of kunai shot out will decrease.  This means waiting after attacking to get more horizontal attack distance is necessary.  One the hand if you only need one or two extra shorter attack times can be used like in the Disco Ninja fight.  This attack is very effective but under some conditions will cause massive lag.
