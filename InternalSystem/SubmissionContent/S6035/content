	"City Connection is a side view driving game. The game was originally developed for the arcade by Jaleco in 1985, it later received a port on the NES in 1988. The story is fantastic, and oddly specific. You've broken into an exclusive paint store in New York City and are now on the run whilst carrying leaking 10 gallon cans of paint. You must inexplicably drive over every mile of highway in order to make your escape.

The stage number is masked so if you keep playing you'd actually repeat stages 9-16 until the counter rolled over and took you back to the first stage. The backgrounds for the 6 cities rotate and are tracked independantly from the stage counter.

		" Balloons - collecting 3 balloons rewards you with a warp. The warp takes you to the next "stage" (increments the stage counter), but strangely it also tries to increment the background counter by 2. Additionally the memory address that stores the controller inputs is involved in the calculation, so by manipulating with the select button you can get it to increment by 3 instead.

		" Hearts - under certain specific conditions hearts will spawn in Paris. Besides spawn conditions and the sprite the hearts are the same as balloons. I may be missing some criteria, but it seems you need to press B when your speed is 4 or less (while you're turnning around). I'm a little unsure if it requres that you have 0 oil cans.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" UFO - if certain specific criteria are met a UFO will spawn. Collecting a UFO nets you an extra life. Unfortunately the UFO is not seen in this TAS. It looks like you again need to hit B when you have speed 4 or less (not sure about having 0 oil cans), but your X position must also be greater than 0xE0. Also there is what appears to be a shot or kill counter that must be 10, the counter does seem to get decremented sometimes, but I didn't really quantify when that happens.

	"The most difficult part of this TAS is the routing. The route is simple enough that stage by stage details probably aren't necessary, but the high level strategy is to keep turning and changing platform levels to a minimum. It turns out that the best way to achieve this is to work from top down, finishing each layer as you go. The second to last stage in this run is the exception. The stage has platforms so small that you don't have time to jump (unless you do some pause manipulations) because the cooldown animation is still going when you hit the end of the platform.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The other part of the route is the warp route. The warp animation is extremely long. So long that it isn't worth using the normal balloons that spawn when the spawn counter hits 0x700 and 0xE00 (the counter resets after a completed stage). You can manipulate a heart spawn right at the beginning of the stage if you're on the Paris background, and 2nd heart even spawns right after. The early heart spawn makes the warp worth while, even though you're actually only skipping to the next stage (rather than over the next stage). Since we can get the background counter to increment by 3 this means we can warp on the 3rd stage and every 4th stage after that if we want. It turned out to be most efficient to get one balloon in the first two stages and then two hearts on the 3rd stage, but because the spawn counter keeps running across a warp for the rest of the background loops it made more sense to collect two balloons in stages and just one heart in Paris for the next warp. Lastly to end as soon as possible it was much faster to head to New Delhi for once and shift the last warp to the 16th stage so we could end on a warp.

	"If you hold up and jump, you can jump towards the next layer up, but if there is a platform in your way you'll bonk against the ceiling. It turns out that you gain control to turn around about 5 frames earlier when you bonk into a ceiling, so this is used as much as possible to save time.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"You can gain a little extra hang-time during a jump by pausing and unpausing at the right time. This is used to avoid wasting time switching platform levels in a number of places, especially in later levels. Conversely it is possible to us the pause buffering to buy more time on a platform to run out the cool down animation and allow for a jump.
