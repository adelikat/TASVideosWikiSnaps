The only thing I really did there is never going too close where it will show off since it will not show at all. Pressing down before a hit to done a beak attack does 4 dmg instead of 3.

	"Snow race: The goal here is just to reach the end of the level before the other racer. Two-point to note here, you get the max speed in slope (5px) and the end of the small platforms in the middle give you this speed. The end looks slow since I left the slope, it's because letting Donald run to the exit lag the game a lot with the destruction of the small buildings, so I ended using the 'backup' route since it barely lags and thou save 1x frames.

	"As pointed out in the forum thread, there are certain time saving techniques that this run doesn't take advantage of. One is a glitch in the first level which allows you to save about 15 seconds. The other is a movement tech which allows you to preserve momentum off of slopes which can be used a few places in the run.

	"When deciding whether to accept runs with known improvements we need to weigh a few factors: the significance of the improvement, the amount of work it would take to implement, the availability of the information, and whether the run itself looks sloppy outside of the improvement. This run happens to be close to the border of acceptability in a few of those categories.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Based off the runs posted in thread, I would calculate that there's 20 to 30 seconds of improvement with these new techniques, possibly more since I'm sure the movies posted are more concept demos than fully optimized runs. In the TAS world for a run this length, that actually is fairly significant. Enough, at least, to give me pause. I've gone back and forth a few times on whether or not it was enough to justify rejection.

	"In testing how hex edit friendly the run was, I delayed the ending of the first level by a few frames. The run continued to sync until the barrel boss, which leads me to believe levels are hex friendly, but some bosses would have to be redone if the first level were fixed. The momentum trick can be applied throughout the run, however, so levels will have to be examined and tested to account for this trick, which would mean that improving this run is not completely easy or simple. It does seem through a quick look that there's maybe 1 or 2 levels besides the one demonstrated in thread that would benefit. The game doesn't have that many downhill slopes that can be used.

	"As for the information, the first level glitch was only available on Discord and not in any userfiles or dedicated forum threads. I can't hold this against the author for a few reasons. One is the trasitory nature of live chats. Even if Discord has a permanent archive, topics change so fast that it's hard to know if there even will be useful information. Even if Discord were easy to search, the

	"As for whether the run looks sloppy; while the input file does show evidence of an inexperienced TASer, such as being submitted with over 9,000 frames of blank input at the end, having random inputs during lag frames, and using autofire during transitions when only a single press is needed; watching the gameplay I can tell that the author made efforts to have everything happen on the first frame possible. Watching the run and ignoring the fact that there's known improvements, nothing stands out as being obviously slow or suspicious. As such, I can't say the run is sloppy or that no effort was made toward optimizing the run.
