That meant I had to go over to the second gorilla to get Bouncy Wario, but that would last all the way up to where I needed to go comfortably. As a third option I decided to test picking up 50 coins, which came close but didn't quite cut it. So I ended up with the solution you see here. Complete with a higher than usual enemy jump to skip an initial cycle of Bouncy Wario which would've taken about 1000 frames to wear off.

So I'm going to have to go out of my way for coins. This is the only level in which I do this.

	"I know you've all been looking forward to this one. Unfortunately, the level is so well constructed that even TAS tools can't take a significant chunk out of the level. I did manage to skip one room (I'll give you one guess as to which!) and I made a significant break through the conveyor belt room which is probably possible in real time, but for the most part it was pretty standard (if you count perfect jumps up those indented ascents as "standard"). I tried everything I could to sequence break the room with the zapper enemy that has to be thrown but the level would not bend to my will, so I eventually backed down.

	"Finally, two things I'd do differently given the chance: First, I would have waited on the treasure room in "Escape from the factory!" and picked it up on the second trip, when I had to unlock the Factory chapter. This would've condensed the first trip to just flipping one switch (I tried desperately to avoid needing a switch at all, but Wario 
	[em
