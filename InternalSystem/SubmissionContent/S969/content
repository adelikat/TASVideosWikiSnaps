	"This movie is 1 minute 40 seconds (6009 frames) faster than Dan's movie. I manage to avoid the flying creature, so no shield is needed. That saves about one minute. The rest of the improvement comes from better route planning and more precise movement. Also, character movement bugs are abused: I jump through a wall and some stairs. I did not need to manipulate luck, because the monsters did not come in the way when I moved optimally. No monsters were harmed, so I guess this qualifies as a pacifist run. It's a very short movie now, so I hope to see some competition!
