	" is a hack of New Super Mario Bros. released on DS on Christmas in 2017. Newer levels, newer enemies (Or said as asm hacking), newer tiles, newer effects, newer BGM, and much more other newer things.

	"Newer DS is more perfect compared with Newer wii. Especially for tanks level. Now the ground in this level looks like it in Super Mario All-stars.

	"So after the newest NSMB any% & warpless submissions published, I get new skills for shell Mario. Mario can jump on the space when Y speed is exactly 0; Mario can keep faster than 3.0 speed with shell, even to 4.5 with starman. So I used shell Mario (Hammer suit) through the whole run. But there's also some different optinos between native NSMB and newer.

	"1. Mario will be shell sliding when speed is 2.75 in New. But won't be in Newer, He becomes shell only when you press down.
	[br

	$LF
	"2. Mario can speed up more quickly in shell. But it's hard in New, easier in Newer. You must press down at the last frame when Mario on ground. But you can press down only if x speed isn't 0 in Newer.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"3. Mario can keep 4.5 speed with starman in New. But same as normal Mario in Newer. (4.5 on ground, 3.0 on space.)
	[br

	$LF
	"4. Luigi can be selected at any time. And jump higher than Mario. But same as Mario in New.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"5. Mario can jump on space while y speed is exactly 0. But Luigi can't. I tried many times but won't get 0.
