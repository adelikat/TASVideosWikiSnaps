	"movie making was odd. i had done 2 versions prior to this (both incomplete and never submitted) in which i did not take full advantage of some moves (hyper-run/advance). most of it was recorded at 12%, but anytime i used the hyperdash, it was at 6% (even 3 at one point). the game was very fun to make.

	"NOTICE: it desyncs a few times...one i cannot get around is in the beginning. play the movie and it will get stuck in the CONTROLLER OPTIONS menu. just stop and start the movie again. it should be fine so long as you never fastforward or anything. and if you do fastforward, never do it at the beginning or end of a level... it has a thing with what i think is the sound and will cause it to mess up. if anyone can successfully get around the desync in the beginning, please post. im very new to using snes9x.

	"the last 2 bosses i apologize for to some degree. i tried to make the last one entertaining while keeping it quick. however, he has a LOT of health and i had to find ways around it (i think i used all but 1 attack if it means anything). the second from last in the prison was a pain. on the last little run of it, i do pause because if i move too far in one direction or another, he will hit me and i could not get around it but to hesitate briefly.

	"also, if i fall and go splat, i was conserving M points. if i use the sledgehammer for what seems like no reason, it was to prevent falling and going splat. i try and avoid as much damage as possible unless it would cost me time, but in some places, you get set-up to take damage.

	"like i said, i didnt check anything. its just a game that seems to very prone to desyncing. i know its done it at the options screen, in the park area at the beginning, at the last level, and a few times on the level before the last.
