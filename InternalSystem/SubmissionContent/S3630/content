	": Rejecting due to poor viewer feedback. Despite the run (originally) being labeled "pacifist", the run appears to kill much more enemies than is needed, going against its own goals. The viewers did not enjoy that dozens of enemies are killed with subweapons in some stages despite the "pacifist" label.
