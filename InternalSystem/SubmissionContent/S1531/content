	"Chrono Trigger is a phantastic role-playing game made by Square. It is known as one of the best RPG games of all time. The story is about time-traveling in which a group of young adventurers is trying to save the future by defeating a mighty creature called "Lavos" which has infected and destroyed the world.

	"This is again a improvement, and hopefully the definitely last one, of my previous Chrono Trigger New Game+ TAS. Once again I used my own save-file I have optimized for this movie to reach the fastest possible time in this mode.

	$LF

[ul 
	[li 
		[b 
			"Hero of the day
		]b
		" ― He discovered a crazy trick to skip Marles "Candy-Scene" that saves incredible 1017 frames compared to pass it the usual way.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		[b 
			"Inichi
		]b
		" ― He found another crazy trick to lower "Battle Speed" from 1 to 2, which allowed to skip one major attack of Lavos (the Hand Sickles), and saved another amazing 314 frames in the end, despite the battles being slightly slower.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		[b 
			"Bisqwit
		]b
		" ― He found a new and faster way to change equipment through shop windows. It saved another solid 161 frames and was completely unexpected for me.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"And I have another surprise for you: This time I used the "Active Battle Mode" (switching between them doesn't cost any frame) and experimented alot in the Battle strategies in this version, to find out that using "Ice Sword 2" on the Lavos Shell saves another ~110―115 frames! And finally I managed to save even ~10―15 more frames of lag by intentionally delaying some attacks to Lavos.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Except of all this boss fights, I couldn't save even one frame anywhere else. Not till the Lavos fight, and not even in the entire End Of Time scene (in fact, I even lost 1 frame during a screen change, which was unavoidable no matter what I tried), and this despite hard analyzing and testing in every place. This just shows how frame-perfect (other than the boss fights) the very 1st run already was. :-)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This runs completion time is 9:30 (slightly lower actually, but it was rounded up), with a total improvement of 299 frames (or 5 sec) to the 3rd and currently published version.
