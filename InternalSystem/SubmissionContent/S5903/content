	"This glitch, found shortly after completion of the Diddy TAS, allows you to skip the entirety of worlds 1-4! Amazingly, executing this glitch is as simple as starting any of the Jungle Jams, and exiting out. For whatever reason, this tricks the game, and instead of bringing you to the Jungle Jams menu, it brings you to the first level in the last world!

	"All of the stages in this TAS were redone since the DK TAS, and many screens do have slight improvements. I had to use a few less Banana Boosts, since I didn't have any bananas coming into Booster Barrel Skyway. Unfortunately, that means Booster Barrel Skyway itself was significantly slower than in the full TAS.
