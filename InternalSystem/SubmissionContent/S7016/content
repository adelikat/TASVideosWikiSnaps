Three of these frames were lost in the second stage because I had to manipulate some of the enemies. The main menu is the only place which accepts input from both controllers; any inputs on the second controller during the game are ignored regardless of selecting a 1 or 2 player game. A 2 player game is selected here, just like the original submission.

	" there is a line stating "When comparing against a prior movie for faster time, the faster time must come from improved play in the actual game-play segments. For example, gaining time by switching to another version which loads faster, has shorter cut-scenes, or by more optimized usage of the title screen menus is not counted as an actual time improvement. A movie which doesn't have any actual in-game game-play improvements over its published predecessor will not be accepted."

	"However, this segment has an implicit assumption in it that menus etc. will not affect gameplay. This is frequently not true. While I see no issue with ignoring simple time differences between versions, if a movie is well optimized in terms of gameplay but has improvements in menuing, menuing should be seen as an improvement. Allowing one to freely delay the start of a game in order to manipulate RNG would be a bad precedent to set.
