		" Slowing in 8-3? > there is a litle problem in 8-3: after getting the flagpole Mario will start running forward, but because of this screen load error, the last part of the level loads for 2º time after you get the flagpole, which isnt a problem in other levels; in 8-3 there is void just before the flagpole, so that void is loaded in the back of the flagpole and Mario dies at the same time that beats the level, which ends up in a glitch that make the animation of the flagpole go a lot slower; because of this, you have to wait more before touching he flagpole and go slower to avoid this happenning, and going through the whole level at this exact speed is the best way i founded to do that

		" 8-4 .-. > well yes, i also dont get so well what just happends in this level, but basicaly going so fast makes you start loading more areas from diferent rooms for so reason, like the koopas of 2º room for example, and i discovered this included spawning other loading zones, so if you run that far you are able to get to the end of room 3 from room 1 and trigger the load for room 4, which makes you go to the water room; after this there is a point where just 1º room loads correctly again, so unfortunately i was not able to go directly to room 5
