	"This is the big timesaver, found and brought to my attention by the eminent TASer ISM, which saved around 4300 of the 4507 total. It is performed by first completing the first space world stage. You then enter that stage again and play up to the mid-way bell. On the very same frame that you touch the bell, you exit the stage and proceed to die in the sidescroller stage. When you enter the stage again, you’ll end up where the bell in that stage is (I think, in any case it’s very far into it). This would theoretically work in any given stage of the game, but it wouldn’t save any time.

If you think a stage or a section of a stage looks boring because I just fly over it or something, it’s because I’m avoiding lag.
