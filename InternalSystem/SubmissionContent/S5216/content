	"Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus is a follow-up sequel and bonus game to Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee released in 1998. In this game, the player controls a Mudokon called Abe who attempts to shut down several coporations. First, he attempts to leave Necrum in order to visit the places that need to be shut down in order to end the game. But before he gets to Feeco Depot, Abe must leave the Mudomo and Mundachee Vaults: facing Paramites and Scrabs.

	"In the second part of the game, Abe arrives at Feeco Depot where there are several companies to shut down. First there is Bonewerkz who is managed by Director Phleg. After Bonewerkz, there is the Slig Barracks who is managed by Vice President Aslik and then there is the Feeco Exceutive Office which is managed by General Dripik. After going through all those places, Abe finally reaches the Soulstorm Brewery who is managed by the Brew Master. Abe must leave the Soulstorm Brewery Main Boiler and resuce 150 Mudokons (at least) in order to shut down the company. However, in this run and as the headline suggets, Abe goes through the game killing every Mudokon which there are 300 in total and kills all 276 killable Mudokons in many different ways.

	"Most of the Mudokons die in this game is by emotions. If you slap a Mudokon, they'll become angry and they'll slap you back if you slap them again. If there is a Mudokon close by and that Mudokon dies, then the other Mudokons will become depressed. If Abe slaps a depressed Mudokon, then they say "No!" and slap themselves so hard that you'll hear a Mudokon groan getting higher and on the last slap, they'll die and Abe says "Oops!". Some of the Mudokons had to be rescued in order to move on. Others can't be reached to be killed. Dooty did a Maximum Casualties run of Abe's Oddysee and since he didn't do one for Abe's Exoddus, I decided to make one myself. Lostraniero91 did a guide on how to Kill All Mudokons for this game and he was the guy that I got much help from him on completing Oddworld games and he also inspired me to make Oddworld plathroughs and speedruns on my own channel.

	"This TAS is slower to the Abe's Oddysee Maximum Casualties TAS simply becasue most of the Mudokons get killed themselves by depression and there is one secret area that involves waiting for the falling rocks to kill Abe. I believe this run should be published to the Vault for record keeping purposes as Avbe's Oddysee has a Maximum Casualties addition. Exdodus won't be complete without this.

	"Sometimees in this run, Abe will trigger some music glitches. It happens a small ammount in the 100% run but theeese glitches are only temporary and they are quite rare to pull off!
