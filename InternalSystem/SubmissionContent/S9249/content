	"1) Just in checking the start-up optimization before the very first Toss-Up round, I was able to save 30 frames.  Doing so however changes RNG and yields different puzzles, thus the rest of the run won't sync.

	"2) Using the submitted start-up, and checking optimization through both Toss-Up rounds and the first main round.  I was able to save another 30 frames.  Doing so however changes RNG and yields different results in Sheila's spins, and thus desyncs.
	[br

	$LF
	"3a) At least some spins are longer than necessary; I'm not sure if you're trying to maximize score, but you can make some spins shorter in order to save time.  If you want to go for a maximum score, then you'll likely need to do a LOT more spinning and letter "guessing" to maximize the prize results.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"3b) You sometimes spin and guess a letter before solving.  This is not necessary and you can solve right away; meaning that 3a above is moot, and there is a ton of free time save available.

	"Specifically, I'd encourage you to investigate RNG manipulation for this game.  Changing the system time 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=as mentioned by Spikestuff|href=/Forum/Posts/531213)
	", doesn't seem to affect the RNG from my testing.  But, the timing of when inputs occur does affect RNG (i.e. what frame the game is started on and/or when certain start-up options are selected).  Thus, it may be possible to manipulate more favorable actions of the opponents, such as forcing them to lose-a-turn or bankrupt on all their spins.  It may also be possible to manipulate a bonus round solution that doesn't contain any of the RSTLNE letters which would save time of not needing Vanna to uncover them.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Regarding input optimization: use TAStudio in order to ensure that your inputs are occurring on the earliest frame possible to yield the results you desire.  If input delays are necessary in order to manipulate ideal RNG for a faster run, explain those delays in any future submission notes so that a judge won't view them as sloppy/unoptimized play.
