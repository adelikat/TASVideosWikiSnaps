	"Mighty Final Fight is an ancient Act Game likes many Arcade Games.There are much randomness in this game.It looks that everything is unpredictable,enemy's life,enemy's action,enemy's direction,enemy's interval,even enemy's quantity.So Manipulates luck is my powerful weapon.This run is 2724 frames(45.4 seconds) faster than the previous published 
	(__wikiLink|/1062M|1062M)
	".Improvement comes from four aspects:1,better details;2,better strategy;3,better Manipulates luck;4,new glitch.

	"Character：Haggar,the hot-tempered wrestler and mayor of metro city.He is very powerful,but flexibility is his weakness.Fortunately,he has a serial punch:B,B,B,B+forward,B,B,B,B+forward......after level4.It's not necessary to take damage and death.The only regret is that there is no death show in elevator in Stage4-2.Manipulates luck is very hard in this tas,because player must manipulate many elements in same frame.Pause/Start in game can help us do it more conveniently.But Pause/Start will reduce appreciation,so I ban it.Then,Glitch:Dart Cut,I was lucky to find elderly's dart counts as a KILL,this means player can miss a few enemies.Here is the detailed data:
