	"This game has controls that are about as easy to use as the modern game 
	[a class=extlink href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWOP rel=nofollow 
		"QWOP
	]a
	", but predated it by 28 years.  The Wonderswan can be rotated to expose two dpads which have to be used synchronously to get anywhere.  All changes of direction must be held for 10 frames while ignoring the lag frames that hit every fourth frame.  The game seems practically unfair to me and I have no idea how it could even be possible to beat the game without getting hit on a normal playthrough because of places where objects fall at narrow points of the building where there is no way to avoid getting hit.

	"Luck manipulation in this run often required moving in very specific patterns to force objects to fall in places it won't hurt you; it was usually possible to do so while climbing at maximum speed but it was often necessary to move to the side to get around closed windows and building layouts. Overall I am happy with how this turned out.  Potential improvements would include finding better ways to manipulate windows and falling objects but unless an entirely new strategy is discovered I wouldn't be surprised if any potential improvements resulted in more than a couple of seconds.

	"This run was accomplished using 
	[a class=extlink href=http://codepad.org/fOuhBtS2 rel=nofollow 
		"a Lua script
	]a
	" to press a given joystick control combination for a given number of frames (always 10, in this case).  The script was needed because if you want to do something simple like go up and left in this game you have to hit the buttons (I kid you not) Y2, Y1, X4, and X1 at the same time.   Thanks go to adelikat for the first version of this script and micro500 helping me adapt it, after which I expanded it for this specific purpose all without exposing what exact project I was working on.
