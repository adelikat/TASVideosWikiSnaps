	"Chip&Dale is a nice NES platform-game of the famous Disney-Cartoon. It supports 1 and 2 player mode.

	"This movie shows how to beat the game in 10:01 min which seems to be the limit in a 1-player mode. Defeated all bosses as fast as theoretical possible. Tried to be entertaining in waiting periods.
