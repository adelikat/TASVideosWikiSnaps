	" is an unlicensed game made for the NES and Sega Genesis, featuring - you guessed it - 52 different video games. The NES version was published in 1991, whereas the Genesis version was published in 1993. Both versions were published by Active Enterprises.

		"Speed Boat
	]em
	" is game 37/52 in the Sega Genesis version of Action 52. The concept is pretty much the same as Sunday Drive, Slalom and Magic Bean among others. 9 levels of autoscrolling where you have to dodge the objects and end input as early as you can. Except this time, you're steering a boat on a lake.

	(__wikiLink|href=/5650M|implicitdisplaytext=5650M)
	", as that they are a race to the finish line...so to speak, while avoiding obstacles that behave slightly different. This was also confirmed by LGR's statement in his submission. Additionally, I checked the menu...its fine. This TAS also does what some of the others have done....end input early, yet death is not possible like some other Action 52 games to coast out even further on that early termination. Action 52 is becoming predictable and easier to check things out, making this submission easier to judge.
