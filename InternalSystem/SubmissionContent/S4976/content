	". The actual difference is only 574 because I used a newer version of Bizhawk which is more laggy.

	"By pressing left + right + down, it's possible to go down really fast and warp through the level. When reaching the upper platform, jumping makes the level to finish. The problem is that some ofsscreen areas kill the kangaroo, so I have to avoid them. In the first level, that's not a problem, I could go straight down and finish the level. In the last 2 levels, I had to go left a bit. Only 1 out of 3 frames allow the kangaroo to move horizontally, so I had to stop falling in these specific frames to go left in 1 pixel.

	"In the first 2 levels, many frames were saved with the usage of the jumping trick. I thought I had found the trick, but then I realized the previous run did use it in the third level only. I believe this trick was thought to be impossible in the other 2 levels.
