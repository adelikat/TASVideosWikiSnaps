The problem is that some ofsscreen areas kill the kangaroo, so I have to avoid them. In the first level, that's not a problem, I could go straight down and finish the level. In the last 2 levels, I had to go left a bit. Only 1 out of 3 frames allow the kangaroo to move horizontally, so I had to stop falling in these specific frames to go left in 1 pixel.
