	"As with the Donkey Kong run, not much need to be said here either. The majority of the improvements are from a neat trick in Level 2, easy to spot:), but the run is also a little more accurate played overall (about half a second in total) plus it contains a new maneuver at the beginning of level 4. One more new trick is substituting an item for another, for example if I have one bomb and 1 fireball I can turn them into 2 bombs or 2 fireballs, whatever I like. I also tried being more entertaining at the slow boss fights.
