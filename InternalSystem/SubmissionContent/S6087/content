	[a class=intlink href=/3780M

	", it doesn't mean its automatically entertaining either. The audience hasn't enjoyed this approach, because it doesn't seem to compensate for increased lag, by offering any unique mechanics or tricks only available for 2 players. Most of the tame it's the same thing as 1P, just slower. In a few places the second player does help, but not enough to make the branch look unique and outstanding. Rejecting.
