	"This was the first Lolo game for Famicom, but I believe it 
	$LF
	"was actually a port of the second Eggerland game, also known 
	$LF
	"as "Meikyuu Shinwa", for MSX.  This game combines 
	$LF
	"traditional Lolo puzzle-solving elements with some of the 
	$LF
	"adventure elements of The Legend of Zelda.  You dodge 
	$LF
	"enemies, collect heart framers, and grab a key out of a 
	$LF
	"treasure box to clear the room as usual, but now the rooms 
	$LF
	"have multiple exits and are connected in a large overworld 
	$LF
	"instead of being presented sequentially.  An exit from a 
	$LF
	"cleared room serves as an entrance to a new room.  But not 
	$LF
	"all entrances to new rooms allow Lolo to properly solve the 
	$LF
	"puzzle, so the player runs into a lot of "can't get there 
	$LF
	"from here" situations.  There are also rooms where you can 
	$LF
	"get a raft from the treasure chest to sail into the next 
	$LF
	"room.  The raft disappears as soon as you step back onto dry 
	$LF
	"land, but a new raft will appear from an open treasure box.  
	$LF
	"There are even rooms where you can unlock a secret item or 
	$LF
	"ability through a process hinted at by the question mark 
	$LF
	"box.  In many cases these secrets are necessary for beating 
	$LF
	"the puzzles!
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"You'll notice that I reach the final stages from a hub room 
	$LF
	"labeled "KEY 5".  This means I need to collect the 5 keys 
	$LF
	"from the timed sand mazes that appear when I clear certain 
	$LF
	"rooms.  Less obvious is the fact that there are four more 
	$LF
	"timed mazes which unlock the powers of the four gods 
	$LF
	"required to beat the final stages--double speed, infinite 
	$LF
	"magic shots, and tree-cutting.  You need to push a certain 
	$LF
	"emerald framer in the rooms they're in to make the entrances 
	$LF
	"appear, however.  Fortunately, these rooms are warped to 
	$LF
	"from the four rooms connected to "KEY 5" as a bit of a hint, 
	$LF
	"as well as a handy shortcut for speed runs.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The path I chose ended up using only one of those warps 
	$LF
	"(and a good thing, too, because it skips some more of those 
	$LF
	"boring rafting stages), but I found another sort of "warp" 
	$LF
	"based on a programming error to keep this movie from 
	$LF
	"ballooning to an hour.  You see, Lolo can still blast an egg 
	$LF
	"with a magic shot while he's stepping onto it, and once he 
	$LF
	"finishes stepping onto the water tile, the game teleports 
	$LF
	"him onto the flying egg.  You can make him step off the egg 
	$LF
	"somewhere in the room and keep playing as normal, or you can 
	$LF
	"ride the egg all the way to the room edge.  For some reason, 
	$LF
	"the egg trick can only be used to warp to rooms north and 
	$LF
	"west of the current one--going south or east simply kills 
	$LF
	"Lolo when he hits the wall.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"And if you use this trick to go west at the western edge of 
	$LF
	"the map, you end up in a room on the eastern edge of the 
	$LF
	"map, one row up, demonstrating that the room numbers are 
	$LF
	"really stored sequentially.  I take advantage of this early 
	$LF
	"on to save some time going after the second key.  I also 
	$LF
	"went off the west edge of the overworld late in the game, 
	$LF
	"but that wasn't the egg glitch; that was just a level 
	$LF
	"designer's oversight in giving the player three bridges on 
	$LF
	"an island three squares away from the west edge.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Another quirk of the egg glitch is that when you get into 
	$LF
	"the new room, if you push in a direction where Lolo is 
	$LF
	"blocked, he teleports onto a particular enemy in the room.  
	$LF
	"And for some reason, the first step Lolo takes is always 16 
	$LF
	"pixels, rather than the standard 8.  Probably residue from 
	$LF
	"the egg-riding routine, but it came in handy by teleporting 
	$LF
	"me onto harmless enemies to finish the levels faster.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"You might notice that the enemy AI isn't nearly as good as 
	$LF
	"it is in later Lolo games.  The most useful flaw is in how 
	$LF
	"the Don Medusa checks for alignment with Lolo.  With the 
	$LF
	"right timing, I can walk past Don Medusa without him caring 
	$LF
	"at all!
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I used suicide as a shortcut to get a raft trapped behind a 
	$LF
	"stupid one-way pass because that was the only way to make my 
	$LF
	"overworld path work.  Death transports Lolo to the default 
	$LF
	"entrance of the last cleared room he left, or to the room he 
	$LF
	"started in if he hasn't left it yet.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"And a little warning if you try to time-attack this 
	$LF
	"yourself: There's a bug in the sand maze timer that causes 
	$LF
	"the first second of a maze to be shorter, depending on when 
	$LF
	"you enter it.  Sometimes the first second is too short for 
	$LF
	"the player to be able to finish the maze!  If you encounter 
	$LF
	"this, try waiting outside the entrance some number of frames 
	$LF
	"before you go in.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I put a lot of work into this movie, so any improvements 
	$LF
	"that could be made are probably very minor.  (Style is one 
	$LF
	"issue I could work on, I know, sorry.)  One of the biggest 
	$LF
	"variables in completing a level fast is enemy movement, 
	$LF
	"which I have to influence with Lolo's relative position.  
	$LF
	"(This is the main reason you'll see Lolo "hesitating".)  
	$LF
	"Some puzzles just have so many different ways of being 
	$LF
	"solved that finding the best way is practically impossible.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"So all in all I think this is an entertaining movie.  But I 
	$LF
	"encourage other players to try the game and play it all the 
	$LF
	"way through!  See if you can find the map or the secret 1-up 
	$LF
	"flowers.  Better yet, see if you can find a better time 
	$LF
	"attack path!  It's fun!
