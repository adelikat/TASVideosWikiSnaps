	"Here is my timeattack for Magical Quest Starring Mickey Mouse.  It's a basic YB platformer where Mickey searches for his dog Pluto using an array of special suits.  This game has the most pessimistic guide character in any game I have ever played.  "You won't be able to get your dog back.  Save yourself."

	"For the most part, the levels are straightforward.  Running is faster than walking (duh), and so using declines to gain speed is best.  Jumping conserves speed, so whenever im on flat land or on an incline, I'll use this technique to save speed.  I take the occasional hit to save time, but since every level only warrants two hits until death, you wont see much of that.  The only fight I think could be better done is Pete himself, but that would somehow require you to make him stay walking into a corner, which is impossible.

	"There are a few points where it seems like I don't move optimally (examples including a spring jump in the wrong direction and some odd throws).  These are done to either conserve speed or manipulate enemy actions/placements, which saves time overall.
