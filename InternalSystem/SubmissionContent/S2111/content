	"Burger Time Deluxe is another of my favorite games from my childhood. Except that I could never get past stage 1-2 when I was 7. Now with the aid of an emulator I finally managed to beat this game. And I do this as fast as possible ;)

	"The plot of Burger Time Deluxe is simple. There is this bad guy who opens a Donut shop near our hero's fast food. Our mission is to prevent him from doing so. To do that, we have to move our good chef over gigantic hamburgers, killing anthropomorphic hot dogs, eggs, and donuts in the process. We have an attack that confuses our enemies for a few seconds: too bad it quickly runs out, and getting refuels sometimes is just a waste of time. For this reason, I use this attack as long as I can, but I develop dodging strategies whenever possible. Once all the hamburgers have been moved to the bottom of the screen, you win that stage.
	$LF
	"Note that sometimes I walk back and forth without an apparent reason, and it looks like I'm wasting time: no. I'm just manipulating the enemies' patterns. Basically, each kind of enemy tries to reach you in a different way (X axis first, Y axis first, etc), so I move my X or Y position in order to move them where I want to. It also manipulates luck (e.g. the bonuses I get, the appearing ladders, etc). All in all, I'm satisfied by this run. I think I found the fastest route to beat each stage, of course according to the limited number of attacks I can use.

	": I think this game may be publication worthy, in the same vein as the Lolo series, but unfortunately I think that this current iteration is simply too sloppy. I understand that there will be some waiting time to allow the enemies to appear on the various burger sections, but this run looks lacking in the route planning department, and the rerecord count seems to reinforce that idea. I would not be surprised if another couple minutes couldn't be shaved off with better testing and route planning. Better luck next time.
