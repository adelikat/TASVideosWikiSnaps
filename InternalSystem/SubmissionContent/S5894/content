	"The SNES version of this game not only has more stages but has a training mode that walks you through some basic traps and concepts step-by-step. There are no tutorial messages, but the first of five training stages doesn't even have any deadly fall. It gets gradually more dangerous, but things remain focused and easier than even the first normal level. After training 5, it returns to tittle screen.
