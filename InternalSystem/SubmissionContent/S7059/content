When asked for his name for the first time, the only thing he could think to do was scream in response. Too ashamed to correct anyone, he now goes by AAAAAAAA instead of his birth name, which even he has forgotten by now. All he knows is AAAAAAAA. AAAAAAAA begins his Thursday, July 25th, presumably 2002 given the time period of the game's release, as he does precisely one other day in this route: Eating breakfast with his exchange dad Yasuo (who often goes by his nickname of Owner because of his incredible skills at LAN parties) and his exchange sister Rumi (who often goes by her nickname of Milk because of her preferred drink at LAN parties). Rumi has deep troubles with her toast, and after neither Yasuo nor AAAAAAAA care about her plight, AAAAAAAA returns to his room to study Japanese for his upcoming trip to Pia Carrot. He decides to go with Milk, and after having a delicious glass of the white cow stuff, he's taken to the restaurant by Rumi, who has abandoned her toast and will try again later.

Granted, most girls are single-faced. The two-faced ones tend to date Walruses and cuck them with Donkey Kong. A brief talk happens between our lovable protAAAAAAAAgonist and the Thing-Haver With One Face before AAAAAAAA meets the manager of Pia Carrot, Shiho, who is pretty much just me, except Shiho is straight and is therefore a false idol. Due to his incredibly basic Japanese skills, AAAAAAAA ends up accidentally getting hired at Pia Carrot. AAAAAAAA's given the tour by the false idol (hail Straightan) and finally comes face to face with his exchange dad, who absolutely insists on being called Owner so fine, he is now Owner. God, we get it, you got a 360 headshot in Unreal Tournament at a LAN party. You don't have to rub it in.

	"Hey, it's a red-haired girl! Her name is Shouko, and she's stolen Pia Carrot's prized possession, the Incredibly Large Penny! Someone stop that woman! Oh, heck, she disappeared. Missing her by only several seconds is Satomi, who goes through a variety of facial expressions at AAAAAAAA's complete inability to speak Japanese before leaving to chase after the penny thief. Owner has found out about the penny larceny, but doesn't care as his best thief-finder is now on the case. He leaves to go own some newbs, which is different than pwning some noobs. Misspellings haven't been invented yet in 2002. By the time night rolls around, Reika Of The Various Have-Things decides that she wants to have another thing, which is more time in this video game. She quickly leaves to obtain more things, so AAAAAAAA returns home. I think he gets a call from Daisuke, who is another character in this video game. Daisuke is a boy so he is not a route, because boy-routes haven't been invented yet in 2002. God, this is only describing the first day of the first route and I'm already resorting to reusing jokes.

	"AAAAAAAA desperately needs to study Japanese more to be able to keep up with the fast-paced world of "living in Japan", so he wakes and bakes (and by bakes I mean studies). Several hours of studying later, because ADHD hasn't been invented yet, AAAAAAAA remembers that he accidentally got a job and has to work at it now, but it's fine because it can feed his addiction to Pocky and gachapon machines with little collectable figurines of long forgotten Sonic characters. He arrives at Pia Carrot and runs directly into Shiho, and in a panic he spouts out part of his phrasebook. Unfortunately for him, that phrase was "I WOULD LIKE TO WASH DISHES ALL DAY", which begs the question of where he got that phrasebook from and why it had a sexy Mr. Clean on the front of it, and maybe it wasn't a phrasebook at all but an ero manga. Five whole-ass hours of washing dishes later, Satomi returns from her overnight-and-mostly-day stakeout of the penny thief, revealing that she only rarely appears in this route, but also that she was able to return the penny to its rightful place. She makes a few faces and leaves AAAAAAAA to wash dishes for several more whole-ass hours before he goes home and presumably has nightmares about dishes.

[div class=p 
	"The next morning, Shouko calls him to reveal that she has once again stolen the penny, demanding a ransom for it. AAAAAAAA ignores her, mostly because he doesn't know what she's talking about, as he hasn't reached the sections for "Incredibly" and "Penny" yet in his study materials. He has in fact learned "Large" already, but he assumed she was just talking about dishes. Sensing an opportunity to learn, AAAAAAAA goes right back to his study materials and finally learns "Incredibly". Suddenly Shouko's demands make more sense, but not completely! He heads to Pia Carrot and meets up with Plain Clothes Satomi, back on the case. The cat and mouse game continues ever more. Once inside, AAAAAAAA realizes he doesn't know what he's supposed to do today. All he knows is dishes, so he returns to the kitchen, only to be accosted by the big cook lady from May's band of pirates in Guilty Gear. AAAAAAAA gets her autograph, she asks for his AAAAAAAAutogrAAAAAAAAph in return but he doesn't understand her, and he returns to D I S H F O R A L L E T E R N I T Y. At some point, he hallucinates Reika coming in and talking to him, but he's snapped out of it by the big cook lady from May's band of pirates in Guilty Gear. They do not exchange autographs again. Hours later, AAAAAAAA The Dish Boy is finally allowed to return home, where he drifts off into a peaceful slumber after a nice bubble bath, definitely not pretending that he is a dish being washed by himself. No kink shaming, please.

Rumi looks up pictures of old dogs on his computer, because she thinks puppies are overrated. Feeling sufficiently jazzed, AAAAAAAA wakes up and heads off to work, running into Shiho. He prays to not have to wash dishes anymore, and his prayers may or may not be answered! Say, who's the cute girl with the terrible taste in baseball teams? Why it's Yukiko, the chosen girl for this route, showing up several paragraphs in! AAAAAAAA, who is a Padres fan because he also has terrible taste in baseball teams, yells at her in English while she has no idea what's going on. Yukiko does not mind. Being an A's fan, she is naturally extremely attracted to AAAAAAAA, and hangs on every word he says. AAAAAAAA angrily walks off and finds that his prayers have not been answered.

AAAAAAAA has now washed every dish in Japan at this point, and his reward for completing this monstrous task is Reika dragging him to a company meeting. Even Shouko has the absolute gall to show up, laughing about her penny theft. Meeting adjourned, and AAAAAAAA decides he wants to yell at Yukiko some more about baseball. They end up actually having a pleasant conversation this time. AAAAAAAA returns home and receives a call from Reika, I think! In her infinite quest to Have Things, she ends up Having a phone call with AAAAAAAA. All is well in the world. The phone call takes precisely 0 minutes, because Reika is secretly a time lord with dimension warping powers, and then AAAAAAAA falls asleep.

Either that or AAAAAAAA's hallucinating again. Either way, he goes to his school, the one that he definitely goes to all the time in this video game, and upholds the prophecy by running into a green-haired girl. Her name is Saori, also known as Lady Not Appearing In This Game. She takes her literal bag of wisdom and leaves until I end up doing her route later on with a differently-named character. AAAAAAAA then sees Kiyomi, who's so shocked to see him that her hair goes all wacky. He says some vague Japanese phrases at her until she tells him to go away and study more. He doesn't listen. Instead, he goes to the Station to stare at the cool dude with sunglasses that is always there. Reika interrupts him, pulling him into a clothes place (probably named A Clothes Place) because she wants to Have all of the clothes. They're there all day as Reika tries on each individual piece of clothing, claiming she now Has it. AAAAAAAA goes home, wondering if this experience was more tedious than all of the dishwashing. He eventually decides that at least he can play Snake on his Nokia phone while watching Reika, so it is superior to Dish Hell.

Not knowing that he will never experience another July before it gets renamed in 2003 and becomes June 2: This Time It's Junier, AAAAAAAA calls up Yukiko for a pleasant conversation. It's just so... PLEASANT. GOSH. After the third most pleasant conversation AAAAAAAA has ever had up to this point (he will never reveal the first two), AAAAAAAA returns to Pia Carrot, catching Shiho just before she's about to change the name of the place from Pia Carrot to DISH IT OUT: AUTHENTIC DISHWASHING EXPERIENCES. Feeling instant remorse, she changes her mind on the rebrand and offers AAAAAAAA a different job. Finally, his prayers are answered! He's told to work in the backroom and do his best Marina from Mischief Makers impression by shaking a box until something happens. Shake shake! Shake shake! Shake shake! Shake shake! Shake shake! After some solid shaking, Reika appears once again to drag AAAAAAAA into her sparkly pocket dimension. It's exactly as exciting as it sounds. AAAAAAAA finishes shaking the box, and it hatches into a beautiful Boxbird (this happens offscreen). He tells Shiho about his accomplishment, and she's so impressed that she allows him to choose his work schedule for the week. AAAAAAAA, sensing that he can have more pleasant conversations if he chooses correctly, chooses to work as a Custodian for two days, then as a Cashier for the next four. Satisfied with his choices, because they aren't dishes nor the act of washing them, he goes home and takes a well-deserved dish-free sleep.

The whole crux of Daisuke is that he wants to milk AAAAAAAA's sister. Sorry, I mean he wants AAAAAAAA's sister's milk. Sorry, I mean he wants Milk, who is AAAAAAAA's sister. Sorry, I mean he wants Rumi, who is not related to AAAAAAAA in any way. Daisuke talks to AAAAAAAA about his hot sister for much longer than two boys in a visual novel should be talking without kissing, then leaves to go do cool guy things. Speaking of cool guys, AAAAAAAA heads back to the Station to see that cool cool dude in shades. He only briefly notices the couple behind the cool dude, where the girlfriend is quite flagrantly grabbing her boyfriend's ass. AAAAAAAA runs into Yukiko here. Wait, sorry, we're not supposed to recognize her, but the ensuing pleasant conversation is all too convincing. Suddenly feeling conscious that her massive floor-length dress isn't modest enough, Yukiko presses it against her legs and runs off to put on something less revealing. Confused, AAAAAAAA returns home for about a quarter of a second before remembering he has to go to work. There, he begins the laborious task of watering the ground for several hours straight. You'd think he'd have at least aimed for the plants, right? Well, no one told him to stop. Fulfilled that the ground is about as wet as the dishes he used to wash in the Before Times, he heads home for some well-deserved rest.

Once at Pia Carrot, Owner rears his ugly head and talks about his latest K/D ratio, not understanding that, even though it IS a funny number, 4/20 is really not something to be proud of. Owner may be, in fact, Owned. AAAAAAAA celebrates by watering the ground for several straight hours. He still hopes for a day in which he can spend more than a single day doing something unrelated to water. The rest of the day is uneventful, which is great for me, because I can only think of so many jokes.

It's cyclical, this crazy game. AAAAAAAA runs home to provide an alibi, then remembers that work is definitely a thing. He runs directly into Yukiko, taking the kindly presented opportunity for some pleasant conversation before getting to work as a cashier. You'd think that'd be water free, but the only thing that Pia Carrot actually sells there are bottles of water. Samsara (the concept, not me) continues, an endless cycle of mediocrity and, apparently, water. This dihydrogen monotony is broken up by Yukiko in uniform, and pleasant conversation ensues. AAAAAAAA momentarily blacks out, then awakens back at the water stand, serving this same customer for several hours. He hasn't gotten enough pleasant conversation, so he returns to the yuniformed Ukiko for round three. Samsara (me, not the concept) has completely run out of jokes and is no longer funny. Fortunately for you, that has never stopped her (me) before, and will not stop me (her) in the fuutre.

I don't know why this happens. No, really, I don't. It might be a copy-paste error on the guide I followed to do all of these routes. I mean, what? Oh look, it's Shiho, coming to tell AAAAAAAA that it's Bring Your Daughter To The Tiddy Restaurant Day! He immediately fields a family with their young daughter, her dad doing everything in his power to keep smiling and not look at the waitresses on what is definitely the most uncomfortable day of his life. Speaking of uncomfortable, here's some jackass who likes

Anywaysuke, he hecksukes off and leavesukes AAAAAAAAsuke to cashiersuke. Shihosuke calls a meeting afterward to address the number of -sukes not only in Piasuke Carrotsuke, but in this paragraphsuke. It's time to stopsuke. AAAAAAAA talks to Yukiko afterward for some kind of happy discourse, then goes home, pledging to see her in the morning and then frick around for the rest of the day.

Sorry, I meant it's been a few paragraphs since I did this joke so it is once again fresh. A chipper interaction happens before AAAAAAAA finds himself serving the same damn customer for, like, a fourth time now. Dude's a prepper, he's just bulk buying water from his favorite tiddy restaurant to prepare for the end of days at the end of August. More serving of customers followed by a cheerful back-and-forth with Yukiko ends AAAAAAAA's otherwise unremarkable Tuesday.

Daisuke's at Pia Carrot today to deliver lines. He also warns AAAAAAAA that the doomsday prepper has returned for another go-around at the store's water supply. AAAAAAAA blows off the tip, which is less sexy than it sounds, but is instantly greeted by the prepper once again. Rumi decides she hasn't been seen enough in this route, so she's also at Pia Carrot today to deliver lines. AAAAAAAA sells water to the Schoolgirl Construction Program, still carrying their toolboxes, fresh off the construction of (INSERT SOMETHING FUNNY AND NOT UNINTENTIONALLY OR INTENTIONALLY RACIST HERE). Little did AAAAAAAA know that SCPs are not allowed in Pia Carrot, which explains why that weird statue looking thing is always forlornly looking in, and also why Shiho had to bat away an entire IKEA with a broom that one time. Speaking of Shiho, she once again gives AAAAAAAA the chance to change his schedule, because apparently "being a terrible boss" hasn't been invented yet in 2002. AAAAAAAA decides to pretty much go with the exact same schedule.

	"After the trauma of seeing his sister's tiddy the previous day, AAAAAAAA starts his 8/9 off right, by heading off to the station and running into Absolutely Not Yukiko. She immediately runs away, then comes back just to run away again, and AAAAAAAA just has to stand there and be comfortable with the fact that he didn't get ANY. Unfortunately for this submission text, nothing eventful or funny happens for the rest of the day. Like a Fortnite player who hates Gabe Newell, I'm really starting to lose steam at this point. So's AAAAAAAA, because he falls back asleep immediately on 8/10. Prepper's back. After several hours, AAAAAAAA tells the prepper to frick off so he can have some wonderful talktimes with Yukiko. Prepper waits patiently off to the side, then immediately harasses AAAAAAAA again for another several hours. AAAAAAAA is devAAAAAAAAstAAAAAAAAted by this, and seeks comfort and glorious word-mouthings from Yukiko. They might be dating at this point? Hell if I know, I couldn't get the translation patch to work. Wait, no, I just ruined the bit. Awwwwwwwwwwww heck.

	"Never forget 8/11, guys. AAAAAAAA is studying whether or not that thing with typing "NYC" in Wingdings is intentional or not while Rumi uses his computer to play porn games. I'm probably not joking about the porn games thing, that's genuinely part of the game and not part of the bit I'm doing for this route. Hey look, it's Shouko! She laughs in AAAAAAAA's face and shows off her solid gold blouse that she bought after pawning off the Incredibly Large Penny. She's never seen again for most of the rest of the day. Rumi steals 2000 yen from AAAAAAAA in the same way that Virgil stole $10 from OOC. Later that night, Owner pulls the non-Shiho staff into a separate room in order to try and turn them all against her. He claims that she dissed Master Chief (his best friend) to his face, and that as Pia Carrot's owner, there is a zero tolerance policy for disrespecting Halo. Meanwhile, AAAAAAAA and Yukiko don't even get chairs and are forced to just squat awkwardly in place. Remember Satomi? Me either.

Room barges into AAAAAAAA's Rumi to stare at him while he studies, not moving, speaking, blinking, or existing. This was a squat-based hallucination, actually. The entire day was, in fact. AAAAAAAA wakes up on 8/13 and immediately calls Yukiko again, for some amusing tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte, though it is THIS game, so it's more of a tiddy-AAAAAAAA-tiddy. At Pia Carrot, AAAAAAAA is charmed by ventriloquist act for several hours. He has no idea why the ventriloquist's hand had to be THERE on the young girl dummy, but it really worked out well! They even do an encore at AAAAAAAA's insistence! After work, Yukiko finally makes a facial expression other than "pleasant". AAAAAAAA is thrown so far for a loop that I can't even come up with a funny turn of phrase for it.

	"8/14 marks the fact that there's only two weeks left in the game! AAAAAAAA panics and causes a small earthquake at the station, summoning Kensuke of the Birdlike Hair from the aether to continuing both being and looking like a jackass. Well, that's a shame. Speaking of shame, AAAAAAAA heads off to work. Shiho shi-happens. The world's most prepared prepper returns for another great cameo appearance. This is the part of the route I like to call "all this stuff has happened a thousand times before and I can't make up anything new and funny about it". Narratives are hard to maintain when none of the friggin' characters show up often enough to warrant maintenance! 8/15 begins with another trip to the thesaurus, so I can come up with the phrase amiable duologue, which is an okay name for a band, and ends with Rumi getting rejected for the first of 8 times in a row. Strap in y'all, you're not gonna see the event attached to this for another few hours of actual real life time. That's not part of the bit. That's real. After a good-humored parley to start 8/16 off right, AAAAAAAA is greeted at work by (scrolls back up to find her exact phrasing) the big cook lady from May's band of pirates in Guilty Gear, who tells him that the ground has been awfully dry lately. Time to correct this injustice! Ground thoroughly watered and the plants all dying in the background, AAAAAAAA returns home to greet the succubus, then heads off to sleep.

Yukiko makes her appearance, cosplaying as Daisuke, and it is the most realistic costume AAAAAAAA has ever seen! Fantastic! AAAAAAAA is mystified by this until he looks slightly off to the left and clearly sees Yukiko in a different costume, looking as forlorn as that weird statue thing that isn't allowed in Pia Carrot. I guess that actually IS Daisuke, then. Shame, really. AAAAAAAA pretends not to see Yukiko in distress and goes off to work. That ground ain't gonna water itself! After setting up the world's most painful slip n' slide, AAAAAAAA returns home for a rest well-earned (but not deserved).

She asks for help, but AAAAAAAA realizes that he has a girl's heart to win over, so he returns to Comiket to chase down Yukiko. This is probably a really important scene in the actual canon of the game, so I won't make fun of it. I will make fun of the fact that AAAAAAAA returns to making the ground wet right afterward, though, because that will never not be funny to me. Shiho calls a meeting to address the lack of chairs for AAAAAAAA and Yukiko, which both of them have mixed feelings about for obvious reasons. The two discuss this afterward in what can only be described as me realizing my internet is acting up so the thesaurus doesn't wanna load for me, but I'm sure it was some sort of affable engagement.

	"The morning of 8/19 is one long, congenial chat that transcends a phone call and flies headlong into the real world. It's broken up by AAAAAAAA realizing he has to go home at some point so he can take a call from Shiho. Could they have talked at Pia Carrot, given that he was there all day? Absolutely not. Shut up. AAAAAAAA and the A's fan talk telepathically in their sleep overnight, then have another phone chat on the morning of 8/20 before AAAAAAAA has to actually go into work and not just spend the entire day there doing nothing but having a jolly powwow. Shiho asks about the green-panted person standing at the water selling station and speaking in tongues, AAAAAAAA lets out a sigh and deals with the prepper for another few hours. Reika decides she needs to Have another on-screen appearance in this route before fricking off to her pocket dimension to let the prepper buy out the rest of Pia Carrot's extremely scarce water supply. Unsure if any further water exists in Japan, AAAAAAAA goes outside and sees Shouko, the thirstiest woman. That's it. That's the joke. The penny thing got really played out already. I've been fresh out of jokes since, like, 8/4 and I still have so much more to write. Hi Rumi, you did a thing, huh?

He begins sleepwalking, because I haven't used that joke yet, and runs into the big cook lady from May's band of pirates in Guilty Gear, because I have used that joke already. Speaking of jokes I've used, there's the prepper again! My favorite character! I guess!

I think that's drama and the long ensuing conversation that only happens on this route is definitely intrigue. Perhaps we can get the third thing? Some tiddy, perchance? No. Just some conversations. Plainclothes Satomi makes an appearance. Remember her? Neither do I. Jackass (not the secret best character in NieR: Automata, but Kensuke) was exciting, but perhaps 8/23 will bring something even MORE exciting! It starts with the most exciting of things: A nap! It continues into the next most exciting of things: An engaging talkfest! The excitement continues as AAAAAAAA blindly says yes to something that Shiho asks him!

I'm really happy with the result! This beats the RTA record by several years, and exploits a new glitch that I'm calling the MotherHeart Strat, which is repeatedly talking to a girl's mom until the girl herself falls in love with you. The fastest mom I could get access to was Kaori, the fulltime dishwasher at Pia Carrot, who has a daughter about my age named Yukari. The tradeoff here, as you can see by the category, is that, well... Her daughter's too innocent for the "NSFW" good ending. I minimized my time spent in the run by minimizing the time I actually spent talking to Yukari, only managing to talk to her a handful of times before the end of the run, manipulating her dialogue to be as short as possible by responding to her in ways that made her happy but also ended the conversation. It really helps that she's shy, a more talkative girl would have cost me a ton of time.

Both plan to start their careers in the city - she as a journalist, he as a political consultant. Presumably they are both successful, because they live in those apartments that only people in the movies can afford, but their professional lives are entirely off-screen.

They keep on meeting until they realize that they like one another, and they become friends - even though on their very first cross-country trip, Yusuke warned Satomi that true friendship is impossible between a man and a woman, because the issue of sex always gets in the way.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The movie apparently believes that - and it also suggests that the best way to get rid of sex as an issue is to get married, since married people always seem too tired for sex. That and other theories about sex and relationships are tested as if Yusuke and Satomi were proving grounds for Cosmopolitan, until finally, tired of fighting, they admit that they do love one another after all.

	"The movie was written by Nora Ephron, and could be a prequel to her novel and screenplay "Heartburn," which starred Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep in the story of a marriage and divorce. But this marriage seems headed for happier times, maybe because most of the big fights are out of the way before love is even declared.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Yusuke is played by Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan is Satomi, and they make a good movie couple because both actors are able to suggest genuine warmth and tenderness. This isn't a romance of passion, although passion is present, but one that becomes possible only because the two people have grown up together, have matured until they can finally see clearly what they really want in a partner.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Ephron's dialogue represents the way people would like to be able to talk. It's witty and epigrammatic, and there are lots of lines to quote when you're telling friends about the movie. The dialogue would defeat many actors, but Crystal and Ryan help it to work; their characters seem smart and quick enough to almost be this witty. It's only occasionally that the humor is paid for at the expense of credibility - as in a hilarious but unconvincing scene where Satomi sits in a crowded restaurant and demonstrates how to fake an orgasm. I laughed, but somehow I didn't think Satomi, or any woman, would really do that.

	"I mentioned earlier that the game has time-saving luck manipulation in it: This happens in every route: Between 8/10 and I believe 8/20, there is a random (yet significantly high) chance that Rumi will barge in at the end of a day and ask if you want to buy hints off of her. While useful for people who are, y'know, actually playing the game normally and not spending hours upon hours TASing it like some kind of dumb idiot who's trying to play up to a self-bestowed title that doesn't actually fit her, these scenes actually waste a good few seconds each, and it could potentially happen somewhere around 90 different times throughout this run, so I save several minutes of time by wasting a few frames in order to not trigger them.

	"Rumi's route has a little actual gameplay in it, namely a find-the-difference puzzle that rewards you with some ass. Video games are art. It also has one more piece of luck manipulation in it: One thing required for her ending is to plow through a bunch of "dirty games" and "dirty comics". Remember last Spring in Yukiko's route where I made some offhand remark about the Comiket security guards giving you porn? Yeah, that's an actual thing, they give you the "dirty comics" that you're required to read, and you get them by essentially following Rumi around at Comiket and being mistaken for a pervert when you're actually just her actual brother. I did actually play through this route translated just to make sure there was no actual disgusting content involving her, and apart from the classic trope of walking in on her changing and a few seconds of some nipple slipple, there is in fact nothing weird going on behind the scenes as it were. That's in Kiyomi's route. Anyway, one of these "dirty" things actually can trigger two separate things, one of which is longer than the other, so naturally I take the shorter one. Thank God this isn't publishable.

	"Since the joke here is that this section is completely straight (unlike me, llllllllllllladies), I might as well go on a Gunstar-level vamp about my time with this game, because I kinda regret doing it. Not because I'm a prude, I'm clearly not, I mean I'm literally submitting pornography to Tool-Assisted Speedrun videos dot org for frick's sake, but because in the final days before April Fools' Day I'm starting to have a huge amount of second thoughts about even submitting it. It's the end of March at the time I'm writing this section, the run's been finished since March 11th, I'm about 46000 characters into this submission text with most of the s-posty sections still completely unwritten, and after playing through a few of the routes translated for some joke inspiration, I found that... Honestly, there's some kinda deep stuff in it. Stuff that, now that I know the context, makes it REALLY hard for me to joke around about it, and deeply uncomfortable to look back at my previous jokes where I was blissfully unaware about what was going on. Granted, after writing that, I went back and added about 23000 more characters to the text by finishing things up, and yes, that does in fact bring me up to 69000 (nice-thousand), but it took me specifically NOT playing through any other route translated to be able to pull it off. I was going to play through every route translated and give basic summaries down here, but... I dunno. The translation patch is buggy and kinda poorly written and given that a full route when TASed takes anywhere between 25-30 minutes, it takes too long to really be worth it in the end, and all it would really accomplish is that I'd come back and reread this down the line and just remember "haha i made that joke about the girl who's severely depressed over her rebound, what a riot" as I slowly lower myself into the abyss by a pissing winch.

	"Anyway, before I come back to this submission text three years later and realize that I'm literally insane and should never have written it, let's talk about the publishability of this run! Because hell no! My "routing" was a GameFAQs guide that is actually wrong in places, so there's no way that it's optimal, not to mention that a pretty significant chunk of time can be saved just through saving and loading due to the game being a dating sim, meaning that if the end goal is just "see every girl's ending" then there's going to be a fair amount of overlap with optimal routing and thus no need to play through the entire game 9 separate times. It's also entirely possible I've missed something mechanical that saves time. I made it about halfway through the first route advancing all text manually before finding out there was a much faster, instantaneous auto-skip (which is the reason this run is "100%" to begin with), so the chance of there being something ELSE is fairly high. Also this isn't even really 100%, since there's naturally an ending for Not Girl, and I'm not about to add that in. I feel like with an actual, proper route for everything and careful save management, over an hour could be saved on an "optimized" run... But is the game itself publishable to warrant that?

	"The easy answer right now is that no, it isn't, because of our rules against adults-only content, but there's always the possibility of that changing. If that rule does change... I hate to say it, but I suppose there actually isn't anything preventing publication of the game. There is genuinely TAS-only manipulation all throughout the run which saves several minutes just because of how often the skipped scenes happen across the game. It doesn't sound like much, but it's superhuman nonetheless. I hate that I discovered this.
