[p 
	"Knuckles' Chaotix is a Sonic game that doesn't feature Sonic. Also, the player is tied to a partner with an elastic band of 'ring energy'. Also, after each stage, the next level is selected via roulette. There are five selectable player characters, and seven partners chosen in between levels in a crane-minigame, making this the Sonic game with the largest cast of characters before Sonic Heroes. The player characters are Charmy the Bee, Espio the Chameleon, Knuckles the Echidna, Mighty the Armadillo, and Vector the Crocodile. The two additional partners are Heavy the Robot, and Bomb the Bomb. For this run I have chosen Knuckles as my primary character.

This movie manipulates luck to create a better sense of continuity by playing each attraction continuously from start to finish. This movie avoids all damage without losing time as a result.

		"If you have never played the NTSC version of Knuckles' Chaotix before, this movie may desync. This is because the game lags in several places if there is no preexisting save data.
