	"3:24 Used the stair climb strat here, I couldn't figure out how to get rid of the falling chair, tried a few different inputs but nothing seemed to work so I just climbed as high as possible and jumped over it at the first possible frame.

	"3:32 Because the ship hasn't tilted back yet I jump at the first possible frame as climbing down is slower. (in this room is nearly lost all the time I had gained.) Waiting for the ship to tilt back (so you can freefall) is slower from what I have tested.

	"4:12 - 4:30 When climbing vertically, I found that it is faster to get as close as possible before you jump to place higher up rather than to jump at the first frame possible.

	"4:21 It's faster to jump off the ladder than to climb to the top and then jump, this saved a few frames.

	"3:36 Jumping to the other side as soon as possible is faster as you can get a faster climbing animation.
