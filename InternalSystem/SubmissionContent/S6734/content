	"This run utilizes hardmode, which saves several seconds. Hardmode (mostly) only reduces the amount of seconds you have per level, and thus the number of frames counting your bonus points takes at the end of each level. Bosses also have more HP, but the time saved from bonus ticking down makes up for it.

	"The main technique we can use is to flip the paddle while ontop of the ball to send it backwards. Other than that, you don't have much control over the ball. It does not bounce if you push the paddle against it. It only bounces if it is coming *towards* the paddle. This makes it difficult to move right and left, as the game biases towards downward momentum.

	"I manage to skip over one gate and destroy it from the opposite side. Unclear how this glitch works. The paddle is exactly 1 pixel off, but likely it also requires the bounce angle to be perfectly aligned to go as straight as possible in order to clip to the other side. Controlling the bounce angle however is not trivial. It seems to be based on a rotating sin-wave that only advances after each bounce. The boss can't die while attacking, so his HP actually underflows.

	"Despite the game having some lag issues, there is not much you can do about it on the micro-level. The game mostly doesn't really support any FPS between 30 and 60. If the CPU is overloaded, it drops to 30 FPS immediately and mostly never recovers. So I don't think there is any point in trying to optimize lag frames. I think the lag decreases when the ball is coming towards the bottom of the screen. This probably indicates something about the collision detection algorithm, but I don't know how you might take advantage of this.

	"I don't see a lot of room for improvement left in this game. I think the biggest gain would be learning how to skip the skull gates consistently. The bosses are pretty good, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's possible to save more frames on them. These were my best attempts, but different bounce RNG going into the boss could open up a faster option.
