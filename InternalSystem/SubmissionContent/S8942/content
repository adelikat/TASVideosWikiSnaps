	"This is one of three Powerpuff Girls games released for the Gameboy Color closely together. The other two games have link cable connectivity with this, and play the same, featuring the other 2 Powerpuff Girls, traveling through similar locales but with different level design. In this game, Bubbles flies quickly through the five levels to stop HIM and his minions at various locales.

	"This movie saved 46 seconds over the previous submission by yep2yel, mainly due to optimizing the flight a bit farther. If you fly up at the correct time, you can get a boost and move more quickly than if you moved up a frame earlier. I also found some slightly faster routes in levels 4 and 5. I discovered a way to bypass the attack cooldown as I was making the TAS as well. This run is 9:27 in RTA time, which beats my WR by 2:06.

Even when the meter looks like it's full visually, you still need to wait a bit for it to reach the max.
