	"This is an attempt to make a Duck Hunt TAS as entertaining as possible. The goal in this TAS is to play 1 round of each game mode (1 duck, 2 ducks and clay shooting) perfectly, shooting the target as soon as possible. After the first round in the first two game modes, the game is reset and the next game mode is played. Only 1 round in each game mode is played because all other rounds would look almost identical. Also, by playing only 1 round in each game mode, all aspects of the game are shown, and hopefully you won't get bored in the short time span this movie last.

	"Duck Hunt is a repetitive game, but by keeping the TAS short and as varying as possible, and considering it's a popular game, it might have a shot at publication. Either way, no one has submitted a serious attempt at this game, so I'll give it a try.
