	"The goal of this run was to destroy the game's time competition levels. Originally I had just wanted to have some fun, but soon really got into it. I put a lot of work into this demonstration so I will submit it, let it's fate be decided by you guys.

	"Wario's Woods is a puzzle game from 1994, Wario has taken over the forest and it is up to Toad to defeat all of his monsters in huge tree trunks, caves and castles to save the day! It's like Yoshi's Cookie and Tetris Attack all in one game. You match the colors of monsters with the corresponding bomb, requiring two or more monsters paired with one or more bombs.

	"This game was actually very challenging to TAS. I worked on this for a few weeks and posted a WIP. I thought a few people might get a kick out of this so I gave it a try. It took so many re-records because the of the bomb orders and such. They are fairly set in stone, especially when playing as fast as I was, however I couldn't just go through quick to see what my next bomb would be. Some color bombs would only appear under strict frame precision in TAS and in some cases require restarts of whole levels to save the time. I also ran into some bad luck, but I won't tell you where cause I think I did alright figuring it out.

	"I managed to finish every level in under a minute, which I didn't think I would be able to do at all, especially Hard 5R

	"I won't ruin the surprise of exactly how badly I killed this game, but I will say that easy finishes top place in 5:00 or less. Normal finishes top place in 10:00 or less. Hard finishes in 15:00 or less.

[p 
	"The hardest level to complete was actually Hard 2R round 2. The longest one in the whole TAS because of the monsters. There just wasn't enough to organize quick chains. Makes it ironic. Just imagine if YOU had perfect luck in this game! You could finish hard mode 7 minutes faster than top place. :)

	": Not knowing anything about the other categories for this game, I can say that this was probably a good choice of goals. I found it entertaining throughout most of it, and it seems like a good puzzle game to provide some future competition. Accepting for publication.
