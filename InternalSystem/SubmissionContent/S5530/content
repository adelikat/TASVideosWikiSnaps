	"This is a 1 minute, 25 second improvement over the Pokemon TCG TAS from 2010 by p4wn3r & FractalFusion. Read the 
	(__wikiLink|2824S|previous TAS's notes)
	" if you want to know more about the game. The basic gist is, every duel is won in as few turns as possible. You do this by finding a duel where the opponent has the right shuffle for the job and you win the coin flip (RNG advances every frame on the overworld), and then manipulating your deck's contents to get anything you need in your starting hand to take them out. RNG doesn't advance during deck editing, so you can go back and expand deck edits to do more. TAStudio helped immensely with doing all this; I don't think it'd have been possible to edit the input like I had to do here back in 2010.

	" Main improvements
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"1. Using Mysterious Fossil against Ronald
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Mysterious Fossil is a Trainer card that acts as a Basic Pokemon, has 10 HP, and isn't worth a prize. There are two duels you want to lose as fast as possible, and Fossil is a better option than using a Pokemon. Using Fossil saves an entire turn over the old TAS's Ronald 1, and in both cases, it saves the animation of Ronald taking a prize.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"2. Using Select+Up/Down in deck editing
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This is a completely undocumented feature, but you can scroll an entire page at once in the deck edit screen with the Select button and up/down, which is much faster than moving one at a time. The old TAS does not use this at all.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"3. Manipulating booster pack contents to not give new cards
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This is an improvement that was listed in the notes of the old TAS. Basically, you want to minimize how many frames it takes to get to the cards you want to add/remove, mostly by minimizing new cards you get in boosters. What matters most is Trainer cards that come before PlusPower in the menu, as PlusPower is by far the non-Energy card most tweaked in deck edits. For the most part I didn't bother with avoiding any Pokemon cards.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The booster pack manipulation I do in this run does not actually lose any time at all, thanks to having to wait before starting duels for good RNG anyway. Like, if you found a good duel that you have to wait 10 frames for, you can wait some of those 10 frames to manipulate the last duel's boosters!
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"4. Naming the player "I"
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"For most of the game text is 'instant', but having a one-letter name saves time during the tutorial, and who wants that to be any longer than it needs to be? It's a bit funnier than "MARK" too! It might save some lag frames as well when displaying text during the rest of the game.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"5. Starting deck + club route change
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The old TAS gets the Bulbasaur and Friends deck, and starts with Rock Club. I get Charmander and Friends, and start with Lightning. These two changes go together, and here's the pros and cons of the changes:
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" Can use Paras against Gene instead of Nidoran, saving Horn Hazard coin flips and RNG manip time
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Saves about a second of world map movement
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Can beat Lightning Club trainers without a deck edit
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Starts with Ponyta/Rattata/Machop in the deck
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Bulbasaur starts with 2 PlusPower/1 Defender; Charmander starts with 1 PlusPower/0 Defender :(
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"I think this route went very well, although my PlusPower count was very bad at the start, partially because I had to get a Defender before Isaac. I was curious about Bulbasaur+Lightning first and tried it out, but since I had to edit in a Hitmonchan + Fighting Energy to take out Jennifer, I was already over 2 seconds behind the Charmander route. Charmander & Friends also saves deck edits by having valuable cards like Ponyta and Rattata deep in the deck from the start, which definitely made me confident about my decision.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"6. Everything else
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If you watch the old TAS, it looks incredibly fast... besides the tutorial of course! But, on a frame level, there are actually a TON of improvements to be made to the old input.
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" Old TAS only uses A when closing text boxes, wasting a frame to depress A
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Old TAS doesn't use Right to skip pages in the hand, losing time getting to slot 5/6/7 in the hand
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Old TAS didn't close prizes with B, sometimes wasting a frame to get an Energy prize instead of a Pokemon prize
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Old TAS didn't combine some inputs together (for example, with cursor on slot 2 of your hand, you can select card 3 with down+A on the same frame)
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"This image shows an example of the menu improvement possible, taken from placing a basic Pokemon in Ronald 1. All of p4wn3r's input has time saves like this.

[p 
	[img class=embed src=http://i.imgur.com/Kk6oLYl.png

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There's other little things like choosing the prize which results in the least lag frames; it takes longer to display a card with a ton of text (PlusPower, Double Colorless Energy) than a Basic Energy. This wasn't relevant in VBA, which had far less lag frames on displaying text.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The biggest time save is probably deck edits; the old TAS did 17 deck edits, while this TAS does 6. My edits are quicker for the most part as well.

	" Obligatory comparison

[p 
	"Unfortunately, this TAS is in that limbo of appearing slower than the old one because of emulator accuracy. VBA-rr is absolutely ridiculous for this game. It saves about a minute and a half from having less lag frames.
	$LF
	"The first thing I did before starting this TAS was to take the old input file and resync it in Bizhawk, so I'd know what I'm actually competing against. Here's that file:

[p 
	"I'd hoped to beat the VBA time, but it was a losing battle. Even on clubs where I save an edit, I'd only save less than a second. Ronald and the Dome are the only big time saves over VBA. Times where Bizhawk gets 10 lag frames, VBA would get 1. You just can't compete with that. I came out only 160 frames behind, and it's still great to save about a minute and a half!

Six edits is way less than I expected, I feel like I got really good luck with some shared card IDs between battles!

	"Farfetch'd isn't the fastest way to kill Joshua; coin flip attacks are to be avoided; but my options are limited because Amy is very very tough to beat, and you can't do an edit right before her. I also need 4 PlusPowers to beat her without any coin flips, and only have 3 (bad Colosseum pack luck), but I have an Item Finder I use on turn 2 to get one of turn 1's PlusPowers back. I end up using EVERY single card I get in the Amy fight, all but two of which (Item Finder discards) had to be manipulated. This fight could definitely have been faster (her Energy Removal didn't help), but the no-edit Grass Club I got after makes up for it.

	"Ideally you'd want to go second against Ronald instead of first, but the battle I found here had the Fossil in a position that minimized deck edit time.
