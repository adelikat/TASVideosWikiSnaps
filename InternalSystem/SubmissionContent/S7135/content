	"Some things to note are that this games proportion between actual gameplay and cutscenes is rather balanced in which seemingly half of the time during this TAS you are standing around watching cutscenes. This and the fact that this game is poorly optimized and lags a lot in most places make this a rather unimpressive TAS to watch. On top of that most bosses are essentially autoscrollers where you wait for their attack cycles to end after every single hit. If it had more actual gameplay this could have been a treat to watch otherwise since the parts where you are actually playing the levels are really fun.
