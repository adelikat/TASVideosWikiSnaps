	"I present you Pokémon White Jade, the game you never heard about! The game was produced by an unlicensed Chinese company known as Jncota, and it's currently available in Chinese language only. Despite anything you may think from a first look, this is mostly a bootlegged NES backport of Pokémon Gold/Silver, from which the Kanto Map was copied. Graphics mostly come from Gen II and III games, while the Pokémon species are taken from Gen IV games. On top of all that, there were introduced a bunch of arbitrary differences in about every aspect of the game itself. Don't worry, below I will explain everything you need to know.

	"In this game, nothing is what it seems. In order to translate stuff, I had to use an optical character recognition software, and I still had to draw many characters by hand into the Google Translate engine. This helped with understanding how to progress through the story events, but I still had to figure out by myself the actual effect of some moves and items present in the game. Most notably, each badge is required for being able to use a key item that allows to progress through the Kanto region.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"It turns out the programmers were total jerks. Many moves have no actual effect at all. There are no Repel items, while the wild encounters are unavoidable. But most importantly, the Ether item doesn't recover 10 PPs like in the original Pokémon games, but instead it recovers half of the max PPs. Rounded down. Imagine discovering this when you're 90% into the TAS production. But on the bright side, this motivated me into writing a bot, namely DankBot, which resulted in a roughly ~1 minute faster run.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The route I developed required a lot of luck manipulation, which would make it impossible to follow the same choices in a real-time attempt. It takes in account every quirk of the game engine, which also makes it much different than what a regular Pokémon game speedrun looks like. Most notably, there are many less mandatory fights, and the player's Pokémon grow much slower, so it's always faster to catch a stronger Pokémon at certain points through the run, even in a real-time attempt. For the rest, you're forced to follow a very linear event line until the end.

	"For optimizing RNG manipulation across the whole run, I wrote a Lua bot specifically for this game (and other Jncota Pokémon backports :) ). You can download it by clicking 
	[a class=intlink href=/Userfiles/Info/62514018295035506 
		"there
	]a
	". All you need to do is to play the game until the beginning of the first fight (the sailor), and start the script from there. It doesn't matter the exact moment when you launch it, as long as it's after start talking with the sailor and before that the battle menu is fully loaded, as the bot automatically proceeds through dialogues and loading times. Then, if you enable the unthrottled emulation speed and wait 3 days straight, you'll get the same movie file that I submitted here.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The bot tries a different delay for each fight turn and creates a new savestate for each successful attempt of getting a desired outcome. It gradually replaces the savestates that resulted in getting the same result slower. After enough attempts of optimizinh the current fight turn, it proceeds to the next turn and does attempt different delays as well, and it will also start from each of the savestates stored during the previous fight turn. In other words, the bot creates and manages savestate branches from which each subsequent attempt will be attempted as well. Or if you prefer, it's a brute forcing approach to micro routing.

The first value is just a frame counter that wraps around after 255, while the other is a random number that changes every time RNG is used for determing the outcome of something. RNG affects moves damage, fails, critical hits, Pokémon capture success, and wild Pokémon species and level. The moveset of a wild Pokémon is not predetermined, but it's affected by both RNG and the position of the map tile you where you encountered it.
