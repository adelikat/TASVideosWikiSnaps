	"This was only of NES Robocop games which I never played on real console. When I saw it in emulator, I found it very difficult, because movements of Robocop has very big inertia, and I has been unable to finish game even with save states. It's probably most fast-paced game of all Robocop-only games (not including Robocop vs. Terminator for SMD), so I decided that it's worth to try to make TAS of this game, and also see how it ends.

	"In order to finish level sucessfully, Robocop must collect enough 'nuke' and arrest enough enemies (touch them instead of shooting) or collect enough special objects (like hostages). If any of those tasks isn't accomplished, Robocop must be 'calibrated' before going to next level. Calibration is a shooting level similar to Operation Wolf, which ends after shooting of enough targets. It's always slower than collection of needed stuff, so it always avoided in this run. In some levels needed stuff is hidden into bonus-like sublevels, which is not necessary must be completed, so Robocop can die after collecting of enough stuff to exit from sublevel.

	"Horizontal movement of Robocop is slowdowns when he shoots, so it's usually faster to jump over enemies, but that is not always possible. Though Robocop has energy bar, some enemies and most of 'danger' background objects in some levels kills him immidiately. Other enemies is a 'solid', so Robocop can't move through them. Thus many enemies should be shoot anyway.

	"Luck manipulation is used for few times to get better timings of enemy shoots, platforms movements and energy walls. Unfortunately, most of moving platforms isn't random-based, so their position can't be manipulated.

	"There is no bosses in usual levels, only two dedicated levels with boss fights. In first boss fight Robocop must wait for some time before he will be able to attack boss. Second boss fight contains three phases. First time Robocop can shoot to any part of boss body, second time he must shoot only to boss legs, and last time he can shoot to anything but legs. In boss fight levels control mechanics is different than in usual levels. So, in second boss fight Robocop can move forward and backward while still face to boss, and also can shoot faster because of less delay between shoots.

	"Note about movie length. Movie ends when I press last needed buttons to make final damage to the boss. No more input is needed to see end screen of game. However, game waits for button to skip end screen, then hi-score screen will be shown, and when name will be entered, game goes to title screen. I decided that skipping end screen and entering name isn't needed actions to finish game, it's like pressing reset or power button after other games shows 'the end'.
