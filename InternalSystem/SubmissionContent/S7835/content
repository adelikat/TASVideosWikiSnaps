	"Mega Man Network Transmission is a game in the Mega Man Battle Network series, developed by Arika and published by Capcom for the Nintendo Gamecube in 2003. It combines the battle chip system of the Battle Network games with the classic Mega Man level designs to create a unique game in the franchise. Battle chips can be for attacking, defending, utility purposes, or a combination of these, and can be sourced from viruses (enemies) mid-stage, bought from shops, or acquired from defeating bosses. You have a finite amount of each chip, and using them costs MP, which recovers over time.

	"The game takes place between games Mega Man Battle Network 1 & 2 (2001). The story follows Lan Hikari and his NetNavi Megaman.EXE as they, after having defeated the WWW in MMBN1, set out to find out the truth of the new Zero Virus and it's vaccine that has been causing other NetNavis to go berserk and cause trouble.

	"MegaMan.EXE can be made to slide by holding down and forward/backward on the control stick and pushing the A button. A slide lasts for 30 frames (unless MegaMan.EXE is unable to stand upright), is used to pass through narrow corridors, and has twice the x-speed of any other horizontal movement without the use of chips. Thus you want to maximize the amount of time spent sliding while still navigating changing floor Y-levels, level hazards, and enemies. MegaMan.EXE's hitbox is rectangular, longer vertically when he stands/runs/jumps, and longer horizontally when he slides. These two hitboxes will now be referred to the tall and long hitbox respectively.

Slides can be chained together indefinitely (on the same Y-level), and if a slide is canceled on one fram a new one can be initiated on the next frame. When a slide ends naturally after 30 frames, or when a slide is canceled, MegaMan.EXE's hitbox becomes tall, even though the slide continues for one frame.

MegaMan.EXE's Y-speed also accelerates faster when falling from a jump than it does when falling from running/gliding off of a ledge.

In the stages where climbing a ladder is unavoidable, if the stage goes down, it is a lot faster just to latch on and instantly let go than it is to climb all the way down. However, a ladder can only be latched onto with a tall hitbox. Thus, in similar fashion to a regular quick drop, by gliding until the first frame where the ladder is accessible with a tall hitbox, over the course of three frames, I can cancel the slide by holding the control stick in the opposite direction of the one previously traveled, latch onto the ladder with the tall hitbox by holding the control stick down, and then instantly let go to fall freely by pressing A.

'Barrier' makes it's debut here, as I use it to run right through the full spectrum of Megalian type viruses that inhabit the stage. 'Barrier' cannot be used mid-slide, so I often use it prematurely while I am jumping or falling so as not to lose speed. This stage contains conveyor belts similar to those in Global Area 2, but the ones in

When he attacks, depending on MegaMan.EXE's position, he will either teleport somewhere and swing his sword three times, or he will do a jumping or spinning sword attack where he is standing. When his HP becomes low enough, he can also become invulnerable, run to one side and send out two sword slashes that cover the height of the stage and fly across it. This attack deals 300 damage and wastes time, so it needs to be avoided at all costs. For the final set of attacks, I wait for Zero to start attacking on his own, letting me in turn attack him. By waiting for the right moment to strike, I can delete Zero as fast as possible.

From the cool movement, to the chip trickery and effective usage, to the quick boss fights, I feel that I was able to show off all that is possible to do with both human hands and with TAS tools. It is not the entire game, but I believe it is the fastest time that it has ever been beaten. I do feel the need to tinker around with the "what-ifs" at a later time, but for now I'm proud to submit this movie for possible publication.
