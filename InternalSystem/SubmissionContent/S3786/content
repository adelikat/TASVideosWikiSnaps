	"Sonic Triple Trouble is the sequel to Sonic Chaos, they are also known in Japan as Sonic & Tails 1 and 2. Long story short, Dr. Robotnik is after the chaos emeralds again and convinced Knuckles that Sonic and Tails want to steal them, again... But here comes a new challenger! Nack the weasel is here and wants to, guess what, steal the chaos emeralds too! (but just because they are shiny and might sell well on eBay)

	"They both have the now classic spindash, but have access to different moves or powerups.
	$LF
	"Sonic can do a "super peel out" by pressing up and jump (like an inverted spindash); this dash-like move doesn't lose speed over time and has some invulnerability frames for a short while. Ok, it's not technically invulnerability, but it can be used to kill enemies for example.
	$LF
	"For Tails, this is replaced by flying for a short duration. This can also be used in the air to have a little distance (and height) boost.
	$LF
	"Another nice feature is the "flying spin attack". When in the air and not in ball form, maybe after using a spring, pressing 1 or 2 turns the character into a ball for a short time. Useful for dealing with enemies, bouncing on tv boxes, etc... It can only be done once per "jump".
	$LF
	"About powerups, Tails can use some kind of submarine in water levels, Sonic has rocket and propeller shoes, etc...

	"Looking at the horizontal speed value with RAM watch (1516, 2 bytes, signed) teaches us many useful things, obviously. There are two distinct speed limits:
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"-1024, the basic limit, reached simply by moving normally, on ground or not.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"-1536, the real max speed, but this one requires the player to "break" the first limit by performing specific actions.

[p 
	"How to break the first limit?
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Some powerups make you go at max speed, like the rocket shoes or the snowboard (named Jet Board in the manual, but who cares about manuals?) for example. Obviously, doing a spindash or a super peel out work too. And one useful "breaker" is simply rolling on the ground; this is not intuitive because you lose speed while doing so on flat ground, but rolling for one frame then jumping will get you far. And fast.
	$LF
	"Most of the time, when you land after a jump, Sonic goes back to 1024 and the speed limit has to be broken again.

	"While in water, these techniques won't help Sonic go past 1024.

[h3 
	"The ceiling glitch
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"If sonic hits a ceiling during a jump after breaking the first speed limit, when he finally lands, he will keep max speed for some reason, and still be in ball form. It was useful here and there. Even if the limit is still 1024, the "stay a ball" part applies anyway.

	"Excuse the violence in that name... This just describes a technique that consists of being caught in a jump between a boss and a wall, Sonic then bounces back and forth, left and right, hitting the boss many times in a row (but usually less times than it looks due to invincibility frames).

	"The propeller shoes glitch
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"It's really a shame that it is not useful in that run... These shoes that let you move freely underwater have a timer, and when it runs out, you lose the boots, how predictable! The other option is to cancel them by pressing 1 or 2, which makes you lose the shoes (again) and fall while in ball form. Now here is the glitch: if the player presses a button to cancel it at a specific frame (there are multiple, arbitrary or random frames where it works), the powerup music stops and Sonic keeps the shoes. Indefinitely. Pressing jump again cancels correctly the powerup, this time.

	"Lag!
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This game is laggy as L (L for "Lag"). TASing it is like playing a lag management simulation game, and not the fun kind. It was really the biggest obstacle in the run, especially because lag frames count towards ingame time. Even when standing still, most of the time lag can happen... Let's not talk about moving, jumping or doing flying spin attacks, and breaking blocks releases the lag wrath on Earth. So yeah, because of that, any little thing turns into a lot of randomness.

Neat trick: even if the snowboard allows Sonic to reach max speed, as soon as he lets go of it, he goes back to the lower speed limit (1024). To bypass that, it's possible to "break" that speed limit just before taking the snowboard (rolling for 1 frame), and then the game lets you keep max speed way later, after you jump off the board (the speed limit is still considered broken).

The only important thing to do here is to deliver the finishing blow as far to the right as possible. Then we have Nack the Weasel for some figuration, and 3 boss fights vs Robotnik. The second one was problematic, again because of the lag; even when he's defeated he has enough energy left to launch a lag attack on the TASer. Aaaand the last phase.

	"Overall this was an interesting game to work on with Grincevent. There was quite a lot of testing and experimenting with various procedures to get the fastest times. Attempts to find some zip glitches were close for me, but the closest I could find ejected me back on track. Lastly the RAM values were probably most useful in the making of this. I can only imagine it would be immensely difficult to optimize blind for a game like this.
