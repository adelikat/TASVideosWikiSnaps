		" It's the fastest way of movement. The character moves at 1.34 pixels per frame. In comparison normal walking is 1.2 pixels fast and the Mech moves at a top speed of 1.0 pixels per frame. In some situation it is faster to walk normally. Also to prevent dying waiting a few frames before jumping is practical. To perform bunny-hops, shoot after jumping.
