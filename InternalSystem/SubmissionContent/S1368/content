	"This is an improvement to the currently published 1-player pacifist Contra run.  Like the previous run, no enemy is killed that is not required to completing the game (boss fights, mini-bosses and some spiked walls in level 7).

	"This run is 1559 frames (26 sec) faster than the current published run measured by game play itself.  The Japan version allows for skipping of in between level cutscenes which accounts for an additional 1667 frames (for a total of 3226 frames).

	"As stated above the lack of in between level black screens makes the run much faster, in addition it means that it is more action packed.  Also the graphics are much improved in the Japanese version vs the USA version, making it a win win situation

	"The original run only upgrades R.  I think that getting the spread gun does not take away from the pacifist feel of the run.  On the contrary it makes it more impressive in some circumstances because it is much harder to avoid killing enemies.  I wait until level 5 to get the spread gun because it would have slowed down level's 2 & 4 considerably.

[p 
	"1) Much of the savings came from better Boss fights, especially from getting the spread gun and using it optimally to get a single stream of bullets.

[p 
	"2) The "waterfall glitch" was used in many places of level 3 to save considerable time.  This is a glitch that allows you to jump much higher than normal and land on ledges that are normally impossible to jump to

[p 
	"3) Luck manipulation.  You will see several stray shots fired throughout the run.  These are to manipulate the enemies to be in more optimal locations.

	"4) Many minor optimizations over the course of the movie.

	"You will notice that I die at the end of the movie this is to a) save input time (don't want to continue recording past the destruction of the final boss), b) It seems fitting that the pacifist hero will sacrifice himself after completing his mission :)

	": I have no idea why GoodNES lables this ROM as "Gryzor (J)", the Japanese name of the game is also Contra (or Kontora). I suggest we keep the ROM name as Gryzor so people can find it, but publish it under the name of Contra like the previous movies.
