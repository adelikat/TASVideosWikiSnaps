	"The original run only upgrades R.  I think that getting the spread gun does not take away from the pacifist feel of the run.  On the contrary it makes it more impressive in some circumstances because it is much harder to avoid killing enemies.  I wait until level 5 to get the spread gun because it would have slowed down level's 2 & 4 considerably.

	"1) Much of the savings came from better Boss fights, especially from getting the spread gun and using it optimally to get a single stream of bullets.

	"2) The "waterfall glitch" was used in many places of level 3 to save considerable time.  This is a glitch that allows you to jump much higher than normal and land on ledges that are normally impossible to jump to

	"3) Luck manipulation.  You will see several stray shots fired throughout the run.  These are to manipulate the enemies to be in more optimal locations.
