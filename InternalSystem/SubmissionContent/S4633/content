		"Summer Carnival '92: Recca
	]em
	" is a hard as nails vertical-scrolling shoot-em-up released by Naxat Soft in 1992 for the Famicom. It is notorious for being insanely fast-paced and showing an insane amount of sprites on the screen, causing hilarious flickering. It also has a nifty "level select" code, which is accessed (hold A+B+S+s when selecting the game mode), which is the essence of this run. By holding A+B and tapping Select, one can choose the level one wants to play first. Level 12, however, is a bit special. It bumps you to the ending.
