	"New tech was used in Screen 6. You see, the bombs in this screen have a very, very wide explosion radius: they can only be dodged by perfect walking left and jumping. The main obstacle was the barrels. But instead of trying to manipulate good barrel RNG in order for them to not come (which wasted quite the frames in the process, because that lead to even worse barrel RNG after the bomb; I could not jump after the bomb explodes for a bit), I simply chose to befriend the barrels. My objective is that, when a bomb is placed, Jekyll gets to a safe position as fast as possible. So I manipulate barrels to be on Jekyll the instant he touches the bomber (so he places his bomb). This way, the barrel knocks me back out of safety, and I can continue peacefully manipulating RNG. I also manipulate a barrel to transform into a dog at the start of the level because why not.

	$LF
	"There are two ways to manipulate RNG:
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	" - mini stutter stepping: when you hold Right, Jekyll doens't actually move forward; he cycles through a three frame long animation, goes forward on the fourth frame, then starts another 'going' forwards animation. However, if you stop for 1 or 2 frames after executing this animation, you will still advance, but without fully holding Right, and consecutely never stopping. This method, hovewer, cycles the RNG very inconsitently, and only works once, until the RNG has done a full cycle.

	"When Jekyll scrolls the screen enough so that he is barely able to fit between a 'step' and the corner of the screen, lands on that spot facing left, turns right, then jumps, he will clip out the screen and reappear at the very right of the screen. The most obivious advantage is being able to bypass dog-jumping, since you scroll past them, being at the right of the screen. However, this trick is sparingly used in the run because of its tremendous setup time (300 frames) and its utility is limited where luck manipulation can do better work in a shorter time.
