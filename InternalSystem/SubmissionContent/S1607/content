	"This game needs some introduction to those who haven't played it: You play as the blue wizard "Shadax". Your goal is to rescue the princess from the evil wizard Morbius. You can walk up, down, left and right. You can also jump. You get killed if you touch an enemy or land on spikes.

	"There are also blocks in this game. Blocks usually fall down from in some rooms, and in some they just lay around. If you press the B button when standing on a block, you will pick it up. When you press B again you will release it. This allows you to carry them with you and use them to reach places that aren't possible to reach if you don't do this.

[div class=p 
	"The most obvious improvement in this run is the use of a new trick that I found: It's actually possible to jump on spikes if you land on the edge of the them. This trick saves time at several places in the run.

	"Another improvement is that I enter the menu to select potion in different places. This is because I found that the time it takes to enter and exit the menu varies depending on what room you're in. Generally, a small room with few objects have shorter loading times for the menu. This trick saved almost 1.5 seconds (!) for the 3 times it was used.
