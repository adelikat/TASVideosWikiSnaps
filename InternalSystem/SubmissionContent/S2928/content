	"NES Asterix completed without take damages .fceux 2.1.4a was used when I record . I wanted to complete the game very fast without glitches.I go out of the screen in two levels and I finished the game in 19181 frames .I think that is improvable . This is my first Tool Assisted Speedrun and it was Hard.^^
