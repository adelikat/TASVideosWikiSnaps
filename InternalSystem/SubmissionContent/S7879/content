	"Animaniacs on Gameboy is a port of the Genesis version. It has a few cuts such as the entire space level and shortening a few other levels, but still keeps most of the original game. The port is technically impressive, keeping many of the features. However, Gameboy Animaniacs introduces a few glitches that completely break the game, when compared to the very solid Genesis version.

As far as I can tell, this results in having the abilities of one character but with the sprites/animations of another. This effect goes beyond visual only and can be used to save significant time. There are 6 different outcomes (3 starting characters each swapping to the two other characters). The biggest effect happens when you swap from Dot to Yakko, which is what I’ll focus on. This has dot’s kiss but with Yakko’s animations.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"This messes with the sprites, but the real issue happens when you blow a kiss. The character chunks fly all over the screen, and as far as the game is concerned, your character is actually flying all over the screen. This messes with collision for objects, but not level collision as far as I can tell. You can use this to:
	$LF
	"-	Collect items (e.g. stars) remotely. Just blow a kiss in the right spot and you’ll grab items on the other side of the screen.
	$LF
	"-	Clip through any object. Just kiss up against it and while your character is flying around you can phase through objects. You can also get this super easily by jumping off an object then air kissing. You just fall straight through the object.
	$LF
	"-	Get “air jumps”. As far as I can tell, this happens when your character is zipping around the screen with a kiss and happens to land on top of an object while flying around. Then even though you’re in the air, you can get another jump because you’re grounded for a second. This is used to skip the box pulling bit near the switch which opens the skull door.
	$LF
	"-	Remotely hit warps. At the end of the section you need to push a box onto a switch to open the door at the end. You could clip through the door with the tech mentioned above. But if your character hits the end of the screen while they’re flying around with a kiss, then that counts and sends you to the next screen. In the TAS it looks like I randomly get sent to the next screen.

The only other thing to be sure of is that you don’t take damage after grabbing the hat. If you do then the level never ends and you’re softlocked. But if you land in a spot where you avoid damage, this hat grab skips the entire boss and the climbing section up to the hat after the boss.
