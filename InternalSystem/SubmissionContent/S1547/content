	"The improved time is Bald Bull, which was taken down from 0:08.62 to 0:08.24

	"Like the previous movies of this game, my submission aims for fastest clock time, which often conflicts with fastest real time.  It aims for fastest real time as a secondary goal.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This improvement is no exception, while it is a .38 clock improvement (what would be a 15 frame improvement), the net is only 6 frames since the change in strategy has a longer "fall down" animation.  Also 2 "magic" frames appeared (possibly timing differences from 1.502 to 1.51) along the way.  As a result, this movie is 8 real frames faster.

	"None that I know of.  I tested thoroughly each strategy and only came up with this 1 improvement.  Then again, so did Phil, and so did I the previous submission.  The Piston Hurricane time sat at 5.5 for a long time until Phil found a rather obvious improvement that everyone had over looked.  So who knows!  Maybe we can continue to improve these record times...
