	" is a big reason for that. The other big reason is neurodivergence, but let's not get into that right now. Despite extremely inconsistent updates due to the fact that The Brothers Chaps are incredibly talented and incredibly busy individuals, H*R is a product that's been an extremely consistent part of my life, my humor, and occasionally sometimes I watch an old SBemail every now and then. Naturally, for a site and world built entirely in Flash, there's been more than a few fun games and even a couple of ones that aren't as fun! I'll let you decide which games are which, but I'll just say there's a reason I didn't submit Homestar Talker.

	"Where's an Egg? is a little randomly generated microgame. Quite literally, even, as the base resolution is 70x65. Someone has stolen An Egg, and your job is to find it. You go from beautiful location to beautiful location, asking suspects questions in hopes that you may find An Egg. Some suspects may lie, some may not lie, but only one has An Egg. Once you think you know who has An Egg, you shoot them. If you shoot the wrong person three times, you go to jail and lose. If you shoot the right person,
