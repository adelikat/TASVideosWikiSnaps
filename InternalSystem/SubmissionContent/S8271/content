	"moon is an RPG released on PS in 1997 and celebrates its 25th anniversary in 2022. 
	$LF
	"At the time of its release, the game was much talked about for its catchphrase, "No more hero" and for its gameplay, which is an RPG but does not involve defeating monsters.
	$LF
	"Due to the dissolution of the developer Lovedelic, the game was not playable on hardware other than PS for a long time, but it was ported to Switch in 2019 and to Steam in 2021.

	$LF
	"In order to go to the moon, it is necessary to raise the level to 22 and collect 5 rocket parts, which are the conditions for clearing the game.
	$LF
	"Many events have detailed conditions for their occurrence at different times and on different days of the week, and the real challenge in creating the shortest possible time to clear the game is to construct an efficient chart that takes these conditions into account.

	"This game is a recent addition to the RTA despite being an older game. (Registration on speedrun.com was in 2020).
	$LF
	"The early RTA records were very much influenced by the in-game time TAS I created way back when.
	$LF
	"The RTA caused a record fight.
	$LF
	"It has improved dramatically compared to the early charts.
	$LF
	"Around January 2023, the record was about 2h19m, but by March it had shrunk to about 2h3m25s.
	$LF
	"Because of the nature of the game and the waiting time, the concept of charting is not very different between RTA and TAS, and the charts are similar.
	$LF
	"This TAS will be the record based on that latest chart.

	"As for the TAS, the heart and stamina routing is very on point and tight even with the intentional waiting for the timed events. The RNG manipulation seems to be on point, especially on the fishing. While this seems slower than RTA the main time difference is that RTA uses modern ports that have reduced load times across the board. While this submission seems like it covers most of the content, I can assure you that there's a whole lot of content that doesn't get covered that can be shown off with a potential "all hearts" TAS in the future.
