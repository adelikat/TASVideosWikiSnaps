	"First of all, massive thanks to DonamerDragon's previous TAS. It was a major source of inspiration for my Round Game TAS, which led to me developing a good sense of how to optimize rounds in this game. Ironically, that led me to go back and re-watch the video for this category, only to find myself spotting potential optimizations left and right, so now I'm trying to obsolete it.

[div class=p 
	"The main goal of this TAS is in-game time, but opportunities for trade-offs between in-game and real time are pretty rare and are generally a couple frames at a time, so this is mostly an unimportant point except in one spot -- I discovered far too late into the run that the Technical Rank Certification screen only appears once you've recorded a time for all 4 levels in any one column, so one could save a few seconds of menuing by doing 3 levels in each column then filling out the 4th row. Unfortunately, by the time I discovered this, I couldn't go back and add this optimization without losing days of work.

[div class=p 
	"Also, in theory this could be routed further by playing the levels in a different order to better match up levels with sections of the bomb color RNG sequence that are more advantgeous. However, this would require a much deeper understanding of the bomb color RNG than I possess, as well as probably some scripting to explore permutations of the levels.

[div class=p 
	"Another potential alternate strategy would be to enter levels, spawn bombs to advance the RNG state, then exit out, which would be a significant real-time loss to save a little in-game time and would probably be less entertaining to watch. Still a possibility though, if anyone else wants to try and optimize this further.

Normally the fairy seems to avoid dropping bombs in columns where they would form a match immediately upon landing if nothing moves, but clearing all of a color from the board during the bomb spawn animation causes the new bomb's color to be rerolled (or more precisely, recomputed using the same integer output by the RNG but using the new color list, meaning this doesn't advance the RNG seed a second time). I exploit this to get bombs that *do* clear upon landing without having to move around.
