	"Billy Blaze, Eight year-old genius, working diligently in his backyard clubhouse has created an interstellar starship from old soup cans, rubber cement, and plastic tubing. While his folks are out on the town and the baby sitter has fallen asleep, Billy travels into his backyard workshop, dons his brother's football helmet, and transforms into...

	"In this episode, Billy is out in his clubhouse, busily working on his handy new ComputerWrist wrist computer. He hears Molly, his baby sitter, calling him to supper but he keeps on working. He hears a strange noise in the backyard and decides to investigate. On a patch of scorched grass he finds a note:

	"Keen --

	]br
	$LF
	"P.S. Next time get one with more meat, please.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"He puzzles over this for a moment, then notices the baby sitter has stopped calling. Suddenly, he realizes that aliens are having her over for supper – and when they say “for supper” they mean “FOR SUPPER”! If he doesn't save her, his parents will be furious. They'll never believe that “Aliens Ate My Baby Sitter!”
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"“This is a job for Commander Keen!” he declares. Once again, he dons his brother's football helmet, hops in the trusty Bean-with-Bacon Megarocket and starts the launch sequence for Fribbulus Xax. He's got to save Molly from becoming a snack for creatures from another planet!
