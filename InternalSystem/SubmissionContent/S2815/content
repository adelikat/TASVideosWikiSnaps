	"sf2 Rainbow Edition is probably the best known hacked game of all time. It said that in some countries there where more hacked cabinets then normal street fighter II cabinets. It's the name given to all the hacked Street Fighter II: Championship Edition games due to the altered color on the title screen. All the Championship Edition hacks are pretty crazy but this one has some sanity unlike Koryu.

So for example, guile can link c.lk to s.hp or s.lk to c.hp. The input for this is c.lk, lk+hp or s.lk, D+lk+hp.

With a turbo boosted walk speed and using the fact that c.mk has no start up gives him a few links. I cancel out yoga fires normal knockdown with a cl.mk. Yoga flame is not normally kneed in this game. Cl.hk is the quickest recovering hard attack but has a lot of active frames, so a meaty one give enough time for a teleport.

The fireballs added make it a lot easier to fully connect rolling attacks. I thought the chip at the end was a cute way to end the input early.
