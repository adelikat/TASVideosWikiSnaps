	" no longer works on the new site, because I felt like it was the main thing that incentivised some people, including myself, to rate. Another thing that made me lose interest in rating movies is that, in the current form of the website, it is not possible to sort unrated movies by anything other than the name. It made it so that I eventually lost track of my progress, and it became difficult to start where I left on my previous movie rating session.

I really felt like this game could have a movie that could be maxed out due to its simple mechanics, so I tried pretty much every possibility. It was a very tedious process, since I did everything manually, but I'd say I'm happy with the results.
