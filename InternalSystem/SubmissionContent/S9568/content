In practice it means that high accuracy attacks are unlikely to miss, while low accuracy attacks are unlikely to hit.

[ul

		" Forge glitch: The japanese version of the game has a glitch with the forge, where if you remove 6% crit from a weapon with an initial 5% (Slim Sword, Slim Lance, Thunder), it creates a weapon with 255% crit instead of 0%. While it may sound amazing (and it is indeed quite good), for the context of this TAS it isn't that great. These weapons either lack 2 range and are weak (a real issue in Maniac mode), or have long animations and are limited to mage units, and this TAS can already land 4 or 5 low % critical hits in a row for a small amount of RN burning time. I ended up only forging a single Slim Lance with maximum Might, which was useful on some occasions but still had more than 10 uses left by the end of the game.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Fast enemy phase: If you are holding B from your unit's last action to selecting the end turn option (hence why I couldn't select the auto end turn in the options), the camera will move faster during the enemy phase (as if you were in the player phase holding B), which saves a significant amoutn of time in the long run.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Dodging trigger areas: In most chapters, some areas will trigger reinforcements or similar things if one of your unit ended their turn in it. However, if you drop a unit in the area and then have the carrier get out of the area, the trigger will not activate. This trick has a big application in chapter 7, and a more minor one in chapter 9.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Camera movements: When moving a unit from point A to point B, the camera will first center on the point A before starting to move the unit. As such, it is more important to move the camera fast to the point A (with the B button or by opening the stats screen) than to inputing the next movement to do.

	"You can get 700 Bexp if you go unnoticed by the 3 patrolling guards, which is the fastest way to complete the chapter anyway. With my forged javelin, Marcia needed 15 STR to ORKO the boss and get his master seal, as getting it to promote her will be faster than leveling up to level 21, so I had to give her 7 level ups from Bexp. My aim for these levels was to get +7 STR and +7 SKL, as well as finding a sweet spot between lot of stats and a low number of RNs burning by viewing characters stats, as each burning (from the base) costs ~0.6s, which very quickly adds up. After a deep investigation, I went for this +4 HP, +4 SPD, +3 LCK, +3 DEF and +5 RES, at the cost of only 8 RNs burns. Also, since I had to trade items between Marcia and Titania anyway, I also forged a max Mt 255 crit slim lance for later uses.

Another issue would be the difficulty/inability to open the chests, as the ravens will waste a lot of time opening them.

Ideally you would want for Marcia to Vantage crit everyone, but the odds of doing it during the enemy phase decrease exponentially with the number of enemies she faces, so I had to make compromises between the time wasted on "extra" attacks and the time it would take to burn RNs to get a better outcome. I alleviated some of this burden by purposely breaking some of my javelins once all the 1-2 range enemies were dead, allowing Marcia/Titania to finish the rest with the forged slim lance. Speaking of forges, I got a brand new max Mt javelin at the base, but despite that I only had a few uses left at the end of the chapter due to the sheer quantity of enemies I had to kill with it.

I could face him anyway, but it was slightly faster to spend an extra turn rather than to watch his ~5s attack animation.
