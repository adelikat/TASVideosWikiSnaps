	"This is an improvement of 13.66 seconds over laughing_gas's princess-only run of Super Mario Bros. 2 (aka. Super Mario USA).
	$LF
	"The concept for this run originated long ago because Princess was the only character not used in the normal run aiming for fastest overall time. Since then, improvements have removed Mario from that run as well. (In fact, Princess is the only character not used in the fastest warpless run either.)
