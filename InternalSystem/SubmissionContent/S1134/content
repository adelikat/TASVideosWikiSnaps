	" Overview
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This little known gem of a game has incredible potential for a TAS.  You control four unique characters with very differing abilites, and, most importantly, the ability to switch between them at any time.

	$LF

[p 
	"The first four levels are introductory levels, one for each character.  The real fun begins when they all team up and can be interchanged at any time.  Here's a rundown of the four characters:
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" Little Samson
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"The all-around character.  Samson walks with an average speed, and can shoot projectiles left or right that pack a small punch.  He also has the ability to grab onto, climb, and jump off of walls, as well as hang from ceilings.
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" Kikira the Dragon
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"Kikira moves at the same speed as Samson, but can jump much higher and hover in mid-air for quite a while.  Her projectiles arc down slightly and then back up as they travel forward (somewhat parabolic), making the shots difficult to aim.  She can also charge up to three different levels of multi-shots.
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" Gamm the Golem
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"Gamm attacks by a stretching arm punch (think Dhalsim, but much much cooler) that can be aimed up, down, or forward.  This attack is more powerful than the shots of Samson or Kikira.  Gamm is a good amount slower than the rest of the bunch, but has a much larger life meter, and can walk on spikes.  Your standard "slow but strong" player.
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" KO the Mouse
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"90% of this run will be played with KO because he has the fastest walking speed.  KO attacks by dropping bombs that pack quite a punch if the enemy happens to run into them (or be near them when they explode).  Like Samson, KO can climb walls and ceilings.  The downside is his life meter is the smallest of the bunch.

	"I used two of Mazzic's runs to gauge my performance.  The practice levels and first three normal levels were compared to a different, more optimized run.  The remaining levels were compared to his first run.
