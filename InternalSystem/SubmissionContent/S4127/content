	"Surprise, another TAS! I've mostly been working on this as a shorter, simpler and easier alternative to my recent Game Boy Mega Man TASes (and faster paced to boot). This game is not as technically complex as those, so I've been able to create this run significantly faster than my recent other runs.

	"X-Men: Wolverine's Rage is, naturally, a licensed game starring Marvel Comics' Wolverine. The game (which is the third X-Men game for Game Boy Color, after X-Men: Mutant Academy and X-Men: Mutant Wars) was developed by Digital Eclipse and released by Activision on May 15th, 2001. It plays like a standard run-of-the-mill platforming game, with Wolverine jumping, climbing and hacking his way through 16 stages and 4 bossfights against foes such as Cyber, Lady Deathstrike and Sabretooth.

		" No acceleration. On both the ground and the air, Wolverine accelerates to running speed immediately.

	[li 
		" Jump height is fixed, regardless of pressing or holding A for any amount of time.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Landing takes horizontal movement away for 1 frame. Thus, for horizontal movement, jumps have to be minimized.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Wolverine can't jump-slash after dropping off a ledge. This is why I sometimes jump off edges (to slash an enemy below) when it would otherwise be faster to fall off.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" After falling for a certain amount of time, Wolverine becomes unable to horizontally adjust his position in the air anymore, until landing on ground. This may be noticed during some long falls.

[h4 id=Objectboost/Enemyboost 
	" Object boost/Enemy boost
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Attempting to land on destroyable objects or enemies causes Wolverine to zip off to the side of the object or enemy. This is used everywhere throughout the run to zip Wolverine forward slightly.
	$LF
]p
[h4 id=Airslashhitbox 
	" Air slash hitbox
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Doing an air slash in the air causes Wolverine's hitbox to change in odd ways - it seems to become smaller and further down. This allows Wolverine, for instance, to pass through enemies in a 4-tile high area. Generally, when an air slash is done that doesn't hit anything, it's done for this reason.
	$LF
]p
[h4 id=Ceilingclip 
	" Ceiling clip
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Doing a regular jump into a ceiling sometimes causes Wolverine to clip into the ceiling and zip down a few pixels. This is sometimes useful to make a jump shorter and land on the ground earlier.
	$LF
]p
[h4 id=Edgegrabbingtricks 
	" Edge grabbing tricks
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"There are a few different actions Wolverine can do while hanging from a ledge; jump up the edge by pressing up or A, do a lunge from the edge by pressing away, or letting go of the ledge by pressing down; if Wolverine grabbed the edge from high enough, he can actually regrab the ledge at a lower point immediately afterwards.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The fastest way to go up a ledge depends on whether Wolverine needs to jump immediately after getting up the ledge, or to move forward. Under normal circumstances, the fastest way to move forward is just by jumping up the edge (up/A). To jump afterwards, the fastest method (to land on the ledge floor as soon as possible), the fastest method is to grab the high point of the ledge, press down and regrab (grabbing the edge about 8 pixels lower), and then doing a lunge up the edge. This allows Wolverine to land 1-3 frames sooner, depending on the vertical position where Wolverine catches the edge.

[h4 id=Ragebuffer 
	" Rage buffer
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Normally, Wolverine's special Rage ability is executed by mashing the B button, causing Wolverine to slash about repeatedly before executing the special move. However, pressing forward+B or down+B on the same frame causes the slash not to come out, so doing this movement repeatedly allows Wolverine to buffer up B presses and execute the Rage at once without slashing beforehand.

So while it was cool seeing Weapon-X in this kind of game, and a rather interesting set of final credits, accepting for vault.
