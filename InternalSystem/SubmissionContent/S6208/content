	"The Story Mode follows Goku as he goes on the adventure of his lifetime. Most of the Dragon Ball story arcs are here; the only one noticeably missing is the Piccolo Junior storyline from the end of the series. There are many items to collect in the game, most of which are hidden. Items can include those that increase the player's health and/or ki, the Dragon Balls, or objects such as Master Roshi's sunglasses and Mercenary Tao's cyborg headgear. Since this run aims for fastest time we only collect the ki upgrades to give us a more powerful kamehameha.

It can be manipulated by jumping and changing your jump height. The x-sx position can be used to increase the chance of entering doorways and screen transitions one frame earlier.

	"Most enemies have 120 HP. After a lot of trial and error it was found that a 5-hit combo was the fastest way to finish an enemy. The combo was Dash attack -> Standing B (1) -> Standing B (2)-> Jump -> (mid-air) Up+B -> (mid-air) B {this final hit was usually changed to a dive kick for better positioning}. The base damage for the combo was 110 which means that to get the extra 10 damage the RNG portion had to be above average for every enemy using this combo. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"On top of needing above-average damage output I needed to make sure that the enemies were spawning from the correct side of the screen when possible. I wanted to be as close as possible to the right side of the screen when the last hit was delivered to the final enemy. I also wanted the final hit to be a dive kick or an attack that I could cancel into the L+R rush. This part wasn't directly affected by RNG, but it did mean that I had to use a variety of combos with a variety of damage outputs to make sure I was positioned well at the end of a fight.

[p 
	"Boss fights are generally much easier to optimize once you can figure out how to manipulate the best starting pattern. You just get in there and keep repeating the highest damage combo which is pretty similar to the combo used on regular enemies (Dash attack → Standing B (1) → Standing B (2) → Jump → (mid-air) Up+B → Dive Kick → (mid-air) B → Land and Dash Attack again). When fighting against bosses or enemies that can't be hit from the ground it's best to simply Dive Kick → Up Kick ad infinitum. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Regular sized bosses (such as Yamcha, Krillin, Devil Man, etc..) can only be combo'd for as long as they're in the air, and they can only be popped up once per combo with (mid-air) Up+B. The only way you can keep them in the air is with the L+R rush. It initially seems like the L+R rush does a lot of damage, but due to its super long cool down time it ends up being faster to just continue with the regular combo as along as possible. For comparison the L+R rush does ~200 damage in 83 frames and the regular combo does ~240 damage in 91 frames.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The 'Area Clear' phrase only appears a fixed amount of time after the boss has reached his final resting animation on the ground. The L+R rush will sometimes be used as the finishing combination because the final hit will automatically set the enemy into a state very close to the final resting animation. But other times it will waste time by sending the enemy flying and bouncing against the wall.

While it doesn't seem unusual to spend a lot of time learning the game mechanics I would still rate the second fight in this level as the hardest fight in the game to optimize. And the second hardest in the game is the last fight of this level right before the boss. Again, hitting that perfect trifecta of getting the enemies to spawn on the correct side of the screen, getting high damage, and finishing the fight with the right positioning was a nearly impossible task. You'll often see Goku punching and attacking the open air before and during the fights. This is to manipulate the RNG wherever I can. I try the best I can to change the RNG without losing any time, which often means going back to the previous fight to add some punches.

	"The enemies in green coats usually throw grenades as their first action. I always reflect these with the Up kick to do around 300 damage. It's faster to wait a few frames and reflect the grenades than it is to kill them with a regular combo, and it usually sets me up in a better position anyways. This hold true for every grenade-throwing or rocket-launching enemy in the game.

[p 
	"Wall jumps provide a speed boost away from the wall which normally makes it impossible to do more than one in a row. By immediately doing the L+R rush back towards the wall we can scale the whole wall and bypass the whole section. Getting hit by the boulder pops up Goku just high enough to reach the wall. That particular maneuver makes use of another trick in which you can cancel the damage animation with another attack. It's done simply by pressing an attack button right after getting hit, but it can only be used after getting hit in the middle of a mid-air attack. It doesn't always work, though, and I'm not too sure why. But it does work all the times I need it to, which is quite often throughout the run (nearly every time you see me getting hit).

	"All of the attacks can be done in pretty much any order you want. The real limiting factor is that ground attacks cannot be cancelled into jumps. There's about a 20 frame cool down to return to a neutral position from a punch. When you land from a mid-air attack you immediately cancel into a neutral position meaning you can jump or attack again right away.
	$LF

[p 
	"The green bar below the health bar is the guard gauge. While it's full you can recover from attacks very quickly. When it's depleted there occurs a long stun animation (about 40 frames) where the opponent can perform as long of a combo as they can manage. It has 16 hit points and it acts very differently than the normal health bar. All attacks do varying amounts of damage to it, and it also changes based on if you're interrupting a move or not. Using a knockdown attack to break the guard gauge will stop the attack from actually knocking the opponent down. I will usually use D+B in mid-air to do this after they've recovered some of their gauge after a ki blast.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"It takes 7 frames to jump, and you cannot altar the height of it. If you jump during a dash, then it only takes 1 frame to jump. Jumping during a dash will cause you to retain your momentum and is actually very useful throughout every fight to ensure that you're always close enough to the opponent to hit them with your attack. If you are already positioned well, then you can press Up on the frame you jump in order to jump straight up. Positioning is very important when landing for firing the Kamehameha. If you're too close the ki blast won't do a large number of hits. If you're too far away, then the ki blast will hit fully and the final hit will cause a knockdown.

[p 
	"In all of the VS fights in the game you never want the enemy's defense bar to start regenerating or else you'll spend 30-45 frames going through the stun animation of breaking their defense without dealing much damage. The main difficulty in these fights is to manipulate the opponent to do an attack immediately after a ki blast. This depends on the rng and your height/position relative to the opponent. This will prevent their defense gauge from refilling since they won't be in a neutral position anymore.

	"Most of the enemies in this level are bats which only have 1 health. In some fights they will not appear if you are too close to the edge of the screen. In the second half of the level I picked up a purple turtle shell which is a fantastically powerful item. It makes Goku invincible and any enemy I touch takes about 30 damage. By far the most powerful aspect of this item is that I can cancel an attack into another attack every other frame, and the new move will do its damage on the very next frame (even before the move animation starts). So I can do ~25 damage every other frame.

[p 
	"Up next Goku tickles a cat to get more powerful in the Korin mini game.  All of Korin's actions are dependent upon your position, the direction you're facing, and ,as a matter of course, RNG. The only way to manipulate rng in this mini-game is to press the B button (the capture button) which takes 31 frames to complete. All other buttons are disabled. After capturing Korin he will fade out and re-appear somewhere else. He will either fade-in in a position relative to Goku (usually a medium distance away) which can take several extra frames to catch since you can't touch him until he's completely solid, or he'll instantly appear in mid-air with several of his copies flying around. Catching him when he appears in mid-air is the fastest option, but it's definitely not possible to manipulate every time that I could find.

Holding Up or Down changes the cloud's position even while off-screen significantly affects Goku's vertical movement. This is how he can jump from the bottom of the screen to the top very quickly or vice versa. Backwards jumping is also possible on this stage but only because the scrolling can retain my momentum.

	"Most of the difficulty in this part was optimizing the screen scrolling to be in all the right places at all the right times for spawning enemies. The truly difficult one was the last fight before the transition. You want the screen to be scrolled as far to the right as possible when delivering the final attack so that the transition will occur as soon as possible. Getting the final enemy to appear from the right side was a rare rng event, and it had to happen on top of a couple other difficult manipulations in order to even get to the right side of the screen in a timely manner.

[p 
	"The second half of this level was pretty straight forward compared to earlier platforming levels. All of the blue soldiers had 131 health instead of 120, so I had to add in an extra hit to the combo to finish them off. This was actually a relief since I didn't have to go crazy making sure every hit did high damage anymore (for the most part). I was also able to skip one of the fights by crossing the large gap underneath one of the bridges. In some earlier testing it was found that the fight checkpoints extend all the way up to an invisible ceiling, but it looks like they don't extend below the ground. No other fight skips were found in the game.

Otherwise he only takes half damage while charging and firing his beam. I've seen videos of him starting with a different movement, but none of the RNG changes I could make would cause a different start. A little interesting trick to note at the end of the fight. Goku can go below the instant death barrier at the bottom of the screen as long as he's in the middle of a dive kick or L+R rush. But you die if you go too far out of bounds or if you stop the move.
