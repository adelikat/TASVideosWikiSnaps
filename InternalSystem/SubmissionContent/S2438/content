	"This is an improvement over the current 
	[a class=intlink href=/207M 
		"published movie
	]a
	" by BagofMagicFood.  Due to better emulation over famtasia this movie is actually 2665 (~44.3 seconds) frames slower than the published movie.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I don't know the exact amount that this movie improves the published movie due to several factors such as emulation differences and the lack fo a frame counter in famtasia.  In addition, I have no idea the numbers or names of any of the rooms so I dont' have a specific location of improvements.  Here is a list of the most significant improvements.  And if it wasn't confusing enough, famtasia's fps is 60, where FCEUX is ~60.1 resulting in even more disparity between reported times.

[p 
	"In addition, there are various 1-2 frame improvements here and there due to having frame advance precision compared to the published movie.  Such improvements are rather mundane for a game like this so I didn't keep track of them.

	" Emulation
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Famtasia improperly emulated FDS disk load times.  As a result, every loading screen in the published movie was ~122-124 frames faster than it should have been.  This submission is slower, but reflect better emulation accuracy.
	$LF

[p 
	"In summary, regardless of reported times, this is a small improvement over the published movie.  In addition, it is done with a modern emulator that features better emulation quality.
