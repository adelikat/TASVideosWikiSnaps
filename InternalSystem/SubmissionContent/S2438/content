[div class=p 
	"I don't know the exact amount that this movie improves the published movie due to several factors such as emulation differences and the lack fo a frame counter in famtasia.  In addition, I have no idea the numbers or names of any of the rooms so I dont' have a specific location of improvements.  Here is a list of the most significant improvements.  And if it wasn't confusing enough, famtasia's fps is 60, where FCEUX is ~60.1 resulting in even more disparity between reported times.
