	"The first obvious difference between this run and the published run is that in this one I enter the closet and take the "no ghost" before I enter the spiral stairs room and take the axe. The reason for this is that the no ghost will be one step higher in the property list, saving some menu navigation time.

	"The second obvious difference is that I take the right path in the backyard before entering the greenhouse. This has to do with how randomness works in this game - to put things short, by taking the right path first, I will run in to the bird one extra time, but not run in to the little red guy in the green house. The scene where the little red guy runs through the screen takes a longer time than the bird scene, so this saves quite a lot of time.

	"I scroll to the first page of the property list when in the marble statue room, compared to the published run where I do in the the zombie room. This saves a few frames, not much though.

	"I found a RAM address, 0091, that helps out a lot during text messages. This address will always increase by 2 after every text box if it is skipped as fast as possible. So if you notice that this value increases by more than 2 after a text box, you know that you didn't skip the text box as fast as possible.
	$LF

[p 
	"Besides these things, this run is very similiar to the published run. Having RAM address 0091, I could make sure all text boxes were skipped as fast as possible, and I also wrote a program that calculates the fastest menu route from point A to B, so hopefully this run is as optimized as it gets unless the route isn't optimal.
