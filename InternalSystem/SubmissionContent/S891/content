	"Super Mario Bros 3 minimal run, completed with the left+right glitch (which seems to be specific to the Super Mario All-Stars version).

	"Compared to Genisto's current minimal SMB3 run, this is about 25 seconds faster in the levels. But, it uses the SNES version, which adds about 29 seconds of delay outside of levels (I am ignoring those out-of-level delays; I'm simply explaining why the overall movie time appears to be slower).

	"This is not nearly as impressive an accomplishment as Genisto's SMB3 run, but I think the result is different enough to be worth seeing separately from that, and I wanted to demonstrate what sort of things the glitch can allow for.

	"Essentially, pressing left+right in this game lets you accelerate very quickly to full running speed and makes you immune to the slowdown that is normally caused by floating, swimming, or going uphill. Also, it lets you jump at maximum height if you let go of left+right before jumping. (My attempts to demonstrate its effect on swimming speed weren't very successful because you can't really see Mario in the sea of mud, but you can see its affects on hills and midair acceleration even when floating.)

	"One problem with fireballs was that they always travel much slower than Mario this way, so it wasn't possible to throw fireballs at things many screens away, and even just hitting something in front of you requires slowing down if it's dangerous to touch and can't be jumped over.

	"I do not know why I got a flower card in 1-1. I couldn't get a star there without slowing down, which was fine with me since normally I would need to slow down to get a flower card later, although going in the order star-star-flower might look better. Sadly, jumping into the clouds in 1-1 didn't turn out to be best, but at least I found something else to do while rushing through it.

	"My least favorite parts are the ones where something very specific needs to be done to not be obviously worse than what Genisto has already done, and I wasn't willing to copy Genisto's input for those parts although no matter what I did had to end up looking similar anyway. This is specifically the case in the 1-ups-with-racoon-mario section and the battle with Bowser. I wasn't quite as precise/efficient at these as Genisto (overall about 15 frames and some additional 1-ups that remained inexplicably out of reach after many many retries), but this movie isn't intended to be the same as that and those parts don't look too bad anyway.
	$LF

[p 
	"My favorite parts are the regular (non-autoscrolling) courses, especially the very first level (admittedly it's a bit downhill from there after that). A warpless run would have more of those courses, although I wasn't going to commit to a run like that, especially not just to demonstrate something like this.
