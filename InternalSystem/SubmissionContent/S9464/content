	"This is 
	[em 
		"Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends
	]em
	" for the Sega Genesis. Released in 1993, it is one of many video games from the Thomas & Friends franchise, and one of my favourites! I think the music and spritework are really nice, and the game is just comforting to play. There are four gamemodes: a mode where you deliver freight cars to stations, a racing mode against an opponent, a free roam exploring mode, and a colouring book.

	"I don't remember a lot of things from my early childhood, but one thing I do remember was my fondness for 
	[em 
		"Thomas the Tank Engine
	]em
	". My family had a VCR and I would watch the Classic Series on VHS tapes, listening to George Carlin narrating fun, little stories about little engines. After watching, I'd sit in silence, listening to the soft buzzing and humming of the tapes. We had these train sets from TOMY, with vibrant blue tracks and battery-powered train toys. My sisters and I would play in this huge, carpeted room in the basement, building elaborate track layouts, making our own stories, and watching the trains chug along with their noisy motors. When I eventually learned what a computer was, I'd watch YouTube videos of other 
	[em 
		"Thomas the Tank Engine
	]em
	" train sets, and played games that were on the 
	[em 
		"Thomas & Friends 
	]em
	"website.

]div
[div class=p 
	"All of this to say that Thomas the Tank Engine was definitely a formative experience in my childhood. Eventually, I grew up and stopped caring about the franchise when I became a teen. I stopped using the VCR. The TOMY tracks were dumped in a plastic bin and stashed away. After learning about the world of licensed video games, I eventually rediscovered 
	[em 
		"Thomas & Friends
	]em
	" and was met with a wave of nostalgia. Even today, I still really love the franchise (mostly everything during the Classic Series though). It's lighthearted and cheerful. There's something about it that I just find so comfortable and nice.
