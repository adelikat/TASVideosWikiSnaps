	"When Virgin Games approached Aladdin about starring in his own video game in 1993, he was naturally drawn to the idea, having just finished an extremely successful major motion picture. They even gave him full use a scimitar for the entire game! To his slight disappointment, he wasn't as agile or nimble as he was in the movie, especially when jumping around rooftops. Fortunately, I restored his faith in his abilities with this TAS, as Aladdin long-jumps and stop-runs like a madman on his way to save Jasmine.

If I duck and hit A, Aladdin will try to throw an apple, but what ends up happening is that he just reaches through the wall and touches the Scarab negating the need to double back for the Scarab later.

The first time I use it to jump across a rooftop (after finishing the section with the three floating ropes next to each other), you'll notice that I run to the right for a bit before running to the left. This is because I needed a running start to make the jump. I use the Long Jump two more times to skip areas soon after.

	"If you stop running a certain time during the latter part of Aladdin's running animation, he will skid to a stop. If you stop for only one frame (long enough to trigger the running animation) and begin running again, the X velocity of Aladdin's skid will be added to his running velocity, noticably increasing his speed for a short period of time. The stoprunning is as optimized as I can get it, and I can't use it everywhere for the following reasons:
	$LF

		" If there's anything harmful in my way (an enemy or spikes), I am forced to somehow react to it if I want to proceed. Unfortunately, doing ANYTHING (jumping, swinging the sword, throwing an apple, stopping completely, turning, landing from a jump, or even running through the enemy and taking damage) makes Aladdin begin his running animation cycle over again. So if there's an enemy in my way, there's no way for me to skid until I somehow do something to get past the enemy (which usually means running through and taking damage). This is why I can't skid as much as it seems I should during long flat areas with lots of enemies.
