	" is a homebrew Odyssey2 game, developed by John Dondzila and published in 1998 - the first O2 game to be released in 15 years after the console was initially discontinued. As with many later O2 homebrew games, it also had a limited cartridge release. Various cartridge variants have been released, with the title screen of the game displaying a special message to some limited-edition buyers. The game was sold through John Dondzila's website (advertised via

	"The gameplay has been likened to that of arcade classic 
	[em 
		"Berzerk
	]em
	" (1980). The player has to shoot their way through enemy robots in top-down maze-like rooms and make their way to the exit. The walls are also electrified hazards, and running into one is instant death. This repeats indefinitely, with rooms getting increasingly harder to traverse and enemies getting more difficult. After a certain amount of time, the invincible Smileybot will also chase the player, who can only be escaped by making it to the next room in time.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"The game has 12 unique room layouts. Once those stages are cleared, the stages will repeat in the same order, while the level counter continues to increase. It also has a progressively increasing difficulty slider, which affects the timing of enemies - the lower the value, the less time enemies wait before they start acting. This value starts at 32 and decreased by 1 for every level completed until it caps down at 4, upon reaching level 29.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Due to programming limitations, only one enemy can act at a time - which enemy it is and what exactly they do (shooting or walking a short distance) can be RNG-manipulated through player actions. Smileybot meanwhile appears at a set time after the level has started (also dependent on the difficulty slider), at one of a fixed set of positions based on the player's location.

	"I initally started working on this run in early February. At the time, there was no O2 submission or publication yet. I could have pushed through to get a first submission or publication for the system, but I opted to wait for this date instead, for lack of anything else to submit. (Incidentally, 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Super Cobra|href=/4424M)

	"This run goes through 12 levels, thereby passing every unique room layout in the game once. I chose this as an ending point as it adheres to the 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=movie rules for game ending for endless games|href=/MovieRules#GamesWithoutClearEnding)
	", by ending when no new content is left to complete.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"I considered other ending points based on difficulty, but it is difficult to pin down a definite ending point here. This is because the difficulty cap (RAM address 0x49) is not synchronized with the level loop. As well as that, the difficulty increase itself is less than impressive - while it forces some minor pathing changes due to different enemy actions (as well as RNG), as well as a little bit of variation in the score sub-goal, it does not affect the game enough in TAS conditions to make significant differences to the routing. Every stage would continue to be following the same general path, and would be beaten in exactly the same amount of time regardless of difficulty. I don't believe watching multiple loops of the game like this adds anything to the viewer experience.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Because just running towards the exit as fast as possible without any other consideration felt like it was a bit too straightforward of a goal (even if it is difficult in unassisted conditions, because the controls and instant-kill wall hitboxes are not very lenient), I added a secondary goal to go for high score in every room (as long as no time is wasted). This amounts to killing as many enemies as possible in each room for 10 points each, as well as gaining 100 bonus points if all enemies in a room are defeated.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"In terms of controls, the player character can move in cardinal and diagonal directions, as well as shoot in each direction. Pressing the shoot button will normally stop the player, but there is a convenient caveat: the player can only move every other frame, so pressing shoot for one frame on an in-between frame will not stop movement. Aiming will also not lose time on those frames, which means that effectively the player can shoot in any direction without losing frames on aiming or shooting.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The player does still have the limitation of only being able to have one bullet on screen at a time. This is important when aiming for score without losing time, as a bad target selection can result in having too much time spent with bullets flying around to be able to shoot every enemy while moving past.

Optimizing score is also very difficult, because being able to shoot my way past the early enemies requires shooting early and luck-manipulating the enemies to walk into the bullets for a shorter path. Then, more luck-manipulation was required to make sure that the enemies that are along the way wouldn't kill themselves into walls, and instead an enemy that is out of the way would kill itself into a wall instead. This is all while there is very little wiggle room for luck-manipulation (literally) because of the narrow passages.

Due to the little room, however, luck-manipulating enemies to do the ideal things for us became quite a challenge. I would need the bottom-left enemy to suicide by wall as there is not enough time to shoot it, but I would also need other enemies to not be shooting at the player or suiciding themselves. Meanwhile, the middle top enemy also has to move in certain ways in order to be in the way to shoot.

I must manipulate it to appear on the right side of the screen, as if it appears on the left, it's basically impossible to reach the exit. However, if I just follow the optimal path, I will be far enough to the left that Smileybot will always appear on the left side. A slightly sub-optimal path, losing 2 frames compared to a theoretical optimal path, is taken here to ensure Smileybot appears on the right side, so that it is far enough out of the way and it is possible to reach the exit.
