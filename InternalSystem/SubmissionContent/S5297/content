	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I think out of every game I've TASed, this is my absolute favorite, and I mean that for both the game and the TAS itself. A passion project from beginning to end, the most I've worked on a TAS, the most fun I've had with a TAS, pretty much the best thing I'll accomplish in my time on the site unless I start getting into Super Mario 64 TASing.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"And I'd rather not do that.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Gunstar Heroes is probably the best game on the Sega Genesis, and that includes all the other classics. It's a game about explosions, throwing your partner, explosions, lots of different guns, a little bit of mind control, explosions, color-based name schemes, similar outfits, explosions, shouting, and explosions.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This is a 16259 frame improvement over the 
	[a class=intlink href=/945M 
		"published run
	]a
	". Starting this TAS sorta just came on a whim, really... Then again, I guess most TASes are like that. I went into it with a couple ideas thinking I wasn't going to get a whole lot done and came out the other side with far more savings than I expected. The bulk of the improvements come from heavy optimization of boss fights and forced fights, but there's also some insane new improvements in stage movement and just pure optimization all around.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I started doing some testing with this game back in April, but judging (lmao) from my Youtube uploads I've been interested in Gunstar TASing since February. I started out by testing Gunstar Super Heroes, finding a few minor improvements in that before realizing I should just bite the bullet and do the original first. My first few tests ended with me finding a few movement improvements in Black's stage (which didn't end up being kept at all, as you'll see) and a quicker strategy for Papaya Dance in Pink's stage (which DID end up being kept, as you'll see). After that, I got sidetracked with other projects, because I'm Samsara. I helped out with a Star Wars, did some demon game where half-naked horse men beat a woman to death in what I can only describe as the President-elect's wet dream, and I think there was some sort of weird gimmick in there as well, but a couple months ago I decided to sit my sweet ass down and dedicate myself to this run full-time. No pay, though, because all the money I earned as a Judge went immediately to Nach in order to maintain Coca-Cola Kid's Star. TAS politics ain't cheap, yo.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Now I just need to find a new job in order to continue maintaining that Star. Anyone hiring? I'm a quick learner and I have a lot of experience in sitting on my sweet ass and watching video games in some form or another. Diversified talent right here. I can watch AND play video games!
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"After one restart very early on that definitely wasn't because I forgot to press Start to skip the opening menus and was definitely because I found some major improvements that didn't involve pressing Start to skip the opening menus I am a very good TASer and pressing Start to skip the opening menus is something I absolutely did not miss thank you very much, I worked like hell and somehow managed to actually finish it... Assuming I actually DO finish it, since I'm writing this part of the submission text before the run is even finished. I mean, if you're reading this and you're not me, then I finished it. That's kinda how things work.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"And yes, since I am writing this before finishing the run, that does mean I completely accurately predicted the final improvement time earlier in this section. It definitely written before the run was finished and I didn't go back and replace (INSERT FRAMES HERE) upon completion of the run. I'm just psychic. If you want a second prediction, donate 50 player points to my account and I'll be your Miss Cleo.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"That may have been the first time anyone's remembered Miss Cleo in well over a decade, and it's in the very beginning of a friggin' TAS submission text. The world works in mysterious ways.

[p 
	"What was I even thinking? Well, a couple of things, really. Also, it's just Samsara. I mean, I appreciate the comparison and all, but I'm still like 5000 words short of Mega Man Battle Network and Peace. War and Peace was a long book, right? I don't actually know what a book is. I only read visual novels. If you release a version of War and Peace that's occasionally intercut with half-naked anime babes and/or lesbian bondage, I'd be down to read it.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Lord almighty I hope other people have heard of Ladykiller In A Bind and don't just think I mentioned lesbian bondage out of personal fetishistic desire or anything.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The first reason that I mentioned too long ago for anyone to remember is simply because I was inspired by Weatherton's masterful Mario Kart 64 submission text. It's probably the best on the site, wonderfully laid out and informative and it reads like the most weirdly specific picture novel. It's like a picture book, except it's also a novel. Kinda like a visual novel. About lesbian bondage. Except instead of lesbians, it's Mario, and instead of bondage, it's Kart 64.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"What the actual Christ am I talking about anymore?
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The second reason is because this game just deserves an insane amount of documentation, and the previous submissions/publications for this game have been really limited on information. And jokes. And optimization, in some cases, but that's beside the point. I had to insert a good amount of information and jokes into this submission text in order to make up for every previous submission.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Or, realistically, a good amount of information and the same two jokes told over and over again. Hey, anyone remember those water puns? Maybe I should fish up a couple more! Hey, anyone remember when the submission thread for that run was nothing but more water puns?
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Hey, anyone remember when this submission text actually talked about the game? Me either.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There's also just a lot to explain in Gunstar that people unfamiliar with the game would need to have explained to them, like some of the more subtle mechanics, why it's weird that some enemies can be thrown and some can't, why I primarily use like 3 guns and don't bother with any of the others, the differences between each difficulty and why Expert is the only publishable one, and most importantly, I can't think of a funny enough joke to end on. Too bad! You saw this paragraph through to the end and I disappointed you!
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"...Ahem.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The third reason is because holy hell I just did not have the motivation to work on the run some days, so me being a "freelance writer", which is a fancier way of saying "unemployed", I would use those moments of no motivation to just work on this submission text. I like writing. A lot. More than I should, really. Did I make that obvious yet? Working on the text alongside the run allowed me to go way more in-depth about my strategies as opposed to my previous strategy of doing the write-up after I finished the run and promptly forgot damn near everything I did in it. The more I can explain, the more I'm prone to spats of pleonasms. Look that word up, I learned it like 2 days ago and I immediately thought "Boy, wow, I sure dang use a lot of those forever!"
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"That being said and done, let's get into the Let's Play portion of this submission text and deeply explain the mechanics and controls of the game. I'll edit in a facecam once I can set up the greenscreen rig that allows me to put my floating head over Gunstar Red the entire time.

And of course, you still have to fight all 7 forms of Seven Force in the Underground Mine.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Expert is chosen to give the most variety/entertainment/content. Despite the huge damage reduction, bosses are still cleared ridiculously fast, giving an extra level of TAS-ness to the run. Throughout the course of the guide, I'll be comparing Expert to Normal, because it's easier that way.

Those aren't actually their names, because that would be a tiny bit weird, but it's actually how they fire their guns. It's a simple difference: Free can move while firing, Fixed cannot. And yes, the characters are tied to the firing mode. It is possible to have two identical characters (apart from color: P1 is always Red and P2 is always Blue) if both players choose the same firing mode.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Despite the name of the game being GUN-star Heroes, guns don't get a huge amount of use in the TAS, but they're still a very important part of boss optimization and lag reduction, so I'll talk about them in great, great, great detail.

	"There are four base weapons in Gunstar Heroes, and these weapons can be combined with each other to make 10 unique gun combinations, or "gunbinations" as I just came up with. Depending on your playstyle, whether you're a single casual player or a crazy TAS Boy, each gun has its own strengths and weaknesses. There are a few that are way better than others, naturally, so myself being one of those aforementioned TAS Boys (well, moreso the TAS than the Boy, let's be real here), I stick with what works the best for going fast. If you want more information on every gun combination, whether it be because you're genuinely interested in playing this beautiful specimen of a game or whether you just want me to pad out this submission text even more than I already am, here's a dang list of all 14 weapons. Anything in quotes is direct from the game or instruction manual.

I'm so sorry this was your introduction to them. Anyway, Force is about average overall and doesn't get a whole lot of use in the run, though it's one of the best basic weapons for casual play. You generally won't be using just a single weapon when playing casually, most stages just immediately give you a second weapon before you even realize what just happened, but in general Force is just...

That's not a joke, 420 is an actual possible value for throw damage. Throwing the other player into an enemy/boss does about 20 damage per frame on Expert, and 50 damage per frame on Normal, which is far and away the fastest DPS over long periods of time.

[p 
	"What happens is that when you start throwing anything, whether it be your partner, an enemy, or a throwable object, that thing's position jumps behind the thrower.

	$LF

	"Basically, certain things can be thrown. That much is obvious, I suppose, if you're aware of the concept of throwing. But these "certain things" are normally completely unthrowable. Giant mechs, piles of crates, the list goes on, except it actually doesn't because I've only been able to throw those two kinds of things while testing this glitch out. From what I can tell, in certain cases and with certain obstacles/huge bosses, you can actually trick the game into throwing both the other player AND said obstacle/boss. This results in the player not getting thrown and the obstacle/boss... well, also not getting thrown, but instead getting "displaced", either ending up floating in midair or lodged slightly in the ground, a few pixels away from where it was thrown.

So you can probably figure out what happened anyway. You're a smart cookie. Oatmeal raisin, probs, since that way you've made sure that nobody wants to eat you.

Partner throws, as I said a few headers ago, do 20 damage per frame, but in between throws there's an 18-20 frame grace period where neither player can act. What this means is that each throw has to be in the correct direction, from the correct position, in order to minimize the number of throws needed to take care of a boss.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"But that's not all: Further frames can be saved by damaging bosses during the grace period. Even if players can't act, any shots that are on screen will continue to exist and damage anything they run into. If I can do at least 20 damage in between each throw, that's a frame saved each time. Chaser Fireball, the best gun, does 4 damage every 2 frames and can be positioned perfectly, so it's used between almost every single throw. Careful positioning of the shot between every throw allows more than 20 damage done between every throw, which can add up to 5-6 frames of savings overall.

[p 
	"Bosses can almost always be damaged before their healthbar shows up, and in some cases they can be damaged while offscreen. A lot of bosses require interesting/unique strategies in order to get the maximum amount of damage done to them before forced invulnerability periods or pattern changes or whatnot. This is basically a game that's almost entirely about the bosses, and boss fights make up a huge portion of the time saved over the previous run, so... Yeah. It's all cool.

This is also mentioned in Known Improvements below. The notes written for Pink's stage and Green's stage were written before the drop chaining discovery, and kinda reflect that by being positive about my movement improvements in Pink's stage as opposed to whining about how I couldn't even begin to get the motivation to redo both stages.'

These improvement times will include any movement improvements before that boss.

	"I start off the level with the first of a thousand throws, just to get everyone into the spirit of the run and to separate Red and Blue a bit.

Can't have that happening.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I do a bit of careful firing to maximize the time spent jump-kicking while minimizing the amount of lag in the level. Along the way, I manipulate the Item Bug to give a Fire pickup, giving Blue the Chaser Fireball that I spoke so highly about in the way too long weapons section. Blue will almost never get rid of this weapon. Red picks up a Lightning to go along with his Force, mostly because it doesn't matter what gun Red has right now.

The Phantom slide, apart from being the new hit dance move among the teens, allows me to consistently damage it without it going invulnerable. Minimizing or removing invulnerability times are the key to every single battle with a Phantom, for reasons about as obvious as "I CAN'T HURT THE DAMN THING WHEN I CAN'T HURT IT". This new strategy combined with tighter movement around the Item Bug leads to nearly 4 seconds of improvement right out of the gate.

	"This battle is where you start to see my usual pattern for taking down bosses: Start with a throw, pull out the Chaser Fireball, dawdle around for a bit, then send the Chaser Fireball at the boss while setting up the next throw. Throws do a consistent 20 damage per frame and normally block out all other sources of damage, so I can't combine throw damage and gun damage in most cases. I use one less throw than in the published run by starting each throw in midair as opposed to staying on the ground. This allows more "hits" on Papaya Dance per throw, and saves a little over a second.

Bravoo Man can actually take damage from multiple sources at the same time, so I use a Chaser Fireball shot to start the fight (it only has one "segment" but it doesn't lose any time), then combine partner throws, more Chaser Fireball shots, and jump attacks in order to take down this marvelous(s) man with The Best Music.

[p 
	"The sliding section afterward is one of the game's many on-rails sections, which is naturally used for playaround purposes. An interesting quirk when sliding is if you change directions within a frame, you'll continue moving in the direction you were travelling in before, but you'll face the other direction. It's kinda neat.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"NOTE FROM THE FUTURE: After watching the movie back way too many times, I've realized that the way I write and the way arki writes in the published run are fairly different, which I think is what lead to all the comments about my writing being harder to read. I wrote it in a way that I could read easily, and since I'm me and thus nothing I think or do matches what is normal in the world, I couldn't really see how unreadable it was to everyone else. I'm putting a section at the bottom of the submission text listing everything I wrote in the run. This entire section was meant to be blink-and-you'll-miss-it-and-then-complain-on-YouTube writing, so don't worry if you can't read it. You kinda weren't meant to.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This part's a good example of a rail section that gives me a lot to work with. The enemies raining down and the weird slide mechanics make this a nice, fluid section where a lot can happen even when not much is happening, if that makes any sense. It probably doesn't. Oh well. RTA runs generally sit offscreen at the top of the "slide", which trivializes the section by making it impossible for the players to take damage, so if you're playing this game casually and getting destroyed by this section, just move left until you're offscreen and you should remain completely unharmed.
	$LF
]p

	$LF

I figured out that Smash doesn't go invulnerable if he's doing that divebomb attack after a throw, so I use that to my advantage to pick up a good amount of extra damage, taking him out before the ship "docks" where Orange appears. Since this is basically on rails up to that point, finishing this fight any faster (or even a bit slower) would not gain or lose any time.

[p 
	"Orange is an interesting boss: He takes 420 (BLAZE IT) damage from throws, but cannot be damaged by throws until he's knocked into invulnerability at least once. Therefore, the strategy is to knock him down as soon as possible, but also make sure he's at a multiple of 420 (NICE) so that he can be finished off with quick drops every time his invulnerability's up.
	$LF

[p 
	"While he's flexing at the beginning of the battle, he won't go invulnerable, so I take the opportunity to start with a throw and get a real good amount of damage in before I quick drop him and knock him invulnerable for the first time. The first invulnerability period is longer than the rest for whatever reason, and from there it's all quick drops until he's blasted off the plane.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The way this strategy works is through careful "manipulation" of Orange's pattern. If a player is below him, he will always try to use the Break Wind attack on them as long as they are the closer player. If the player on top of the plane is too close to Orange, then he will try to suplex that player, and bah god those Gunstars have families! While he's using Break Wind, he's completely open to attacks until he stops breaking wind. As long as Orange is in the middle of Break Wind when he stops his invulnerability, the throw can always happen on the first possible frame.

Slopes and higher ledges are a problem, though, since you can't travel upward while drop chaining and slopes tend to mess with the timing by making it impossible to quick drop.

Of course, a casual player wouldn't realize that it's full-healing since Phantoms aren't considered bosses, but I've realized it and grown to hate it. With arki's strategy not working at all for me (which it did in my previous WIP, where I even managed to improve it by a few frames), I had to settle for a battle that's about a half-second slower. It's one of the sad, but negligible caveats of having a form of movement that's way too damn fast for its own good: You may get much better positioning on bosses and kill them much quicker, or you can overshoot things and have the new positioning work poorly in your favor. This isn't the only boss fight that suffers from me having moved to fast prior to it. You'll see that again in the next stage.

Technically, I could kill the Phantom faster by using a down+right throw instead of a downward throw so it hits the ledge instead of the ground, but his little death jumpback will jump off of the ledge and it actually takes longer overall.

In the TAS, it's basically just a short boss gauntlet with a couple HAPPY ITEM ROOMS mixed in for good taste, but in a casual playthrough there are a variety of possible bosses or short challenges that one can participate in.

Okay, not really, but they're fairly difficult to get through. The "THE WAY BACK" square will take you back to the beginning of the board, though any squares you have completed will remain completed. You'll see the other squares in action in the TAS, but they're a little more self-explanatory.

[p 
	"The fastest possible way to "throw" the die is to quick drop it out of a one-frame jump. The earlier the better, obviously, but the earliest moment is not always possible.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When playing casually with 2 players, each square is only meant for a single player. The player who rolls the die and lands on the square is the player that goes solo into that square. RTA runs kill off Player 2 in the first part of Black's stage, as it saves both players needing to roll the dice, but there are two problems with that for the TAS. One is that it ruins the point of the run being 2 players, and the second is that there's a frame-perfect trick that can be done in the TAS in order to save about as much time on all the bosses.

[p 
	"Under certain, unexplainable conditions, if you execute a throw on the right frame before teleporting out, the teleportation will be "skipped", and both players will be able to move during both the fade-out and fade-in. This causes a small bit of lag, maybe a few frames, but there's the super great "side effect" of allowing you to bring both players into the battle. Even if there's a couple frames of extra lag, having both players in every battle makes up for it in whole seconds due to throws and such, so it's always 100% worth it. There's a bit more to this bug, but it doesn't come into play until the battles actually start, so I'll explain more then.

	"And I really don't know what the proper conditions are for making that throw work, because it doesn't always work.

If I hadn't done that, he would've thrown a 1, landing on a yellow space and performing a laser attack that would completely prevent fast throw damage. He instead throws a 3, which puts him into the corner to receive a fair amount of throw damage. The throw displacement also puts him in a better position for upcoming throws, and...

	"The layout of the stage makes drop chaining inconsistent, though. The same thing that allowed me to pass through the wall in Black's stage is actually kind of a hindrance here, where I'll clip one player into a box, they'll end up on top of the box, and then I won't be able to continue the chain. Thankfully, Gunstar Heroes is looking out for me, and I'm usually on the far right side of the screen when this becomes an issue, so despite some weird movement sections there's no actual time loss since each issue is resolved before the screen catches up. The stack of four boxes is the only major obstacle in this first section, and passing over it leads to a lot of lag, but it's still much faster than having to break it down to get both players through. Despite the extra lag, I manage to get over it quickly enough to prevent the screen from stopping.

Red high jumps and throws that flying platform downward, which does 120 damage per frame upon exploding, taking out the Phantom easily. Much like the Black Phantom in Black's stage proper, I needed to find a way to minimize the death knockback. Keeping the Phantom on the ground is about 10 frames faster than letting him jump onto the box.

Smash here is more or less the same as he was in Orange's stage, so I reworked and optimized the strategy I used in Orange's stage and lock Smash into a quick kill pattern where he never goes invulnerable. This is an interesting pattern, and there's a lot going on despite how simple it looks.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The pattern is as follows: First, of course, I toss Red up. It doesn't actually matter for this fight because the strategy is so tight that there's almost no room to get a shot or two in edgewise, but I'm more used to throwing Red. On the way down from throwing Red, I'll fire a few shots before using a dropkick, then I quick-drop Smash right when I land, which sends him upwards quickly. He becomes vulnerable at the top of his arc, where Red is falling. I usually try to fire a shot upward for a tiny bit of extra damage at this point, though it doesn't always connect. While both Red and Smash are falling, Blue jumps out of the way just in time to avoid being hit by Smash's divebomb, then catches Red

Despite Smash looking like he's vulnerable right at the beginning of the fight, he actually isn't until the frame I first throw him. After that first throw, I don't actually use the dropkick because it breaks the pattern: Smash would go invulnerable if I dropkicked (notice how he actually looks like he's taking damage that first time around as opposed to all the other throws), so I just fire normal shots instead.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The dropkicks actually hit three times each use for a total of 60 damage, even though they look like they only hit twice. That's because the last tick of damage is done upon landing, even if it doesn't appear to hit. This is a neat little timesaver in the fight.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The change at the beginning of the battle is just the one time throw damage is actually effective against him. There's some weirdness happening here, and that throw should not even be possible because of it, but somehow it still works. Normally, if Smash isn't in his taking damage animation, he'll throw any player that gets close to him. You can see an example of this at the end of the battle. For this first hit, Smash can actually take throw damage without changing animations, which means that he would normally catch a player being thrown at him. For some reason, if the thrower is facing away from Smash, the thrown player will fly right through without being caught, doing a fair chunk of damage. This throw cuts the end of the battle a bit short by not needing to fire shots for the last two cycles of the upcoming, same-as-the-published run pattern.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I wanna say the reason that throw works in the first place is because of the position of the thrown player before he is thrown: You'll notice that Smash actually leaves the ground for a moment once Red passes through him, which signifies that he's going to use the mighty Bravoo Reg, or as I like to call it, the "Keep On Truckin' Attack".

	"Majestic. This attack is usually triggered by a player being above him, so I think that when Red is thrown, Smash sees Red as being above him, so he starts truckin', but he can't keep on truckin' because he's thrown out of it. The startup of this attack (i.e, him jumping) is actually vulnerable to throw damage, however he's immune to everything but being thrown once he reaches the peak of that initial jump. You can't get a whole lot of throw damage on him either while he's jumping because of the speed and height of his jump, not to mention that throwing him back down takes longer as a result, so unfortunately making him do that attack isn't conducive to a good pattern.

He can take exactly 124 damage from shots before going invulnerable (and of course can't take throw damage at all without going invulnerable). Something interesting I discovered here by complete accident: The base Fire weapon can actually do 4 damage per frame with only one character if the enemy is right up in your face. It's an interesting quirk, to say the least. This doesn't mean that damage from the other character will also apply: Remember that damage is normally supposed to be done once every two frames, and both players attacking at the same time means they alternate doing damage every frame. Kinda sucks, but it's not the end of the world.

The only difference between this run and the published run is that I'm a little more dynamic during downtimes. The published run keeps Smash directly between the two players, which confuses Smash as he's normally programmed to track toward the nearest player. This is kinda funny, but it's not the most exciting thing to watch for 8 cycles of shoot/throw/shoot/throw, so I decide to make things a tiny bit more active.

The main problem I have with this stage is that it is almost purely autoscroller, much like Green's stage, except Green's stage has more things to deal with and more things to do in order to keep it interesting (or at least somewhat close to it) all throughout. This stage kinda has the bullet hell thing going on, but the ship hitbox is a little too big and the bullets are a little too sparse to do a lot of close calls and such. Green's stage also has more moments where I could possibly save time: All of the train sections in Green need to be cleared as quickly as possible, for example, whereas all there is for this stage are the 3 bosses.

	[b 
		"always

]p
[p 
	"The issue with games like Gunstar Heroes and Splatterhouse is that the action keeps getting broken up by sections that can't be sped up, whether it be autoscrollers or timed sections or waiting for a die to roll several times. Speeding up the other parts of the run only means you're getting to these slow, plodding sections that much faster, so it creates this horrible dilemma where improving the run actually makes it seem slower-paced, since with each successive improvement, you're technically spending more overall time waiting around.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"It's a worse problem in Gunstar Heroes than it is in Splatterhouse, because Gunstar has longer autoscrollers, and the longer ones have the added """"""""""bonus"""""""""" of utilizing non-standard forms of movement. Green's stage with the minecarts and this whole shooter section, while being very fun to play casually, end up being kind of a nightmare to TAS. You find that you quickly run out of ideas, and even if you manage to find a good rhythm for a few minutes, you still have more to do after that.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This is compounded by bosses taking far longer, especially on Expert difficulty, as the only really quick way to kill a boss is to throw your partner at it repeatedly, a luxury which can't be done underground or in space. This makes these autoscrollers seem even slower after long periods of bosses dying within a few seconds of appearing on-screen. You need to shoot, and that also presents the problem of lag (especially when bosses have shots of their own), so that's a third level of slowness on top of everything else.

	"After I discovered drop-chaining and started implementing it into the parts of the run I felt like redoing, my first time watching back progress felt... weird.

	[b 
		"STOP
	]b
	" in the action whenever I had to slow down to deal with a boss or some other obstacle. And that's how the autoscrollers feel in terms of the run as a whole: Pink's stage, despite not using drop-chaining because I am a lazy jerk who didn't want to redo 2 months of work, is a super fast-paced start to the run. There's a lot going on, it's all taken care of super quickly, bosses are destroyed in seconds... And then you get to Green's stage, which is 3 minutes of not much happening followed by 3 more minutes of slowly plinking away at bosses.

Green first to get the autoscrolling out of the way, Orange next because it starts with another 2 minutes of autoscrolling, Black third since there's a lot of tricky movement at the beginning, and Pink bringing up the rear because it's the fastest, most technical stage, and it leads nicely into the drop-chain madness that is Save Yellow.

They have the right sort of "feel" as well, tight controls and fun mechanics and all those nice things that good games should have, plus I feel they're about the right length for casual play.

	"At the beginning of the fight, he's once again flexing his steroid-driven muscles and won't be knocked invulnerable by anything. Can't be thrown, can't be knocked out of that state until he stops, so I give him a good partner throw and skid him down until I'm able to throw him. I still need to be a good distance away to avoid the suplexing and to avoid any other moves where he's unable to be thrown.

With some initial tests, I couldn't really get either thing to work, but then I found a really good strategy that involves some careful jump and throw control, and I figured hey, if I had to take that 20 second attack, I'll still save a good amount of time with the new strategy.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Much like most human Boss Boys (like Toss Boys, except alliterative) in this game, Green can take a set amount of damage before being knocked invulnerable, and this set amount is dependant on like thirty different variables so I just new strategy my way into another gigantic improvement.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Green's a bit like Orange, in that Orange has some attacks where he's unable to be thrown, and Green... has some attacks where he's unable to be thrown. Maybe they're a lot alike after all. Point being, Green will always throw stars upon rising. Sometimes he will jump to the top level first, but after that he will start throwing stars just the same. He can't be thrown during this, otherwise I feel like this fight would have ended up more or less the same as Orange. Green takes less damage from being thrown, only 240, but it's still a fast amount of damage to do before he goes invulnerable. Naturally, minimizing invulnerability times is the name of the game here, and this new strategy works pretty darn well for doing that.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Much like most human Boss Boys (like two paragraphs ago, except exactly the same), Green's next attack is based on where the Gunstars are in relation to him. Further Boss Boys similarity comes from Green having an "attack" where he is vulnerable to throw damage, in this case coming down from a jump. The jump itself is an attack, but on the way down, he'll just take the throw damage like it's nobody's business.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"So the new strategy revolves around keeping him pressed up against the wall and jumping into it, allowing for an up-right throw that tracks him as he comes down, doing a large amount of damage in the process, then finishing the pattern off with a throw the frame he lands. Otherwise, he'd be hit by another tick of throw damage and instantly be knocked invulnerable, and that's 220 less damage than we can get in the same amount of time. Homie don't play that.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Sometimes, Green just doesn't cooperate with this pattern. Manipulating him into using the right moves sometimes just doesn't work if the same pattern is kept up all throughout, so there are times where I have to substitute a quick drop for a normal throw. Green takes an extra 80 damage if he collides with a wall while being thrown, which takes about 15 extra frames from a normal downward throw. This does allow 80 more damage per cycle (760 as opposed to 680)... But it's not enough to save a cycle, so doing it is just a waste of 15 frames each time... Except for the last time, where I needed to do it to properly manipulate Green into doing the jump.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I do apologize for the battle being a lot of standing around, but moving around too much affects Green's next attack, so I have to stay still. I do as much as I can to try to make it a little more entertaining but there's not a WHOLE lot.

[p 
	"That is the power of the Chaser Fireball.

]p
[p 
	"The battle shifts between the gems rotating in place, where I do ridiculous amounts of damage by rotating two Chaser Fireball shots in the opposite direction. It's about 15-16 damage per frame on average, which is less than a throw but as I said earlier, throws don't work too well on the gems. For an example of this, watch the published run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The gems don't stay in place the whole time, though, and will start moving around and following Golden Silver in a segment I like to call "damn near impossible to optimize". Once this is over, three of the gems will return to their rotation and the last one starts attacking on its own. Golden Silver itself can't be damaged, only momentarily disabled, which is done a few times to prevent it from attacking the Gunstars.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Honestly, despite being the most improved battle in the run, there's not a whole lot else to say about it. I avoid Golden Silver's attacks, I keep up a barrage of flames on the gems, and I end input a little early by letting go of the Chaser Fireballs when they're guaranteed to finish the battle off.

It's the "completely preventable" kind of awful where the only reason I'm in the situation I'm in is because I don't have the motivation to bring myself out of it. Pretending that it's uncontrollable and life-destroying is the easy way out, and it's only going to keep breaking the ground underneath me and plummeting me deeper and deeper into this hole.

	"And that is ultimately why I stepped down, because it's the first, and admittedly easiest, step for me to take in order to, if you'll pardon my Rule of Three usage of this joke,

	" It's something I worried about that I no longer have to worry about, and it's much easier than giving up drinking or chain-smoking or my crippling addiction to peanut butter and LSD sandwiches. I'm thousands of dollars in debt after buying all the LSD I could get my grubby little mitts on, but damn if it isn't the best tasting PSX game.

	"I know what you're thinking: "You actually worried about being a Judge?" Yes. Yes I did. You probably had the same kind of worries at your first job, or your first day at a new school, or your first time getting close to someone you think is cute. I worried that I'd make the "wrong decision" and have to deal with weeks of fallout, which has happened more than once over all the decisions I made and usually over the weirdest friggin' things, like the time Gummy Bears lead to staff meetings/arguments and an actual site rule change, because when anyone thinks about staging an uprising, a coup, or a mutiny, their first thought is Gummy Bears.

	"I worried that I was doing too much at times, to the point where I started worrying that I was actively demotivating the other Judges with my nonstop activity, and thus I would worry about stepping back from the site because I was convinced we'd have another month like February on our hands, where I watched and analyzed 5 submissions in a single day, only to see 6 more submissions come in within a few hours of each other.

[p 
	"Are these major worries? No, not at all, not in any way, shape or form. Perhaps "frustrations" would've been a better word. Annoyances, grievances, normal parts of a job, whatever you want to call them. They're just the barbed wire star on top of the Christmas tree of broken glass that is the rest of my worries. They're fairly painless to remove as long as it's done right, and I'd like to think that stepping down is "doing it right", as opposed to my usual method of climbing on a Segway, tossing a molotov cocktail onto the bridge behind me, and riding off into the sunset flipping the double bird. And then flipping the Segway and hitting two birds with it. My own birds. Now my hands are all broken.

	"It's much too early for me to finalize my thoughts about the run, though I feel like out of everything I've worked on, this has been the most intense in several ways. If I were more egotistical and self-centered, I would call it my magnum opus. However, my feelings can change in the future. I want to look back on this magnum opus in a month or three and think "Yeah, this was pretty sweet. I'm proud of this." Will I? Maybe, maybe not.

	"Like judging, I started the run off with a good amount of motivation. Like judging, the midpoint was pretty weird and I took a couple breaks that ended up being shorter than I would have liked. Like judging, everything just went south at the end and there were at least 2 or 3 moments per session where I felt like my time wasn't going to be worth it. Like judging, I'd look back on what I did on a daily basis and see things I did wrong, knowing that I can't fix them. Like judging, I need a friggin' break.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"But there's a flipside to it all. Like judging, I'd look back on what I did on a daily basis and see things I did really well. Like judging, I put my all into everything even up until the end. Like judging, I settled into a really nice optimized pattern that allowed super-efficient work without sacrificing any quality. Like judging, I truly enjoyed my time doing it from start to finish. Like judging, I feel like what I'm doing is helpful to people in some way. Like judging, I'd like to come back and try everything again someday, when I'm much better off as a person.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"And most importantly of all, like judging, I know that even if it's too early for me to reflect on everything I've done, I'm almost positive that when that time comes, I'll feel as though it was 100% worth the time and effort. Even if I made mistakes, even if I couldn't motivate myself to perfect absolutely everything the first time around, I can't see myself looking back on my work and despairing.

[p 
	"But, at this point, I think I'm just glad to be done. Glad to be done with the run and glad to be done with my staff positions and everything attached to them. I can close the metaphorical door on this chapter of my life and open the literal door to the world outside where my PC sits, especially since I spent a long while repairing said literal door after I literally shoulder-bashed it off the hinges a week and a half ago.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"But as for the metaphorical door, I'm just going to wave to everyone, step through, and leave it slightly ajar so as to not lock myself out forever. Then, maybe some time down the line, when things are better for me, I can come right back and shoulder-bash 
	[em

This new movie takes the greatness and entertainment that made the previous so great and adds even more to it whilst improving the movie by over 4 minutes at the same time! The audience also responded very positively overall on this submission.
