	""Enchanted: Once Upon Andalasia" is a prequel to the 2007 Disney Movie "Enchanted". It is also one of the absolute latest Game Boy Advance games, releasing in mid November 2007. The game is a 2D platformer where you take control of Giselle, Pip and prince Edward who have to save Andalasia from an evil fairy who is stealing Andalasia's magic and kidnapping innocent animals. Being a prequel to the movie, the game takes place exclusively in Andalasia, so we never Giselle, Edward and so on go to the real world outside of a handful of stills from the movie being in the game. It is not a ground-breaking game by any means but it also not bad for what it is, you could certainly do a lot worse. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The game has a total of 13 levels, 9 Giselle levels and 4 Edward levels. The final level is only accessible if you beat the game 100% and as that would require playing a majority of the levels twice, we just stick to beating up to level 12 in Any%.

	"I am a huge fan of the movie (if you haven't seen it, I highly, highly recommend it) which ultimately resulted in my doing RTA runs for this game. I ended up really enjoying the run and I ended up grinding this game a fair bit, finding many strats and pushing the game much lower than I initially imagined. Because of my enjoyment/knowledge of the game, I wanted to see a TAS come to fruition and it took it upon myself to make that a reality.

	"The main bulk of the game are the Giselle levels. You mainly take control of Giselle but you can also switch to Pip whenever needed. There are 9 Giselle levels and each level and split up into multiple sections. You have 3 hit points and there is no way to recover health outside of dying. Giselle's moveset consists of a jump, a crouch/crawl and a sing. Giselle's singing is affected by different animals you save throughout the game who alter the ability of your sing. In order to use animal powered songs, you need to collect music notes. You either need 10 small notes or 1 big note to sing and you can hold up to 3 songs depending on how far in the game you are. Pip can fit through small spaces, climb up walls, pull objects and distract enemies with a taunt. Pip also does not take any damage but he can still be hit.

	"Whenever you grab onto a ledge, you have two options to get up the ledge. The first option is to climb up the ledge. This makes you fully invincible but it is relatively slow. The second option however is to jump off the ledge. If you press back and jump while on the ledge, you will jump of the ledge. This is significantly faster than climbing up a ledge, it gives you more freedom when landing on top of a ledge and since there are a lot of ledges in this game, every ledge jump counts. You do have to frame perfectly time a ledge jump (or a ledge climb) to perform it as early as possible but how you perform a ledge jump itself does not really matter. You have a ton of time to do pretty much whatever you want while you wait to get up on top of a ledge. I do mix up how I perform ledge jumps throughout the run but I restrained from doing anything too crazy on the ledges outside of a handful of instances. Ledge climbs are almost always avoided outside of specific instances.

		"Damage boosts
	]b
	$LF
	"Damage boosts in this game are a bit odd as there are two different damage states. The first damage state is "physical damage", caused by trolls and fall damage. When you are in a physical damage state, you have almost no iframes so you can't go through enemies/obstacles. These damage boosts are still very useful but they are a bit more limited. The second damage state is "projectile damage", caused by smaller enemies and projectiles. When you are in a projectile damage state, you actually have a fair amount of iframes to work with. This is particularly useful against rock trolls as you can get hit by a rock the troll throws and then you can walk past the troll. Damage boosts are a key part of the run and every level has areas where damage boosts are beneficial.

		"Jumping VS walking off ledges
	]b
	$LF
	"There are numerous instances in this game where you have to go down a ledge to get to a lower part of the level. This gives us a choice: do we jump down the ledge or do we walk off the ledge? Whichever one you want to do depends on the exact ledge. Sometimes jumping is faster, sometimes walking is faster, it is a case by case basis. You also have to consider factors like ceilings, adjacent platform locations fall damage and bird spawns when making this decision.

	"Giselle's walk and air speeds are identical but there is one notable difference. When Giselle walks, she takes a bit of time to accelerate to full speed. When Giselle jumps however, she reaches max speed pretty much instantly. This can save up to 4 frames compared to walking. This is used whenever Giselle is at a stand still and you need to start moving.

[div class=p 
	"Not taking fall damage is naturally useful because we only have 3 HP and every piece of health counts. Saving HP and not losing any time for it is a notable positive. Not triggering the birds however is a much bigger positive. If you have a music note, falling down far enough will trigger some birds. These birds slow down your fall and prevent you from taking fall damage. The main problem with these birds is that they not only significantly increase the amount of time you are in the air but they also cost a music note (they also activate before fall damage starts which is annoying). Music notes are vital in specific areas and they really cannot be wasted. Pip/Sing dropping allows us to fall faster and save a music note which is a big timesave in areas where we have to go far down. Pip dropping has a shorter animation but sing dropping can be preferable in certain instances, whichever one is needed/preferred depends on the situation.

	]b
	$LF
	"By holding the L button, you open up a menu where you can switch between your different song abilities. The game normally pauses when you activate this menu. If you activate the menu the same frame as skipping a cutscene however, you will go back to normal gameplay after skipping the cutscene but the song menu will open. This lets you move around with the menu open. This is naturally useful as it allows you to switch songs without having to pause the game. It's typically not a big timesave but it does save time so we do use it on almost every cutscene where we need to change songs. Controlling Giselle with menu storage is awkward but since this is a TAS, we can easily use it smoothly.

	$LF
	"Enemies in this game operate on consistent patterns. They spawn in a certain location and they move in a certain pattern. Knowing this, it is possible to reset an enemy to its default position. If Pip is already out and he is a certain distance away from Giselle, we can switch to Pip, wait a certain amount of time and then switch back to Giselle. When this is performed, the enemy Giselle is near will respawn in its default position and it can't hurt Giselle until the player switches back to Giselle and she is on screen again (assuming Giselle is close enough to an enemy). This can be exploited. If we move Giselle far enough along a platform with an enemy, we can switch to Pip and then when we switch back to Giselle, she will be in front of the enemy. This skips having to take out the enemies (typically with a hedgehog) which is not only faster in numerous cases but it also typically saves a music note which can be very beneficial.

Menu storage saves over a second here and it is by far the biggest individual timesave it brings. After taking a hit from fall damage, we get an extra note and we make it over the platform without grabbing the edge. We then Pip drop down the last drop, which is much faster than dropping off normally and it saves us a note. As a sidenote, skipping the birds is not possible.

If we skip the cutscene too early, we actually lose a chunk of time. This is the only cutscene like this, it is extremely strange. We can then do the Pip area where Giselle takes damage from the bird and Pip exclusively climbs up the left side of the area, skipping a bunch of platforming. Pip's double jump is always stored until it is used and it only refreshes when he lands on the ground. We can choose to use it either immediately or we can wait to use it on a wall.
