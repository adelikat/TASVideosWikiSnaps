What even made it crazier is the fact that I discovered new broken stuff that literally changed how the game was played, and I'm happy that I did

		"This is potentially the biggest source of improvements. The way you move in this game either by crawling, walking/running, web swinging or web zipping. Later in the run we obtain an ability called Winged Assault (requires Gliding ability), which allows Spidey to bolt forward in a fast manner, however its usage is based on the situation and it is NOT always faster.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Comparing to the current run, it makes use of all of these ways of moving but there are some key parts that it doesn't pay attention to:
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				"In this game, the fastest way of moving/flying is by Web Zipping. Ideally you want to maximize the usage of Web Zipping. It has 8 directions so mostly you want up + right/left then down + right/left. This increases Spidey's speed significantly, and if you follow up with a Web Swing, it increases it further.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				"Approaching doors is not trivial. If Spidey hits the ground off of a speedy Web Swing or from a Web Zip, he rolls, otherwise, he tries to stop while standing. Rolling is faster, especially against doors, as it allows him to get to the next area earlier compared to walking.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				"The current run also doesn't make use of the dodging ability, which allows rolling faster inside vents.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				"This is a beat'em-up game style, which means the more you combo two or more enemies, the faster you finish the fights. This game has several conduits and locked fighting rooms. Each has a good set amount of enemies, so mixing a bunch in one fist is faster but most importantly satisfying! Fights also become laggy the more enemies screen too, so that also helps reducing lag.

[ul 
	[li 
		"While this game is a Metroidvania style, it is quite different as there aren't warp zones, and I think they replaced them with portals to other Spideys (Noir and 2099), making the route linear as a whole. Each time you use a portal, you get a new mission, however, it is possible to do missions earlier if you can. Taking early Electro for example. this mission is supposed to be the last before the final mission, yet we do it early, allowing us to gain Spider Dash which is incredibly powerful. The current TAS does it too but it is worth noting here as well since it matters later. Also, during each mission, I changed the routes by taking some shortcuts.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"The boss order is as follows: Mysterio->Boomerang->Vulture->Tinkerer->Electro->Calypso->Silvermane->Super Mysterio. Current TAS follows same order, except it switches between Tinkerer and Electro.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Couple tricks that have been discovered before and while I was making this run:
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				"Running in the vent: Normally, if you web zip into a vent, you can roll and get farther inside that vent, however, it was found that if you roll way earlier and make Spidey stand up just as soon as he tries to enter the vent, you actually run instead. It can bee seen at 
				[a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBStgHj9Avo&t=122 rel=noopener external nofollow

				" and 
				[a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBStgHj9Avo&t=490 rel=noopener external nofollow 
					"8:10
				]a
				" in the above encode. It saves a good amount of frames, though sadly, probably only those two spots where it is useful
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				"Unintended Spider Dash: The Spider Dash ability is very similar (and probably better) to Speed Booster from Metroid Fusion and Metroid Zero Mission, where you hold the directional button and Spidey keeps running until he gains his maximum speed with which he can break some barrier but most importantly is dealing very high damage to enemies. This last part is not supposed to be carried over during boss fights, however, because of how early you can gain that dash, it is possibly to use it during boss fights. Thanks to crawling ability, you can run at same speed in the wall, and for some reason, if you jump just before the moment the dash starts, you basically start it against a wall. Moreover, since enemies/bosses don't have i-frames, you can basically kill them

		"Speed Overflow glitch: This is the biggest glitch I found in this game. It changed how the game is seen as a speedrun, as it can allow wrong warping straight to Super Mysterio, as demonstrated 
		[a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvF-dYKPQWQ rel=noopener external nofollow 
			"here
		]a
		", if you use it during a conduit room fight. However, wrong warping is not possible in this category as we need to finish the conduit room to obtain the abilities as part of the item and we cannot go back to the same conduit. That being said, it is still possible to use it during Mysterio's dimension to skip those long rooms, saving a big chunk of time. There is another sad part about this glitch, which is that it requires two things:
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				"A giant enemy (doesn't matter if its a robut lol), as its hitbox and landing animation from a swinging hit is what enables the overflow. Hitting on his landing window (4 frames) probably creates a bug within memory values, causing them to overflow.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				"Facing left side, as I could not do it not a single time on the right side (could not skip second room in Mysterio's dimension sadly). This strongly support the theory of overflowing as the game probably tries to reduce Spidey's speed to 0 but instead it overshoots it to below 0 then it loops that infinitely until a collision or another condition that stops the loop (Not sure exactly but that is what I'm thinking).

		". Normally, to defeat him you need to destroy his three generators. Each generator requires beating a good amount of enemies before it turns on, and only one generator can turn on at a time. Though, it was discovered that you only need one enemy to be defeated for it turn on. Because we have multiple enemies on screen, defeating just one can enable a generator, and somehow if you have more enemies left on screen, beating one of them will turn the another one earlier than it should. Sadly, we can't turn all three generators at once as it is not possible due to having just two big robots. Even if we have more, the generators don't stay on enough to turn on all three and clear them all.
