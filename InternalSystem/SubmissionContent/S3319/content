[p 
	"Kenseiden stars Hayato, a samurai that has to fight against warlocks and evil spirits that plague 16th century Japan. The warlocks stole the five secret scrolls and the sword of the Dragon Lord. Hayato, who has dragon blood in his veins, must recover the scrolls and sword and enter the castle and kill Oda Nobunaga.

[p 
	"In the original Japanese version, Hayato is blond. In the Western versions he has black hair.

]p
[p 
	"I really suggest that you don't read any of this before seeing the TAS itself.. o_o
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Decided to use all my Kenseiden experience acquired on the 100% run to improve the any% run a little, turned out I could change route and improve it by more than one minute.. could even improve parts that can be applied to the 100% run in the future.. =P

		"Tricks and glitches
	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Hayato moves 1 pixel per frame when walking right, left or jumping right, but on left jumps, we can press left once more and he will be faster than this, around 1,0625 pixels per frame, this saved around 12 frames per going left screen.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The game only accepts input on half the frames, and that depends on the scene we are in. It's odd or even, can change a lot, but not during the same scene, the game has no lags at all.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There are two types of floor in which Hayato can walk: platform, that recalculates his Y position while keeping the X speed at 1, and ground, that recalculates his Y position but sets X speed to 0.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Landing: when the floor is ground, we can land on good frames, which are the ones that set our Y position to the same one as the floor. Example: we're falling at speed Y 3 and 255 for subpixel, which goes 4 pixels per frame. Y floor being 127, if we're at 123 on the frame that accepts input, he will fall directly on 127, which will make we not lose frames, other values, 126, 125, 124, 122, 121, 120 .. make him lose 2 frames. 2 frames per jump made me gain around 170 frames in the end. 119 makes him lose 1 frame, which leads the game into making us lose the other one on a screen transition.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Attacking in mid-air is preferred, because Hayato keeps going right or left depending on the situation. This attacks had to be made 16 frames before landing, or else he will pose there, with 0 X speed and lose 2 to 14 frames.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Jumping on ladders: Hayato actually climbs up ladders a little faster and is recalculated for 3 pixels of gaining in one frame when we press up on the ladder at a good situation.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Taking damage: when we can't take an enemy out without losing frames, there is the trick that makes it possible to go through them, we just have to be hit by an enemy that cames from our back. Tests indicate that this is faster than going back for 10 frames or more to gain space to jump over something.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Some enemies walk with us, that being said, I don't need to attack them, they just go with me, walking together. This saved frames in 1 situation or 2.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Snakes are ground enemies that can hit us with their heads or tails, but their bodies are not considered, so we can walk inside them, only when they are striking. (same speed) =P

		"Luck Manipulation
	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Random variables have little use in this game, but enough to not being a good idea to hex-edit, these are the moments that can change completely: falling rocks can change direction randomly, blue fiends can jump right or left, flying bubbles are harmful and can change speed, and the final boss' shots change their flights' directions. (but now I can manipulate the final boss into not shooting anything after the first one)..

	"- "faish" is done in air, up+1 after defeating the second boss. 20 frames in air, not a problem except we have to do it 20 frames before landing, or else Hayato gets stuck there until the attack is done. (Actually used the stuck time in my favor when fighting one of the bosses)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- "kaoshi" is not in this run, but I should mention that it is a weaker, wider crouch attack. 1/2 of the usual crouch damage, not really wanted on a speedrun, in my opinion.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- "pling" is the frame saving attack in many situations, we just have to start holding 1 after any attack or landing, and then crouch. After a pling, we have to jump front to avoid losing 4 frames, as the game recalculates our crouch position and our standing one.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- Standing and crouching attacks are only used in bosses.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- Taking damage cost 24 to 26 frames of non-moving Hayato, with 3/4 of speed, which means only 8 frames lost if you're pushed front.

	"Memory Watch on MHS got these good memory positions that made the calculation of good frames to land very easy:

[p 
	"00D44153- X position subpixel, made me realize that sometimes I was losing frames when turning, and it was fixed.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"00D44154- X position on screen (stops when it's moving), helped me because it changes on bosses for better positions.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"00D44155- Y speed subpixel, that was on the formula, button 2 changes it by summing less Y speed each frame.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"00D44156- Y speed, it's negative when we're going up, and positive when we're falling.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"00D44157- X speed subpixel, the reason I discovered that left jumps are faster.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"00D44158- X speed, it's 1 when going right, 255 when going left, 254 (with subpixel 240) when jumping left.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"00D49F4C- Y position, not the only one, but one was enough to make calculations, even if it gets weird numbers when Hayato is taking damage..
