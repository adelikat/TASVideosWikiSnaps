Most gamers in the US however have never heard of him (including me before I saw a reference to the games on this list of game ideas: http://tasvideos.org/ListOfIdeas.html ).

]h3
[div class=p 
	"This game boils down to choosing the shortest route to collect and drop off the needed items, then running and jumping through the route while maintaining the highest speed.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"To track speed there is a RAM address (72) that holds speed.  It starts at 0, and increases by 1 every frame a direction is held, up to a maximum of 48.  If you let go of the direction for a frame, it gets divided in two, rounding down (ie if you are running at 47 it will drop to 23).  If you press the opposite direction it reduces immediately to zero.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"If you hit a wall, speed reduces to 1 (you don't move, but this allows you to jump over the wall).  Similarly, if Dizzy runs into a small dip in the ground his speed will reduce to 1.  It will also go down it you run into a corner or sometimes when you hit his head into an overhanging corner.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Also, if you run between screens his speed will usually halve itself for a few frames.  Presumably this is because the game is not accepting input, so the game thinks you've "let go" and slows Dizzy down.  So, you will see him usually jump as he transitions between screens as this helps maintain maximum speed.
	$LF
]div
[h3 id=Jumping 
	"Jumping
	$LF
]h3
[div class=p 
	"Jumping is fairly strict in this game.  If Dizzy's speed is 0 he jumps straight up and down a set distance which is unrelated to how many frames you hold the A button.  You can't steer in the air.  If his speed is greater than 0 he maintains the same speed during the jump and moves up the same distance as he would from a standstill.  During the jump, he flips.  One flip takes exactly the amount of time it takes for him to go up from and back down to the same altitude as when he started the jump.  If he ends up in the air longer than one rotation he starts another.  So, if he jumps to a lower level, he will usually land in midflip, which causes him to roll along the ground until he completes the flip.  You cannot control him until he comes out of the roll when he completes the flip.  But, while rolling he maintains the same speed as the initial jump.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"So, jumping before you reach max speed is slower, but jumping at max speed is at worst the same as running, and at best is a good way to avoid various slowdowns on the ground.  Sometimes Dizzy has to land and run for a couple of frames before jumping again, but sometimes he can jump a few frames before he even hits the ground!
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Falling is similar in that Dizzy maintains his speed and you can't steer until you hit the ground.  One technique that saves time when dizzy needs to fall off a cliff and run back in the opposite direction is to steer in the opposite direction at the last frame before falling off.  This reduces his speed to zero so he falls straight down instead of going off in the wrong direction during the fall.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Normally you have to be on the ground and stopped to go into Dizzy's backback.  When he's falling at zero speed you can start the process of going into the backpack even though he's not on the ground.  If by the end of his animation he is not on the ground the process cancels and nothing happens.  But, if he's on the ground it goes as normal.  I use this a couple of times to save a few frames.

I manage to climb this elevator without waiting, and pass by a rather perturbed looking gentleman (who's wearing a neon green potato sack and purple leggings).  Secretly he is a trumpeter missing his trumpet.  Dizzy saw a trumpet but it didn't look that important.  He is embarrassed and decides not to talk to this poor sad man, a man with nothing to offer but love, and possibly a flying carpet.  A flying carpet that could send a legged egg from one cloud over to another cloud, potentially a cloud baring a crown.  But oh well, got that crown anyways so, yeah, you're screwed trumpet dude.  Dizzy runs through the banquet hall, and ends up at the controls of the

Far be it from video games to break down stereotypes.  No ordinary woman, this is the Princess, though she can't float while carrying boxes with scrolling words on them, nor can she cleverly hide her identity to aid some elf dude save the world (end of spoiler for oot)  No, this princess can only be appeased by that most powerful of items: the Jokebook.  She's so happy she gives you her only flag.  (Well she might have more... we'll leave that to your imagination.)

	"Cool, ramparts.  There's a cowardly cherry here that won't even get anywhere near dizzy.  Oh yeah and a scary man with beard wearing plate mail (and possibly smoking a pipe?).  It's a King, and apparently he claims that he returned when he saw the flag.  Which is odd, because to get where he is he would have had to run directly past dizzy and we didn't see him go anywhere.  In fact he doesn't move at all (like all the characters almost?)  Then we talk to him two more times (!) and finally give him that crown thingy and then the king tries to set you up with his daughter.  Dizzy tells the king he's spoken for, and now that he mentions it there's this wizard that's trapped his true love yadda yadda yadda, so, the king says "you are a knight".  Yeah, like that'll help.  OK actually it does since for some reason only a knight can break the spell on Daisy.  Or something.  Dizzy grabs the convenient key and runs.... back through practically the whole game.  He's so happy that he starts jumping a lot.  At one point Dizzy prevents himself from being knocked out by landing on a rock (because he gets knocked out after falling a certain distance, the rock is barely enough higher than the surrounding ground that it is the only safe landing)  kills himself again in the river (no fancy jumping though :(  Then looks up and sees he's missing 5 stars still!  Man, what's left?  Oh yeah, cloud land.  Now remember that star I said I purposefully missed?  When Dizzy jumps off to the right to get the lone star in the sky he has to fall more than enough to knock himself out.  But, when he falls into the bottom star (which is right next to the ground) he gets congratulated for finding all the stars... whoo.  Well, when he comes back his fall counter is reset and he safely and gently lands, ready to head into evil castle one last time.  Which has one last evil elevator, most evil elevator of all.  In that it's slow and long.  But, at the top...
