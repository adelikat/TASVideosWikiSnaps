Later on, I would start getting them from a magazine shop. By that time, I never knew anything about this game. What a great game this was and I surely missed out on playing it in my youth.

	"This game was completely addictive for me to TAS. It took me about 2 months to complete. After the first round of TASing, I learned an amazing amount of tricks and strategies to further improve it on my 2nd attempt. Even with all that, my knowledge still increased and prompted a 3rd round of TASing, which lead to me getting highly frustrated. Yet, I prevailed and now I'm able to deliver a movie that I'm highly satisfied with.

One for forcing the "Grey" blocks to green and the other to force the "Capsules" to spawn as I needed them. The only part of this game that wasn't BOTed, was the routes and strategies. In my opinion, BOTing the routes and strategies would take an impossible number re-records to optimize any screen, due to the constant change in RNG affecting everything that happens on the screen.
