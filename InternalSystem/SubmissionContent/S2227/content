In other seasons those plants was small and you can step on them and collect stuff really easily...but in autumn....I need to use A+Z glitch to collect those notes because lowest note is so close to the plants eyes so it can't collect other way without taking a damage. When Banjo is a bee, pressing B and ^, bee goes lot faster.

I manipulated questions so its always the first or second answer (first and second answer can push in same frame so it does matter which one is it). I collect 2 joker cards to get rid off two timelimit squares. I choose the Box fight in the remaining timelimit square because its fast to kill with wonderwings.

There is not enough time to shoot 3 eggs before the animation :( after that its possible to get that green Jinjo activated in same time as purpe one but there is a problem...game "freezes" if I do that...game runs but I can't do anything...Banjo just stands still no matter which button I push...even start won't work...and Gruntilda can't do anything either :D she tries to shoot fireballs but they vanished immediately...anyway...to get activate green Jinjo right, I need to shoot one egg separately.
