	"In this game you have a few moves.  There's a slash that Dottie can do, and a drill attack which is really fast.  Dottie has to hit an enemy in order to use the drill, either from slashing one or from hitting one with the drill attack.  I try to set up my Drill usages to chain them against other enemies.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"You can also change directions if you have another drill attack available, and there's a trick you can do where you drill in the wrong direction you're moving.  If an enemy is hit, the game will think you're moving in the direction Dottie is facing, so this means I can change position during some chains.  You can also cancel a drill by pressing the B button.

[div class=p 
	"Later on in the game, there are some enemies that will knock back Dottie.  If I angle Dottie's position while drilling, we can make her get some height in the tree stage, and also use it to clip through some walls in the last level before the boss.

	"One other feature in this game that isn't really used that much is the perspective mode, which allows Dottie to use her Owl friend to find hidden spots, which will make those platforms explode.  perspective will only work if the Owl collects 4 items that are dropped from the lego head enemies, sometimes I have to wait a bit before continuing to make sure the owl grabs those tokens.  There's also two moments where while I'm waiting for some platforms to explode, I kill an enemy to get an extra token so I can save on having to get one from other enemies.
