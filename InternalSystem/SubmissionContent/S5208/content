	"It's Spider-Man......2!! This is what I consider the first 'meh' 3D Spidey game, since it didn't really fix any of the original game's problems or do anything very original. Still, in a TAS setting this game is quite a bit better due to the lack of autoscrollers or forced waiting times, making the game pure optimization.

[p 
	"Web swinging is garbage in this game, as you have zero control over where Spidey wants to swing to. The way it work is that Spidey will swing to whatever object he's currently being moved towards, which can cause his web swings to vary wildly as a result. For an example, when over a pit he will commonly swing at an upwards angle, when close enough to a building to swing there in one swing he'll do one low fast swing, and so on. Getting optimal swinging angles was extremely difficult as a result.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Another aspect of web swinging is a 'web zip', which is where Spidey shoots a line forwards and launches to that point. It requires Spidey to be touching the ground and be a decent distance from a wall, which makes it pretty worthless outdoors, but amazing in tight corridors.
