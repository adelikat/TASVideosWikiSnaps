	": Romhacking.net only has version 1.1 of the hack available on their site as the hacker didn't include the older patches. As this submission was done on version 1.0 of the hack, I took the time to find the right version, make a patch as I could only find the hack prepatched, and upload it to the Internet Archive to make this older version more readily available.

	(__wikiLink|displaytext=the Megankreuzstilette submission|href=/8367S)
	" I'm noticing a lot of bosses in this Mega Man 3 hack not being defeated more towards the center. In Mega Man 3 the boss explosions leaving the screen is what triggers the end of level event so having the explosions travel across the screen less saves time. While there are some bosses where it might be hard to tell if it would even save time by manipulation or otherwise waiting for a better boss position, there are definitely a few bosses where it's definitely doable. The standout ones from what I caught was the Doc Wood Man (getting him to jump left to the room's center rather than right towards the edge) and Doc Heat Man (getting the last hit with Heat Man moved towards the horizontal center of the arena though trickier since there's a big ol' pit there) fights. I would reckon that this would save at best seconds, which isn't a whole lot considering that this is a TAS that's over 25 minutes. Outside of that little bit, this all looks good.
