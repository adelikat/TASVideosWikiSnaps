	"This was one of my favorite arcade classics. After I figured out the the ROM situations for a number of arcade games (for use with bizhawk), I finally decided to give this a try. I actually was surprised how easy it was TASing this game. In fact, most of this game was a simple exercise in RNG manipulation and applying my 8 years of TAS experience. The only trouble was figuring out a route around one set of mines...which I eventually gave up and slowed down. This slowness was the only one that occurs in the entire run.

	"Moon Patrol has two courses...the regular course and the "Champion Stage". I don't know why the game has "Champion Stage 2", since it is a repeat of "Champion Stage 1". If there is any question about this, I can take the inputs and re-sync to get that extra course....as the only difference is RNG.
