	"Some comments (aka. "novel" :P) from the author
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The movie is 301,102 frames (83:38 minutes) long, however the last minute was used to trigger a little easteregg. The last hit on Bowser takes place after 297,736 frames (82:42 minutes), so this is the actual time of completion.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"As the movie is so long, and even watching it in turbo mode still takes some time, I created a few savegames throughout the movie, which you can load if you watch the movie with "Open Read-Only" actived. These can be downloaded here: http://www.viper7.com/smw/savegames.zip
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Yes, the rerecord count (66,666) IS faked. I didn't create the movie in one big 
	[tt 
		".smv
	]tt
	" file, but splitted it into several small movies instead, because I found that more comfortable to work with. Now the problem is that it's quite hard to calculate the exact amount of rerecords used; I estimate it to be somewhere between 60k and 70k. So I just hex-edited a nice number into the final movie file; personally I don't really think that this value is so important anyway.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The fastest way for Mario to move is flying with the cape. To achieve the fastest result, you must release the FORWARD button in the exact right frame; releasing it 1 frame earlier or later might end up in a loss of 2 seconds by the end of the level (although it's hardly noticable when watching at full speed). The only problem with this "normal flying" is that Mario loses his speed as soon as he hits the ground, and then has to regain running speed first. So, in some cases it was better to use so called "spinjump-flying", that means lifting off by pressing the A button instead of B. Spinjump-flying is slower than normal flying (it's the same speed as simply running on the ground), but therefore it conserves the running speed when Mario hits the ground (so Mario can directly lift off to another flight).
	$LF
	"Of course one could argue that flying all the time is boring, but well, speed has first priority (except in a very few cases!). And I tried to make the flying as entertaining as possible by bumping on as many enemies as I could (without slowing down). If you noticed that I seemingly missed an enemy, you can be sure that it was done for a reason (bumping off the enemy would have got me into a bad position).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If you watch the movie at a very slow speed, you might notice that I sometimes enter levels with a little bit of delay (1-3 frames). The reason for this is not inaccuracy, it was intended. Sometimes I had to redo older levels to improve certain passages, but of course I didn't want to play all subsequent levels again. So I hex-edited the improved level into the old movie. But this sometimes caused so called "desynchs", that means that the enemies were in different positions or acted differently, and therefore the movie would screw up. However, most of these desynchs could be fixed quite easily by entering the level 1 or 2 or 3 frames later, then the enemies would be in the right spot again. So, these delays are a combination of lazyness and luck manipulation. Overall I estimate the accumulated delay to ~ 2 seconds.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I'm quite sure that the worldmap route I chose is the fastest in regards to time spent on the worldmap. I figured out one route which would have required 2 less worldmap movements, but it was still longer in realtime due to some very long movements (for example Soda Lake -> Star World). Sometimes I could chose when to do a level; in that case I tried to avoid repeating the same level (normal and secret exit) and play a few levels inbetween (for example Donut Ghost House or Forest Of Illusions 2).
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"However the route could still have been improved a little bit: Yoshi's Island 1 and the Yellow Switch Palace could have been done after completing the Special World; then I could have played them with cape, which would have been a little bit faster. And in Donut Plains I should have taken the middle route first and then do the left route (including the Green Switch Palace) after completing the Special World. This would have avoided the slowdown caused by the
	$LF
	"green !-blocks in a few levels (for example Donut Plains 1 B
	$LF
	"or Castle #3). If you wonder why I didn't just hex-edit the world route: This would have changed a whole lot of variables in the game, and simply entering the levels 1 with or 2 frames delay wouldn't have really helped in this case, I'd have to play all the levels again. And all in all these world route changes only would have improved the total time by ~ 3-4 seconds, so it's not that serious (maybe a motivation for someone to make a new run of this? :) ).

	"Super Mario World is really a very special game for me, I think it actually was one of the first video games that I played. The only other game that I spent so much time with was Mario 64, and I think a 120 stars run of this game would surely be interesting. So maybe you'll see another movie from me once there is an N64 emulator with rerecord function :)
