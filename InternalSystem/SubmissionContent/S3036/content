	"This run improves the current published run by 49.60 seconds or 2976 frames. The improvement comes from small optimizations, better boss fights and route changes. A small amount of time was also saved on the menus, pressing start sooner. The "slide off of a ledge" trick was improved with the "let go directions" trick: when falling off of a ledge during a slide, you can maintain the sliding speed a little longer if you don't hold any directions.
