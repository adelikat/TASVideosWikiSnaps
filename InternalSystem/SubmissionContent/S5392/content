	"This TAS was initially started in late 2011, even before my Metal Slug 7 TAS was started and when FBA-rr 005a was the most recent version. The frustrating nature of the emulator and demotivating sections in the run made me put this on hold numerous times. The first 4 missions were completed over a span of 2 years, from 2011 to 2013, before I decided to TAS Metal Slug 7 instead. After my Metal Slug 7 run was finished in 2014, I worked on mission 5, getting all the way to the first Rootmars battle. At that point, I lost motivation and the run was put on hold for 2 years. It wasn't until HappyLee brought it up in forums and encoded my WIP when I was inspired again to finish the run.

The strategy at the end is simple, use F for the mosquitoes that fly in and bombs for the plants that walk in from the side.

Changing the time of when I killed the previous clones didn't affect when the next ones spawned. So I decided to use a single cannon and 2 bombs to destroy the top bubble and then just crashed the slug noid at the earliest frame possible to destroy the bottom two bubbles. For the final hoop shooting bots, F is really not suited to fighting them, but I don't think using only bombs is correct. Using the rebel slug cannons for the first two bots ended up only being about 10 frames slower, but saved me 10 bombs so I decided to use it.

	"The cannon smoke does 50 damage to Rootmars and only costed a few frames (2 for Tarma, 5 for Fio), so I decided to use them once before exiting out of the metal slugs. There is a spot around Rootmars' nose where I can easily switch between using a weapon and using knife. Even though the knife speed is slower, this was still faster than using just knife (although it created a lot of lag frames). There is also a safe spot by the left stitch where I can stand and avoid getting hit by the ring. I manipulate 2 F's and 2 G's from the 4 red balls that are shot during the fight. I had Tarma get the first F right away for just 15 additional bullets because I found that he'll run out of F around the time the 3rd red ball is available, so I can either initiate the faster F or start using G. The 2nd F is used to initiate the faster F trick for Fio, which does a lot of damage to Rootmars over a small period of time. For the last two red balls, I decided to use G because Rootmars doesn't have much HP remaining by then and G is faster at dealing damage over a short period of time (and it also creates less lag). At the end, Tarma stopping a little early didn't waste any time. At the time Tarma stopped, Rootmars had 292 HP remaining, so I would've had to fire 2 shots of G regardless of what Tarma did. So I had Tarma wait a little bit to set up a nice ending shot (see suggested screenshot below).

	"Despite the large improvement over x2poet's run, this run is still far from perfect. Many of the tricks were discovered when I was far into the run and couldn't be implemented in the earlier parts of the run. A good amount of frames can be saved with less lag, but that might just require a better emulator. Some specific things/ideas:
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		"The faster H and faster Vulcan tricks can used to save time in earlier missions (mission 1, 3, and 4).
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"I noticed that the last cannon shot from the Slug Noid against Huge Hermit (mission 1 boss) wasn't optimized well. Unfortunately, I didn't notice it until way later in the run. I think 20~30 frames could be saved there.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"In mission 3, there's most likely a better strategy such that Marco doesn't have to wait for bombs from the last tank right before the boss. It might be better to give one of the earlier bombs to Marco instead of Fio so that Marco can go the right earlier which would save some frames. Maybe Fio should pick up the bullets earlier in the mission and be the one to use H and Marco should be the one to use big L.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"In the first part of mission 4, I used bombs to destroy some enemies after the 2nd truck so that Marco and Fio could continue jumping uninterrupted. It might be better to save those bombs for the next part and walk a few frames and jump over those enemies.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"In the second part of mission 4, I initially took the C in mission 4 because I thought I had to save more F shots for the boss and it was useful for killing enemies quickly. Turns out that L-trick was a lot more useful than I initially predicted and I only needed 31 shots. Thanks to the L-trick, I think it might be better to skip the C and use more F + H + bombs to kill the enemies. It might also be worth trying take R to this part, which might be better than using H. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"At the beginning of mission 5, it might be better to throw the slugs earlier to destroy the last pair of planes faster and use pistol + bombs to destroy the first helicopter in the next part. The helicopter will drop bombs when you engage it without any slugs. When I tried testing using pistol + bombs on the helicopter much later, I came out 5 bombs ahead of this run after destroying the helicopter. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"In the same part of mission 5, after destroying the first helicopter, it might be faster to destroy the two trucks afterward to initiate the next phase faster. I always thought the next phase started at the same time regardless of whether the trucks were destroyed or not. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"I just recently learned that the first 3 hoop shooting bots after Rootmars1 (before the ones that drop the big S) can also be potentially be skipped by screen scrolling to the left at the right time. If all 3 of them can be skipped, this would save a lot of bombs and time.   
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"I had 12 bombs left going into Rootmars2, but I think those bombs are better used in some of the earlier sections. I didn't use any bombs in the earlier sections because I had no idea how the rest of the run would turn out.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Some of the boss battles (Sol Dae Rokker (mission 4 boss), Morden, UFO's, and Rootmars2) can probably be improved with better luck manipulation.
