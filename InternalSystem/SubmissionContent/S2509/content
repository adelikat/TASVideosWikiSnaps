[div class=p 
	"The reason to why this run is only 15 seconds slower compared to the old warpless run is because it is played on Hard, which requires me to start with SRAM. There are some fundamental differences between Hard and Normal: Soma has less ATT/DEF on Hard, you can skip cutscenes on hard (actually this is not entirely true - you just need to have finished the game once to be able to skip cutscenes) and there are 4 pretty cool items lying around in different places in the castle which are only available in hard mode (although none were actually picked up in this run). It seems hard has always been favored for the all-soul runs, since it counterweights the fact that Soma does become quite powerful towards the end. And the removed cutscenes adds alot of momentum to the run.

Enemy actions in turn garble up the loot tables, so when bruteforcing a soul it is important to always have it act the same. There are a ton of ways to manipulate RNG, but the most common ones used in this run are: Swinging, backdashing (including small changes in backdash pattern), using the Kicker Skeleton soul, wobbling with the Black Panther and using Guardian souls.

	"The second phase was pretty tricky, due to all the million different ways to approach Chaos. I chose the Red Minotaur approach since it hits all the targets for massive damage. I tried hitting the lower targets twice, but never managed to do so. I believe this is because they are so close to the ground.

[div class=p 
	"The first one being the textbook route, there are no sequence breaks whatsoever. Pretty straightforward, but still very good. The pros are early Claimh Solais (especially vs Legion) and overall being higher level for Balore, Legion and Graham. The con is the detour for Flesh Golem. There is no way to make it up there without Hippogryph.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The second one, the one used in this run, is a little more refreshing. It uses the double jump sequence break for early Death, to get Skula to gain access to Underground Reservoir. The pros for this run are much earlier clean-up (more fastpaced steamrollage), while the cons are being weaker for Legion, Balore and Graham.

	"Once you have collected all the souls, an item called Chaos Ring appears in the room adjacent to the room with the first Alastor. Chaos Ring gives unlimited mana (which is not entirely true - it actually only gives incredibly high mana regeneration, thus it will not allow using souls such as Red Minotaur under level 15). I did not get this, since it's so late in the game. The only 'big' difference would be Chaos' 2nd phase, I deemed it not worth it. My apologies to anyone who disagrees with me.
