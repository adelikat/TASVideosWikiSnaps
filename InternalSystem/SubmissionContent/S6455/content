	"Mega Man of Game Gear is a remix between Mega Man 4 and Mega Man 5 of NES, the game has a lot of stuff from the games mentioned. This game contains only 8 stages, 4 Robot Masters, 2 Cossack Castles and 2 Wily Castles. The goal of this TAS is to go as fast as possible using glitches and tricks all over the run.

	"You can shoot between every slide since there is one frame that Mega Man is standing between the slides, so you can shoot without losing time or frames. If you are equipped with Rush Coil you can shoot while you are sliding, this is useful to kill enemies in your way like in Stoneman Stage or Napalmman Stage.

	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"You can do a Double Hit to every Robot Master with the Buster and the Power Stone, the two shots needs to be in the same position or hitting in the same frame, i did Double Hits to Stoneman (since you have no other weapon than the Buster) and to Starman taking damage to position myself where he is and making possible the two hits. I also do a Double Hit to Wily Capsule since there is one cycle where you cannot hit him without help of Rush Coil.

[div class=p 
	"The zips are done by jumping off of Rush Coil 3 frames from the ceiling while holding left or right and you will land on Rush Coil and he will proceed to push you up into the ceiling, you can zip really fast to the left but in most that doesn't save any time (except in Napalm and Stoneman Stages) since you want to zip up.

I didn't find any manip to have a perfect Wily Capsule fight, by my luck, i had only 1 bad cycle, but in that cycle i shoot Wily Capsule with Rush Coil to don't lose a cycle.

In the final part of the Motorwave before the transition i did a full jump to keep Motorwave's speed in the air and move along the room faster. I shoot Double Hits to kill Waveman faster.

	"There were concerns in regards to this TAS using Normal Mode instead of Hard. The author cited that they felt there wasn't enough of a difference between difficulties so they chose the fastest. In general we prefer the most interesting rather than the fastest, even if there is not that much of a difference. It seems that Hard Mode for this game increases the amount of enemies which we see as good, increases miniboss health which can be good or bad depending on if strategies differ, and increases damage taken which is likely to be good but can be bad if damage boosts are interesting to the run.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"However, this run does seem solid enough to accept for a first publication, so I am accepting to Moons. However this run could very well be considered obsoleted by a Hard Mode submission provided it is more interesting.
