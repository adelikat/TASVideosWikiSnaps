	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This run cancels missions, with means it uses "warps" to get to the final stages since the beginning, this is the route used:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-Intro Stage (Golem)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-Disposal Center (Aztec Falcon)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-Find Shuttle (Escaped)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-Duel in Desert (Escaped)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-Defend the Base 2 (Hanumachine)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-Neo Arcadia Shrine (Herculious Anchortus)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-Neo Arcadia Tower (Rainbow Devil)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-Neo Arcadia Core (Copy-X)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Note: To do the "Warp" you must escape the Find Shuttle mission, wich then unlocks Dual in Desert mision, if you escape in said mission the base will get attacked, thus unlocking the Defend the Base 2 mission without any choice.

	$LF

[p 
	"Since this run is done using "Warps", the only weapons being used are the Z-Buster and the Z-Saber.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The Z-Saber was leveled up to get the Triple Slash and the Air Rolling Slash, the latter is a must in this run, because how quick it can do some bosses, to get such technique Zero needs 100 Air slash Experience.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Improvements
	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There is one improvement here, and it's about a new trick that allows Zero to get Saber Experience REAL quick. This is a programming error.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When Ciel is attacked by the Golem and Zero get his Z-Saber, if you shoot her and keep your saber inside her without slashing the golem, you get one experience point per each frame that the saber is in her without any delay compared to when you slash enemies.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"What i did was just to calculate how many slashes i would get in the other stages (i only got experience only for mandatory enemies) and then get the remmaining experience using the glitch.
