	"Kanji Sonomama Rakubiki Jiten DS is a Kanji-English-Japanese dictionary based training software developed for the Nintendo DS and released on April 13, 2006. This movie inputs "ball" on the dictionary, clicks an entry that's weirdly capitalized, and then makes a number display reach 9990 before overflowing and making it seem like nothing ever happened.
