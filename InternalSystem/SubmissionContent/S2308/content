	"I finally finished one of the most complex submission I ever worked on. I started this on 28/12/2008 but I stopped 2 months later, trying to cool out after my poor performance in the last submission, trying to IMPROVE, searching videos to influence it. I started doing the TAS again in 16/03/2009, with great expectations, working on it until 29/06/09, and now it's finished =)
