	"Raiden Fighters is an arcade shmup/STG released in 1996 by Seibu Kaihatsu, taking a spin on the very popular Raiden series from the early 90's, Raiden Fighters is a more bullet heavy game and focuses more on extreme precision in its' scoring systems rather than memorizing where one specific tank spawns so it doesnt insta-snipe you frame 1.

	"Raiden Fighters takes place within 7 increasingly difficult stages full of secrets and scoring opportunities. On stages 3, 6, and 7 is what the game calls "Missions" which follow a slightly different scrolling approach to the rest of the game. There are also plenty of ships to choose from in RF, a total of 7 unique ships are available to select, as well as the "Slave" being the 8th ship. The slave is normally a power-up you collect, it follows you around and blocks bullets. Picking the slave as your main ship gives the player a very small hitbox and a rather large "graze-box" which will be covered later. For this TAS I am using Slave, specifically the Judge Spear variant as it is the fastest ship in the entire game.

	"Oh baby now we got the good stuff. Raiden Fighters is a pretty unique game for 1996, almost all of it's scoring techniques are secrets that you need to dig through the stages to find and optimally route. Enemy kill values are rather low for this reason, a lot of your score will come from knowing every secret and executing them perfectly, let's start with:

	"Medals. The primo scoring method most players will encounter when playing this game. At first, silver little medals will spawn; ranging values from 10-90 points. When you collect a slave powerup, they spawn as blue medals, ranging 100 to 900 and when you have 2 slaves, the value ranges from 1,000 to 9,000 points.

[div class=p

In this state, gold medal value will chain from 10,000 points to a whopping 100,000 points. If one medal escapes the screen, the value will then reset to 10,000 points. This is a very big chunk of this movies score so please enjoy the shiny things.

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Now how does graze score work? Well, in a game with lightning fast bullets and a very fast player character, Seibu decided to do some trolling. When you are in the grazing state, you are awarded score per frame, starting at 10 points and increasing by 10 every frame, maxing out at 1,110 points per frame. If you stop grazing for a few frames at 500 points, then start grazing the next frame, your value will be 510. It does not bleed over time that you're not grazing, with one exception:
	$LF
]div
[div class=p

	"This creates some very interesting routes where I skip out on grazing for 15 frames to dash across the screen to tag a single bullet to reset that timer so I can keep grazing at 1,110 points. It's all about the long term score gain rather than the short term!
