	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"Action Man: Search for Base X is a game based on the Action Man license, developed by Natsume and published by THQ on 2001. The game’s plot involves Alex Mann, alias “Action Man”, having to search for Dr. X’s base, and then, of course, beat the crap out of Dr. X. However, just to get to Dr. X’s base, Action Man needs to fight his way through various locales to discover useful items, uncover clues and pass through dozens upon dozens of Dr. X-brand robots which are all out to destroy Action Man.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Initially, the game works somewhat similarly to Mega Man, in that there are multiple stages to choose from, they can be done in any order, and after going through each stage, you finish your mission and you get an item. These items are in turn required to uncover new paths and areas in the stages and finish more missions and get more items, etc. etc. The game starts with 4 stages available, which hold 10 missions total. After finishing these 10 missions, Action Man will discover and go through Dr. X’s hidden base...s in a more linear way (similar to the Dr. Wily in the Mega Man series, again). There are three “Base”s in the game. Which one of them is supposed to be “Base X”, I don’t know.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"As for the gameplay, for each mission, Action Man gets to bring two items, a suit and 6 hit points. Besides that, he has the ability to walk, jump, crouch and crawl. One of the more interesting facts in this game is that when Action Man gets hit, there’s no knockback animation at all - if it weren’t for the fact that Action Man’s hit points are very limited - the game has no pickups of any kind, so there’s only 6 per stage (excluding death/checkpoints). This turns every stage into a puzzle of finding out what the largest damage/time savers are in each stage, and utilizing damage to its fullest potential each mission, so every mission ends with 1 HP.

[h4 
	" Some notes:
	$LF
]h4
[ul 
	[li 
		" This game’s Hard difficulty mode is absolutely ridiculous, with loads upon loads of deadly enemies everywhere. It’s like Mega Man cross Bullet Hell. Some of the later stages I’ve found practically impossible to beat without health cheats or tool-assistance.
		$LF
	]li

		" This game has really good music. Unfortunately, the TAS goes through the game far too fast to do the game’s soundtrack justice. It’s a shame that the background music restarts each time the player progresses a section in the stage. The full soundtrack can be listened to

[ul 
	[li 
		" This game has no lag, no luck (other than the boss battles near the end of the game) and no subpixels. However, some enemies do have frame-rule timing, so hexing does not always work seamlessly.

	" Tricks
	$LF
]h2
[h4 
	" Enemy hitboxes
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Most enemies don’t have hitboxes; only their projectiles do. (The rolling enemies are one exception). Despite that, it’s generally still not safe to be inside an enemy, since most of them will just fire projectiles which instantly hit Action Man anyway. But this fact is used a lot to pass through enemies mostly unharmed.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Robot line-of-sight abuse
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The large robot enemies will only fire shots if your hitbox is at equal level with their head. This means that if you crawl towards them, they won’t fire, but will instead only walk backwards. Sometimes, crouching for just one frame can make them momentarily stop firing.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Shot interrupt
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Most enemies which don’t die in one shot will stop firing for a short while if they’re being hit. This is quite helpful if I need to get past one quickly without losing time crawling instead. If you see me shoot an enemy without killing it, it’s for this reason.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The bosses have another version of this trick: if they take damage on the exact frame they’re firing a projectile, their projectile will not appear. This is very useful on both boss battles in the game, as it leaves much less projectiles for Action Man to deal with.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Disarming Device skip
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Normally, the Disarming Device is required to clear Mountain Mission B. However, with some careful jumping, it’s possible to avoid having to use the Disarming Device there. This is useful, because not requiring the Disarming Device opens up an item slot, allowing Action Man to bring the EMP Gun along and making the mission significantly easier.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Ladder boost
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"If there is a ladder below Action Man, pressing down will move Action Man to its position if he is close enough. If Action Man immediately jumps off in order to continue moving, it saves a few frames over just walking over.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Ladder zip
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"When on a ladder, repeatedly pressing A to jump off the ladder while holding up to regrab the ladder will cause Action Man to zip up the ladder quickly, allowing for very fast climbing. Strangely, there are a few stairs in the Mountain area that do not allow Action Man to jump off when he's near the top of the ladder, which is why some of the ladders are climbed normally for a short time.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" General physics notes
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Action Man moves at 1 pixel/frame horizontally when walking or jumping and holding a direction. Crawling happens at 0.5 pixels/frame. When Action Man is falling, he falls at a rate of 1 pixel/frame vertically. When jumping, for the first part Action Man will gain height by 1 pixel/frame, then by 0.5 pixels/frame.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Every state change for Action Man stops horizontal movement for 1 frame, e.g. walking>jumping, jump rising/falling, landing/walking, or jumping/firing the gun. Because of this, for example, a jump costs 3 frames, and a jump with one shot fired costs 5 frames. Because of this, jumping and shooting (even in the air) need to be minimized for optimal movement.

	" EMP Gun
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Action Man’s dinky laser pistol he starts out with. It makes Mega Man’s pea shooter look amazing by comparison, and yet it’s still by far the most useful weapon in this game. Action Man can fire this while crouching, standing, or jumping in the air, and can also be fired diagonally up while standing. The ability to shoot it while in the air makes it very useful, as it’s one of the few ways to shoot while not losing time standing still.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This is one of Action Man’s starting items.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Long Bow
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This is the most useless weapon in the game, although it’s required for two missions which also require Action Man to not bring his pistol. Doesn’t do any more damage than the EMP Gun, fires much slower, and can only be fired while standing. Required to hit a target for Jungle Mission B and Jungle Mission C.

	"This is also one of Action Man’s starting items.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Sonic Explosion
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The second best weapon in the game, although that doesn’t say much. Does twice as much damage as the other weapons, but can only be thrown while standing still, and is slower than the EMP Gun. It can be thrown with two possible arcs, arcing mostly forward or arcing mostly upward. Sometimes useful for the damage output.

		" The first phase of the final boss is a rather typical "core-and-turrets"-boss, with two turrets descending from the sky, which respawn if killed, and Dr. X in a corner controlling the turrets and serving as the "core". I shoot him as early as possible, which means from as far away as possible, to the point he's not even on screen when I fight him. I deal with one of the turrets by destroying it with a Sonic Explosion, and whaling on Dr. X while it spends time respawning. The other turret doesn't even spawn because I'm so far to the left. Dr. X has only 5 HP, so the battle is over quite quickly.
		$LF

	[li 
		" The second phase of the final boss, Dr. X in his airship, has 32 health, with gunshots again doing just one point. This makes this battle significantly longer than the other boss battles, although it's still not that long. I occasionally use pauses to change Dr. X's attacks, and use the shot interrupt trick to cancel out many of his attacks, preventing me from having to take too much damage or having to dodge.
