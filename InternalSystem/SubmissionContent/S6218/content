				"Ladder Boost - Only when traveling from left to right, climbing a ladder for 1 frame then immediately returning to the ground positions Mario further to the right on-screen than he would have progressed simply running past the ladder.  This works with both ascending and descending for the first frame (broken ladders cannot be descended).  This trick is used in both girder stage and rivet stages.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				"Spring pseudo-clip - While jumping normally loses a pixel of horizontal distance compared to running the same number of frames...On the top of the elevator stage, it is possible to jump toward an oncoming spring so that Mario can progress past the spring without being hit even though the spring would hit him if he were just running.  This is not jumping over the spring (which I couldn't accomplish anyway), it's jumping through it.  This trick is not used in this submission.

				$LF

				"If however, unique content is based on the technicality of sub-stage memory identifier; the only way to truly have no further unique content is to complete Level 5.
