	"My interest in this game began with seeing PJ do speedruns on this game. I was impressed by his efforts to make a well optimized run of this unforgiving game and decided to look into some pain points in the run.
	$LF
	"By that time, I had become somewhat acquainted with the game mechanics and knew the newer strats employed in the first stages. Beyond that I didn't really have a plan, but nevertheless I set out to make a new TAS.

	[a href=/3617S

		" A double jump can be started at any time during a standing jump. If left or right isn't held during the first frame of a jump, one can initiate a double jump at any given frame during a jump. Otherwise one has to wait until about the top of the jump.

Watching the two side-by-side, it was evident how the minor route improvements, lag reduction, and quicker boss strategies contributed to the incremental time savings gained.  This made for an entertaining watch, overall.  Congrats on your first TAS!
