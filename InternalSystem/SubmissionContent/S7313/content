	"Cross Wiber is the sequel to Busou Keiji Cyber Cross (a game I've spedrun). A sidescrolling platformer inspired by tokusatsu shows like Super Sentai (aka Power Rangers), you go through a series of levels, defeating bosses to reach the last chapter and defeat the final boss, Doma.

	"This game is incredibly unforgiving as a real-time speedrun, due to enemies that are impossible to dodge and poorly programmed platforms, and is what inspired me to make a TAS for it instead. I'm interested to see if a damageless run of this game would ever be possible, RTA or TAS.

	"My main goal going into this TAS was to complete the game as fast as possible. My secondary goals were 1) to never transform, as it wastes around 7 seconds and doesn't pay it back in power, 2) to always damage boost forward and never back, and 3) to break every item pack that didn't require me to backtrack to get it, as playing this game casually, there are many item packs that lure you in only to throw an enemy in your face. The goal would have been "to pick up every item", but some are completely out of reach. This was an almost necessary goal going into the later half of the run, as my health reaches dangerously low levels a couple times.

	"As a speedrun, this game is all about damage boosts. Enemies and their attacks can either knock you back or forward a short distance, depending both on your position and even sometimes your pose, such as if you're in the middle of an attack animation. You can even get boosted forward for a few frames then sucked back a few frames into your original position! Very strange.

	"Unlike this game's predecessor Cyber Cross, your base form in Cross Wiber comes with a useful and powerful attack; the spin kick. Not only can it do 5 hits in all, it also gives you complete invulnerability during the entire animation, whereas trying to get 5 hits in with a punch or kick will usually result in getting hit once or twice, slowing you down. However if you're in the position to do so without taking damage, punches especially may be faster than the kick or spin kick. And the jump kick is useful for getting through levels when enemies are coming at you without slowing down. So we get to see a fairly even mix of all the attacks in this run. Well, minus the transformation ones anyway.

	"This is a simple introductory level, of course. However the only useful glitch I've discovered in this game was in this level, but it unfortunately isn't in this TAS. Last year when I first tried out this game. I was somehow able to reach the boss at the end of this level in such a way that the boss failed to spawn and it immediately cued the fanfare and moved onto chapter 2, saving about 9 seconds. I stupidly did not record this at the time or write down how to recreate it. Despite hours of trying during the making of this TAS (as I assumed it was a simple matter of sprite overload), I was never able to make it happen again. If anyone ever recreates this glitch, please let me know! I'd love to hear how it's done.

My theory is that there's a set number of waves of enemies that must pass for the boss to spawn, and the only wave that matters for a time save is the final one. But that's just my best guess. I try to defeat all of the enemies quickly in these stages regardless.

In the room just before the boss, you'll see me cross some other moving platforms, and it looks like you can make them in the first cycle, right? Well you can't. It's not possible.

	": This might be one of the most damage-boosty TASes I've ever seen. It's honestly rare to see a run of a game that's so liberal with its health pickups and so forgiving with its contact damage that a TASer can literally just spend the entire game damage boosting... And to be honest, I kinda like it. I like it a lot, in fact. Damage lends itself extremely well to speedruns of this game, it seems, both in significantly speeding up the walkin' portions and allowing for fast and aggressive boss fights using invulnerability frames, and you definitely used it well throughout the run. Also, there was just so much charm in those little post-fight victory dances c: Great job making them all varied, and even finding ways to do it in the vehicle sections!
