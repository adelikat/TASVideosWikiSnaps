	"Another movie from 2004 is about to bite the dust, unless this one gets rejected of course. When I started this run, my main goal was just to reduce lag, but soon I found out that I have to rethink my strategy as it is not always possible and sometimes when it is, it wastes time instead of saving.

	" Bomb Boost
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Bomberman can lay bombs at his feet and then walk over them, but after a certain point the bomb will eject him if he turns around, it's used to give him a small boost before he collects enough speed powerups.

	" Push-Block Bouncing
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Not really a new trick as nitsuja already used it, but it was improved a little bit and now Bomberman can wrap-around the stage like a bomb, just find a place where there's no empty spaces and start bouncing.

[h4 
	" Bounce Over Pits
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Found and only used on stage 5-6, it's basically the push-block bouncing from nitsuja's run, but using the rotten floor to start. Unlike his trick, it's not possible to choose the direction.

	" Stage by Stage
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"There's 35 stages on this game, and explaining what I did in each one of them would take longer than it took to create the run, but I'll try to sum up what I did; It's possible to manipulate enemy movements, item placement and even which items will appear on the next stage by delaying the frame you enter the door on the current stage, it's also possible to manipulate enemy movements inside the stage but only the ones close to Bomberman. Most of nitsuja's strategies were used but on different places to take advantage of enemies or switches off screen. Same strategies on bosses too, but with an extra care on the lag counter to make them faster. The last hit was delivered sooner with the bomb wrap-around trick. Well, thats about it, I hope you enjoy.
