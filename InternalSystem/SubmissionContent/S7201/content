	"Boomer's Adventure in Asmik World is a puzzle game for the Gameboy where the main mechanic is digging. You can dig to find various power ups, trap enemies, and also to find the key in each level needed to proceed. The various enemies in the game can also dig and can take items (including the key.) There are 33 levels, including several bosses. Once you beat all the levels going up, you must beat them again in reverse order going down (except now you start at the exit.) The game is pretty slow paced, and if you don't already know the key location, it can be pretty difficult to find without the radar item.

	"Optimization in this game is complicated by RNG which makes the levels not independent. Generally speaking the goal is to manipulate enemies out of your path to the key to avoid digging, which is very slow and costs several seconds (unless you have the shovel.) Therefore you might play a previous level slower, or even just wait at the exit, in order to avoid digging in a later level. Sometimes you can even get an enemy to dig up the key for you and bring it to a more favorable location or kill them with an attack item to avoid digging altogether. Bosses have no RNG though.

	"The current run is about 35 seconds of gameplay improvement over MattyXB's original. RNG in the first 20 or so levels was pretty good, and while some improvements are possible, I always ended worse off eventually, so those levels are unchanged. After this point many levels have large improvements, while a few are slightly slower to facilitate good RNG.

	"I'm pretty happy with how this turned out, and a few times RNG even worked in my favor. Probably it is possible to still do slightly better, but since everything has to be redone forward of the point you start changing things, and the game is so tediously slow, it's not really that interesting to try.
