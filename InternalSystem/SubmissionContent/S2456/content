	"The reason I choose the DS version is because it has skipable cutscenes and room transisions and green slime instead of blood so more people who maybe don't can stand blood can stand this. The graphics isn't not as good as the Plasytation version but that's acaptable since it's much so faster to beat.

	"This run is pretty optimised. I think the plant and tyrant boss can be beaten faster. Maybe on plant you can kill it in one go without moveing but then you need lots of lucks and tyrant faster but he was a pain in my butt and drived me crayz and then I got sick

	"I like to puint out that I made one mistake. On plant I missed a knife swing swing I always play without sund and didn't notice I miss untill too late for redoing. There is one miss knife swing on tyrant but it was intetional because if I didn't swing he would hit me and I would loose time
