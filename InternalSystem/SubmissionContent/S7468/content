	"The fastest strategy in RTA is repeatedly kicking the enemies in the face. However, it's only done because RTA players don't have control over the RNG. This game, unlike MK3, has a very static RNG which is not easily manipulatable, so you just kinda accept the RNG for the fight mostly. New actions can cause new rng, but just waiting will not change the result. This is really bad for TAS. If you can cause a new action, all the rest of the RNG for the fight will change. Sometimes i delay to get a new action.

	"Combos usually slow the matches down because the hits that come after have lesser damage per hit, but I figured a few that make the match go faster. Combine that with RNG I can't control and you get a lot more variety in this TAS. Doing IAJK (instant air jump kick) 2 HKs is a universal combo which is significantly faster than just doing HKs.Good luck trying to make the enemies eat your combos though.. I sometimes use a weapon at the end of this combo for big damage, but only if I can avoid triggering Max Damage..

	"Each character in this game has a set of Weapons, I noticed Scorpion Sword, Shinnok Lance and Liu Kang Sword are the most relevant ones for their damage and combo potential. Taking the weapon from your pocket inside a combo already makes it hit the enemy with a very fast animation, instead of the slow startup the weapons have by themslves when being taken from their character's pocket. You could use other weapons by selecting the 3rd and 4th outfit for the characters, but i didn't find anything interesting with that. ( johhny cage has a pistol with the suit, looks really good!)

He doesn't get the Fatalities though, but we don't care about that. We use the fight styles to get other weapons, like scorpion and liu kang, and to cancel normal moves into the style switch to recover faster from your own moves.

	": I usually think it is a bit cheap to decrease the number of rounds in fighting games, but in this case I think it works out. Since the life bar carries over between fights, it actually makes the game harder, and as mentioned in the submission, it means you can go at full speed and still avoid Flawless Victory messages every stage. I will accept this to the standard category, i.e. not replacing the current playaround movie.
