	"I've already made a glitchless TAS which simply forgoes the corner skip and thought such a simple restriction probably wasn't interesting enough to submit to TASVideos. That's how I came up with this idea to also collect no tools (low%) to amp up the challenge! To the uninitiated viewer, this just looks like more of what's already been seen in the

We can use this fact to squeeze twice as many inputs into certain places, which was used extensively in the run. Two spaces can now be moved at once on the overworld map, and picking up items and shooting or counting arrows can both be done while running.

	[em

	" glitches, as I opt to enter the third mountain in an uninitialized state. By inputting a map movement on controllers 1 and 2 at the same time, we can enter a black mountain before the game is even able to process the mountain's true identity. Inside, a black mountain is identical to a purple mountain. This was done because the RNG entering the uninitialized black mountain was simply better than had I entered it in its true blue mountain state.
