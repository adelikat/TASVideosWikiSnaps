	"I have to say, I absolutely love and agree with the sentiment of showcasing that TASing isn't as hard as it appears to be! Tetris is a great game to illustrate that point, too, containing easy-to-grasp manipulation with very obvious results. As pointed out in the 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=submission thread|href=/Forum/Posts/510387)
	", this manipulation has been used for incredible results across every NES Tetris run, particularly our 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=currently published playaround|href=/1502M)
	". The only issue here is that this run is competing with that playaround. I know that wasn't your intention, but since this run was submitted for consideration to be published, it unfortunately has to compete anyway. Obviously, this issue is on us and not on you, and I apologize for the site currently operating in that way, but I'm very happy to say that we've been doing a lot of work to correct that as of late.

	"In the short term, I feel that we could benefit from more upfront promotion of the 
	[a class=intlink href=/Forum

	" and 
	[a class=intlink href=/Userfiles 
		"userfiles

	" as ways of sharing and showcasing TASes. Over my 15 years of having been around this site, I've noticed that we really don't seem to retain newcomers all that well. The submission process is definitely the central feature of TASvideos, and naturally the most active, so it makes sense that newcomers are immediately drawn to it. They'll often come in and submit their very first TAS effort, it'll be scrutinized and judged far more strictly than they're expecting, and it drives them away from the site, possibly furthering us having a negative, elitist reputation. The actual

	(__wikiLink|displaytext=updating and changing our submission guidelines|href=/Forum/Topics/22917)
	", with the goals of widening our content base by removing our often arbitrary restrictions and simplifying the submission process, especially for Judges like myself and newcomers like yourself. We're also less than three weeks away (at the time of writing) from transitioning over to the new site, where a lot of these potential changes are going to be a lot easier to implement!

	"All of my usual waxing poetic about the site aside, I have a few suggestions for how to improve this sort of showcase:
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"1. Definitely study our other published runs, particularly their inputs: There are other, faster ways to manipulate pieces!
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"2. The published playaround creates a unique and difficult pattern. See if you can make something more impressive than that.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"3. A proper playaround would ideally show off a lot of things, more than just what you did or even what the published run did. Maybe combine the two concepts and add a bit of extra time - Something around 4-5 minutes could work, assuming there's great variety in it.
