	"New Mario Bros. is a hack of the original Super Mario Bros. It introduces 20 new levels (5 new worlds) that weren't there in 1985. Along the way, there are new aesthetic features that remind you of later Mario franchise, and some brand new, enemies. I aim to complete these 5 worlds as fast as possible with as much entertainment as I deem necessary. In most of these levels you will see me attempt 100% killing of the enemies.

I will be doing this many times in this TAS, to save repeating myself I will refer to this as "going above the level". I slow down mid-air when falling back down onto the ground to avoid hitting 343 on the timer (which gives 3 fireworks and loses time).

I clip through another wall to avoid another slow area, but when I exit, I perform a walljump instead of slowing down and hitting the ground below, the reason this wasn't used in 1-4 is because you aren't able to reach the closest wall. Then another walljump is performed instead of slowly jumping upwards. I go through the slow area because there is no other way to get through, however I perform a corner clip while accelerating, which saves 1-2 frames (I'm not completely sure about that one).

Because I am already at 11 X-speed when I touch the ground, I just hold L+R and I accelerate to 22 X-speed just as fast as backward jumping but I have the benefit of staying on the ground, giving me the ability to do a backward jump and accelerate to 40 X-speed. I then clip above the wall using a duck clip (wall clip while duck-jumping, which has actually been used many times before in this TAS) to avoid another slow area.
