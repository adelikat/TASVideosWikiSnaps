Since I figured out that this was a very old rule and it didn't seem to completely make sense to me, I brought it up to the rest of the judge team and we agreed that we want to give more freedom of choice for freerun goals. For this reason, we now have changed the relative

For the rest, the movie stays coherent to its goal through the whole run, and it's overall more than enough entertaining for the freeruns requirement. As such, accepting as a new branch for Alternative!
