	"Between these, and discovering you don't have to "Push" the rock, you can just "Get" it, 1.8 seconds is shaved off the previous run.  Unfortunately, for some reason, it seems the last screen steals those 0.8 seconds away, with Elsa waiting longer now to hop the desk than she did before.  I even went back and removed typing a name, which bought another 0.3 seconds, but that just made her wait equivalently longer to hop the desk.  My only guess on that is that she may only be able to hop the desk on at the end of a full second, but I'm not certain.  Below is the code for this, and I'd appreciate if anyone can add any insight to this added wait time:

	"Although it's disappointing not being able to squeeze more than a second out of this, that wasn't really the main point in redoing this run.  My actual goal was to test out a new scripting system I set up for editing JPC-rr movie files.  If you haven't used the emulator before, JPC-rr files are notoriously bad for trying to edit or patch.  The main reason for this is that they store commands with very specific relative time increments, which can vary seemingly arbitrarily.  Changing one of these can have huge cascading effects, causing errors and desyncs all down the rest of the movie.
