	"Miniature Golf is an Atari 2600 game released in 1978. As the name of the game suggests, you play through a 9 hole miniature golf course. The yellow dot is your ball, the moving purple square is your putter, the moving red square is an obstacle, and the stationary purple square is the hole.

	"On most holes, it's fastest to finish in as few shots as possible, however, there are two exceptions, hole 5 and hole 7. In both cases, an extra shot is taken, very slightly moving the ball to allow for a much more direct 2nd shot. The best possible score in Miniature Golf is -26, but because the TAS takes two extra shots, it finishes with a score of -24.

	"ThunderAxe31 speaking here. While judging this submission, I found a minor improvement applicable to 7 levels, for a total of 21 frames saved. It just made the movement of the cursor shorter, the trajectories of the ball are actually unchanged, so you can't see the difference by naked eye. Below is the list of improvements:

	": Nice little movie, execution looks good, and the feedback was quite positive. Easy difficulty makes sense because hard doesn't add new impressive gameplay elements. The game can't be played further than in this movie because you can't hit the ball anymore, so for a game without and ending it's a sane ending point. Accepting to Moons.
