	"A stranded visitor from another galaxy needs to get home and doesn't have much time. Designed especially for children, "Friendly Alien" is a nonviolent game which requires strategy and a little dexterity. The object is simple: You must guide a stranded visitor to a phone from which he can call home, then lead him to the ship when it lands.
