	"When you charge a shot with the spirit bow, the damage output of the arrow is computed based on the charge magnitude. Then, the velocity of the arrow is computed from the damage output and the charge magnitude (which is usually redundant). However, if you release the arrow frame-perfectly when the charge just started, then the damage output is not initialized, so it is using the leftover value from a previous shot.

	"Because of this, it is possible to fire arrows very quickly at maximum damage output. Those arrows will only have half of the maximum velocity possible, because the charge time is zero.
