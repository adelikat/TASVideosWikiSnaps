	"Super Monkey Ball Jr. is notorious for the bad controls and even worse physics. If you've seen the other monkey ball movies on the site, you may have noticed that moving diagonally is faster than going straight, and getting bounces into the air gives you more speed. Naturally, the exact opposite of both are true for this game. Any airtime will slow you down, and going diagonally does not save time.

Using a password is fine to access a higher difficulty. It's short and viewer reception was positive, so I am accepting this and suggesting that it goes to moons.
