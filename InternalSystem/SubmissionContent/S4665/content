	"Super Monkey Ball Jr. is notorious for the bad controls and even worse physics. If you've seen the other monkey ball movies on the site, you may have noticed that moving diagonally is faster than going straight, and getting bounces into the air gives you more speed. Naturally, the exact opposite of both are true for this game. Any airtime will slow you down, and going diagonally does not save time.

	"Each floor has an intro where the stage is viewed from afar. These intros can all be skipped by pressing A, but this movie uses a bug where the intro is skipped before it even begins. By getting the exact right frame, the game loads the stage before the intro scene is shown.

	"I'm now certain that no more possible shortcuts are possible for this game. All intro skips and level transitions are perfect as far as I'm aware, and all five floors are optimized to the best of my abilities. I don't see anyone improving on this movie (mainly because nobody will ever bother)

	": This looks good. It's faster than previous attempts, and not just because of the stage introductions, all of the levels are improved as well. Using a password is fine to access a higher difficulty. It's short and viewer reception was positive, so I am accepting this and suggesting that it goes to moons.
