	"There is an infamous trick used in the RTA runs where selecting the stairway after Bobby (the Scissorman) clips his scissors once allows you to run past him without getting hurt (and then you cancel the action before you actually go up the stairs). However, you can start moving left earlier than that, and I end up moving early enough that I can't perform the cancellation early enough to avoid the stairs without getting hit by Bobby). Thankfully, I can avoid this by pausing the game for a few frames as I'm about to pass Bobby to change his movement pattern)

	"Where all the interesting stuff happens. Bobby is manipulated to leave the room almost immediately after he enters (note that he only shows up after you've started running toward the ladder), which saves a lot of lag frames. After that, I have Jennifer pick up the car keys from the box just to the right of the car; this is a significant improvement over what is possible in an RTA, as Jennifer will start walking as soon you select the box. Therefore, I have her run to the left and wait until the last possible frame before I actually select the box to pick up the keys.

[div class=p 
	"A similar trick is also used with running to the car. In addition, when I do select the car, I open my inventory on the same frame, which allows me to skip Jennifer's monologue in the car on both the second and third entries by constantly switching between the cursor and key (preventing the game from loading her text since it has the load the description for the two items on every frame).

	" Thanks to Soppanaama for telling me about a useful trick which saves ~45 frames; when selecting the car keys, it is quicker to stop later so that the camera scrolls left during the cutscene, so that the cursor ends up on the car door immediately.

The audience response was a somewhat lukewarm, but more close on the positive side. As for game choice, it's an interesting one. In any case...
