	"Ever since I stumbled upon TASVideos, I've wanted to make my own TAS.  I tried to find a game that I knew very well, that wouldn't be a long TAS, and that hadn't been done yet that people wanted to see.  I finally settled on Space Quest IV.  Turns out, this may be the first mouse-based dos game to be TASed.

	"This run turned out to be a lot longer than I had originally anticipated.  I figured that if I jumped straight from SQ XII to SQ I and back, the guard in the right hangar would be gone and I could enter Vohaul's complex from there.  I TASsed that, just to discover that the guard was still there, and I was shot.  So, I then tried jumping straight to the mall and back.  Zap!  Guard still guarding.  Turns out, to get the guard to leave you have to summon the time machine and guards in the mall.  To do that, you have to clean out Zondra's bank account.  And to do that, you have to save the ladies from the sea slug.  So, a trip to SQ X is unavoidable.  Still, since the jar of slime is the only real inventory item you need to get to Vohaul, I was able to skip past SQ I, the software store, Radio Shock, as well as bypass catching the bunny.

[p 
	"JPC-rr is a very functional emulator in all aspects except one: 
	[em 
		"mouse support
	]em
	".  Unfortunately, in almost all cases, mouse input is faster than keyboard input for this game.  As built, JPC-rr comes with a side menu with mouse movement options of 
	[tt 
		"Up 10, Up 20, Up 30, Up 40, Up 50
	]tt
	", and corresponding options for down, left and right.  The problem is, those increments are too broad for any accurate mouse movement.  My initial solution was to alter the extramenu file to add 
	[tt 
		"Up 1, Up 2 and Up 5
	]tt
	" options (as well as the same for down, left and right).  This provided me with a more exacting way of specifying mouse movements.  Still, mouse movement was always trial and error and it made TASsing painfully slow.  "Up 20? Nope, not enough.  Up 20, Up 5?  Still not enough.  Up 30?  Too much.  Up 20, Up 5, Up 2?  Not enough..."  Halfway through TASsing the game this way, I decided I couldn't keep going like this.  I needed to find a better way.
	$LF

[p 
	"Luckily, Ilari included the source code with the emulator.  With some poking around, I was able to implement the ability to drag the game's mouse cursor around with my mouse.  Click on the the mouse cursor, drag it to your desired location and release.  The cursor will move to wherever you want, no menus or guesswork involved.  I have no idea if it'll work for other games, but it made TASsing much, much easier for this one.  I also added the ability to type in the x and y movement values so you can simply specify 'Move X 17, Y -11'.  Finally, I added buttons to move the mouse cursor to the bottom left and right-hand corners.  With this new functionality, not only was I able to TAS this game in a quarter of the time it took me before, but I was also to play around with the mouse cursor and do some fun things during player idle times.

[p 
	"To add a little bit of entertainment, I incorporated some mouse cursor play into the run. After reading some of the comments on this submission, I realized that those who had never played the game before might think these movements were originally part of the game! XD There are in fact five different times I added mouse cursor movements to the run for entertainment. For a fun Easter egg hunt, try to find them all. (FYI, The bouncing nose and monorail mouth together only count as one).  Some of them are really quick, so blink and you'll miss them!

The unfortunate downside of this is that if you leave the screen before it starts moving again, the game refuses to change screens and just stays stuck on that one screen.  I try to get as close as possible to the screen boundary before the slime begins its movement again.
