	$LF
	"Unlike some other games (sonic for example) horizontal momentum is not lost when hitting walls. This makes optimization easier when passing corners.
	$LF
	"Since the game seems to have no glitches at all and the fastest routes through the level are pretty obvious, the only thing one can do in a TAS is optimization. This prooved to be a bit tricky on some occasions. Some bosses for example can be killed faster when delaying the first hit for a frame.
