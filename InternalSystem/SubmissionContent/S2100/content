	"While there are multiple small improvements due to RAM watching to assist with velocity control and boss HP monitoring, and lag reduction, the majority of time was saved by a new strategy for the 3rd level. Venom makes a mid-level appearance, and the screen will only advance when you've either lost enough HP to drop below 15, or take enough of Venom's HP. Thanks to taking a ton of damage from both Doc Ock in level 1 and Venom in level 2, I was able to get my health below 15 without having to stop at all. The only noticeable slowing of action is a somewhat awkward looking jump used to trigger Venom's appearance.
