	"The most significant difference from the previous route is skipping Clefable entirely, and instead using Squirtle until Tauros is caught.

	"Thanks to gifvex for proposing to look into this option more; I thought I ruled this out as being slower while working on the previous submission, but I clearly miscalculated.

[div class=p 
	"A pure Squirtle route loses most of the time during the final stretches of the game, as Blastoise's move set and stats cannot keep up with the end-game fights.
	$LF
	"However, when optimizing Squirtle to only be used until the Safari Zone, a lot of the slow parts can be cut out.
	$LF
	"It still can't complete that stretch of the game as efficiently as Clefable, but fast enough that it outweighs catching a Clefairy for it.

	"where in the previous TAS it aligned Clefable's level ups better to save time with redbar, here it aligns the level-ups in a way so that Wartortle learns Bite at L24 before Bill.
	$LF
	"Learning a move cancels Instant Text, so you want it to happen in a convenient location.
