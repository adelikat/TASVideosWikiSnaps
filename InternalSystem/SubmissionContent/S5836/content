But by going into walls and pushing Mario to the right edge of the screen, then touching a Spiny Egg to get hurt it will be possible. I tried many ways to control Spiny Eggs and the way I use in the movie seems to be the best choise.

	"1UP Mushrooms in X-1 (except 1-1) only appear when we get all the coins in (X-1)-3 ( For example 1UP Mushroom in 4-1 will appear when we get all the coins in 3-3). So in this run you can not only see all the ways of getting items , but also see coin collection in X-3 stages. In 1-3 we can miss two coins.

	"This is my first substantial collaborative TAS. But as HappyLee says, Mars608 has finished most of the stages by himself. My efforts were not very helpful I guess. He invited me over with admiration for my SMB technique, but I don't think I've lived up to his expectations.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"But anyway, they were much outstanding than I'd thought. Mars608 and HappyLee accomplished the results that I couldn't reach with my own knowledge and skills. When I thought "this is enough" and I handed them the movie files, they gave me a more surprising result and unexpected improvements. Especially in 4-1, I had a lot of difficulty manipulating the position of Spiny Egg, but they succeeded in taking both of Mushroom and Flower with this perfect movement (It may have been Mars' solo). Also Mars608 has devised of a small improvement in 8-4, but it's too bad it couldn't apply to this TAS. I hope it can apply to the warpless run they're producing.

	": Whether this run collects all items is debatable because it hinges on the definition of an item. All power-ups might be more accurate. This run also has a very high points to time spent ratio, and all in all is only slightly more than a minute slower than a full run, keeping the action fast paced, and the entertainment fairly high. The audience for the most part agrees.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Normally, an acceptable run is one which does 100%, which differs game to game, as different games have different optional components. For Super Mario Bros., 100% means all levels, because levels is seen as optional, power-ups not so much, because collecting the same power-up over and over doesn't actually do anything aside from awarding points. Therefore this run is a custom goal which is 100% and then some.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Custom goals are allowed if they offer a couple of things that are not seen in other runs, and the audience finds it entertaining. This run while having many similarities to the as fast as possible warpless run does offer some unique things. Many of the power-ups are collected with a variety of glitches not seen in the other SMB runs. Since more time is spent in levels than seen in other published movies, some alternate tricks are employed to complete levels which line up enemies that are at a different location in their movement cycle than seen elsewhere. The handling of 4-1 was especially impressive. Some of the tricks appear to be required to collect items without losing time, and are unlikely to appear in other runs, such as the 1-up collection in 8-2, or some lift shenanigans in 1-3 which seems to be the fastest way to get a power-up and coins (which is then required for the hidden 1-up in 2-1).
