	"Tetris Party Deluxe runs at 30fps during a Tetris game, and uses modern Tetris mechanics, like SRS and the 7 piece bag (or whatever it's called).

	"Sometimes, rotating a piece early makes it appear 1 frame sooner, which I used a few times during this TAS.

	"The European version was used because 1- I accidentally got it instead of the US version and 2- There isn't the ESRB screen when booting, making this 1-2 seconds faster.

	"I could have finished the run with a perfect clear, however I would have needed to clear a single line first, which would have been overall 6 frames (3 frames at 30 fps) slower. So I just dropped the S-piece.

[p 
	"After testing multiple sequences, even attempting building 9-0, this was the fastest way to build I found, which is 6-3. This allows me to drop the I-pieces really fast.

[p 
	"I'm not sure if I missed any optimisation while moving pieces, but I'm sure there is a way to end on a Tetris perfect clear. I think it could probably go under 23 seconds.
