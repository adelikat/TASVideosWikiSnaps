	"Pilotwings is a flight simulator game from Nintendo for the SNES. The player earns pilot's licenses through light plane, skydiving, rocketbelt, and hang gliding events. This run clears all 8 lessons and the 2 helicopter missions in 20 minutes without ever piloting the light plane.

	"One frame sacrificed prior to entering the level for luck manipulation. The game rotates bonus stages in the pattern "A-A-B-C" on a per-frame basis. The frame counter increments between levels and during pause. Stage C is the fastest for getting the 20 points needed to end lesson 1.

	"No skydiving unfortunately. TAS hang gliding is still slow and boring, but it's faster than the 2-minute light plane circuit and has a bonus stage.

[p 
	"Getting 20 points on the bonus stage is likely ~105 frames faster on the rocketbelt stage. However, I believe landing on the bonus platform makes up the difference on hang glider stage.

[p 
	"When taking sharp turns with the rocketbelt, I found that propelling yourself backward is faster than taking the time to turn off your jets and turn. This saved a second off my time on this level.

[p 
	"Getting 70 on the skydiving bonus stage takes the longest because you have to travel farther horizontally at expense to your vertical speed. However, the difference is negligible compared to a single super jump in the Rocketbelt bonus stage. So I chose this route, which allows me 300 points without having to do a single super jump in the rocketbelt bonus stage.

[p 
	"Note: This 40-point bonus level is one frame slower than the next. I didn't fix it because I have to wait 1 or 2 frames in the next lessons for luck anyway; if I changed it, that would become 2 or 3 frames instead and I would come out even.

	" Final Thoughts
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"There are 2 glitches one can use, but they are usually slower. One can bounce off the ground in one's landing animation in skydiving or hang gliding. In Lesson 8 skydiving, I used this to bounce over the water onto the moving platform until improved to falling straight onto it. One can also fall into the water after clearing a level. This is entertaining, but provides no frame advantage.

	": The votes here are not particularly great, however those who voted yes (and posted) were enthusiatic about doing so and seemed to enjoy the run. I found certain parts of this run to be rather repetitive, however the rocketbelt stages proposed interesting strategies and optimisation opportunities. Audience response proves decisive. Accepted.
