		" Level 47: It desynced due the heavy random lag of this level and with the adjustment of the input we lost 3 frames. But there is in fact an actual improvement in this level, since we break the middle most block after our last bounce off of it (saves 1-2 frames over not doing it).

	"Optimization looks solid. I played around with the game for a bit and found nothing to improve, at least not after understanding the tricks better. It bounced back every potential improvement I threw at it at least, ha haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. I really enjoyed the routing work with the wallclips and OoB shenanigans, and the little attentions to detail/entertainment to keep things interesting all throughout.
