	"Straight up stolen from a wiki, because I never watched the cutscenes and I'm too lazy~    
	$LF
	""Dora and Swiper travel around the world. They go to France, Tanzania, Russia and China. Dora needs to pass out friendship bracelets that Swiper took from around the world. Once all the bracelets are passed out the sky will light up. Each country has their own "Swiper" that they need to stop from stealing bracelets."

	$LF

	"There is only one glitch used in this run, which does not save nor waste time. By timing my movement in the autoscrollers correctly (frame perfect), I can go into objects. What happens is as soon as you pass the object, you can not move. Exactly one frame before you can not move, you can go into the object. Doing it a frame too early, Dora will work as intended; just stop, which wastes time.
	$LF

[p 
	"I don't think this is a glitch, but for some reason, the hitboxes of when you select items in the mini games are REALLY weird. One time I'm selecting a completely different item than what I'm supposed to select and still selected the one I'm supposed to select. By abusing the hitboxes I can save time over RTA. It's not too weird, it's just that they feel a little...awkward when you're doing a TAS.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The RNG list? Empty. No, I'm serious. Literally nothing is RNG. Not even the mini games where you need to pay attention to fake Swiper's movement and select the correct item. On top of that, this mini game right here appears 3 times, and they all have the EXACT same pattern, always. Pretty creative! Right?
	$LF

	"Russia is a autoscroll/mini game only place, no walking. Why am I mentioning this? Because the mini game with getting the correct person looks as if I intentionally wasted time. Truly, I didn't. What happens here is apparently the lag frames are really...common here. Basically, every other frame is a lag frame which ends up in it looking like I wasted time. Truly, I didn't really waste time. The game just doesn't like this mini-game. Shame...
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Speaking of lag frames, after Russia, while going to China, pressing up in this autoscroller produces lag. Meaning that I have to input as low "up" inputs as I could.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"One final thing I would like to note is that because I'm ending input early, RTA Timing is 3 seconds slower than the WR. If I did not end early and decided to end like in normal RTA Timing, I would however be about 13 seconds faster than WR.

	"So...long ish story (not really). On a random day, I was bored as heck, and decided to do a run of a short game I haven't ever played. After a hour looking, I decided to go with this, Dora the Explorer - Dora's World Adventure. I got a time of about 16:30. Many months later, I touched the game again, to go for a better time. I might go for a better time, as I'm still second-to-last place (better than last) sooner or later, and probably will. I noticed how the WR's comment said "FINALLY sub 12:20. Can I retire from this game now?" and while thinking about it some day, I thought about something. What exactly is the best time one could ever get if they are being EXTREMELY precise? Like, pixel perfect precise? And then I started to make this TAS.
	$LF

[p 
	"The game was slightly harder to optimize than I thought it would be, but I still managed to finish it in a...day. Actually, 8 or so hours. Not the hardest I've worked for a TAS (still a lot more work than that "Pacifist" run I did in SMW), but I still decided to take my time. Could of finished it in a hour if I wanted to. As stupid as it may sound, the hardest part for me was actually in France with the balloons. Their hitbox really was weird, and I kept noticing flaws. For a simple 30  seconds mini game I took far more time than I should have.

	"For having a sub 12:20 run making me curious what the best possible time. I'm actually surprised the TAS is over 10 seconds faster than RTA WR, for such a simple game. Had he not done so many attempts on sub 12:20, I would not have done this TAS. And this is why I want to thank to him.
