	"This is the last game in the series to release on the Gamecube, and it has not looked back since. Unlike typical games in the series, the bulk of this game takes place in the Story Mode, spread out across 5 worlds (according to the manual). For simplicity sake though, it’s safe to merge the last 2.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"The objective of the game is typically what confuses people the most, since a typical game in the series traverses level to level with only the goal to reach on each. With how this was structured for story mode, each world requires at least 60 joy points (can be seen under the character icon in the HUD), as well as a final mission per each world. Also, like challenge mode, baby is used due to overall improvements in the load times.

	"As stated before, each world requires at least 60 joy points to continue. To this day, there is no known way to get around this, so the route generally follows the concept of completing the fastest missions possible to get to the required amount. One key thing taken into consideration though, was the banana collection, which is both a strong and weak point of this. Also, big thanks to Meowmix_fan for helping with the route a ton.

[div class=p 
	"There is only one instance where it was deemed worth going slightly out of the way to do a slower mission in order to make up time later. The tradeoff was that more bananas had to be collected, raising the total to 350 from 250 in the typical route used. This specifically is the only area where there are errors in this TAS; it reaches the amount, but loses a few frames overall due to which bananas are collected.
