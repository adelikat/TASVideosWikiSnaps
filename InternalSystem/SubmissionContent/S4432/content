	"This 1 Player TAS of the NES version of Joust focuses on showing off the strange physics of the game.  Instead of focusing on being surgically accurate I worked on creating long chains of bird bouncing madness, frequently bashing my mount into the ceiling and into the heads of other mounts.  I hope you find this run entertaining!

	"Since the game does increase in difficulty for later waves with more distractions from the pterodactyl, and spawning enemies which move considerably faster, I am deeming this run incomplete. Several more waves need to be played, and a later cycle must be reached. Rejecting.
