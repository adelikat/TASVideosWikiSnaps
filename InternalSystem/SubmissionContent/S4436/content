	", in, as you might guess, a pinball format. As in Metroid Prime, the objective is for Samus to collect 12 Chozo Artifacts, and then enter the Artifact Temple in order to enter Impact Crater and destroy the eponymous Metroid Prime. In this game, the Artifacts are collected by doing various missions, destroying all kinds of enemies, and defeating some bosses, all of which are also adapted from Metroid Prime and the Metroid series in general. It's a fairly simple but pretty fun game.

Collecting these in both colors causes a final red-and-blue Phazon Fragment to appear, and collecting it with either ball triggers a Super Jackpot, unlocks an Artifact and repeats the same again (sans Artifact in further iterations). It ends when either ball is destroyed; the remaining ball will turn back to the orange Samus ball. During this mode, it is possible to enter the Mode Saucer and do missions, but not leave the table or activate Hurry-Up!.

Clearing a Hurry-Up! fast enough (before the score timer starts counting down) unlocks an Artifact. To complete the Hurry-Up!, I just need to enter the top passage from the right. This would normally end up the ball in the zone with bumpers and rollovers, which are always slow to get out of, but proper nudging causes the ball to bump into one of the 'gates' and bounce back, which also sets it up nicely to be shot into the Mode Saucer to leave the stage.

Additionally, after hitting him three times, he turns completely invulnerable even during the startup of rolling up. (He becomes vulnerable again when either ending the roll, which takes a

		[em 
			"then
		]em

There are 12 Artifact Towers on the stage; hitting them once unlocks them, hitting them again locks a ball inside it. You need to do this for all 12 Towers, and then enter the center saucer again with one of the balls. Meanwhile, Meta Ridley appears and occasionally drops bombs which instantly destroy the balls (though it is possible to regenerate balls by hitting the top center "button" on the board).

		" As with other balls entering the board, it's possible to use nudges to adjust their speed and direction. In particular, it makes it possible for the balls to hit two of the Artifact Towers right away, as well as have them land in more convenient areas in general. However, it's made quite a bit harder by the fact you have up to 6 balls on the screen to control. Basically, I have two balls enter the bottom towers that can be immediately triggered, and have the remaining four balls do some absolutely crazy stuff that ends with them unlocking all the top-screen Towers and landing them in the four most convenient ones quickly.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" I actually discovered a glitch while running this, where when hitting the second tower from the top left, the ball would both enter it and bounce off at the same time, effectively duplicating the ball (and making another one disappear). This is useful because it allowed me to have 6 towers "filled" while still having one ball on the table to do things. I use this ball to unlock the bottom two towers, saving some hassle there, and then shooting it in one of the final 6 towers. The other 5 balls are also carefully nudged to enter another tower as fast as possible.

		" Another thing of note is that when entering the Force Ball rails, nudging the table up on certain frames can speed the ball up a bit. This can save up to 20 frames sometimes.

		" I do a very precise Force Ball hit on the first hit to make the ball bounce off and go on into another Force Ball path very quickly. This saves some time but actually messes up Metroid Prime's pattern, causing it to spam more homing bombs. The problem is that Metroid Prime takes more damage when doing its laser attack instead, and I need it to do that in order to hit it with the final force ball. So what I do is delay the final shot so that it goes around the circle behind him, giving it a bit more time to start its laser attack, before it is hit in the back and killed by the Force Ball.
