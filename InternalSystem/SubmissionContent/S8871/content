	"Children sometimes play a game called "Matching Pennies." The rules go like this: The first player covers a penny with his or her hand. The second player has to guess which side of the coin the first player picked, and place a penny showing heads of tails. If the two coins match, the second player guessed correctly and keeps both. If the pennies are different, the first player wins both coins.

	"Yes...BOTing. Why did I do that? I have no idea. This was the biggest waste of my time, writing a BOT that basically didn't accomplished what I wanted. When I couldn't affect the RNG, I decided to test it with an "RND" seed. I must have seen something different, as I thought that was the only way to accomplish the changes I needed. Since this game was loaded with BASIC, I figured it would behave by BASIC rules. Well, the code created an ML routine which controlled the RNG. Basically, this means I had to alter RNG like I do other machine language games. The only problem was...if I try to change RNG...it wasted my time and made the situation worse. So I ended up playing the game straight through...as I couldn't find any other way to make this faster.
