	": Watching this submission leaves one thing clear, you (sirstarmagic) did NOT read the guidelines, or take the time to educate yourself about the submission quality required. The thing that remains unclear is whether this is intentional trolling, or simply a young user misunderstanding the purpose of the site. Since I am not clear on that, I am issuing you a warning sirstarmagic. If you submit a similarly subpar submission again, you will be banned. Use the forums to discuss your ideas for a TAS before submitting again. Canceled.
