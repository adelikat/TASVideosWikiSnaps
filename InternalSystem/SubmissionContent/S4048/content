	"1. Open and close the status screen at the place one-step north of the town in the overworld.

	"3. Buy Potion (1), Eye Drops (2), Antidote (2), Leather Shield (20), Dagger (20), Longsword (1).
	[br

	$LF
	"4. Set the items in the inventory in the order of: Leather Shield (20), Dagger (20), Eye Drops (2), Antidote (2), Empty, Longsword (1), Potion (1).
	[br

	$LF
	"5. Have the second character equipped with a Leather Shield on each hand; a knife then falls into the fifth slot of the inventory.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"6. Make a battle in the village (it's necessary to do it in the map where we can't save, such as towns or dungeons).
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"7. The first character uses a knife in the inventory.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"8. The second character puts on/off Daggers and Leather Shields iteratively to fill the inventory with those.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"9. After filling the inventory, cancel all the characters' commands.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"10. The knife which the first character used tries to go back to the inventory, which is already full, so it goes into the "33rd slot", which indeed is meant to be the first character's job.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"11. Now the first character's job is glitched. Cancel commands twice to select the second command of the first character, which makes the end of battle.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"12. Can call the ending for some reason, possibly because the memory addresses are widely rewritten when the job is glitched. The details are still unknown, however.
