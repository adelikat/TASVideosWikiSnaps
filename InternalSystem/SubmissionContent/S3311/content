It utilizes real-time battles like many other ARPGs, but there are many features peculiar to this game, such as the “Ring Command” or multiplayer action. Thanks to them, this game has got much popularity all over the world. Playing this game, we find our spirit of adventure coming up to walk around the beautiful world or fight against evils, or even save the world.

	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This glitch allows you to make money without economic efforts. In Secret of Mana, collected items are stored in 12bytes of RAMs: 1 item per 1 byte. There are 32 kinds of items and you can possess at most 7 items of the same kind (though usually limited by 4 items). In the memory, lower 5 bits indicates what kind of item you have, and upper 3 bits tells you how many items you have. For example, 0x40 means two candies and 0x20 is one candy, or 0x26 means one magic rope and 0x06 is zero magic ropes.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"0xFF usually means blank. But if the cursor points the item 0xFF, you can sell it with 30000 GP. In fact, 0xFF calculates as if you have zero glitched item “BLAT”. When you sell it, the RAM number is subtracted by 0x20 then becomes 0xDF, which means 7 “BLATS”
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"You can access this memory like this way. If you have 2 candies 1 chocolates, 1 herbs, 1 ropes, and nothing else, and the cursor points the rope, then the 12bytes RAMs is like this. (Hexadecimal)

	$LF
]pre
[p 
	"The cursor moves once, but not more than twice. So you can select the blank item (zero “BLATs”). In this situation, the former 2 items are displayed as item icons. But the actual items are glitched. Described candy is actually a magic rope, and the described magic rope is zero BLATs, whose price is 30000 GP.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This glitched situation will be finished if you buy something or restart the game. But if you sell the blank to earn 30000 GP and get new item (like chocolate), then the RAMs becomes below and items remains glitched.
	$LF
]p
[pre 
	"40 26 DF 21 FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
	$LF
]pre
[p 
	"This is because if you get a new item, the nearest 0xFF is replaced by that item. Item 0xDF (7 BLATs) has no icons. So there are only three icons and new item cannot be selected because the cursor itself is not glitched anymore.
	$LF
]p
[p

[p 
	"If you attack a rope pole when someone is casting a spell, a player temporarily gets able to run through all the obstacles. If this glitch happens, a player can just go straight until the glitch ends. But if you apply this with “Locking the Screen Trick” I will mention later, you can go through the walls to wherever you want to go in the screen. Usually, I give order to the Sprite to cast some spell and make the Boy attack the pole, and then let the Girl run around to gather all the members at another rope point.

]p
[p 
	"When you beat a boss and land the event points at proper timing, the screen doesn’t white out. This glitch skips the “Way to go!” message and I can save around 150 frames. This glitch happens because the map tile causes a blank event and the event overwrites the game order to white out the screen.

	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If you throw away an armor equipped with by someone, some glitched situation happens depending on the X position in the screen of the displayed trash. The changeable RAMs are 0x7ECC00 to 0x7ECCFF. I will list the changeable data from the left: characters’ name, head armors, body armors, arm armors, items, weapons, GP, and other useless data.

	$LF
	"The Sprite: RAM whose number is 192-254 decreases its number by 192.
	$LF
]pre
[p 
	"First, the X position of the trash decides what data to refer (0x7ECC00 + X position). Then check whether the data number is true to the above-mentioned condition. If the condition is true, the RAM number decreases. If the condition is false, then refer to next RAM address and check whether true or not again and again.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"You can change a character’s name with this glitch. If the name’s first character becomes glitched, then the player’s name will never be called again. This can save 1 frame every time the player is called, but I did not use this because this is not faster.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Also, you can take off certain armors or weapons. Even if you disarm a weapon of a character, the character’s current weapon does not change. So using this glitch, two characters can be equipped with the same weapon at the same time. I used this glitch once because I needed two players’ whips.

		"Save Data Corruption (*6)
	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Secret of Mana is so glitchy that even a usual player’s usual save action may cause a save data corruption. Land at the Ice Country Neko and save there, then a save data which has no information about where to start. Usually, this save data couldn’t be read. But if you use a soft reset (L+R+Start+Select) and read the data, you can start the game from where you reset. Abusing this glitch, I could skip the Ancient City under the Grand Palace.

		"Carry over Some Event to the Next Map (*7)
	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Use the Magic Rope and cause an event, then the map changes and the event happens at the next map. This can reduce fadeout lags by about 30. I didn’t use this glitch much though, because I didn’t know this until the movie is about to finish (at that time, my movie was 40000 frames left). I used this only at the Dark Palace.

	$LF

	"Attack a rope pole and call Flammie, then you can skip the first event that will happen at the landing maps. I utilize this glitch to skip the barrier event at the entrance of Mana Fortress. You can enter the fortress as usual and beat Dark Rich and Mana Beast to save the world, without any Mana powers.

[p 
	"In Secret of Mana, many things are calculated every 5 frames. When attacking to enemies or obstacles, I must time the best frame to press B button.

[p 
	"When a character is on the stairs and you want him/her to move vertically, he/she moves for 4 frames and then stops for 4 frames. The horizontal movement is not limited though. So if the character can go through the stairs horizontally, that is faster than usual.

	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When you want to sprint, you can control the direction to some extent. Normally, if a character sprints, he/she moves directly. But when he/she moves diagonally and finds a wall, he/she moves along the wall. In this game, the distance between 2 characters is limited. So if you set one character at the right position and let the other character sprint diagonally, the sprinting character moves as if there were a wall and goes along the invisible wall. You can control the sprinting direction this way.

		"Damage Combining Trick (*14)
	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When two characters attack an enemy at the same time, sometimes the damage made by them is combined. The amount is determined by simply addition. Killing an enemy this way, the fatal hit is regarded to be made by the rearer character (i.e. the Girl or the Sprite) and he/she gains more weapon experiences.

		"Double Hit of the Boomerang (*15)
	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Some kind of Boomerang charged attack has two chance to hit and can hit an enemy twice. This is also true to glitched charge attack, so Boomerang can deal really big damage! But glitched charge Boomerang has a significant problem that the Boomerang never flies, though it has very close attack range. In order to abuse these glitch and trick, I had to take many re-records because there is little possibility to make a double hit.

	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Leave a character to NPC and when the character wanted to charge, the character’s weapon charge flag is set. If this flag is set, the character starts charging right after you leave him/her to NPC controlled. This can save many charging frames in the boss battle. You can watch this flag with memory 0x7EE085 (the Boy’s flag) and 0x7EE485 (the Sprite’s flag).

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If a character gives a certain attack (like a sword’s thrust) and takes an enemy’s hit at the same time, the character’s attack/sprint gauge never decreases.

Accompanying this, there is extra 29000 GP left. So I bought two Power Wrists to enhance the Boy’s and the Sprite’s power by 5. The Boy’s power is useful at the next battle against Tropicallo.
