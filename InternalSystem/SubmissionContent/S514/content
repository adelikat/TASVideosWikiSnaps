	"Level 4 - Or Why I Dislike FCEU While recording... I spent 45 minutes alone trying to load and save properly and back things up and FCEU crashed a ton. I did my best to move while I shot at Red Lobster.. this'd be where the awkward button placement comes in ^^;; And yeah, you'll notice I literally pause at one place in Level 4 so I can time my jump right... amazingly.. I did this right after another crash made me redo that level and I did the jump perfectly, FIRST TIME! I have to do this as the kid I try to avoid is the bonus stage... [grrr]

	"Level 5 - I tried jumping as best I could to avoid things and got a bit of trouble for it.. but I think I faired well.. I mean more pogo ninjas ^^ The rest of the level was straight forward... but.. I DID get an idea for the final boss... I realized the other submission, he gets hit.. so instead of that, I tried jumping.. it might be a TOUCH slower, but I personally found it more entertaining then getting hit. Oh yeah, that one screen with the stamp? It can be bypassed lickety split taking you to the game over screen faster, which is what I did. Cursed 73 frames.. 31373... it could have been unintentionally 31337 if I touched it a bit faster ^^;;
