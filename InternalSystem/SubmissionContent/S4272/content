	"A TAS of Tengen Tetris that goes for 30 lines in the fastest time. This run does it in under 30 seconds. I achieve this by warping to level 17 with a code. The pieces can be rotated while being moved or dropped. A code which replaces the current piece is never used. This is rather interesting to see after seeing the other Tetris TASes.

	"This is the version of Tetris released by Atari. It is the puzzle game everyone loves. There is no need for an introduction. I use two controllers to go through the menu. It is faster than using just one. I use the level select code for the highest level possible. I do not use the Konami code for a shortcut 'cause that would be cheating. I aim for 30 lines in the fastest time possible. It takes less than a second for the board to be set up. The handicap is set to 12 lines high to ensure the fastest time.

	"I used the level select code (Pause Up Down Up Down Left Right B B A*n) to skip to Level 17. I cannot use the Konami code 'cause that would be cheating. I play this legitimately by relying on what piece is next. It is completed very fast.
