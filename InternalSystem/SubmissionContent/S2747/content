	"Tiny Toon Adventures is a awesome platformer, with varying levels that are short and can be challenging. As shown in the game intro, Montana Max has the power to talk through T.V's and, he notifies you that he stole

	" )by Randil. Time saved comes from more optimization, better use of the "hyper ultra mega maximum super jump", skipping using Furball for all world except the last one, and better boss fights.

The run then got halted at world 3 because I got lazy, but I recently picked it back up and finished it. There are improvements in every world, some more noticeable than others.
