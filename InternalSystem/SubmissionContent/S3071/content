	"As stupid as this run looks, there actually is (very slight) strategy to it. First, during fights, when you get within range and punch, depending which punch you do (left jab, right jab, left upper, right upper) you can force the AI into doing the wrong thing. Uppers do more damage so you want to do them whenever possible, and manipulate the opponent into doing an upper block.

	"Second are your powerups. You get three for winning a fight and you can put them into one of four stats: P (power), R (???), F (speed), and SP (super punches). Yes that's right, I have no idea what R is. I thought maybe range, but that doesn't seem to be the case.
