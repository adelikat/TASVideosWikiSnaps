	"I got interested in TASing this game back in November 2010 and managed to save a few frames here and there. After I posted my WIP in the 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=WL2 topic|href=/Forum/Posts/252989)
	", we started creating an improved run - and improved it here and there many times. Jlun2 discovered the walljump trick which proved to be very useful since it can be used to go out of bounds when used near a ceiling. We found goal doors in the OoB area which meant the run had to be redone. Eventually we ended up with an awesome WIP, but after talking to klmz I realized that the OoB areas were incorrectly emulated on VBA 19~23 and the WIP basicly died...

	", another GB emulator, is said to be emulating the OoB area correctly, but I couldn't find any goal doors in the OoB area at all with it. I tried looking for quite some time, but never managed to find any door at all. Sometime later, VBA 24-m arrived which emulated the OoB sections correctly, but due to those sections being useless now, all the anticipated awesomeness of a new WL2 run was gone and we didn't work on any run until August 2011.

[div class=p 
	"jlun2 suggested to try the SGB version of the game, and quite surprisingly I found a nearby goal door right in the second room of the second level, so I put a lua script together and was all settled to work on a new run. Admittedly, the SGB version doesn't nearly look as nice as the colorful GBC version but we didn't want to let go of a 1.5 minute improvement after all, naturally. In my opinion a new 100% run shouldn't use any OoB glitches. Sure there would be nice glitching in every level, but the run already consists 30% of bonus games and loading screens. Cutting much more would hurt the run in my opinion. On the other hand, I always wanted to see the 100% run with all the non-gameplay parts cut out. :)

The deprecated GBC WIP glitches to the top of the last room, falls 4 screen lengths while collecting coins every frame and then finishing via OoB goal door. I think this was one of the coolest things about this WIP, but sadly it's no longer possible, even on the SGB version. Instead, we glitched into the last room and left/re-entered to make the bat with the pounder appear and finished the level normally.

D037 always runs out the same way, but D038 stops at some values randomly, depending on what Wario is doing. Crouching, crawling, going left or right, turning around, jumping all affect the way D038 decreases, so what looks like spazzing on the floor is actually the fastest way to make the boss stop.
