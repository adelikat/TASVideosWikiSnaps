	"This game is a sequel to an Atari(numbers) game. It has been published on several consoles, including Sega Genesis. There are some differences in gameplay, biggest being you can skip two bosses in the SNES version. Pitfall hasn't been TASed before, who knows why, but it certainly deserves a TAS, so here it is.

	"After finally finishing my Sky Blazer TAS, I decided to grab one of my other WIPs. This came to mind first since I just verified an SDA speedrun of the same game. I had everything planned, knew the mechanics well and I had the first stage done. It took me four days to finish the rest of the game.

	"It wasn't terribly hard to get this movie optimized. Also it can be optimized only to a certain point, because every second frame doesn't accept input at all. One could call it a frame rule, because this movie couldn't be improved by 1 or 3 frames, but 2 or 4, for example.

	"You may notice I whip the air often. Its purpose is to cut the high jumps or to prevent falling animation. The boss fights may look a bit bad, but it was necessary to waste time in order to manipulate the bosses' actions.
