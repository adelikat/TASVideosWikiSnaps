	"i will now explain some of the match details, this game has 48 chars and i decided to use the most interesting:
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"A groove sakura and bison are classic competitive chars that have the strongest A groove combos, this is normal for competitive so i didn't show too much of it, A groove has custom combo which allow for infinite juggles and cancels while the meter is active
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"EX groove is an unlockable that allows to select other groove's super meters and combine with other groove's mechanics as well.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"For exgroove 1, i chose S groove meter, which allows for infinite level1 supers while in low health. Combined with other mechanics like super cancel, which actually belongs to P groove, you can cause unintended combos which are the basis for the many infnite combos in this game.Having infinite super by itself does not cause infinites, but canceling out of these supers and whiffing the supers is one of the ways you can make them infinite. The other way is to have the super by itself cause juggles.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Ryo Kyosuke Benimaru are S meter Abusers. Kim Kaphwan as well but he needed to level 3 to juggle at first. Benimaru cancels into his GRAB SUPER which misses but has whiff animation short enough to allow for more combos.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"For exgroove 2, i chose C groove, which allows for level 2 supers. Level 2 supers are the ONLY supers in the game which can be CANCELED OUT OF and therefore make it the more distinct meter to be used and allow for some more elabote 100% in combination with the other mechanics like super cancel and chain combos from EX groove.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Athena has some 100% combos with this but they would take some setup which might look very ugly. Also i prefer showing off Kyosuke from Rival Schools.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Iori uses S meter for infinite super and can only combo his fireball super from supercancel shoryuken, normally unavailable to S groove. He has a glitch in which the fireball super usually has a timer to keep the enemy frozen, but infinitely redoing the super initiates the timer all over again.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Boxer or Balrog as he's named in this version has a Turn Around punch special move which is done by holding and releasing buttons,, it takes around 40 seconds to the FINAL punch, the character actually voices the version of the punch which he's using.  Raiden dropkick also has this property but i charged it less to not kill and make the TAS more dynamic than waiting 40 seconds again.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Rolento has an infinite against tall characters, he has command jump to cancel his moves which allows for more.
	$LF

	"Kyo Kusanagi is my favorite character in the game, EXgroove has 100% routes for many combos, but i decided to show off one with the aragami OTG supercancel. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Hibiki is a character i played very little, but she has 2 level 3 supers, i could have killed in one combo with her but i wouldn't be able to show some extra moves from her like counter and super 3 ending.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Kyosuke has 2 infinites and i showed off both infinite juggle with lightning super into super jump combos into super cancel and air supers into followup into air supers infinite. I decided to show off his level 3 with Rival Schools chars which is more interesting
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"I showed of all Shin Akuma supers and his exclusive counter move in this game as well. I didn't want to make this any longer, i supposed i could have cut arcade mode and put some more exhibitions if you prefer.
