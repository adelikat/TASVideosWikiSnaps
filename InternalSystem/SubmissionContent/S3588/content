[div class=p 
	"-When flying, the most efficient way to conserve wing power is to periodically stop flying, fall for exactly three frames, and then start flying again. If you do this the right number of times, you will travel farther than you would by letting your wing power run out normally. This is used multiple times throughout the run to cross large gaps and get Firebrand to affix himself higher up on walls than he would have normally. -If you try jumping off a wall while holding in the direction of the wall, you temporarily lose control of Firebrand while he jumps up. If, however, you jump off a wall without holding the D-Pad, or while holding the opposite direction of the wall, you never lose control of Firebrand and can immediately pull him back towards the wall. This allows you to climb up walls MUCH more efficiently. By my own research, the most efficient climb pattern is to keep rapidly jumping off, getting back on, jumping off... (once every 9 frames.) -Firebrand seems to walk more slowly on ramps, so I save some frames by jumping off at the first possible instant. -If you fly up to just the right height beneath some platforms, like the tree branches, and then let go of the jump button, Firebrand will pop to the top of the platform faster than you would have normally. -As in many other platform games, jumping before falling down a pit gets you to the bottom faster than simply dropping down it. -At around frame 2950, allowing myself to get hit by the enemy here causes me to be pushed through the branch and to the right. -The boss fight is the best improvement to this stage. For most bosses, the best strategy is to get as close as possible and rapid fire.

	"-The overworld has random enemy encounters, but as in the published run, I manipulate the RNG to avoid them by simply waiting an extra frame prior to where there would be a random encounter. -In many of the overworld fights, including this one I saved time by allowing myself to take damage in order to defeat the enemies quicker. -The first huge improvement of the TAS is that, amazingly, it's not necessary to get the Specter's Fingernail, which the game seemingly requires you to obtain to cross the bridge.
	$LF
	"BRIDGE 1
	$LF
	"-Again, it's possible to cross this initial obstacle without increasing your jump height, by getting on JUST the right height pixel and then jumping off. -However, as a result of your weaker jump, you do have to wait a little bit for the columns of fire to pass, and you end up taking a bit of damage from the spikes at the level's end.

	"-This level gets trickier without the Fingernail, but it's worth the time saved. -The floating vase-shaped platforms are tricky, because their movement is very touchy. Depending on where they are relative to Firebrand on a particular , they can move in the direction you want, or the opposite. Here, I wait for the right frame before hopping up, so the vase goes right instead of left. -At certain points, I'm able to actually pass through the platforms by jumping off of them, then immediately pulling back towards them. This doesn't always work. -This boss fight could definitely be improved. Try as I might to manipulate its direction, I couldn't seem to avoid getting hit by the enemy's attack without taking significant time to avoid it. As a result, I think I did worse than the published run here. -At the very end, when the level exit opens up, I save a little bit of time by being in midair beforehand.

This made me realize the walls could be climbed quicker. The publisher of this glitched run on NicoNicoDouga which first showed me that it was possible to cross the large gap without items (among other tricks): http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm11744808
