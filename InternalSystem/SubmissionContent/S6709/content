	"Higurashi When They Cry (ひぐらしのなく頃に, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, lit. When the Evening Cicadas Cry) is a murder mystery visual novel series produced by 07th Expansion. Its DS remake, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kizuna, has four parts. This movie of the first part, "Tatari", aims to get to either one of the endings ASAP. In particular, Onikakushi-hen ending, which is arguably the default, is reached.
