	$LF
	"My main goal in all my movies is entertainment, bottom line.  The goal was to make SMW be as entertaining to watch as I possibly could.  It is NOT a speed run, then again it's not unnecessarily slow either.  I move through the level as fast as I can, while making the movie as entertaining as I can.  I understand this is not the kind of movie you guys usually do, but I thought I would throw it out there and see what people thought.  It IS my very first movie.  I tried to make it very sleek and professional, but again very pleasant to watch.  I will never take any hits in any of my movies, I absolutely hate that in a speed run, even if it saves time.

	"Making of the movie:

	"The final run actually went quite smoothly.  The re-record count is a bit deceiving as I completely started over Many times, redoing levels that I felt I could have done more with.  I hope that people will like the result.  I feel there is a lot of potential in "style" movies that has yet to be tapped.  I hope more people will start making them as I feel that they are the most entertaining to watch.  Since you guys only take .smv files I had to start from the beginning, and do the best I could with the levels I was given.  The movie goes through 2-1 which I feel is the most enjoyable to watch of the movie.

	"I suppose the best way to shortly describe this is a pseudo-speed run made to be as smooth and entertaining as I possibly could.  Speed is very entertaining, but I don't think it should go at the expense of entertainment itself.
