	"This run was made on the 128K model since it boots the fastest. I tested a run with the +2A model, but it didn't bring improved frames during input. The parsing system has a particular input delay time due to the ZX's beeper being used. You have to wait 3 frames for each press, 5 frames for each 2 presses, and 7 frames for each consecutive letter. I wanted to use shorter words for "cupboard" and "diamond" and tried them out, but shortcuts are not implemented for using items. Also, you can't carry an object while opening things, you have to drop them first.
