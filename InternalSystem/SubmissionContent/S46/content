	"Here's a movie of this game finished as fast as I could do it, the game is a side view beat'em up where you fight monsters with the help of a cursed mask in order to save your girl, besides this, the game will remind you to some megaman games XD. The play time is 16:02 and the rom used is the one that has the same name as the movie.
