	"I do this because the bonus stages is not only boring but very repetitive and takes time, about 10 more minutes if I should catch the bird on every stage. I have that version too but personally I think that is kinda boring.

	"I also tries to avoid as much points as possible since they take some time to count down at the end of every mountain. Of course I canÂ´t avoid all points since I had to kill some birds, and I had to smash blocks along my way up. Also to grab some vegetables at the start of the bonus stage were the fastest route..
