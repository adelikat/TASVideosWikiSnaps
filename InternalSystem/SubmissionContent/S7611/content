	"Battle Kid features a password system and has bonus levels that can be accessed from it. This movie aims to complete the bonus level associated with the password LIFTLUNACY. The level was added in Version 2.0, the Japanese release for Famicom, and, as its name suggests, features Lifts, a new mechanism added in the said version. Thanks to the power of frame perfect inputs, I managed to skip a few intended uses of that.
