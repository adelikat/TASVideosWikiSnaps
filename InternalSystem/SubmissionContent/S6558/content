	"Actually all movements for opponents are not fixed especially in LEVEL-8. They will react to how players move, for example, in the same frame if I take show slash they will jump but if I do medium one they will guard, etc. So, I repeatedly tried every movements - Jumping attack, ground attack, special moves, guard, run, etc. to succeed stronger attack.

	"Basically if a goal is to complete the game as quickly as possible, to use the Strong slashes repeatedly is the best strategy, however, just using normal moves repeatedly is not attractive as a movie, so I also tried to include as many special moves or combos as I can. e.g. Jumping strong slash -> strong slash -> Slicing Gust

	"In some cases the locking sword to sword movement is happened, it can't be avoidable once the stage is started even though I push any buttons, so I adjusted the timing of pushing the buttons to skip the stage introductions, as a result I could avoid this movement - If we have it, we will lose 6-7 in-game sec.

	"If in-game clear time at each stage is ranked in as Top 1-3, the record screen is shown every time. Compared to normal ones, it will take more time by around 65-70 frames (depend on the stages). So in order to avoid the losses, recommendation is to take fastest time at the 1st/2nd stage and fill out all No1-3 with the fastest time. In my movies I took 88 sec and 87 at the 1st stage vs. Kyoshiro, it's not bad, however, in some stages I took faster ones so it's not perfect. At Ukyo stage I took both 88 sec, so I tried to record another movie which is begun from Ukyo, but in that case Ukyo's movement can't be optimized and it is around 86 sec. So it is tough to identify which is the best case...

	"This movie keeps getting perfect. I also tried to confirm it is faster if I get damaged and have more POWs. If I get slashed by opponents it will have knock-back and as Wan Fu is very slow, it will take more time to be closer again. knock-back causes 2-3 in-game sec loss and it was tough to offset this delay. Will confirm more in future when I make the one w/o perfect games.

	"Not sure from which timing to which I need to measure the time, but in this movie I checked the time from the power on including Dip-Switch setting, to the timing when I skipped the Amakusa stage result, not including the name input. It seems around 46,900 frames, the time is 13:01.46, but if it's not suitable I will change the descriptions.
