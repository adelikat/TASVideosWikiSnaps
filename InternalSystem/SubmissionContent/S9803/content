	"This TAS completes the game on Hard difficulty, which means the player must descend at least 12 floors before they can face the Minotaur and grab the Tarmin Treasure. But we're not just going to do the bare minimum... no, no, no, we are descending all the way to the bottom of this dungeon! The lowest level in the dungeon you can reach is 256, after which you will wrap back around to level 1... but that isn't very interesting... I want to defeat a Minotaur and collect the Tarmin Treasure on level 256, which is arguably the hardest feat one can pull off in this game. This is because the Minotaurs get more and more powerful with each level you descend. By Level 256, the Minotaurs will start with a whopping 176-201 war level and an 88-100 spiritual level, which are some pretty daunting stats.

	"A 12x12 maze comprises each level. On Level 12 and beyond, there are two ladders per level—one will be on a random tile in the 4th north-south corridor and the other will be on the 8th north-south corridor. Now, imagine how time-consuming it would be to manually manipulate the ladders to be in convenient locations for 255 levels. And what if you wanted to test different RNG seeds? That's why this TAS would've been practically impossible without the help of a Lua script which automatically and (somewhat) optimally descends most of the levels. It works by automatically finding level layouts where the ladder is on the same tile or one tile ahead of the player. A savestate is made for each level that is descended, and if the script gets stuck in a situation where it takes too long (>100 frames) to find the next ladder, the script progressively calls back to previous levels to see if a faster solution can be found. The script can recall up to the past nine levels. When reaching the end of the corridor, the script has the player turn around. I also tried running a script which only accepted descending ladders on the same tile as the player, and another which allowed descending ladders two tiles ahead of the player, but both seemed to be slower overall.

On Medium and Hard difficulty, the Minotaur targets whichever player stamina (war or spiritual) is lower. To accurately determine which one he will target, spiritual stats need to be multiplied by two first; and in the event of a tie, the Minotaur will target your war stamina. Since most of our efforts have been invested in driving up our war defense, we will make sure our war stamina stays lower than 2x our spiritual stamina when the Minotaur attacks, so our heavily defended war stamina is targeted. Right as the Minotaur throws his war weapon, we will use our +10 War Stamina Potions to both restore and drive up our war stamina to absorb each attack.

I found that I can defeat the Minotaur slightly faster if I let him attack my spiritual stamina for the last two turns—which is honestly quite incredible I survived given how poor my spiritual stats were.
