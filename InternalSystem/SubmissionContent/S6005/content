	"You control the great French private eye Pierre Touche who is trying to capture the ringleader Henri Le Fiend and turn him over to the police. There are 4 different cases in this game and a last one, which is played here, where every evidence of the game against Le Fiend are needed to turn him to the police. (I would say it would be a "100%" but I'm not sure since the definition of 100% on the site.)

	"Each "Case" as the game manual refers to them should be acceptable as separate branches given that they are accessible completely independently of each other and have different layouts. The difficulty toggles should not be treated as separate branches however as they can be changed at any time and simply affect the controls.
