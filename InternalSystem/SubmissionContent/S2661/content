	"This is my long overdue completion of v2 that I started soon after my 
	[a class=intlink href=/1283M 
		"1st publication
	]a
	".  I took a lot of time off due to luck manipulation issues World 5.  During that time, TRT finished his movie.  Most of the content up to 5-G was done prior to his movie (but map sections edited to sync with 9.6 instead of 9.2).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Because TRT's movie is the currently published, I will compare my improvements to his movie.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This movie is 11918 frames (3 minutes 18.6 seconds) shorter than TRT's 
	[a class=intlink href=/1408M 
		"published movie
	]a
	".  Most of this, however, is due to Desmume9.6 having significantly less lag than 9.4.  It is hard to estimate the true improvement due to some improvements in the map movements I made.  However, the in-level improvements total 723 frames (12.05 seconds).  I had overall better luck on map movements too, but I have no idea how to calculate a lag-reduced value.  I don't value map manipulation improvements much anyway since the entertainment value of this game is with the levels.

			[li 
				" By running down a hill and sliding just before the bottom, you can get a speed boost.  If you hold down you can continue to get extra speed for many frames after the hill.  This is used in 1-1 and several levels in world 8

	[li 
		" Fast vertical swimming
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				"By alternating B and X for swimming, you can retain 31 vertical speed as opposed to turbo firing one of them which results in an alternating speed of 31 & 30.  It also goes so fast that the swimming sound is canceled out (which is kind of pleasant compared to the sound of turbo fire swimming).

[p 
	"Most improvements come from various strategy improvements, more corner boosts, and various optimizations.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Also, not so relevant overall, I must mention, the luck manipulation for getting the 2nd blue shell for 8-3 is ABSOLUTELY EVIL.  I spent about as many hours getting good luck there as making the rest of the TAS.  You have so many elements working against you for luck manipulation: The previous level is a boss level so no flag, you are mini-mario so no killing enemies to change the RNG, the previous level is the most brutal in the whole game to optimize, and the hammer bros appears immediately in 8-3 so nothing in 8-3 can affect what he drops.  I think TRT mentioned struggling in this spot too. Evil :|
