	"Cyclo 8 0.5 is the first version of the game Cyclo 8. It only has one level, the controls are terrible, and the physics are slightly different from the final game. This TAS aims to complete this unfinished version of the game in the least amount of in-game time possible.

	"Just like in normal Cyclo 8, the left wheel is the one that drives. So I tilt the bike backwards at the start of the level to start a wheelie, which is the fastest form of movement in this game. However, I can't maintain a wheelie for very long. Cyclo 8 0.5 doesn't have dedicated drive and brake buttons. Instead, turning with the arrow keys also accelerates the bike. This means that in order to drive forwards, I have to tilt the bike to the right, which makes it very difficult to keep the back wheel on the ground. When driving up the big slope at the start, I build up as much speed as I can while also avoiding launching the bike too high in the air. In Cyclo 8 0.5, you can actually control the bike in midair a little bit, so I keep holding right to move the bike farther forwards. After landing, I bounce in the perfect way to land flat on the platform and then I drive off into the flag.

Furthermore, the track contained in this version is but a slight variation of track 2 in the released version. Notwithstanding these facts, the physics and inputs of the game are sufficiently different to provide a different experience to the player (although not entirely for the spectator).
