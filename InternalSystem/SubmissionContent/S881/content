	"Again, this is a menu-based game like Deja-vu, but cutesy and Japanese-like, just to warn anyone who hasn't played it before.  This is quite a bit faster than my last version, because the fights were shortened (thanks to Ferret Warlord), and the menu navigation is faster all-around.  Its possible I could have missed a frame or two since the menus move at different speeds, so on each screen they have to be tested - its not just an automatic fomula I used to move the cursor around and select items.  The fighting is based on rock-paper-scissors, and guessing which direction your opponent will look.  In this movie the fights go by really fast, though, so its hard to know what's going on.  I used a slightly modified version of DTJAAAAMJS's walkthrough from gamefaqs.  I tested most of the route, and some parts that seem pointless (like going to the cave first in level 6 before getting the lamp) are part of the sequence and can't be avoided.

	[a class=intlink href=/381M 
		"Deja Vu
	]a
	" has menu possiblities; allowing you several ways to move about the game or collect items with the cursor.  This leads to interesting cursor movements in order to achieve each objective.  This almost becomes a game within a game, as the "route" for each screen must be planned.  The cursor movement in this game is just menu based; offering nothing interesting to an already dull game.  The fastest method of selecting each action is immediately obvious.  In addition, this game is about 4 times longer.
