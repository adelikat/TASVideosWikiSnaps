	"Bonk's Adventure is the first game of the Bonk series and was a major flagship title of the PC Engine/Turbografx16. It stars Bonk on his quest to rescue Princess Za and defeat the evil King Drool. He mainly uses headbutts or "bonking" to attack.

		" Flower Boosting: Bonking off a flower bud will cause you to recoil backwards at speed 7, can be combined with hovering, bouncing and damage boosts to last entire screens. For whatever reason, it only registers if you start to Bonk a flower every other frame, the other frames you will fail to connect for whatever reason.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Hovering: Actually completely intended. If you spam the attack button in midair, your vertical speed will repeatedly be reset back to 0 briefly.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Bouncing: Hitting an enemy from above with a midair Bonk will cause you to bounce off the enemy and deals double damage to it. It gives less height than damage boosting, but doesn't cost HP.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Damage boosting: Bonk will get a bunch of height off damage boosts and will maintain his previous horizontal speed. Which direction you move is dependent on what side of the enemy or projectile you get hit by: if you get hit by the left side of an enemy you move left, if right, you move right.

		" Landing on ice after doing any midair flips (even if you cancel the attack and land on your feet) will cause you to slip along the ice at speed 5 and you will not stop unless you press the opposite direction and jump which will freeze you in place for a while or simply slide off a ledge or into a slope. Usually not worth it because sliding off a ledge reduces your speed to 0 and if you need to jump you will have to wait a while but can be worth it in key situations.
