	"When I started the last cancelled TAS, it was because I discovered a new trick that makes me able to manipulate events to get the items I need. But unfortunately, I noted early on that it wasn't worth. Nonetheless, I had created a route using the Lilty class, wich has 1 more strength at start than the Selkie (used in the previous TAS). It proved to be very effective, and, saving time almost everywhere, this new run saves 64 seconds over the previous submission.

	"The route is very similar than the previous published TAS, main differences being related to the 1 strength difference. Per example, I eat more meat to get better stats. I also can skip some chest artifacts that I don't need anymore since I have enough strength. Adding to this, this TAS is simply BETTER. I improved a lot, and it shows with small optimisations here and there, some new techniques I discovered on the fly like using the monsters on the traps in Veo Lu Sluice, and bigger rng manipulated (shown mostly at the end of Kilanda).

	"The big change between this TAS and the last cancelled submission is the fact I skip master's weapon. As a consequence, I'm weaker and slower. BUT I skip taking the weapon scroll, I don't have to go to Marr's pass a second time, and I don't take mythril. My father is a merchant so I can sell him items. I answer one of his letters to make him mad, wich gets me better deals.

	"Even if it's close to be, it's never perfect. Manipulating rng costs frames, and it might always be possible to save some here and there. Still, RNG is way better in this TAS than the precedent. Also, Meteor Parasite is such a hard boss I can't imagine there's no way to make it faster.

	"I created recently a route that possibly is faster, by skipping Warrior's Weapon and tking Valiant Weapon, and manipulating an event. But for now, I'm a bit tired to TAS, I'm trying running the game RTA, so I will not test this hypothetically rout soon. I think it's important to publish this movie because, well, the last movie is old and obsolete.
