	(__wikiLink|displaytext=thread here|href=/Forum/Posts/430697)
	"), but due to real life (and lack of progress with RNG), I decided to just submit it now, on April Fools. It still technically beats all known records however. The only improvement is at the very last stage, where I managed to get Gladys to clip into a wall, saving 740 frames. Additionally, each part of the final stage was further optimized, saving another 182 frames compared to the cancelled submission.

However I needed to make him stay in a spot such that he would also clip me OoB (to avoid a spray trap at the entrance), so it was tricky.

There's also no way to push the chair down to the floor so I could grab it with Verne without using Hammy to push it beforehand.

It's intended for you to use RJ and throw Verne over then instead, then find a switch and disable the lasers. However, at the peak of RJ's jump, there's a brief period you can make it over.

For RJ, if I didn't swap to Verne right there, I'd get hit by the pepper spray, which for some reason doesn't hurt me (for this stage) when offscreen. Verne seems unable to walk past the laser fence while clipping in, so might as well hop back to RJ instead. For some reason, the kitchen was very laggy despite nothing much there.
