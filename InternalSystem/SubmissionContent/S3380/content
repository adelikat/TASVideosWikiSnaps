	"This trick is only used in the first world, where the slopes are not very steep. I learned of this trick by watching Sonikkustar's WIP of the first 2 levels. When running up a slope, if you let go of all buttons for one frame, Tinhead enters slide formation. If you immediately start moving again he will be slightly farther forward. This saves a couple of frames each time.
