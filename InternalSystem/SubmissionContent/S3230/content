	"Here's another run from me which took very long time. This time it's Bonkers. It beats the TAS by Dark Fulgore by about 75 ingame seconds. You can find his TAS either on Youtube or at speedruns.net (Note: their timing stops with the last hit. If we did the same, it's ~13:12.) Sorry, I don't have an encode ready yet.

	"This game is a great candidate for a frame war. It's incredibly difficult to optimize all the movements while minimizing lag... Just one example: In the level with the penguins, it should be possible to remove ~15 lag frames. But when I did that, one of the penguins a bit later in the level was staying at a very bad position, costing about 200 frames, so I decided to left them in. Another example: Sometimes, you need to throw bombs. If you stay on the floor, you will stop completely for that. If you're jumping while throwing the bomb, your movement speed will start to decrease. On the other hand, you need a certain height for hitting the obstacles. Another one: Getting all the necessary potions in the best possible way is also not trivial...
