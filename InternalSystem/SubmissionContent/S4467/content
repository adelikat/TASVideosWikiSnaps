	"Hi! I'm William Brown also known as LaryDLobster (don't ask why....I mean you can if you want ;) ) and this is my first ever TAS run :) I watched a TAS on awesome games done quick a while ago and I always wanted to try. I finally got around to it so I got myself and a emulator with a goal in mind, to complete Super Mario Bros. quickly (not necessarily the fastest) with Mario backwards almost the entire time (including the underwater section). Everything I did in the run I figured out on my own by playing around with the emulator and with some previous speedrunning knowledge from watching others speedrun. My run may not be the fastest as I don't particularly know all the fastest routes, but I believe it met my original goal. My favorite part is when I moon walk under Bowser (Take that Bowser!!). I hope you you guys enjoy my first TAS run and I am fully open to, actually I encourage, suggestions as to how to make the run better and faster :)

	": Hello LaryDLobster, and welcome to TASVideos. For a submission of a game by a new runner, this run actually does not look so bad in movement; I see you handle movement mostly well considering your "jump backwards" goal, with fairly little slowdown in moving towards the right, and you have some reasonably creative ideas like taking damage to save time a bit later on (although I am not entirely convinced it's faster than just slowing down a bit before the Goomba). However, it still does not make for an acceptable goal choice, and still contains some suboptimal things, with especially a very slow 4-2 strategy which I am certain would be much faster by, for instance, just using the vine. So, I am rejecting this run for bad goal choice and visible improvements.
