	"NOTE: The ROM used in this TAS is different from the previous one, which used Hook (U) (29252).  Hook (U) (29252) is now considered a beta in NSRT--Overload and I dumped our US Hook carts and both got Hook (U) (2648), which is used in this run. I only noticed one time saver that was obviously due to ROM differences: in level 4, after killing the boss, the screen

	"Hook is a somewhat slow platformer game based off the movie of the same name.  Peter Pan has grown up, and is now a successful lawyer named Peter Banning.  His children, Jack and Maggie, are kidnapped by the pirate Hook. The fairy Tinkerbell transports Peter to Neverland, where he has to go through 10 levels to save his children.

		"I minimize hovering while collecting pixie dust, because Peter Pan collects pixie dust slower if he is in a flying state. In cases where I can't simply stand on the ground, and for some reason jumping wouldn't work well, I switch in and out of a flying state. This is to take advantage of the fact that after switching out of a flying state, Peter Pan's falling speed is very slow at first.  This way I can still spend most of my time collecting pixie dust at the faster non-flying rate.
