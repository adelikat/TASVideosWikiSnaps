		" I used the same trick ziplock used to skip the scolling to 'leve; 20' and setting the speed to 'high'. You can do this by inputting your settings, en then start you're movie. The game restarts then, but the settings are still the same (if you restart the whole game the settings are back to normal). It's being discussed if this is allowed, but I'll tell you why I did it:

	"After starting a level you can't manipulate luck. The only thing that can be manipulated it the level you enter. This level has it's own order of capsules that fall... so you have to pick a level that has the viruses placed in a good way, and capsules that fit.
	$LF

[p 
	"You'll never get all the capsules you want... but you can try a lot of levels to look if it's good enough for a speedrun. Some time ago I wanted to start a speedrun of this game... and tried a lot of levels... but eventually all came to a point where the capsules didn't fit at all.

	"Ziplock had a pretty well chosen level, and so I tried a few levels using the same trick. The levels looked a lot better, and I recorded a few on 25% speed. One level was really good, so I took that one. The level I chose is an other level ziplock played.

		" The purpose of the game it to dispose of the viruses, by placing capsules. A horizontal or vertical line of the same color of either capsules or viruses, or both, that is 4 blocks or longer will disapear.

		" After I picked out my level, I played it again, and looked more carefull to find the fastest 'route'. Then I played it frame by frame to get the fastest result possible. The total length is 2 minutes and 2 seconds.

	"I chose to wait untill all capsules where placed, and pressed start to how the ending. If I would have stopped at the last capsule and let it drop by itself (like ziplock), the movie would been 2 frames shorter than 2 minutes.
