	"Fred and Barney are out there platforming, racing and throwing rocks so that Fred can become Bedrock's new Grand Poobah. Since there's nothing in it for Barney, he takes it easy and leaves all the action for his pal.

	"In this game, one throws rocks to determine the number of steps to advance on the map. I manipulate the throws and get the result I want by holding the X button. This also sends me sliding in a preferred direction on stage 3.

	"We start by going to the bonus level which has a fixed duration of 10 seconds. Fred then picks a fight with two gorillae while Barney goes to the amusement park. I finish one of the gorillae a bit slowly to get 89 on the timer and a shorter bingo sequence at the end, since this is the only area where I will end with the timer ending in 9. Then it's time for a foot race. Turboing Y keeps Fred running as fast as he can, and I jump a lot to avoid losing speed in the mud. I manipulate Betty away so that Barney can sneak past her and onward to stage 2.

	"Fred stops at the cafe, but finds out that he isn't hungry. Meanwhile, Barney decides to take a hot bath. Unfortunately, the bathing technology in the stone age isn't so advanced, so he develops a sixth degree burn. Next we see some platforming action. Jumping gradually reduces the speed, so I try to minimize the time spent jumping. But I jump at the bottom of the two slopes to get some extra speed. Then, after some maneuvering to get over the lava pit on the rock, there's another race up ahead. I use two different turning techniques here. One involves releasing the D-pad every 8th frame, and the other is more complicated but turns faster with a slightly lower forward driving speed. It consists of not pressing Y for a frame, and releasing the D-pad 8 frames later while pressing Y twice in a row and then releasing it twice before switching to turbo again and then repeating this pattern every 16 frames.

	"This stage begins with another race, this time on skates. There's nothing new here, it's a very straightforward race after I sneak past the other guy and it works just like the car race. Fred wins a hammer which he has to give to the guy standing at the beginning, and then they can go on.

	"I go to a log jumping area and an area with some rocks you have to use to get over the water, and then there is a boss. Then both Fred and Barney have to go to the bottom of the map to complete it. Barney turns around and takes the left path since there is a normal level where the boss was.

	"This map has two parts. In the first part, I go to area 4, 7 and 10. The first has a lot of waiting, but nothing can be done about that. Then there is a area with deadly rocks. I tried to zip past them, but it's impossible. The last of the bunch is a long vertical level. Once again, both Fred and Barney have to reach the end of the map to continue. I could have saved around 17 seconds of in-game time by going to area 3, 6, 8 and 11 but testing showed that it's slower in real time. In the second part, I go to area 1 and then area 4 which are the shortest ones. With some careful jumps I barely get past the rising platforms and don't have to wait for them. I get some speed from running downhill in area 1 but I can't keep it because the ceiling is too low. The game ends when both people get to the left side.
