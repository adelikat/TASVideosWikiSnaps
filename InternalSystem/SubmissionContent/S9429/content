		" Zuma is a fast-paced puzzle game developed by PopCap Games. The objective of Zuma is to eliminate all of the balls rolling around the screen along a given path, with other balls (the path is clearly visible in all of the levels except the last level), before these balls reach the yellow skull structure, which will open to varying degrees as a warning of oncoming balls. It was released on December 12th 2003.

		" Everything depends on the RNG, combos, gap bonuses and chain bonuses. I added 15 seconds at the end of the movie for encoding. Coin will sometimes appear in all of the levels (depending on the RNG) except the last level, you can collect coin to get to the point goal faster. I delay some ball shots just because I need to get the specific ball color (RNG manipulation) to continue the combo.

	": A very interesting game concept with nice music and ambientation. Here, the authors go through each of the levels in an insane pace thanks to careful placement of marbles and an almost instant destruction of the marble train. As a result, this movie is more than 20 min faster than the current
