[ul 
	[li 
		"playing the previous levels doesn't show off any new techniques or any particularly exciting features of the game
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"SIGNIFICANTLY shortens the movie (37 min versus 3:50)
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"It solves all complaints about the full run of this movie, such as the repititive nature of the game/length of movie vs enteratinment value
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Unlike many codes and level selects, this one makes the game "harder".  Starting on the most difficult level with only a basic weapon and 3 lives in generally suicide.
		$LF
	]li

[p 
	"In addition, the use of frame advance means the making the boss fight faster than the my previous run.  Frame advance also made it unneccessary to gather rapide fire power-ups.

	"The level select is done by recording 13 soft reset.  Since FCEU records from soft reset, make sure you re-open the ROM or do a hard rest prior to loading the .fcm file
