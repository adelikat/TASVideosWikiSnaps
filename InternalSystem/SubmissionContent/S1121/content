	"This is a swordless speed run of the First Quest. Because of this deliberately chosen handicap, it is several minutes longer than the existing record, and is designed to supplement rather than replace it. The movie ends when Link enters Ganon's room in Death Mountain, since there is no known method to defeat him without a sword. This run aims for the fastest possible time, and also takes no damage. The Up+A method is used regularly. The movie was produced using the re-recording version of FCEU (0.98.15).

	"The most difficult part, by far, in producing this movie was the bomb placement. I'm very satisfied with the way it turned out, though. The rate and precision with which bombs are placed could not be replicated by any human player at normal speed. Many rooms could simply be walked through while dodging the foes. For those that required battles, I used frame-advance to try different methods until I found the one that was most effective and looked best. Link definitely shows off his full arsenal of weaponry (except the sword!) in this movie.
