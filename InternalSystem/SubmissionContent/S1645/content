[div class=p 
	"There are many differences between expert and normal difficulty. There are more enemies in expert mode. Bosses move faster, fire more projectiles, and in some cases have different strategies than they do on normal. If enemies ever start blinking and become invulnerable, they do so more often. Also, all attacks are weaker. Gun attacks do about 2/3's as much damage in normal as they do in expert. Body attacks in normal do 50 damage a frame in normal while they do 20 damage a frame in expert. Also, in expert you have to fight all seven forms of seven force. In normal, it's only three.

	"The game makes some weird choices for how to deal with two players. For one, whenever they attack the damage happens every other frame, then switches back and forth. Also, two players cause a lot more lag than one player, especially when they're both firing weapons at once. I tried to minimize lag at these points but it's hard to avoid.

Since the only way he can move while shooting is to jump, sometimes it's better to use a flame chaser during fights so player two can concintrate on dodging. During Blaster Force, I have to turn around everytime he fires to make sure I'm still hitting him.

	"The first bit is autoscrolling, so I play around while jumping, and play with the ship, which has a few interesting bugs. I pause after the Swapping Reg in order to prevent tbe end of the level from becoming garbled. Smash Daisuke, the flying guy blinks everytime you body attack him, so my strategy was to attack him until he almost starts blinking and body attack right before he becomes invulnerable. Orange is the same deal, except he has a few animations which can't be interrupted and allow you to body attack.

	"Some more zooming across the stage. The cannon is a boss. If you look hard enough, you can see the numbers blinking. I actually beat the phantom without him blinking once. I'm so glad I could do that. The glitch I use during the dice palace involves throwing your partner right before you warp out. The route I use is faster because the boss fights are faster. Taking damage from Curry and Rice's head saves a lot of time.
