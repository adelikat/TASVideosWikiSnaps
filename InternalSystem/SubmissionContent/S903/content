	"Link, Fox, Mario Bros., and Pikachu-- generally uses a combination of dashing and reflector. Because of the very hard difficulty, these characters require edge guarding.

	"Yoshi, Kirby, and Fighting Polygon teams-- stays close to the ground when attacking so to save time, but sometimes it is advantageous to jump and attack (like say for the last of them). Character and pokemon spawns are manipulated through movement.

	"Samus-- because the lava rules out bottom vertical KOs (fall through glitch does not occur until around 20 seconds) and top vertical KOs take too long, damage is built up with a combo so to execute a horizontal KO.
