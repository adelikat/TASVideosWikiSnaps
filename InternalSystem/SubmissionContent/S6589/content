	" because it was rejected and sat in cold storage for seven years before it was reevaluated for inclusion in the Vault. But Tool23 submitted it on 5 October 2005, and so it would have been publication number 420 or so if it had been published back then. I figured that it would be easy to obsolete such an old and flawed movie (improved by 4788 frames / 79.7 seconds). But I didn't expect that trying to make a perfect version required nightmare-level luck manipulation.

	"There are eight essential items that the hero, Eddie Valiant, needs to collect in order to beat the game. The locations of these eight items are all “randomly” determined before the player gains control of the character. But the memory values can be manipulated using inputs during startup in order to place the items in the best possible locations. Each different input generates a new “random” memory value combination. In theory, there are 36864 potential combinations. But the ideal combination is even more difficult to get than just winning a 1/36864 lottery, because the values do not come up with equal probability.

	"In FCEUX, it’s possible to press Start as early as frame 534. But two of the ideal memory values (009 and 013) never appear together unless the Start press is delayed until frame 540. From there, the memory values can be manipulated using different input combinations up until frame 728. On frames 730-733, the memory values are established. A very large portion of the work on this TAS went into searching for a combination of inputs that resulted in getting all eight memory addresses to show the ideal values simultaneously.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"To make it more difficult, I didn’t program a bot to search for the ideal combination. I manually went through possible combinations in a systematic manner. I started with single input options on the latest possible frame and worked backward in order to maximize search speed. When none of the singles worked, I started testing double input options. Eventually, after many thousands of input variations, I found the perfect combination: pressing Up on frame 714 and A on frame 724 yielded all eight memory values that I wanted simultaneously. And those eight memory values are:

They are also used to jump over the pits in the caves, but it should be noted that it is technically possible to get through the caves without the Spring Shoes. 040 is the most difficult manipulation of the eight. It does not come up 25% of the time; it felt more like 10-12%. It is essential to use the 040 rare spawn because 040 is also the location at which Valiant buys the Dynamite. The Dynamite is another essential item, but it always is available in building 040 right at the start.

However, the reactions to this new submission were more positive and I can't completely disregard that. I also have to note how the previous judgment is about 14 years old, and I don't think that entertaining responses can be really compared when they have such a large timespan difference, as the community has undoubtedly grown and changed in the meantime. I also enjoyed watching this movie myself, despite not being familiar with this game, and I don't think there are doubts about optimality either. Still, I'll keep an eye on this movie for a while after publication, just to check if the ratings reflect the votes and the posts gathered while in the workbench.
