	"After my 
	[a class=extlink href=http://bisqwit.iki.fi/nesvideos/243S.html rel=nofollow 
		"last submission
	]a
	" over a year ago, I have decided to pick this game back up and do it right.  I have taken advantage of the previously overlooked warps and amulet (which allows Plok to turn into a sawblade, essentially one-hit killing Fleas), and have made speed a number one priority.  To accomplish this I have avoided as many shells as possible before getting the amulet.  If the Plok meter reaches full capacity it will cause a "Bonus Plok" which wastes 198 frames (3.3 sec).  When the amulet is used it expends shells, so there is no longer a need to purposefully avoid shells.  Damage is taken to save time, which includes taking damage to avoid shells, and to jump higher while still being able to shoot limbs (especially useful for boss battles).  Luck was manipulated to cause Flea eggs to land where I intended.  Thanks to frame advance, ledge-to-ledge jumps are pixel perfect, shots are taken as soon as possible and never missed, and programming errors are abused (such as passing through spikes in Silent Running).  ...I don't "wobble".
