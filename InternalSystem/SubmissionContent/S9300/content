	"the best version of this game for speedrun is PC, so i lose time in the boss challenge after i clip when doing full spins to make glitched laps, the reason is you can make ABSURDLY SHARPER turns in PC version so PC gains time after you need to spin around laps, Saturn version is horrible for 100% because of item collection rules in that version.

The chosen category (100%) requires getting all chaos emeralds (obtained by winning races and their associated 'challenges') and unlocking all characters. The author abuses out-of-bound techniques and achieves a faster time than that of the current
