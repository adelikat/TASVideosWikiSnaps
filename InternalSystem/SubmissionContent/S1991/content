	"Well folks, here it is, TASVideos first Sextuple TAS :) After I had finished about a year ago the Quadruple TAS with my dear friend Baxter, I felt I needed to do this to satisfy my curiosity. I decided to finish only 1 stage in each game because obviously you cannot slide in Mega Man and Mega Man 2. Mega Man and Mega Man 2 are much shorter games compared to the others. Mega Man and Mega Man 2 are 15-20 minute runs while the others are around the 30-minute range. So by the time I've finished Mega Man 3-6, the viewers would see 2 blank screens for several minutes, which is in my opinion bad. Also, this run is meant to be 
	[b 
		"demo run
	]b
	". My initial aim was to finish all 6 bosses at the same time/frame so that it looks entertaining. However, as I progressed I realized that that goal became more and more unrealistic. You could fool around a lot of time so that other Mega Mans can catch up but I felt wasting so many seconds to satisfy my initial goal was a bit too much if you ask me. So, I revised my goal and aimed to finish all games as close as possible at the same time. In order to fully understand what the heck is going on, do 
	[b 
		"not
	]b
	" focus your eyes on any game. Instead, try to watch the center of your monitor. When I did this, I somehow felt it was easier to follow the progress than the Quadruple run, you decide! Anyway, to replay this run, follow these steps:

		$LF

	[li 
		" Enable Background Input (at config), if it was already enabled when FCEU started, disable it first, and enable it again (it will automatically enable Run In Background).
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Load the same movie file at all FCEU's (note that it will only give a correct ROM checksum for one of the games so do not worry about it).
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Unpause (with a hotkey... background input will make all games unpause at the same time) and enjoy!
