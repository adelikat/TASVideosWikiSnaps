	"Tempo is a platformer on the Sega GameGear. To complete each level a yellow keynote must be collected that unlocks the exit sign. Tempo is quite fast during his dash state, which is performed with a double tap in the direction you want to dash. Tempo can also flutter, hovering without getting tired until gravity eventually brings him to the floor.

[div class=p 
	"The main problem to overcome in Tempo is that enemies constantly block Tempo's path, interupting Tempo's ability to dash. Tempo has several attacks to deal with enemies. Tempo can land on enemies, roll into them when dashing or roundhouse kick them. Tempo also has a musical note attack that only stuns normal enemies but does damage bosses like the other attacks.

[div class=p 
	"Every time Tempo jumps, it needs to be jump cancelled by performing a flutter or musical note attack because Tempo jumps too high, overshooting every platform. Tempo won't land unless he's in a downward fall so the jumps are cancelled a pixel higher than each platform. Tempo also takes 2 frames to land and no inputs will make him move in this state. Most enemies will knock Tempo into the air after being defeated, so these also need to be jump cancelled. Some rolling collisions can be cancelled almost immediately, allowing Tempo to initiate a dash right away. There are sad wilted flowers in each level that serve as checkpoints. Being in the vicinity of these flowers slow Tempo considerably and unless Tempo is already moving fast enough through this area, it saves time to activate them before dashing.

One of the bees in the first level is despawned by performing some jumps where Tempo bonks his head and jumps immediately again to set its position. The bee flies off the bottom of the map and despawns.

It can alternately shoot a tadpole note that will turn into a smaller frog. Unlike the first boss the Frog can be hit and take damage while flashing. The 5th and 6th hits all occur while the Frog should technically be in iframes from the 4th hit and the 8th hit likewise after the 7th.

This is the only spot in the run where ducking is needed to save time.
