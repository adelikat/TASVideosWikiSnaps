	"First of all, I use VBA19 because VBA20 sucks monkey fleas for TASing GB-games. Not the fact that it count frames like a drunk 8-year old, but the fact that it messes up the graphics when state saving (Rendering frames ahead and stuff). I posted about this in the VBA-forums but got no response so I decided to use VBA19 where I won't have to go insane and quit TASing because of a stupid emulator. Thank you for your understanding.

	". It has basically the same route (The only real difference is when getting all the beams) as the previous run, so all frames are gained by optimized movements, Metroid-fights, missile-planning etc. Just like the previous run, this one collects all beams in the same area rather than collecting them along the way.
