	"Here is The Adventures of Captain Comic completed 32 frames faster than the published movie. This game kinda sucks. It also provides very little from a speedrunning perspective. Your character simply moves straight through levels while shooting enemies. Very little gets in your way to prevent you from constantly walking in a straight line, so optimizing this game isn't very impressive or particularly difficult. I did manage to find a couple of frame savings over Randil's movie, though, which are basically all related to controlling Captain Comic's velocity better. Ocasionally, trees/walls are too tall to clear without bumping into them. If you bump into the wall, you lose all your speed, and must accelerate again. Not touching these walls are the way to go, and this accounts for most of the savings. (Occasionally, the wall will be so high up that you'll have touched the ground as you land, saving no frames.)

	"There is some mild luck manipulation in this TAS. By jumping, enemies will spawn above you. In certain levels, this is useful, because it means they will spawn on a higher platform and won't hurt you. There is also a glitch, used at the end of the movie. By using the teleporter on the right frame, you can insert yourself in a wall, and jump up through it, allowing us to reach the final item faster. This glitch can technically be done anywhere, but it only saves time at the end of the game. Oh, and by the way, there is no speed penalty for using the teleporter, it's the exact same speed as walking.
