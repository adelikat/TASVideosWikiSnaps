	"By the end of the 4th stage Boss battle, a total of 17 frames had been improved. However, due to the existence of a 32 frame rule for 5-2 Boss to launch attacks, all 17 frames improved were invalid. I re optimized my luck and ultimately improved 7 frames

	": With 13 previous publications, It amazes me to see this game go even further. I hate it that there is such a large frame rule that negated your efforts. I've certainly run into those kind of issues before. Nevertheless, everything checks out here and I congratulate you this discovery!
