	"Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles is an action role playing game developed by The Game Designers Studio and published by Square Enix in 2003 for the Nintendo GameCube. This was the first Final Fantasy game to include real-time fighting, which has since become a staple of Final Fantasy games. It was also the first Final Fantasy game to be published on a Nintendo console since Final Fantasy VI on the SNES.

	"You play as a caravanner, trying to beat dungeons to collect myrrh drops to be able to sustain your village's crystal energy, which protects the villagers from the mortal effects of the miasma. In this run, you go out as a Yuke, a race of mages, to go explore the whole world and beating every boss in the game to cleanse the world of all miasma corrupted monsters.

	"This is my third TAS of this game, and third time on this category. I chose this category because with All Dungeons, we can see more of the game, the different dungeons and the bigger picture of the overworld. In any%, you do almost the same thing but you skip longer dungeons, which I don't skip here. Also, I do glitchless because the only glitches known in this game are multiplayer exclusive.

	"Final Fantasy is my favorite game of all time, even if it's mostly nostalgia. Here, you go on an epic quest to discover characters and cities, new stories unfold and there is sidequests offered to you along the way. Unfortunately, in this run, I skip most of it. In this game, the fastest way to beat it is to get to the last dungeon, wich is blocked by a miasma wall. The only way to pass it is to get the unknown element in the Lynari Desert, which is only accessable at year 5. You have to collect 3 drops of myrrh to complete a year, wich means I have to beat 12 dungeons before even being able to get to the last boss, 13 if we count reviving the flowers in Veo Lu Sluice to rise up the river to even get there. I do all 14 single dungeons in this game, and I also do a revisit of River Belle Path to get a necessary drop.

	"I chose to play the Yuke, because he is not only the fastest caster, but his casts are even faster than autoattacks. Not only that, but spells are way more flexible and fusions can offer some great gameplay to beat boss easily. Also, with this race, I skip having to buy equipment, instead I focus on getting good artifacts to gain magic power. Since it's a TAS, I dont have to worry that much about my defense either since I can manipulate rngs all I want.

	"You choose, after each dungeon, an artifact that will give you permanent bonuses. In my case, I obviously the ones helpful for my magician. There is 2 ways to get artifacts: with points, or by dropping them inside the dungeon. The game works on a global timer, so each frame dungeons get a different seed wich affects bonus points conditions and ennemy drops (in the first room). The best way to manipulate what you want is to wait frames before entering a dungeon or a zone. It's also the same strategy I do after beating bosses to get the good set of artifacts I want. You also gain bonus points by killing ennemies and picking up things. It is important to know that my magical power only grow each multiple of 5. So most of the time I try to get to the higher one, with fruits and droppable artifacts. We start with 15, and we will be at the last boss with 76.
	$LF

	"Money is also something important in this game, to pay the boat's fee. It costs me a total of 1200 gils, 2200 if I want to do a dialogue skip of 1 second. I got just over 1200 with all the money I dropped, and the items I sold to my merchant dad.

	"You will all be happy to know I really improved since my last runs. This game use TAS imputs to double the number of directions. It gives a new smoother movement, and a better feel when it's watched. This run takes more time moving and playing inside the dungeons, and less time battling repetitive bosses, wich is a plus. Also, I put every tricks I know and discovered to make a pleasant smooth watch.
	$LF
	"Unless new tricks and routes are found, it's pretty much the best I can do. With better rng and maybe better movement some places, I could shave some little seconds. I'm proud and happy of this result.
