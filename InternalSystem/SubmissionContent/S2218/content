	"I was going to do an obscure Japanese psx game just so the encoding of it would be imposable but I couldn't find Heiwa Parlor! Pro Lupin Sansei Special. I was going to do the kickass game Pepsiman as an alternative but I got busy with other things and didn't finish it in time so I just submitted this run I did for fun a couple weeks ago.

	": 15 seconds for one fight, no matter how well done, doesn't seem like much of a movie. A publishable version of this game will likely focus on entertainment, opposed to speed, as most of the other runs of fighting games has done. Sorry, I'm rejecting this, but I look forward to a version that contains more than one fight.
