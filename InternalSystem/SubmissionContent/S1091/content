	"This game doesn't seem very suitable for a TAS.  It is slow paced & there is little to offer in terms of interesting routes, suprises, or elements that make a good published run.  Refer to the

	"This run does show good improvement over the previous version.  It shows that you are learning the tools and getting better at TASing.  I encourage you to keep it up :)  Again, refer to the guidelines to learn about features such as frame advance and other things to help you perfect your movies.  Post a short WIP in the forums.  This will allow you to get feeback from others.  They may see places than can be improved and help you get acquainted with TASing.
