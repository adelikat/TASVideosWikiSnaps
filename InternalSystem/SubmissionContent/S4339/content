	"It's mating time in the land of armadillos and one horny red male armadillo looked for a female armadillo it could mate. It shall not be an easy task for the armadillo to find a partner to breed, because their species are threatened by extinction. The armadillo needs to travel, roll and swim though the US to find just one female armadillo somewhere captured in a zoo in New York. One rival male armadillo makes the life of the armadillo features in this game very hard, it's a giant, blue, masculine, genetic manipulated armadillo, why else would an armadillo that big and blue. Shockingly the blue armadillo even uses a self-built robot to try killing its rival, it can even talk. While the red armadillo only can talk, just a few words, but it is able to manipulate a extraterrestrial species for its porpuses. The armadillos might be genetic manipulated by those aliens. Not only makes the blue armadillo the life hard for the red armadillo to find a female armadillo to mate, but also it needs to fight natural enemies, which includes a pig, obviously pigs eat armadillo flesh. But most important is that all armadillos are wearing hats.
