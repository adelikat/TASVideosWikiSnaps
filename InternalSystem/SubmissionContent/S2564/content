You are armed with limited flying ability, an arsenal of music note projectiles, kicking, and a groovy set of dance moves!  You fight your way through 7 worlds before defeating the evil boss and save the chick.  Along the way you will find  many opportunities to meet female bugs and do a groovy dance.

		$LF
	]li
]ul
[div class=p 
	"When doing a regular jump, you can rapidly alternate Left and Right to freeze Tempo into his spinning animation.  When stuck in this animation, Tempo will spin his way right through the floor!  This is a mega time saver that is used in numerous levels.  Most noteably is Stage 2 of the Jungle Performance where the end of the level happens to be right below the start.

	[li 
		" High Speed Head Bump
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[div class=p 
	"This trick again involves alternating Left and Right.  When doing a dashing jump, if you bump your head on a ceailing it stops your momentum and returns you to walking speed.  If you alternate Left and Right just before the head bump, you will retain full dashing speed as you spin towards the ground.  This is used throughout the movie to save time

		" Shaft Zipping
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[div class=p 
	"Ouch! I mean, this trick is used on vertical shafts that Tempo climps up.  If you do a dashing jump, then flick a music note just before entering the shaft, you will zip up the shaft.  This is used several times throughout the movie, including the room before the final boss.

		" Head Glitch
		$LF

]ul
[div class=p 
	"Every boss has a floating head that falls down at a specified point in time.  On later bosses (after boss 3) a glitch can occur with this floating head.  If you defeat the boss, then get the head, it will do Tempo's "got head" dance.  This will override the usual (long) boss end animation and end the fight much sooner.  When used this can save 10-15 seconds.

I could NOT avoid the big music note at the end (the one that slowly gives Tempo full health); seriously, I did everything I could.  It looks ugly but it is the only choice.

Backtracking through the bedroom is in order to get the key from the bug.  Passing by the lights in order to make it dark was required.

The level normally has Tempo run all around and teleport to various places only to get to the level end which is right below the start.  Here I floor glitch at the beginning, then end the level.  A good 5 seconds or so of level!  Probably 1-2 minutes were saved here.

	"I go through so many doors so quickly that most of this level is black screen!  The long room with the inside pool & frogs has to look that way.  You can NOT do a dashing jump on a frog because it bounces you immediately on contact.  You can't run in water either.  So I can only get running speed on that first jump.  I maximize it with the High Speed Head Bump however.
