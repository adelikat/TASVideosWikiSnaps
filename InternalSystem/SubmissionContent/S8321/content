	$LF
	"My analysis started when both initiated the game with "Start". Noticed areas that this TAS was getting ahead slightly, and then would loose that lead. This went back and forward a bit, until the very end where the WR wins by about 2 seconds.

[div class=p 
	"Now that I have seen the problems with this run, I am now noticing the way this TAS was created. It shows signs of being recorded with a controller, using save-states to go back and correct errors. There is no doubt that this TAS can show improvements, using the TAS Studio Editor, where tons of "mashing" was observed.

[ul 
	[li 
		"The submission area is not for experimental runs. We do have a WIP / User File area for that. If you want feedback on them, that area is safe from scaring your profile with rejections.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Stating that a run is not perfect, means that you should still hold on to it and give it more time. I can tell you from experience, that you will reap amazing satisfaction from putting a lot of work into a run. The end result will be rewarding.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"The TASing tools go way beyond the ability to create highly optimized movies over manual recording. Please look into the tool..."TAStudio Editor". This is where you can edit your movie file...frame by frame.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"There are often questions asked, and comments made on submissions. I've noticed that you haven't responded to any statements or questions. This is also a red flag for rejections, as sometimes responses can clear up problems that the community members may have.

	]li
]ul
[div class=p 
	"I don't want to sound discouraging, but you need to do a lot more work before submitting these. As it stands, I cannot accept this...especially since our rules state that any TAS must beat ALL known existing times, which this TAS does not.
