In normal gameplay, you get 10 * (1 + currentLevel) points for destroying a fish or an enemy sub, 50 * currentLevel points for each diver you rescue, and 10 * (1 + currentLevel) * your remaining oxygen when you rescue the divers.  After reaching level 8, using the No-Despawn glitch, I collide with a sub for 3 minutes until I reach the maximum score of 999999.

	"There are 4 separate depths that divers swim at.  Generally, you must collect divers from all 4 depths before being able to spawn divers from the first depth again.  For example, if you collect a diver at depth #2, you must collect divers from the three other depths before spawning a diver at depth #2 again.  This detail limits the efficiency with which you can collect divers, and significantly impacts the routes I take.

	"Normally, when you collide with a fish or enemy sub, the enemy despawns immediately, and your sub despawns 35 frames later.  However, by colliding with an enemy in a special way, you are able to prevent the enemy from despawning, which keeps your sub's despawn timer from completing.

[p 
	"In this case, you get 10 + 10 * currentLevel points for every frame you are in contact with the enemy, for currentLevel <= 8.  For example, if you perform the glitch on level 4, you receive 50 points for each such frame.

[p 
	"We can use an equation to model the number of frames it would take from each level to reach 999999, if x is the current level and y is the frame estimate.  Note that we only need the integer part of x:

	"Using this method, it takes 4 minutes and 39 seconds to reach the maximum score of 999999.  At this point, the enemy swims away (without ever despawning), and the kill screen is shown.  In the kill screen, the "Activision" text at the bottom is replaced with "Copyright 1983", though you never actually die.  This is the same behavior as when you reach 999999 by means of normal gameplay.

In level 8, I don't need to collect any divers, so I don't kill any extra in level 7.

	"In this level, my goal is to hit the correct point at the back of a right-to-left sub quickly.  By returning to the surface with only 1 diver, I can cause the fish to swim faster, which will let me trigger NDG sooner.  Frame 5870 is the soonest I can surface, or else the enemy sub that I use for NDG will spawn from the left side of the screen instead of the right, which I do not want.  This is why the fish turn green before leaving the screen on level 8.
