	"This was one of the first games to get released onto the SVC-1000 console, which was SEGA's first attempt at a home console, released the SAME DAY as the Famicom. The game plays similarly to Kung-Fu on the NES, wherein you ascend a tower while fighting hoards of bad guys and bosses. This game, however, presents you with mazes of floors you must navigate in order to reach each boss. After completing a level, the maze gets more complex and another boss is added, until level 5, when the game begins looping.
