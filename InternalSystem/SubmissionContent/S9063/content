When you try to attract to a rail or a metallic platform, if Billy detects it, he will start moving towards it at an increasing speed, and remember how stopping attraction will convert your current speed into running speed? Well, this applies even when you haven't fully attracted to the rail, this means you can start moving at very high speeds without wasting much time. There is a caveat, which is that this attracting speed on rails has a variable cap that maximizes at 580 speed, but this only applies to rails, since for some reason, metallic platform don't have this limit, meaning you can practically go as fast as you want. The reason why this glitch is so useful is that it opens a branch of other glitches, so many in fact that it has its own segment.

This can be used for many thing, it can be used to increase or decrease your height without losing any speed, allowing you to make some pretty absurd distances. However, touching a wall will make you start attracting back to the rail you were supposed to be attracting to. Also, I kinda lied in the Attraction speed section because all of the following glitches actually happen because of this trick, not Attraction speed. However, since you can only do Attraction disassociation at higher speeds, Attraction speed is absolutely necessary.

You either snap to the part below the floor and lose all your speed, or start moving horizontally at a rapidly increasing speed until you get out of the wall and lose all your speed again. The way your speed increases in the latter is interesting because you can either end up close to the wall or very far way from it, depending by how many units you moved in the last frame.

After some Double jumps, I reach the first rail, which I use to get a speed of 444. I then do the same thing again on a later part of the rail to get a speed of 500. After some more movement, I become jammed in another rail and reach the speed of 580, I actually need that speed in order to perform the next glitch.

After some movement, I land on the platform close to the metallic platform's path and start attracting in place, this is going to increase the radius of my attraction shield. After increasing the radius to the maximum size and walking right, I start attracting to the platform, increasing my speed to the absurd value of 1120 units per frame.
