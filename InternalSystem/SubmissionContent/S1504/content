I wrote a program that converts a text file containing the notes to play and append the appropriate input onto the end of an fmv file. Due to frequent nesmock use, you'll have to specify acc=8 and bc=0 in the FCEU movie playback dialog, as this information was lost.

	"The program I wrote is fairly simple, and also very unsafe due to lack of time to clean up the bleeding edges. The format is simple. It loads the file and looks for an integer, then two characters. The integer represents how long it will play the note (due to many botched-up chainsaw surgeries done on the code, it does not actually correspond to a number of frames, but comes pretty close), and the two characters represent what notes to play (A, B, C, c, D, E, F, G, or anything else for nothing). The two notes are played at the "same time" by rapidly alternating between them. One note is sustained with a simple auto-fire.

		"The same concept used to play two notes could probably be extended to three or even four notes, but the more notes you do, the less "at the same time" they sound. Besides that, it's more trouble on the person composing the textfile because every available note that isn't being played is another x that needs to be manually typed out.

	[li 
		"It's probably possible to make the single notes sound a bit better by using a two or three frame auto-fire, but this would have made writing the program more difficult.
