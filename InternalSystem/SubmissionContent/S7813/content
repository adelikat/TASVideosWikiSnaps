	"Refresh is the feature web browsers have, as well as Adobe Flash Player, and the game stores your progress in both cases, so it's a legitimate feature of the platform, similar to soft Reset on consoles. But abusing that feature makes it basically unwatchable, because all you see is very few unskippable cutscenes, and the game's startup sequence for 20 times. Though since Refresh is not a glitch, using it is a Standard any% goal, and avoiding it is Alternative-only. Good thing that this game is incredibly entertaining on its own, I don't even need to ask for viewer feedback on this one! It's hilarious and awesome!
