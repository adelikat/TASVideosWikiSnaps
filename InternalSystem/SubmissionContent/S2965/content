	"To understand Linus Spacehead's Cosmic Crusade, it helps to understand the first Linus Spacehead game and the kinds of games CodeMasters was known for.  CodeMasters was a British game company that started out coding games for early budget home computers such as the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, the Amstrad CPC, and the Commodore 64.  Many games in that period were notorious for their difficulty, where platformers would quickly deplete the player's lives with one-hit kills on the many precision jumps throughout.  When CodeMasters started coding for the Nintendo Entertainment System, this unforgiving style of game design was carried over into some of their early releases such as Quattro Adventure and The Fantastic Adventures of Dizzy.  Linus Spacehead was one of the games on the Quattro Adventure 4-in-1 compilation, a simple but challenging platformer wherein a space alien who looks strikingly like a human boy in a superhero outfit must journey from where he crashed in the depths of the sea all the way up to the top of the sky in order to send a faster-than-light radio signal to call for a ride home, all set to strange randomized background music.

[p 
	"But it was Dizzy that was CodeMasters' real claim to fame in their early years, a game series which employed a combination platformer-adventure element: Rather than merely find objects and search for the places they belong, Dizzy had to find objects and dodge baddies and perform tricky jumps to reach the places they belonged.  Many of CodeMasters' other early games copied that success with similar platforming-fetch-quest combinations, and so it was that Linus Spacehead was given a sequel that would turn it into a true action-adventure.  And why not?  Linus Spacehead had already borrowed concepts from Dizzy such as riding bubbles and sinking through clouds!  But where Dizzy did platforming and adventuring at the same time, Linus Spacehead's Cosmic Crusade segregated the game styles so that "arcade" areas with levels reminiscent of the original Linus Spacehead were gateways between "adventure" areas where Linus was indirectly controlled by a roaming cursor, with commands and an inventory in the style of SCUMM.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"It's only in the arcade areas that Linus can die, and so they can end the game of any player who was doing all right in the adventure areas but doesn't have enough platforming skills.  But in the vein of The Guardian Legend, once an arcade area is completed, it never has to be entered again; the player can then move between the two adventure areas freely, only having to watch a scene of Linus running that route on the planet map.  This calms the gameplay down until the player figures out how to unlock the next area.  A password system in the adventure areas allows players to easily continue their games after switching off the system or after losing all their lives, as after a Game Over the game will automatically enter the last password received on the Password entry screen.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"So what's our hero up to this time?  Well, Linus has returned to his home planet of 
	[em 
		"Linoleum
	]em
	", where he finds that no one believes his story of discovering the planet Earth.  Actually this doesn't make much sense to me, since we saw Linus get a ride from the moon, so you think he would have said "Hey, check out that planet I escaped from!  It's full of advanced life!  Let's swing by for a closer look!"  And depending on which manual you read, Linus either saw a sign post pointing out Earth, or he read about it in his guidebook, so I wonder how much of this "legendary undiscovered planet" business is a retcon.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Anyway, although the game doesn't spell any of this out for you when you first turn it on, Linus's goal is to get off Linoleum with a new car and a camera so that he can revisit Earth and bring back proof and maybe entertain dreams of being a world-famous explorer, starting with nothing but his birth certificate.  He has to visit many places both on-world and off-world and solve many object puzzles to reach his destinations.  I would say the puzzles are easy enough that children could enjoy the game, but I have to wonder what kind of children's game has the hero gambling all his money, buying someone else's driver's license off the black market, and stealing parts to build a missile, not to mention giving the impression that "icing sugar" has anything to do with actual ice.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"And so I decided that this game was fun and varied enough for a tool-assisted perfect play.  While Linus doesn't have any fancy moves, the platformers are still exciting because of all the close calls due to Linus's weak jumping ability, and the general adventure is interesting due to the route planning and item management, plus I get to whip the cursor around whenever I'm waiting for Linus to catch up.  Now I already discussed this a lot on 
	[a class=intlink href=/Forum/T/9755 
		"the game's topic

[h4 
	" Why I chose this version
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"CodeMasters is a multi-platform game developer, and Linus Spacehead's Cosmic Crusade was chosen to lead their action-adventures onto 16-bit platforms like Sega Genesis alongside Fantastic Dizzy.  In the process of making numerous ports, the game was updated in various ways and given the new name Cosmic Spacehead, just as Fantastic Dizzy was an update of Fantastic Adventures of Dizzy.  Most of the same changes were made in a later NES version which I believe was only released in Europe.  The first superficial differences are that Linus was given the new name Cosmic, and he was given a new look for the consoles that would support it, going from this:

	]img
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I think this guy looks kinda silly in the action stages with his big new sprite when the enemies weren't redrawn to match the new style at all, only given a bit more shading.  (Fantastic Dizzy took the opposite approach and made everyone 
	[em 
		"but
	]em
	" Dizzy larger, so as to give them all cute cartoon eyes.)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There was a new 2-player combat arena that was largely irrelevant to the rest of the game.  The "16-bit" systems also had the graphics completely redone for the adventure towns, with a new art style that exaggerated the alien cartoonishness even more, dedicating more space to the floor than the sky so Cosmic would now move up and down across the open floor space.  I'm not sure the new graphics are totally an improvement; I tend to prefer the broad spaces and clear-cut corners of the 8-bit versions over the impossible angles and more outrageous coloring schemes.  The action stages couldn't be changed as much of course, but the Genesis and Amiga versions received new backgrounds that scroll differently, platforms in some places such as Formica and Linograd had their elevations changed, and when Cosmic jumps and falls the foreground scrolls away from him.  The Genesis version also adds a few more sound effects and a round window around the action areas, which I just find obnoxious.  I also think the NES versions have the best music, evoking lots of emotions, while the attempts to port it mostly made the music blander.  Basically what was impressive on NES felt mediocre on Genesis et al.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"But the real reasons for version choice in my opinion have to do with difficulty.  Linus Spacehead's Cosmic Crusade has a huge difference from Cosmic Spacehead in the platform areas as Linus still follows the physics of his original game, where once Linus jumps, he can't change his forward velocity until he lands again, which means you have to plan your jumps carefully as you can't double back.  Linus is also slipperier than Cosmic, possibly to allow for starting a jump at lower speed more easily.  And in some versions, including NES, Cosmic Spacehead jumps significantly higher than Linus Spacehead, making previously impossible jumps possible.  Finally, if you run Cosmic Spacehead on a PAL NES, Cosmic will run much faster in most of the action stages, though the rest of the game will be a bit slower as usual.  I know some will argue that the version with the greatest speed and maneuverability should be preferred, but I think it's the poor maneuverability of Linus Spacehead that makes the game more interesting to play.  Jumping over gaps and enemies has to be more precise to succeed, and finding the perfect jump speeds for when Linus needs to stop or turn back for a moment is an engaging puzzle for perfecting a TAS.  I would think that players of the original Linus Spacehead's Cosmic Crusade would be proud to see the same challenging game physics overcome in record time, rather than picking an easier version just because it's a little faster.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In some ways Cosmic Spacehead is more difficult: The passwords are now icons that can only be collected once, rather than a button code that can be used anytime.  (But in either case they also function as the Continue after Game Over, as the game inputs your last password automatically.)  In some versions the number of candies required for an extra life is bumped up to 15.  And there may be different glitches in the adventure logic.  But these are differences that shouldn't matter to a good speedrun.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Cosmic Spacehead on NES would definitely be a little faster than Linus Spacehead's Cosmic Crusade just because of some other subtle differences: The cursor can move a little faster, Cosmic runs faster on the world map view, and the first choice of command to be selected with B was changed to Use, as it is the most frequently needed one.  The 25% speed-up in the action stages in PAL mode might be enough to offset the 16% slowdown in the rest of the game too.  But some of these changes only make me prefer Linus Spacehead's Cosmic Crusade more, just because it's more of a direct sequel to the first game.  Why should Linus's jumping become less realistic, and why should his speed change depending on where he is?  Why would he change his name to Cosmic on all official documents, when he still likes using the word as a universal adjective and exclamation?  Why ruin jokes like how the sign that says "STOP" in big letters plus writing that's too small to read matches its description, or remove cool details like the fireworks in Cape Carnival for winning something or the flying saucer in Linoville that confuses the satellite dish?  I'm not just picking the "(U)" version, I'm sticking with the original story, rushed translations and all!

	"When you first turn on the game...  Oh right, I didn't remember to try the CodeMasters logo skip for a long time. I actually figured it out right before I read Alden's explanation of how to do it in Dizzy the Adventurer.  But even though I had already recorded half the game by then, I could still edit it in because the game is largely deterministic and randomness seems to be reset at the beginnings of levels.  I choose English because... why not, all the signs in the game are in English too, and I doubt anyone will want a language change just to make certain verbs a bit faster to reach with the cursor because they're longer.  So the first thing you notice is, they reproduced the whole box art accurately in the game itself!

	"When starting out here, there's plenty to look at, but not much to do.  (I don't 
	[em 
		"think
	]em
	" there's any significance to the discolored D on the post office sign...)  There are two items lying in the street, but they can't be used yet.  The Old Lino Town teleport key is used in the various teleporters around Linoleum, but as the telekey sets the destination, it can't be used in the same town.  I skip this item anyway for reasons I'll explain later.  There's a sub-area, the run-down-looking post office, but Linus can't afford its services yet.  If we were to enter the area to the right, the way would be blocked by a large monster that we don't have a way to remove yet.  If we go down the arrow to the kingdom of Formica, we'll get kicked out by the border control for not carrying a passport.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Thus I first go for the single Gold Lino Dollar.  I can't spend it yet, even on the $1 machines in the post office, because the game won't let us run out of money and this is the only coin lying around on the whole planet.  So I take it to the left for a way to multiply this cash.  As you can see, while there appear to be many choices at first, you end up having to follow certain paths to reach a few goals, and the trick in route planning is coming up with the best intersection of those paths.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I should now explain how cursor movement works and point out that the way I picked up the coin was a little different in style from the habits I formed later.  Linus can only ever run 1 pixel per frame, but the cursor will accelerate up to 2 pixels per frame if moved long enough, so it can eventually get far ahead of Linus without ceasing to guide him with just a bit of a head start.  However, clicking anywhere with the A button or selecting a command with the B button causes the cursor to freeze for the next 2 frames, meaning that I can only repeat these actions once every 3 frames at the fastest, and clicking too much can cause the cursor to fall behind and Linus to stop running before the cursor has reached the destination despite its better per-frame speed.  Usually when entering an area, the second frame I'm able to control the cursor is when I can get into a pattern of pressing A every 4 frames so that Linus keeps up precisely: He walks 1 pixel on all 4 frames, and the cursor travels 2 pixels on each of 2 frames.  If I need the cursor to get ahead of Linus to activate something else, I'll let it advance one more frame before the first press of A.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This first adventure area is the only one where I have the awkward position of getting the cursor ahead of Linus while it's still in the 16 frames or so where it moves at only 1 pixel per frame.  It takes up to 12 frames for it to go back to 1 pixel per frame depending on how long it's moved at the faster speed, so sometimes I let it decelerate to that for just a moment if I need to reposition the cursor by just 1 pixel.  Usually I want it at the double speed at all times, and it's convenient that the double speed is remembered across areas--but only for the horizontal component.  The horizontal acceleration and vertical acceleration are done separately, as you'll notice if you compare moving in a diamond shape to moving in a rectangular shape, and for some reason the vertical acceleration never carries over to the next adventure zone, but that's not too bad when we're mainly moving Linus left or right.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Finally, notice how the Lino dollar is at the "top" of the list, and the scroll button must be used to reach the birth certificate again, even though there's room for three items on the list.  This always happens when new items are received and is important to remember for route planning.  I should note that for clicking commands and objects in the graphic area, you can press A at the same time as pressing the D-pad again, but inventory items can only be pressed by A alone.  Moving while pressing A even allows Linus to stand 2 pixels away from the actual hotspot of the object he's examining, but this usually only works with Pick Up; most other uses force Linus to stand in a specific spot every time no matter where the cursor was, which can be helpful in its own right.

Here we see Linus dodging mechanical eggs on legs called Headcases and collecting Cosmic Candy.  Cosmic candies give you a life for every 10 collected, which I don't need, but I made a little challenge of collecting as many as I could without wasting time to see what my final number of lives would be.

This slot machine claims to have a "99.9% payout rate", but although you always win when you're down to your last dollar, you can actually lose a lot.  But it's not random at all.  Through extensive testing, I discovered that whether the Luk-E-Day machine pays out $50 depends solely on what amount of money Linus is currently carrying: At $1, $25, $30, and $35, he will win, and at all other amounts, he will lose.  So the maximum amount of money is $84.  They set this up so that it seems as if you win every 4 tries or so if you're spending your money appropriately, but with these dollar amounts, I found a slightly faster way to get the next payout than to lose 3 or 4 times.

These welding robots don't kill Linus, but they do stun him and knock him onto the conveyor belt which takes him to the previous room, so it's like dying without losing a life.  The first three can always be run past if you just run without stopping, as far as I know, but all the robots have some kind of rule to when they are able to fire, like one can only fire while moving left, and one can only fire while moving right.  It is random when they actually stop to fire (or which side they fire from, I forget), so I had to luck-manipulate a couple of them by slowing down.  The very last robot fires all throughout its path and is probably meant to be too difficult to dodge, so that's why there's a computer key you can collect before it, marking the one time where something from an action stage helps you in an adventure stage.

But if you succeed, then all those robots on the car line stop firing and you can pass through without trouble.  It's all totally moot if you can dodge the last machine, but if you really want to see the password game, then stop the movie when Linus collects the key, get sent back to Factory Reception, and use it in the computer, it's not hard.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This is another thing that was probably supposed to be unavoidable: Normally Vork is a good enough shot that the player keeps getting hit and knocked back, and after about five hits, Linus gets stunned and falls onto the conveyor again, which somehow brings him up to Vork's hand, which sends him into the Scrapyard adventure area.  There Linus can find a Fire Extinguisher which will put out Vork's power source so Linus can pass him safely, but you need to find a bar in an earlier area which allows you to pry the extinguisher out of a car wreck first, and pass another action stage to get back to the reception area.  (Hey, weren't there a couple of fire extinguishers on the wall of that car assembly line room?  Too bad Linus couldn't reach one of those.)  All this was skipped by careful jumping!

[p 
	"When the starfield stops scrolling so fast, the asteroids appear.  Now, you would get the impression that the goal is to dodge the asteroids, but in fact nothing ever happens if you keep dodging them; they just keep coming.  So the actual goal is to ram into as many asteroids as possible as soon as possible so Linus will give up and go to the next scene.  The car ends up with loads of damage marks that don't appear in the 16-bit ports--watch out that bubble dome doesn't burst!  But then Linus claims the problem was he guzzled too much gas "dodging" the asteroids and needs to refuel, not repair the car, no matter how fast I filled the asteroid collision quota.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This makes for another annoying sub-game to TAS.  The car is another vehicle that accelerates slowly, so you have to plan your moves ahead of time.  What's interesting is the asteroids always push Linus to the left, no matter which side they actually hit him from, so it can be a good idea to let a clump of them onscreen, then come down on all of them from above or up from below.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The other annoying thing is the random element, where what asteroids are spawned where and when drastically changes depending on when Linus last hit an asteroid or the pause button.  Yeah, hitting Start to pause in this game affects the few random things in it, but I don't like to resort to it because it restarts the music.  I didn't manage to improve this, or the car robot area, or No-Man's Causeway with pausing anyway, but it's something to keep in mind if you're persistent enough to try to improve the TAS.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"So the randomness can be annoying because as soon as you hit the asteroid that would have ended the game and started the next scene, a change in randomness could have caused another asteroid to spawn right before that, and the scene won't start until you remove every remaining asteroid from play.  But another weird thing is that sometimes you can get away with hitting a lower number of asteroids than you're supposed to.  I watched the memory address that counts how many asteroids Linus hit, and 10 is indeed the target number to make the asteroids stop appearing, but occasionally a single asteroid will count up 2 for some reason.  I don't think it's because of two asteroids overlapping, because I've tried hitting the same asteroid in different ways from the same save state, and sometimes it awards 1, and sometimes 2.  It usually happens when I hit the rock with the middle of the car while coming down on it vertically, and in fact two of the ones I hit in my movie gave double, so maybe it has something to do with the two sides of the car counting separately or something like that.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Anyway, I figured I got a pretty good outcome.  Since the acceleration made it annoying, I ran small parts of the asteroid section at low speed many times and kept whatever gave me the lowest time for the appearance of the message, "That was a close one!"  Then I went over the best runs with frame advance to try to whittle more time out.  I found that slight movements upon hitting the last asteroid make a big difference, seemingly due to how Linus has to accelerate toward the center of the screen and overshoots it by less and less until he finally stops on it.

And these new enemies, living springs I guess, are randomized!  It's random how far they jump as well as how long they wait to perform another jump, so I made a couple of unnecessary jumps just to manipulate them to get out of the way in time.  With the lower speed, Linus can't even jump over the springs when they're on the ground.  I tried pausing as a quicker alternative to jumping for luck manipulation, but although I saved a little time at first, I lost more time once I got to the end even though I was being very careful to watch the subpixel timing the whole way, so I gave up trying to figure out another improvement.

Dropping right off before reaching the next platform caused Linus to fall all the way down, and clicking on anything demonstrated that he thought he was over on the far left, climbing stairs in what looked like thin air to get back to where he had been directed.
