	[a class=intlink href=/Guidelines#BeAware 
		"Be aware
	]a
	" mentions that you should ask about your TAS at the forum. This is probably the most important point. Post a WIP (work in progress) at the forum, and ask what people think about your movie. The submissions queue is not the place to do this. Submitting something without consulting others is not something you should do if you don't have any published TASes. Like 
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/mmbossman 
		"mmbossman
	]a
	" mentioned in 
	[a class=intlink href=/2374S 
		"a previous submission of yours
	]a
	", if you keep submitting movies that don't follow the guidelines, it might result in a ban. If you share your movie with the forum members 
	[b 
		"before
	]b
	" submitting and listen to their opinions, you'll avoid something like that from happening.

	"The above point was the most important I think. Others are "Select your game well" (this game already has two TASes, and one of them is already a Zangief TAS. Judges must consider the number of movies for a single game so your movie should be significantly different/more interesting than the other TASes of this game. Then there is "Select your goals well" (the mode you picked doesn't seem suitable for TASing, especially if the full game TASes are already around). Finally "Do something unexpected" and "Be accurate". 52 rerecords is not enough to make an impressive TAS. As stated in the guidelines, "The fewer rerecords the better" is false.
