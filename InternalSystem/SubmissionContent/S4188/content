	"Whoever this guy may be, he's looking to assemble the Golden Warpship. To get these pieces, you must collect enough fuel for your base ship to reach the next planet, and to then seek out a large wormhole leading to the ship part necessary for the assembly, then you go to the next planet. Along the way, there are many treasures to find, as well as useful equipment to add to your jetpod to make this quest easier.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The physics of this game is pretty complex. Your jetpod has a thruster to move about, but keep in mind there isn't any friction. While you will keep going, you're not likely to keep your momentum for long before you decide to thrust the other way or end up face first into a wall or an enemy bullet. When you shoot, your bullets are affected by your current speed. There are a number of tools you can buy to change how the jetpod handles or weapons to deal with enemies you find.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"There are also secret warps you can take that will take you several planets ahead. For whatever reason, taking these warps will also hand you a Warpship piece for every planet you skip. These warps are also the only way to reach Planet 13, but clearing it will still take you to Planet 12, which houses the last part to move on to the endgame.

[div class=p 
	"The pod's usual maximum is 3 pixels per frame. This speed limit can be broken by tethering an object and having its momentum throw you around. This can let you reach 4 pixels per frame, but if your thrust pushes you in the same direction on that axis, the boosted speed is lost. Even gravity enforces this 3 pixels per frame limit, so I need to turn it off with the handy Anti-Gravity item in order to fall faster. This leads to odd habits like dragging wormholes around even if I don't need to use it to get (more) items, just so I enjoy a higher speed.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Gravity also affects the item you tether. For some reason, even if you aren't thrusting, the item rotates its way to the bottom of your swing (or the top in reverse gravity), which implies that your ship has very low density in whatever fluid it's in with the tethered object being high density. It makes even less sense when you go into some kind of liquid and find this object now flying up to the top of your reach. Even zero gravity enforces the 3 pixels per frame limit for going down. Anti-Gravity shuts off these behaviors completely.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"There's some asymetry for how tethered items affect your momentum. For example, when the item swings around at the bottom of your jetpod, if it's slightly to the left, it imparts a lot of left momentum and very little down momentum. If it's at the bottom and slightly to the right, it imparts very little right momentum and a lot of down momentum. This makes it very easy to go left faster, and difficult to go right faster.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Tethered objects do not affect your ship's momentum on the first frame. You can also untether the item on the first frame. Since you didn't give it time to be tethered, the item moves two pixels closer to you in both axis.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"It's possible to trick the game into thinking you hit a surface of the wrong angle, such as acting as though you hit the ceiling even though you clipped its corner going down to it diagonally. Good for getting around a corner quickly and lack a good braking mechanism or dealing with heavy tethered objects. I have not analyzed this closely, but I make use of it anyway.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"When you pause and unpause the game, it forgets to check for collisions with enemy ships and bullets. This is only good for one frame of protection, so if you can't avoid an enemy, yet at the same time end up inside of it for exactly one frame, pausing the game might yet save your jetpod. The trick is used once while spinning the orange crystal.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"You start with 0xE000 (57344) fuel. Each frame with thrusters active uses up 2 units. Crash into a wall, you bounce off at a somewhat reduced speed and you lose 0x1000 (4096) fuel per 1 pixel/frame you crash into a wall at, relative to angle of collision. You are also invincible to further wall collisions for 48 (non-lag) frames.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Whenever you thrust up or down, and on a frame where it's enough to change the sign of your speed (positive to negative, or negative to positive), the game applies your vertical thrust again, effectively doubling the strength of your thrusters for that frame. It seems small, but it was critical in maintaining height in Planet 7 with the first fuel cell, as I did not otherwise have enough thrust to stay at negative Y speed in order to get through that tunnel safely.

	"This is an excellent time saver. Since you can switch gravity on or off at will, it gives one more way to control your momentum. The insane stunts done with some item tethering is only possible with this, especially when getting a speed boost for vertical movements, both up and down. Less helpful for horizontal movement, but it still helps to keep tethered objects in control. The two minutes it lasts for is more time than I can use.

This is a secret with orange crystals, blue ones don't work this way, or any other object for that matter. The extra life is meaningless, and the 9th spin turns the crystal blue, but the 8775 generated goes toward paying for the Sports Jetpod. Spinning this crystal adds a bunch of seconds to clear Planet 7, but the jetpod is easily worth the delay. Unfortunately, the displayed number and flashy dots it generates each spin takes up your bullet slots, reducing how many you can shoot at once.

In the maze, I clip a few corners in such a way that I'm deflected off the wrong wall. I do this four times. Smashing up the jetpod like this from max speed four times plus other minor bounces would destroy it before I ever reach my destination, so for three of these, I first lightly tap a wall then abuse its invulnerability to survive the wrong deflections. Take a look at my fuel as I ascend for the last time.

	"There's a lot of gravity spheres. As if that's not enough, there's also very noticeable downward gravity as well. Anti-Gravity proves its usefulness once again. My last terrain-based crash into that stalactite doesn't seem to be very clean, but I didn't spot any obvious solutions I can try to get me to fall faster. This Golden Warpship part doesn't take tethering priority like the last one, but all I have to do is be out of reach of the wormhole. Just drop it for one frame with it above me, and I can tether the ship part and instantly deposit it in the wormhole.

	"Start: Physics-based exploration. End: Side-scrolling shooter. My goodness, one life, and tolerance for three collisions with objects and instant death on terrain. The controls are vastly different with motion based on the d-pad rather than facing and thrust. You go through some strange place where the terrain can't make up its mind on what color to be. What's this eye thing you have to shoot? There's a boss now? Someone get me out of this crazy zone! ... Honestly, the dramatic change I outlined here does leave me a sour taste after such a wonderful game.

	"In any case, there isn't much I can do to speed things up. Even the RNG doesn't seem to do too much, as I literally copied Blublu's run and it still beat the boss, though it did take three hits and missed some scattered blue stuff from the direct copy, so it wasn't a complete sync. Of course, I'd rather fill this place with my touch, so I TASed this part as well. I hope my antics entertain, at least the parts where I didn't just give up the entertainment potential.

	" I never actually investigated this with any detail. Then again, I still make an improvement as the eyes do rely on the RNG on when to open or close. Some eyes use the highly volatile RNG that completely changes based on controllers, while other use a more stiff bit-shifting RNG that can still be affected by the highly volatile one. Preventing an eye from spawning will definitely speed things up more, though.

	"Oh, by the way. My weapon bar is still being emptied out by my Anti-Gravity. No one shut that thing off. And since I don't have it, I can't turn it off now. The Anti-Gravity has no effect here anyway, and when that bar empties, nothing happens. It is, however, a good indicator on how close I am, as once it empties, there isn't much left to this place.

	"One thing to check is if Anti-Gravity is worth picking up for Planet 13. I highly doubt it's possible to get enough money (quickly) for that plus two Double-Strength Thrusters and the Nippon Sports Jetpod, so one strong thruster will need to be traded for that. If a second thruster is desired, this takes a lot of shopping time to get, as the thrusters are deep in the menu, and the second shopping trip does not have the convenient desire for the shiny jetpod.
