		$LF

[p 
	"Both were not available at the time this run was started because the TAS input plugin was not available at the time I started the run. The Dam pause out was avoidable yes, but would have cost me several seconds of in-game time which is the movie's primary goal. The second was because of how 2.3 works, the axises of the joystick need to be set seperately for it to work, and this was not possible until TAS plugin was released.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Another thing to look forward to in the improvement is a less fucked up sky. The newest version of Mupen released by okaygo causes polygons not to drag on the sky, but it is still just blackness. Ideally, I would wait for a plugin which has the sky emulated perfectly but, well, we'll see. Also a few tiny improvements here 'n there.

	" is certainly the best FPS game available on a home console. The first FPS game to involve more than being nigh-invincible and blasting your way through a long corridor. It is a game of stealth, skill, and doing things called "objectives" which enhance each mission and truly make them unique. This TAS plays the game more like a convential FPS however, in that I mindlessly yet skillfully blast my way through everything without any regard to my own safety.

The shirt backwards strafe and emptying of the KF7 clip was to get the door to the mainframe room below open for me. Saving about four seconds compared to a loss of 30 frames. Some lookdown was used on the surface of the Dam because the sky is dreadful to look at. Possible improvements: Shooting the alarms on the Dam itself through the walls. This still won't save much, but it could help. Warping the door to the first alarm would lower the time to 1:48 for sure.

Thus, an unnoticeable amount of time was spent watching the 2nd cinema, to wait the frames here instead of the vent, saving in game time at a loss of no overall time. Reason I don't leave the level right away is that I need to wait for the Objective involving meeting Trevelyan to complete. Note the ass-shot on the scientist. Possible improvements: Better Obj A door. This would lower to 51 and get me a reasonable shot at an even 50 seconds. I may have to lose time warping the door before this one though, we'll see.

The movement while I am getting pinballed around by the drone gun looks odd, but it prevents me from getting backboosted (loses more time than the small stuck on the table). Next warehouse, I have to destroy a bunch of boxes. Luck manipulation happens, and the explosion from one box creates a massive chain reaction. This objectives completes about half a second before the end of the level. Lastly, there is an error in hit detection on the back of the train itself allowing me to shoot through and hit a guard; they open two doors for me saving about 3-4 seconds.

To proceed in this level, I have to kill everything in the first room and the guards' bodies must fade away. I manipulate the faster/fastest death animations here. The wierd movement while Natalya runs to the first computer is done to force her to take a diagonal line to it instead of making an unnecessarily wide 90 degree turn later on, saving time. This computer runs on an invisible timer then the first door opens; but if Natalya is doing one of her animations as the timer ends, it continues to wait for the animation to finish for the door to open. I shoot her so that when her getting shot animation ends, it is the earliest possible frame for the door to open. Fast forward a bit, When fetching Natalya for the long protection sequence, looking away causes her to warp a door saving around 2 seconds. Boris can be killed at this point safely without failing the mission. The wait at the very end of the level is for Objective A to complete (happens when Natalya gets back to the elevator).

In the Obj B consoles room, I manipulate the key drop to be in optimal position. The guards blow up the Obj C console for me.
