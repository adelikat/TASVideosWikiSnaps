	"Much of the saving came from improved boss fights.  These were improved by finding the ram addresses that store boss hp and using them to find the optimal type of weapon and timing to do as much damage in as few hits as possible.  It turns out that this game calculates damage very oddly, resulting is some seemingly counter-intuitive waiting between shots and waiting before charging another shot (this game has a peculiar quality that a shot will do less damage if you begin charging the next one too soon :s)

	"Other saving came from a few new tricks in the levels, such as a fast way to duck and slide in level 2 & optimizing the usage of coins.
