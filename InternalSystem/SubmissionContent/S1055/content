	"For the most part Guybrush played the levels and I once again demolished the bosses.  There was some deviations as Guybrush played the first boss, and I did several sections of the various levels.

	"Much of the saving came from improved boss fights.  These were improved by finding the ram addresses that store boss hp and using them to find the optimal type of weapon and timing to do as much damage in as few hits as possible.  It turns out that this game calculates damage very oddly, resulting is some seemingly counter-intuitive waiting between shots and waiting before charging another shot (this game has a peculiar quality that a shot will do less damage if you begin charging the next one too soon :s)

[p 
	"Other saving came from a few new tricks in the levels, such as a fast way to duck and slide in level 2 & optimizing the usage of coins.

	"I would personally like to thank Guybrush who got me motivated to do this game & discover entertaining this game is to TAS.  I also want to thank Walkerboh for his hard work on the previous Flintstones movies.
