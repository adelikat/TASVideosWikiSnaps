	"Fire Emblem: Thracia 776 (ファイアーエムブレム　トラキア776) is the fifth game of the serie, originally released through the Nintendo Power (japanese only flash cartridge service) before receiving a proper ROM cartridge the following year (only in Japan). There are a few minor differences between the two versions but nothing important as far as this TAS is concerned. The story takes place during the events of Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War, with Leif trying to retake Manster and liberate northern Thracia.

]h4
[div class=p 
	"This game has several unique features compared to other Fire Emblem games. The most notables ones for this TAS being :
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		" Fatigue: Doing an action (Fight, Dance, Steal) with any unit increases his Fatigue by 1 (or between 1 or 5 for Staves, depending of the Staff used). A unit with a Fatigue greater than their maximum HP cannot be deployed in the next chapter. Fatigue is reseted to 0 when not deploying the unit or by giving him a Stamina Drink. Leif isn't affected by this mechanic.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Rescue/Capture: A unit can rescue an ally if his BLD is higher than that of the ally (mounted units are treated as 20 BLD ones), and will have his STR, MGC, SKL, SPD and DEF halved if the rescued unit's BLD is more than half of the rescuer's one (or more than BLD + 5 if the rescuer is mounted). You can also capture an enemy unit by winning a battle against him (with STR, MGC, SKL, SPD and DEF halved). The same penalties apply than if it was an ally, and you can trade items with him. The enemy tends to prioritize capturing over attacking, and no battle occurs if the attacked target is unharmed.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Escape Maps: In some chapters you must escape with your army, and once Leif Escapes, any other unit left will be lost (you get one opportunity to get back the units lost in chapter 21x, which is also an Escape Map).
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Minimum deployement: In addition to the maximum number of units you can deploy, there is also a minimum number, presumably to prevent cheeses in Escape Maps. If you don't have enough units available, everyone will be deployed regardless of their Fatigue.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" MOV growth: Most characters have a movement growth rate (usually between 1% and 3%), movement which can go up to 20. Needless to say it can be very useful early on when you don't have access to the Warp Staff yet, or for Escape Maps. A pop up message appears after the level up to say to the movement was increased.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Movement Stars: About half of the cast have "Movement Stars" (between 1 and 5), which give them a (number of stars x 5%) chance to move again once per turn (not taking dance into account). Starting from chapter 7, any character will also lose his ability to re-move if he Seizes or Escapes, and the only way to get back this ability is to end the turn normally (i.e. by not finishing the chapter in one turn) or getting danced by Lara.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Staves: All the Staves have a (60 + 4 x SKL)% accuracy, meaning that any unit with less than 10 SKL can miss when using a Staff (you still get the Exp and the Weapon Exp from it, and it doesn't cost a Staff use). Status like Sleep last forever and can only be cured with a Restore Staff.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Battle Accuracy: Hit cannot go higher than 99% and lower than 1%, so every attack can either hit or miss and is subject to the RNG.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Critical Rates: When two units are fighting, both of them can only have a maximum critical rate of 25% for the first round of combat (so if the critical rate should be higher than that, it is reduced to 25%). After that, if one of the unit has an extra round of combat (because his Attack Speed is higher by 4 or more than the opponent's one), then it's critical rate for this round of combat will be the expected critical rate (i.e. the one displayed in the battle summary) multiplied by the Pursuit Coefficient of the unit (can go from 0 to 5).
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Critical hit damage: The critical hit damage formula is 
		[small 
			"ATK x2) - DEF), as opposed to the 
			[small 
				"ATK - DEF) x 3) in the later games.
				$LF
			]small
		]small
	]li
	[li 
		" Deployment order: Unlike later games, you can't choose where your deployed units will spawn, as it depends only on when you deployed them for the last time. Since for some chapters the units are separated into several groups, a big part of the planning for this TAS was to find in which way I had to deploy my units in order to have them at the right spot at the right time, given the other constraints.
		$LF

[div class=p 
	"This is the last Fire Emblem game to use a 1 RN system, meaning that what is displayed on screen are the true odds (except for critical rates).
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Each time the RNG is reseted, the game randomly picks a number between 1 and 64 (that I will conveniently call seed from now on) and use it with the Knuth's subtractive RNG to generate the first random numbers, and the following ones are calculated with the formula RN#(N) = (RN#(N-55) - RN#(N-24)) modulo 100
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The RNG is often reseted, in particular at the start of each chapter and each time you open a menu screen. Checking the stats of a unit is faster than opening the option menu, but this second option is less laggy (lag = the seed isn't advancing) so it is the fastest option if I must wait some time for a specific seed anyway. Opening a menu costs at least ~60 frames, so most of the optimization of this TAS was to find the less time consuming combinaison of opening menus and burning RNs.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"There are two efficient ways to burn RNs, the first one is to watch the battle summary (right before the battle), as it will "simulate" the battle and so it will burn the RNs accordingly, the other one is to move an unit to a different place to force the game to burn RNs to dertermine the path to take (slower but more accurate). There are also some oddities that can burn 1 or 2 RNs at a time, like the Bragi's Blade.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Since you must always watch the battle summary before doing an actual battle, some RNs strings for a particular battle may be inaccessible because you can't "sync" the RNs with them (i.e. after the simulation from the battle summary, the RNs are right where you want them to be). The more complex the battle (several attacks, several skills involved), the more likely you are to not be able to sync the RNs with a specific string.
