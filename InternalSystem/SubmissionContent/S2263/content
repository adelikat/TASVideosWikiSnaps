	"Both players share a life bar and they fight four difficult boss battles. You can easily die in a hit or two if it hits both players at the same time, loosing 4 quarters in the process. To make up for this your given infinite super.

	" 1st Adon round
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"So if I was going for speed every round would look like this. Note that super throws can combo in this game. In most street fighter games shadows move during superfreeze, most of the time this is harmless, but Roses shadows are not harmless and can hit during a freeze. Roses super throw is unique in that you can combo out of it with another superthrow. This can cause some strange things to happen if you time it right.

	"Just showing what you can do with inf custom combos. Notice at 0:34 that rose switches to her kick super rather then a custom combo, and that throw damage doesn't scale.

	"1st Just showing some super combo juggling that's possible.
	$LF
	"2nd it's possible to dizzy with a super, and a projectial only CC.

	"1st a round with mostly normal attacks. Note that sim would have killed Vega with the super at the end. When rose activates CC it causes Vega to fly higher.
	$LF

[p 
	"2nd So rose has a unique alpha counter. Normaly she can combo after it. For some reason the suction from sims combo will keep the opponent standing in mid air. I end my combo so that you can see Vega do a crouching fierce in mid air and to show he will keep on fire after the combo.

	"I think it's improvable but I think Dhalsim and Rose are the ideal characters for this kind of thing.
