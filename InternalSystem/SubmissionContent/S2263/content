	"So if I was going for speed every round would look like this. Note that super throws can combo in this game. In most street fighter games shadows move during superfreeze, most of the time this is harmless, but Roses shadows are not harmless and can hit during a freeze. Roses super throw is unique in that you can combo out of it with another superthrow. This can cause some strange things to happen if you time it right.

	"2nd So rose has a unique alpha counter. Normaly she can combo after it. For some reason the suction from sims combo will keep the opponent standing in mid air. I end my combo so that you can see Vega do a crouching fierce in mid air and to show he will keep on fire after the combo.
