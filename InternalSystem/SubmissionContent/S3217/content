	"Flicky is an arcade styled Genesis game in which a small blue bird (Flicky) tries to rescue some other bird's children. In doing so, he must travel through a series of houses, some being in Egypt, others in space. He must avoid the tigers and chameleons who just happen to be in the houses too, and occasionally he takes a break to look through the windows and see an undressed lady posing.

	"This TAS goes to the first roll of the credits which comes right after stage 48. Why it comes after stage 48? I have no idea. Anyway, this TAS plays through the game with an inhuman amount of reflexes and luck. Flicky is kind of a boring game, but I try to make it as entertaining as possible, for example: In some of the bonus stages I'm constantly jumping, or constantly twitching. I abuse a lot of "clipping" on ledges in this run, and there is also a kind of programming error that allows you to reach the Chirps that normally would be out of reach. To do this, jump, and at the height of your jump, turn Flicky around to face the other direction. For some reason doing that extends his hit-detection box upward.

	": The game choice here is truly awful. Graphically this looks like a NES game on Genesis hardware and the less said about the audio the better. Normally these faults can be compensated by interesting gameplay, but this game also fails on this account. The levels are very repetitive in style, yet on the odd occassion that the level is complex the run suffers due to how slow the character becomes at the apex of his jump. This completely broke any tempo in a level with many enemies or complex platforming. As pointed out in the thread these factors are very important to whether or not a run will be published. This is not a 'records site' 
	[em 
		"per se

	", our primary goal is to create entertaining content. The point has also been made that some of the times in this run have been surpassed by real-time play. This alone is a ground for rejection, but I feel that even a more optimal run of this game would be unsuitable for publication. However, in this run you do demonstrate a decent grasp of the concepts of TASing and I encourage you to continue to TAS. Try posting in the forum once you have selected a game in order to get some feedback on its suitability, and from there you should post WIPs so that the community can verify that the work is optimal. Rejecting for bad game choice.
