	"This game lags a lot. In fact, roughly 2 out of every 3 frames is a lag frame (there are very few instances where you’ll get an extra lag frame or you’ll gain a non-lag frame here or there). Just for clarity, throughout these comments when I refer to “frames” I mean non-lag frames unless noted otherwise.
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		" You always start off walking for a few frames at a pace of 2 p/f (pixels per frame). After a few frames you start running at a pace of 4 p/f. The amount of frames it takes to start running can be manipulated to some degree (a very small degree). Turning around, for instance, saves a frame of walking before reaching max running speed. And sometimes holding forward one or two frames before you hit the ground can lessen the amount of walking frames. But even then it isn’t completely consistent in that regard.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Jumping is as fast as the current running speed you’re in before the jump. Diving forward to either avoid an obstacle or an enemy is just as fast as running, but you can only dive if your speed value is at 4 (even if Catwoman hasn’t started running yet).
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Whip swinging is faster than running in most cases. You’re paused for around 15 frames for the swinging animation, but you move at 26 p/f for one frame, then 46 p/f for one frame, then 20 p/f before continually moving at 4 p/f until you land. So it more than makes up for itself. There are very, very few instances in which it’s slower, like if you have to fall for longer due to it.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" You can’t whip swing during a fall, but you can after a wall jump.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" As a small note, not necessarily a trick, you can’t turn in mid-air. So whichever way you were facing before the jump/fall, that’s the way you’ll be facing when you land. There are A LOT of instances where I wish this wasn’t true. But like I mentioned, it causes you to run after only about 3 frames.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Running and jumping onto a platform usually stops you when you land, but in a lot of instances you can jump onto the platform and maintain running speed. This is a frame-perfect maneuver and can’t always be done with higher jumps, or if an enemy is in the way. It can be done with some consistency with shorter jumps though. This isn’t always possible particularly if a gap you’re jumping over is too wide. This is because in order to pull this off you have to hold jump the exact amount of frames needed to make it onto a given platform. If the jump is too wide, you’re forced to jump higher than you want just to make the jump at all.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Getting damaged moves you at 16 p/f for a few frames (the amount of frames vary by enemy). The issue with this is that the enemy’s pattern is set once you enter a room and can only be modified slightly (without wasting time) , so if an enemy isn’t going to optimally knock you into a door, there’s nothing you can do about it. Also, you’re stunned for a number of frames, so it isn’t usually worth it aside from very, very limited situations. All of which I’ll explain when they happen.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" To go along with the mention about lag frames there are very limited instances in which you can manipulate them. For instance, you can only control Catwoman starting a stage once she enters he idle sprite. Sometimes how you exit the room before can determine whether this sprite appears on a lag frame or not (seeing as the frames cycle on a “lag, lag, normal” basis). This isn’t always the case (in fact, it’s very rare that it makes a difference), but it’s good to not rule it out when planning the room strats.
		$LF

		" Another way to reduce lag is to get certain animations off the screen as fast as possible. This is only really relevant to the final stage, though.

		" If you dive/fall/swing onto a platform near or above an enemy, sometimes you can get “wedged”, for lack of a better term, on into the two hit boxes. Sometimes this means you won’t be able to move, but a lot of the time this means that you can turn and jump quickly and not have to, say, jump for as many frames to reach the next vertical platform or execute the next whip swing.

[div class=p 
	"As you’ll see throughout this stage, when you dive or whip swing onto stairs there’s a chance you’ll jump without any input needed. This is good because walking up stairs normally locks you at 2 p/f, but by manipulating this automatic jump (which I’m guessing is a bug) moves you at 4 p/f. Whip swinging so that you land on the topmost or bottom most stair is sometimes faster than avoiding them altogether. Walking at the very top or very bottom of a stair case can cause you to start running a frame or two faster than normal.

I backflip in order to avoid getting hit, but I have to do it in a very small window that allows me to attack before he’s ready to attack again.
