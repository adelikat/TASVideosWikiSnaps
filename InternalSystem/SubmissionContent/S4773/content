	"Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories is the second instalment of the Kingdom Hearts saga. This game is about a boy looking for an other boy but also about memories, hearts (love, friendship and so on), saving Pooh and killing some annoying guys (and one girl). For the rest ? I... I'm... I can't remember...

[p 
	"The game is subdivided in 13 worlds. Each world has many rooms (the number depends on the floor). You get the cards that allow to create this worlds (except for Castle Oblivion) during the run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"To create a room you must use a map card. If you use a card 1 on a door, all the doors to get out of the new room will ask 2 (or more). If you use a 2, you will have to use a 3, and so on. If you use a 9, you still must use a 9. Using a 0 card reset this counter which starts again at 1. The room created depends on which card you use, e.g. a Moment's Reprieve will create a room with a save point, a Teeming Darkness will create a big room with a lot of Heartless, a Sleeping Room will create one with 2 or 3 sleeping Heartless. There are special rooms, usually 4 per floor : Room of Beginnings, Room of Guidance, Room of Truth and Hidden Chamber. They need a special card and some other cards. The 3 first are related to world's story. Hidden Chambers contain sleights or cards (attack, magic and Enemy) and any of them won't be opened.

Of course, you need to have learned the sleight to be able to use it. The first of the 2 or 3 cards can't be reload (except with some item cards, such as Hi-Potion).

	" Traverse Town : 93557 frames
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Basically, the tutorial and farming world. Marlu... An unknown member of the Organization explains how to use cards and how to move.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Donald's attacks are directly into Marluxia which has 2240 HP (he can't be beaten of course). When you have to press L and R to roll the deck, firing L and R at the same time is faster. Using the first two animations of a combo (Strike and Thrust) are faster than a complete combo because you have to empty the deck.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The aim in this world is to get enough card to do the first part of the game. Unfortunately, we can't get a Blue card. I also had to get 6 Blizzard cards, a lot of Moggle Points (for later), 2 Blue Rhapsody and 1 Red Nocturne. Blue Rhapsody/Red Nocturne card's effect is 
	[em 
		"Blizzard/Fire Boost
	]em
	" which improves damage done by Blizzard/Fire by 50% but it disappears after a reload.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Traverse Town is optimal to farm because it's the only world where you can fight just 3 Shadows. You can't find them in a Temming Darkness room but this one improves enemy cards' drop, so I used 2 of them in this farming session. I finish this world with around 70 map cards.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The second tutorial (the Room of Beginning) introduces a new card (Simba). Having a new card  reduces the luck to get a Blizzard, so it's done only at the end (when farming session is almost over).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"And then, the first boss : Guard Armor : 200 HP but it has 2 gauntlets and 2 hammerlegs to destroy : each has 200 HP. Using Blizzaga with Blizzard Boost deals 97 HP and it can touch the four parts with a single attack. So, in 2 Blizzaga and 2 hits of Keyblade, the Guard Armor itself can be destroyed (also by Blizzaga and Keyblade's hits).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Normally, it's faster to appear at the top of the ladder but I need to manipulate the next boss, Axel (because he teleports around the battle field) and, with that data, it's faster to climb the ladder.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Second and first Organization boss : Axel : 320 HP. As I said, he moves only by teleportation and he does that very often, so I have to make him go where 
	[em 
		"I
	]em
	" want (inside a Blizzaga, for example). Two Blizzaga and he's done. We get the Fire card.

	" Olympus Coliseum : 10537 frames
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"As for Traverse Town, I manipulated luck to get the fastest battles possible. I still have to get some cards because I need blue ones to open some doors (and they open easy rooms). I also wanted to use as less attacks as possible. So, sometimes I had to wait to kill many enemies with a single blizzaga (enemies usually don't pop during a Sleight). The Calm Bounty room contains a sleight : Blizzard Raid : Sora throws his Keyblade with Blizzard effect (it's basically a magic version of Diskobolos, if you've played Kingdom Hearts).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Mid-Boss : Cloud : 274 HP. 2 Blizzagas with the boost and some Keyblade's hits are enough to kill him. We get the Hi-Potion card which allows to reload all cards.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I didn't immediately slam the door because I needed the change Hades' pattern (by rolling the RNG), so I used a Heartless but it had to appear on the field. I changed the positions of Blizzard Cards to be able to use Blizzard Raid faster.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Boss : Hades : 439 HP. This battle might be faster if Hades didn't move so much (but I couldn't get better because of the RNG). Blizzard Raid has the capacity of dealing damage each time it's possible as long as the keyblade touchs the sprite (so touching an enemy when the Keyblade starts to go back to Sora is really useful). We get the Hades Card, a really really really powerful card for a speedrun/TAS : its effect is called Berserk : Doubles the power of attack cards when low on HP (when the gauge is flashing red).

]h4
[p 
	"Crescendo can be meet in this world... And they have a good enemy card : Summon Boost : Disables use of magic cards to power up summon cards. As you can imagine, this asked a heavy luck manipulation to get it as fast as possible. I still got some map cards on the road.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Mid-boss : Cards Soldier : really weak enemies. Using Blizzard Raid is the fastest strat. We get the Card Soldier card (yes, it's a card) : Attack Haste : Increases the speed of attack cards.

[p 
	"Trickmaster is really slow to attack but I needed to get Berserk. So, I used some enemies.

[p

[h4 
	" Agrabah : 17844 frames
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Mid-boss : a simple group of enemies. We get the Ether card : quickly reloads magic cards with no charge time required. It does not work on cards that cannot be reloaded.

[p 
	"And here comes a heavy luck manipulation : Moggle Shop. 10 Lady Luck, 5 Three Wishes, 5 Fires and 5 Cloud must be found. Premium cards have some shining particles that make the RNG rolls three times. The content is the same for all packages of the same price.

To be able to hit Marluxia you must cardbreak him. Some flowers-drones will appear ; when they attack, each of them deals 40 HP (so 80 HP isn't enough to get Berserk).
