I'll be going over them in turn, because that's precisely the kind of person I am, but I want to make it clear in advance that I don't mean this to be discouraging at all. I want this to be a learning experience, like Sonic's Schoolhouse, except more fun! I'm even going to assign homework! Don't worry, it's going to be actually good homework. The kind where you, like, do a fun thing at home and you don't get graded on it the next day in class. It'll be fun, unlike Sonic's Schoolhouse.

If you hear a ring sound, you did it correctly, and you can press Start + A to go back to the main menu for it.

It seems clear to me that the route used in the 100% TAS to get to the upper lift is faster.

	"I will give a couple hints though: My file is intentionally not fully optimized, so you should definitely be able to perform everything faster. Definitely use the upper route in Mushroom Hill 1: Below 20 IGT is easily possible, which means you should be aiming for less than that. I perform the glitch using mostly the same strategy shown in your run and GoddessMaria's test file, but I managed to optimize it by a good amount over both. People in the submission thread brought up that using debug mode to place and subsequently break several monitors at once can also activate this glitch: Look into that for sure!

	(__wikiLink|displaytext=working on a single run|href=/3274M)

Just keep working at it, keep improving, and who knows, maybe in the future we'll see your name attached to the best Sonic TAS we've ever seen.
