No credit roll, and the last couple lines are changed (translates roughly to "But Giss [supposed evil] #2 and #3 may already be born!"). The only known ROM translation even missed this ending (although it still acts as a bad ending otherwise since only the text changed). I'll take it that the bad ending is a price to pay to cut down on the final boss.

When maxed out, attack is 5000 (the electric gun does one tenth of that, or 500, to the final boss, who has 34000 HP). So instead of being forced to hit the final boss over 200 times, it only requires 68 hits. I need 10 EXP items to max out 009's attack. Also note that you can't pick up items if you are flashing from being hit.
