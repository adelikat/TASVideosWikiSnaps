There was no information on the game's RAM, so I had to find a bunch of addresses myself. While attempting to do so, I found out that ID 109 and 110's name corresponds to item in storage 7-9, and 90-92 (Addresses E642-E646, E6E7-E6EB). I was going to change my name to get items to make a payload, but then I realized those values won't get saved. I could however, try to use stat boosting items to increase my stats to make those a payload. Unfortunately, the Japanese character set does not have any values that correspond to stat boosting items. Only the english version does.

Unfortunately, it appears the (U) version does not give me ID 117 when depositing Beavern to the farm, so I was not able to get the ACE entry point (yet). This test run however, made me realize that the tricks I found on (U) could be applied to (J). So I started this run.

CactiBall/SpotSlime gave me trouble, since it appears after getting the 1st Cacitball to follow you, it becomes a lot harder to get a 2nd one to follow me. I was able to get 2 SpotSlime, but I had to delay a bit to get the encounter step count low enough for 1 final fight before Beavern, or else I won't have enough monsters. I used Warp Wing as soon as I get Beavern.

When you deposit the duplicate follower, the index gets bugged, and becomes a high value. It was discovered by others (I do not know who; it was already a thing since 2015 at least with

	" Depositing Beavern in the Japanese version of the game results in an index of 117. This treats the region from EB69-EC0D as part of the follower's data structure, which still isn't useful. However, when you release monsters from your farm, the game decrements your index to reflect CartRAM being cleared. Since I was at index 117, the game decrements to 116, which is still in WRAM. By releasing 7 monsters, I can get the game to treat E6E6-E78A as their data.

I did test using the fastest text speed in game, but all it does is auto press A at the earliest time in battle. I decided to keep with text speed of 8 to control RNG events.
