This time I get through them MUCH faster than I did in my first published run, though ideally, it should probably be timed so the fourth car explodes just as you reach the edge of the screen, if that's possible.  Something to try in a third attempt, methinks.

Once she's defeated, a dragon rescues her and carries her off.  She's out of view as this happens in both my movies.

		"I like the start of this stage 'cause my pre-emptive strikes of the first several enemies looks really cool. =)  The fat guys are more annoying then they seem, because not only do they have a ton of hit points, but the bottles they throw have a wider collision field than they should, and they tend to push Annette back when they touch her.  Compared to my previous movie, I managed to affect the direction they throw their bottles in a way that's easier to avoid.

		"The dragon mini-bosses are hard to optimize because it's hard to figure out how to affect their movements so they can die faster.  I figured getting the dragon on the right to come out earlier would help, because you can't stop it from hiding for a few seconds.  My most obvious error in the movie happens here; I thought I had hit the right dragon with my fire magic, but I actually hit one of the fireballs, which caused its hit points to increase. Arrgh!  I didn't notice this until I got far into the run.  Starting over just isn't an option with an emulator as tempermental as Gens, but I DO have a reason to make a 3rd attempt sometime later, anyway.  Despite this error, I got through the mid-boss fight faster than in the previous movie anyway.

		"The water magic (given to you by the dragons) is needed to get past the fireballs, which is a pity since it's almost useless otherwise.  Imagine how much time I could save if I could skip the boss fight entirely!

		"BOSS: The cell is really hard to have an optimal fight against, for obvious reasons. I tried to kill it without a single wasted shot this time, and it's hard to say if I succeeded in this area, but I DID kill him significantly faster than in my previous movie anyway.  Should be noted that a bug in the game makes his life meter fluctuate depending on the type of attack used against him.  It confused me at first 'cause I thought I was doing damage to him just by striking his "gel", but no, the red nucleus is indeed his only weak spot.

		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"If you're wondering, it IS necessary to kill the hang gliders.  If you miss them, they follow you, continuing to drop bombs, which not only interferes with the OCtopi fights, but also creates enough sprites on the screen to slow the whole game down! Yikes!

		"The endless, bizarre warehouse area is the hardest level to optimize, period.  Lots of precise jumping, dashing, and charging of special moves is involved! It felt really good to get this stage over with!  I use a few new strategies in this attempt; you'll notice I go very slightly out of the way to collect two medicines on the way to replinish my health. This is why:
		$LF

	[li 
		"BOSS: The boss always unleashes an attack after being hit a certain amount of times.  It's very hard to avoid and takes off a ton of damage. In the first attempt I had to pause a bit between attacks to keep from getting killed, but this time I had more health, and was able to keep the attacks pretty steady until I was a hit away from dying in the very end.  I was also able to use the water spell! Yay!

This, combined with the fact that I really had the strategy down at this point the first time, made these three stages tough to optimize further. Between the three, I ended up shaving off three seconds. Oh well... it's better than nothing!

I do think the timing of the wind attack against the batch of guns before the boss came off almost perfect.

		"BOSS: Only boomerangs hurt it, and it can only be hurt inside its box, after the boxes stop moving. More or less a "brain-teaser" boss... but its movement is not random; it's static. After playing the game enough times, I pretty much had "right , left, right, right" memorized. ^^;

		"BOSS: Kind of annoying since he makes you wait at the start. Unlike in my previous attempt, I don't try to be entertaining or anything. That was just annoying, so I waited patiently this time.  It turns out that just charging up the Homing spell and using it is the fastest way to kill him. It made the fight LESS fun to watch than it was in my previous attempt! But... It's faster.

		"BOSS: Restiana, the cutie you fought at the end of Stage 2, has become an unwitting sacrifice whose body becomes a vessel for this horrible spiky dragon thing.  The movement of the last boss is completely preprogrammed and static, so forget about trying to affect its movement to keep it from hiding its weak spot below the ground like an annoying little coward. You got to make the best with what you got!  The fireball spell really hurts, so basically I used it as much as possible, hitting him with weak attacks as I waited for my magic to charge (if I could).  It's hard to beat this boss quickly due to its high hit points and aforementioned cowardly hiding, but I'm sure I did the best I could.
