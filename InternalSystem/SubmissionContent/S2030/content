However, I took a look at his WIP and tried to beat it, succeded, informed him about it, was handed over project, completed it. The route used is the same as in the previous version so the improvements come from better precision, lagreduction and new strategies.

	"This might look like a not too complicated game to TAS. However, even though I haven't tried so many games yet, I found this being far from easy. The main reason for this is spelled LAG which can sometimes be so cruel that it could drive anyone insane. If this game had no lag I estimate the time to make this would be about 5-10 times shorter.

	"In this run I slide over much more 32-pixels holes than in previous run. And the ones I don't slide over is because it's not faster (by LAG-logic). The sliding-over-32-pixels-holes trick works because when you slide between them, you can only fall down at the 2 pixels in the middle and Mega Man slides in a speed of 2.5 pixels/frame. So by some subpixel positioning, it's not that hard to do.

In the previous run they picked up 2 large refills which would also have made my journey much easier but I've learnt that small refills are much more economical to pick up than the large ones. I also found out that there where only 16 enemies that I could get the refills from to not slow down too much. So of these 16 enemies I needed to get refilles from 14 - no small task, and the fact that I also had to deal with lag and subposition to slide over the holes didn't make it easier... For the rest of the level, I found a faster way to zip through the first bubbles. The boss doesn't get to breath for very long either.

	"On this level I thought that if I semi-kill my self on the spikes and take away the music, perhaps the game will lag less. This was also the case and I gained around 80 frames on the first part of this level because of this. On Wood Man I managed to hit him 1 extra time before he got his shield back. How was this possible? Well, the simple answer is because the dealay you have to wait before you can hit a boss right after you've hit it is not constant. If you want a more sophisticated answer you  can ask, but it's quite too much to have on the submission page I think:) For the rest of the level, I found that it wasn't worth switching to Magnet Man. Then on Heat Man I found another intersting thing. Apperently, after you've hit him he randomly waits 30, 60, or 90 before he moves. So by getting two 30's I very easily gained a whole second here. The boss strategy was also changed.
