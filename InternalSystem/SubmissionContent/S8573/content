	$LF
	"RNG is predicted and manipulated so that we always win a 35:1 payout every time the ball lands in the roulette.
	$LF
	"After making copious amounts of cash, we move over to the pawn shop across the street and buy everything they have available.
	$LF
	"The only useful item here really is the alarm clock, as it gives us extra time in the morning.
	$LF
	"Right next door is a convenience store that sells smokes, it's the only item here that we really need.

	"Moving forwards from here, we go back to the bank to buy real estate, stopping to give the kid 10 packs of smokes.
	$LF
	"The kid gives us a skateboard, and then dies from smoke inhalation, this drops your character's karma.
	$LF
	"Stopping at the furniture store we buy everything they have then go home.
	$LF
	"At home we invest in stocks (a bad one, admittedly) and go back to the casino.
	$LF
	"Stop at home to sleep, go buy more furniture, the castle, then right back home.
	$LF
	"Next is sleeping repeatedly to increase our stats so they're high enough to hotwire the car outside.
	$LF
	"After sleeping once more, we stop at the hobo to give him money to increase our karma above 0.
	$LF
	"More sleeping, dump the rest of our money into the stock while it's tanked, and more sleeping.
	$LF
	"Then we go out once more to become CEO, and return home to run our presidential campaign.

	"Once that's done, we're done, pull up the status menu and end time.

	"The run is fairly simple, I was going for the 100% category and since most of the game is predominantly menuing, there was potential for huge time saves compared to RTA.
	$LF
	"I used some predictions with the RNG to make a large amount of money very quickly, however by exploiting this in combination with the bank there's potential to make way more than I did in less time.  (Estimated time save about 2 minutes)
