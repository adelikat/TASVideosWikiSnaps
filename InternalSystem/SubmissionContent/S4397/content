I personally just removed the credits entirely, since they're like 7 minutes long and really freaking boring.

I went through Kingdom Hearts 358/2, to Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin, to Adventure Time: Hey Ice King!, to Ikachan, to Legend of Princess, to Jenka's Nightmare, and to Shantae before finally looping back around to this. It was a long road, but it was a road worth taking.

	"-At the very beginning I choose the Sword and give up the Shield in order to change what my starting commands are. This gives me a Sliding Dash and a Quick Blitz, which both skip combo lag when used.
	$LF

[p 
	"-The third wave of Shadows in Dive to the Heart require at least one Clock Finisher to beat. Elsewise they'll just loop forever.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-I pause in the first system sector in order to spawn the enemies faster. I only do this when I need to travel a short distance to where they spawn, elsewise I don't usually bother.
	$LF

[p 
	"-Tidus normally takes three rounds in order to kill, but I managed to manipulate a critical hit here to reduce it to two rounds.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-Throughout the first phase of the Darkside fight, I need to make sure Sora doesn't activate his Clock Finisher before the end of the fight. Elsewise, phase two would take longer.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-Phase three of Darkside takes a fixed amount of damage at any level, so it's all about attacking as fast as possible. (Just like every fight o.o)

[p 
	"-Immediately as this world starts I pick up a Blank Chip and a Thunder. Via command fusion the Thunder is used as a Thundara, which is very helpful. The Blank Chip is used to get a Command Expansion in the Stat Matrix, which increases the amount of commands I can equip from 3 to 4.
	$LF

[p 
	"-Occasionally there are certain cutscene triggers that wait until Sora is standing still before activating. By walking into the cutscene trigger in the side alleyway I save time.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-After the first fight I use a very accurate Slide Dash to skip a cutscene. Saves a few seconds.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-The autoscrolling section is pretty straightforward. The only notable thing is a slight glitch with the physics. If Sora rolls into a gap being filled by a Blox, he'll actually warp above the block. This saves a tiny bit of time in the second section, but is elsewise just entertaining.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-The second boss, Guard Armor, is manipulated based on how far away Sora is to him. I wait a specific distance for him to use his arm throw attack, which is easy to dodge and takes a while, and then destroy him.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-I also go ahead and equip the Power Armlet I got in the first world. More on that later.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-Similar to most RPGs, waiting a certain amount of frames changes the RNG. I abuse this to get critical hits, finishers, and shorter attack animations.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-Before fighting the end of world bosses you're supposed to pick up Cloud as a party member. However, it takes nearly two minutes to get him, something that's terribly slow in a TAS. So I just leave him to die or whatever.

[p 
	"-The Olympia keyblade converts my standard combos into slower, stronger ones. It also allows me to move during a loading screen, which is pretty helpful since the first hit of the combo acts like a Slide Dash.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-When I'm at it, I go to the Stat Matrix to unlock Combo Master, which allows me to continue a combo without hitting anything first. Very helpful.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-The first Jafar fight is rather complicated. In order to manipulate him to where I want him to go, I need to stand in a specific spot at the start. I also attack two bloxs during his invincibility phases in order to prevent him from wasting time warping around.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-The green Bandits in the first system sector here aren't stunned by my attacks, similar to red enemies. I use Magnera to fix that easily.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-The elevator fight is essentially the same strategy as the green Bandits: Magnera then kill.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-Jafar 2 is exactly the same as the first one, only he has a bunch of clones shooting at me.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-Genie Jafar is all about stunning Iago so he doesn't get away. This is actually pretty easy to pull off in a TAS, so I manage to kill him much faster then normal.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-Oh, and I deliberately take damage into critical range (where it starts beeping) in order to activate my Power Armlet. Power Armlet gives me an attack boost when my HP is below 25%. This helps when dealing with the damage curve later on.

[p 
	"-Right before the end of world boss fights, I finish synthesizing a Judgement Triad. Judgement Triad sends three spinning blades after enemies, which are all very powerful.
	$LF

[p 
	"-Pete can easily be manipulated via my attacks to do what I want. I manipulate him at the start to get me into critical range, so I can deal more damage.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-Pete 2 automatically starts with the lightning vortex, so I just Judgment Triad his face beforehand. He's supposed to use the lightning vortex again once he reaches low HP, but I kill him too fast for that.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-Riku can somewhat be manipulated with his attacks, but it's mostly jumping and attacking.
	$LF

[p 
	"-Riku 2 is the same, but with a warping ability you never see.

[p 
	"-Beating the 6th world grants me the Oblivion keyblade, which is essentially the Kindom Key with automatic Attack Haste. It also has Two-Edged Blade, which means I deal increased damage at the price of HP. Combined with the Power Armlet, I'm literally unstoppable.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-I also get Dodge Roll LV2 and a Finishing Plus. Dodge Roll LV2 has more invincibility frames and travels farther, which the Finishing Plus gives me a second finisher to my combos.

[p 
	"-Not much to say about the world revisits.

[p 
	"-Riku 4 is the same as Riku 2, but with some silly fire nonsense. I managed to loop him into doing his guard move.

	"-Another sidescroller section, only this time it's determined by how fast I go. How nice.

]p
[p 
	"-Dragon Maleficent automatically does attacks after a certain number of hits. Pretty simple.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-What you do in Sora's Heartless 1 changes what Sora's Heartless 2 does. In order to prevent him from doing an instant death move I can't dodge, I manipulate it away here.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-Sora's Heartless 3 and 4 are exactly the same, in that he'll automatically do his finishing move once the clones die.
	$LF

[p 
	"-Roxas automatically does his Faith attack at certain HP points. That's why he does it twice. When he reaches low HP he can do a final version of it, which takes much longer. I managed to kill him before that though.
