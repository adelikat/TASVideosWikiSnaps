	"In the run I choose Henry, he is not the first character. For U version you must have a save to use him, but for J version it needs not, so I used J version for the run because Mupen can't record movie from reset. Henry's objective, he must rescue 6 children found in 6 stages within specified time.

	"The second stage Castle wall, actually I can leave the area just after rescue the child, but I went to the top of it for a moon card because I'll use it later. There is a coffin at the end of Villa stage, it could warp to three different areas in different periods, the cards could change current time, this is why I collected them before here. I also found some shortcuts in some areas such as the child rescuing in Outer wall, which saved lots of time.

	"As for the run, it feels like one long fetch quest, and in the worst of ways. The technical aspect looks to be of as high of quality as previous zggzdydp runs (that is to say, fairly high), but the entertainment aspect is sorely lacking. Two very similar boss fights were the most exciting part of this run, but the rest wasn't enough to make up for it, and it appears much of the audience agrees. Sorry, but I'm rejecting this.

	": I still find this to be a bad goal choice for a run. People seem to like it by proxy, in the hopes that a full run using Cornel will eventually come along, and that this run is good enough for the time being. With that in mind, I'm going to accept this, with the likelihood that it will be obsoleted if/when a good quality Cornel run is submitted.
