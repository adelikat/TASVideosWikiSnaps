	"I've been tackling the All Platforms Challenge bit by bit, which is mainly an excuse for me to check out different console libraries. There's a standard Atari Jaguar port as well but I chose the Atari Jaguar CD version for a reason. The big problem with the Atari Jaguar CD is that there's less than 20 official releases for the add-on. I didn't quite get the interest to TAS those so I explored what was out there for Atari Jaguar homebrew and a few interesting games came up. I ended up choosing Degz since I do like Scramble and it's a very short and straightforward game.

	"The only real points to optimize was the initial menuing, not dying since this is a checkpoint based game, and the positioning and timing of the last bomb to trigger the ending screen for a loop. I chose the default difficulty of 1 since that seems to only affect fuel consumption. After a certain point in difficulty it becomes actually impossible to complete a loop due to how fast fuel is consumed compared to how much can be refilled, so I just TASed the first loop since an ending screen pops up after blowing up the satellite dish at the end of a loop.

	"I did some RNG manipulation to get the highest point drops from the red-orange objects on the ground, which is mainly frame based but also affected by what was shot down before. The range is 100-300 points and ultimately doesn't affect the completion time. I just thought it at least maximize the possible points in a loop without dying.

The scrolling speed seems constant throughout the gameplay so it's unlikely we'll see any faster movies. In spite of that, the author makes sure to eliminate all destructible enemies and objectives.
