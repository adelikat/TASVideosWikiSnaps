	"Professor Layton and his young assistant Luke Triton receive an disturbing letter. Andrew Schrader, the professor's mentor, has come into possession of the Elysian Box; a cursed treasure that is said to kill anyone who opens it. To their horror, they find Dr. Schrader dead in his home, and the box gone. The duo venture out on the Molentary Express in search for answers.

				"Characters that you can serve tea to are randomly determined to be thirsty when you enter that screen. It is not based on the frame you entered the scene on, but the order that you moved areas (this means I couldn't simply wait for the right frame to tap an arrow to engineer perfect luck.) Story progress and solving puzzles also advance tea RNG (and the order does matter, not just how many times you advance the RNG.)
				$LF
				[ul 
					[li 
						"That means that there could theoretically be a route through the game that doesn't involve going back and forth between screens to make characters thirsty, but the amount of permutations in the order of puzzles alone make finding this route humanly impossible. Take, for example, one of the trips to Granny Riddleton's Shack. The most puzzles we solve there at once in this run is 22. The number of permutations, that is, number of unique sequences, of this set of puzzles is 1,124,000,727,777,607,680,000. That's over one sextillion, and only for one small set of puzzles. So, unless someone makes a script that automatically plays through all of them to find the fastest route, it will simply never be found.

				"Also, in the section were I flip back and forth between Narice/Clarice and Illyana/Vera (US/UK names) Narice gets thirsty first, but I don't give her tea yet until Illyana gets some. This ended up taking the same number of screen transistions as when I gave Narice tea first, so it didn't matter. I mention this because there are a few frames where the thirsty mark can be seen above Narice when I'm flipping back and forth and I didn't want the judge to think I didn't see it.
