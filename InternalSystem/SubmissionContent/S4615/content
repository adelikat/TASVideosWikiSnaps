	"Road Blasters is a game where you make a perilous journey across long stretches of highway in search of more fuel in order to go... 
	[em 
		"somewhere
	]em
	". While I still haven't figured out where exactly you're ultimately trying to go, I've at least decided the game has something to do with trying to stay alive in some kind of "Mad Max" inspired aggressive driving simulator. It seems everybody on this planet is out to get you whether they're swerving between lanes, brake checking in front of you, or simply firing bullets from the side of the road. So you better have your defensive driving skills up to par or else you're going nowhere.

	"I started this as a pacifist run by just passing on by whoever got in my way, but I quickly found out it's simply impossible to reach the end without inflicting violence on your fellow travelers. You're essentially required to destroy a few road hogs from time to time just to refill your gas tank. Weapons include your standard front-mounted gun along with a few upgrades like a Cruise Missile, UZ Cannon, Electro Shield, and best of all, the Nitro Inject for massive NOS speed boosts.

	"In the end, our driver gets to where s/he needs to go in record time amazingly without even a single scratch on their beast of an automobile. But what do we make of all of those haphazard commuters whizzing by all seemingly out to get us? What ulterior motives possess their souls to take such dangerous actions in the presence of others? Are we driving across some kind of private property, a military base perhaps, or maybe a lawless third world country bent on destruction? Whatever the case may be, I think I'll be taking a different route next time.

	": As has been pointed out by the audience that it is suboptimal in a bit of areas and missing some tricks that can save time. The author has acknowledged the issues and requested that the run be rejected in favor of his upcoming improvement. With that said, I am rejecting this submission due to optimization issues.
