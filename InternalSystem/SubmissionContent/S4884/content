	"One thing to note is that Bizhawk has slower load times, usually 1 frame per load, than Gens. But I chose to use Bizhawk as it is a much better emulator as well as I ran into issues with Gens. When I started this project Bizhawk would not run Toy Story so I had no option at that point. Eventually Gens stopped saving input into the main file so I thought I was going to have to start over again. Then I realized it was updating the backup file. So after each session I would have to copy the backup file and work from it which got rather annoying.

	"The biggest improvement to this run came from turning the "Storyline" off. By the beginning of the second level I'm already saving time. On a level basis the main improvements came on Revenge of the Toys, Buzz Battle, Inside the Claw Machine, Really Inside the Claw Machine, and Battle of the Muntant Toys. The rest of the levels were mostly only a few frames with a few being a second or so. Mukki's Buzz Battle was horribly slow and this was the level where I saved the most time. Sid's Workbench and Battle of the Muntant Toys were the levels that took the most work in the whole run. I did each of those level several times testing all kinds of damage routes ranging from deathwarping and taking damage off certain enemies to not deathwarping at all and avoiding everything. Although dying and respawning in this game is very fast it is not always the faster.

When falling from high up when Woody hits the ground he gets a stumble animation that slows you down for a bit. By using the whip as you hit the ground it cancels this animation and allows you maintain your speed and control of Woody. Towards the end of the level I turn around and face to the left for a few frames. This is to manipulate Hamm's coins to be in a good pattern as to allow me to run under them without having to duck and slow down for them.

I was surprised I ended up making a good cycle on the fans at the end so I was able to take an additional hit of damage earlier in the level and avoid it there. This level has a new mechanic in it not in previous levels. Whether it was intended or not I do not know. But when standing on a platform that moves up there are a few frames where you can jump for one frame but you get a full jump out of it. This is not just an ordinary jump though, you get a lot of extra height out of it. This allows to skip waiting on the cog platform towards the beginning of the level as you can jump up to the top a cycle early.

		"Info: Creative level name given the previous. This level is the 3D Doom style level. Originally I did this level and used backwalking for portions to avoid having to turn around. Backwalking turned out to be slower than walking forward. The way this level works is that every third frame is an input frame. Aliens can only be picked up on input frames so it's possible to come out at a bad position and just walk through one and not pick it up.

Each cycle the Claw comes in it will always move Buzz a little to the right so I let it take him over but not far enough that I wouldn't be able to complete the level. On the first few cycles the Claw moves all the way across the level, but on later cycles it only comes to Buzz then grabs him and tries to leave immediately. This is why letting it take him far to the right is faster as it will have to travel less to get to him later on.

In order to figure out was faster I had to test all kinds of routes for damage as well as then test the next level to combine the two and see what all was faster. Avoiding damage and using the hit points for the yo-yo's ended up being the fastest. When normally moving Woody his velocity maxes at 4, but during the "Hot, hot, hot!" sections his velocity is 5. Meaning that by starting these sections early would save time. However the yo-yo's need to be close enough to start the cycles so that they are in good positions so starting too early would put them in bad ones.

This level makes use of the one glitch used in this run. I call it the Hook Turn Around. Mukki found this for his run. When you are using the whip to swing on a hook if you switch the direction you are facing on the last frame before the hook Woody will flip around and swing the opposite way. This saves a good amount of time as it eliminates half the swings you would need to normally do to get up the hook sections. At the end with the big chain with yo-yo's I jump off and run along the bottom as this is much faster and allows to avoid damage than climbing across the chain.
