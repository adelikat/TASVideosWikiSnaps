	"For the first large crate I had to jump on, I had to position myself so that I won't get shot as soon as I leap off it. Leaping off the alcove is faster than continue to run.

[p 
	"I lept after taking damage as I would be forced to stop otherwise. I tried to avoid the gunner, but I wasn't able to.

[p 
	"Stopping early before jumping to the 2nd crate ended up being 3 frames faster than having an extra leap before jumping.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"For the green roof at frame 7920 however, it's 21 frames faster to leap before jumping due to the wall immediately stopping your movement, allowing you to jump.

[p 
	"The gunner inside the "INBARRR BLACKSMITH" building is triggered as soon as your x position goes past 3227. I had to stop there or else I wouldn't be able to both recover and leap past him before he shoots. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I used a different way to get the money bag before turning to manipulate the shooter on the roof to damage me in order to cancel the landing animation, saving 3 frames. I tried implementing the way the current TAS grabs the bag, since it save 6 frames, but it caused worse behaviour for the gunner; he would shoot too early, so as I land he would've retreated and not be able to hurt me.

	"Yet another driving stage. This time, you ride on a toy car to collect 10 wrenches before you're allowed to leave. I found out here the hard way that it's 6 frames faster to turn completely at the very end of the intersections rather than gradually turning.

]h4
[p

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The 3rd coin in the published movie becomes the 2nd coin here because back tracking is bad. I won't blame the previous run though; apparently there's only a small area where this is possible, so it's easy to miss.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This single toad gave me a ton of trouble. I tried to see if taking damage from the frog unlike the current TAS (since that allows me to jump immediately) would be faster. It ended up me having to TAS the entire level after this point twice, since it messes up 2 critical points later. The first is that it forces me to grab the health BEFORE getting the token, and the second is that I had to wait out the steam pipes before the last health pickup. Taking damage here ended up being 24 frames slower in total.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The steam pipes gave me some trouble, since I only had 47 movement frames before I'm vulnerable again. Thankfully I was able to manipulate my landing so that I could leap past the area nonstop.

[p 
	"It seems your jump is just high enough to make it to the top at the first platform. Who knew?
	$LF

[p 
	"For the backtrack to the 6th coin, it ended up 3 frames faster to take damage from the spider in the air rather than slow down and take damage from it on ground.

]p
[p 
	"Hopping to the higher platform, before leaping over the toad like the current TAS is 3 frames faster than landing next to the toad and jumping over.

[p 
	"Now you may noticed that I paused to avoid that spider. I'm aware of that, and I even tried using the same route as the current TAS (not taking damage from the toad before hand). It ended up being ~70 frames behind + still had to wait regardless. It was only due to the steam pipes that I stuck to the published movie's route.
	$LF

[p 
	"For the last coin, it seemed the only reason why the coin isn't there was because of too many objects on screen. Moving slightly left fixed that.

[p 
	"Better enemy manipulation for stage 2 so that 9 frames in total could be saved rather than 3 from that gunner.

[h4 
	" Stopping immediately
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Normally after running, you'll skid a bit before standing still. By stopping early in front on a wall, it allows you to instantly stop; which also allows you to jump immediately.

[h4 
	" Cancelling landing animation
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"By taking damage at the same frame as you land, it cancels the land animation and allows you to move right after.

	" Clipping into blocks

[p 
	"If you get stuck into a wall/block far enough, you'll be pushed up rather than away from it. Its most noticeable application is during stage 1 at the beginning (discovered by NitroGenesis) and stage 7 on the way to the 5th coin.
