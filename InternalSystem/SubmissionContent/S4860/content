	"My goal is kind of simple.

	"I am not allowed to bother an enemy, with the exception of bouncing off of immortal enemies (spiky enemies) and exception of bosses. This is surprisingly annoying to do, especially in the later parts. I am also not allowed to take the Star Road.

	"I tried making the run as enjoyable as possible but, I speedrun this game and am still learning the game, thus the run is not perfect. But my goodness, it was hard. I tried multiple tricks but a lot went really bad, but it didn't waste much time.
	$LF
	"I'd have to say that Yoshi's Island 2 was the easiest (duh) to do, and Sunken Ghost Ship the second easiest. But truly? The level that has the easiest fly was one of the hardest, because I wanted to go UNDER the stage instead of up. I tried the same thing in Forest of Illusion 1 but wasn't able to do it.
	$LF
	"Chocolate Island 1 was also really annoying, it made me really nerverse. (woo bad english)
	$LF
	"But for me, the level I had the most fun doing was definitely the final boss. For some reason, after rewatching & recording the movie I laughed a lot at Bowser battle which was... strange.
	$LF
	"Most of it was done in slow motion, although some parts was done frame by frame.

	"And that's all what I can say. Note: this is not supposed to beat the WR of No Starworld, as this submission had rules that may not be able to beat the WR. If so, it'd be really hard. I'll probably redo this someday, but not now.
