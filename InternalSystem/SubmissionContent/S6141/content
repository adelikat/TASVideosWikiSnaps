	"What is “Battle Mord 25Cups”?:
	$LF
	"It is to clear the challenge of battle mode and get 25 cups.
	$LF
	"When moving to the screen displayed as the last VICTORY, it is supposed that the cup has already been acquired. Therefore, I ended key input at that time.

	"General explanation etc:
	$LF
	"In this game, I think the most important point to note is the difference between Japanese version ROM and overseas version ROM.

	$LF
	"In other words, by choosing ROM, you will fundamentally change how to capture and how to make TAS animation. It would be great if you could watch it with it in mind.

	"I summarized important techniques below.

	"This choice of mode was extremely repetitive and there were long periods where one had to wait out a minute long timer and not much could be done to make them appear entertaining. Audience votes were at 68% support as well.

	"The author deliberately picked the Japanese version which has no relevant differences for this mode except the player and I believe the cpus both have increased movement speeds on English. It's significant enough of a difference that strategies on English will probably not be directly comparable to Japanese, but at the same time it doesn't seem worth having a separate branch for. We would absolutely prefer English in the future given it would almost certainly be faster.

	"The choice of mode is acceptable for Vault given that Level 5 is the maximum level of challenge for each type of battle and this run reaches that for each. However the branch name given is. Given how in the English version it says "Challenge Battle level x" at the start of each set and that you can't complete this mode at all without 25 cups, I believe it is appropriate to name the branch "Challenge Battle mode".
