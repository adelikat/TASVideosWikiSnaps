	"Here is the last missing version of battletoads: 2 players - warpless. This was the hardest movie i ever made as i had to control 2 characters while trying to keep up with phil and genisto's tricks and movements.

	"Unfortunatelly, the game has a lot of lag on 2 players mode, so the time ended up being slower than the 1p warpless run (if it had same lag as 1p, it would have been faster, despite the forced gameover). But its more entertaining, i hope. Enjoy!
