	"Bombliss, also known as Tetris Blast in the US, is a Tetris variant where some blocks have bombs in them, and clearing a row containing a bomb causes it to explode, erasing blocks in the explosion and causing any connected components in midair to cascade down, potentially creating a chain reaction. The objective is to clear all the blocks on the screen.

[div class=p 
	"Putting 4 bombs in a 2x2 square causes them to fuse together into a big bomb, which always explodes in a 10x10 square. However, the game checks for fusions after checking for detonation, so creating a 2x2 square while simultaneously completing either of the lines it occupies won't get you a big bomb before it blows up. If there are multiple possibilities for a 2x2 big bomb (e.g. a 3x2 rectangle of small bombs) then the game fuses the highest 2x2 possible, with ties within the same rows broken in favor of the leftmost square. Creating a big bomb also adds 1 point to your score for the level.

This is the source of several speed/entertainment tradeoffs throughout the run, where I use a more impressive-looking strat that scores higher due to the score bonus for high-power explosions, losing time at the results screen.

	"Note that beating the game unlocks a new set of levels, numbered 31-60, but these are identical to 1-30 except all bombs on the intial boards are replaced with regular blocks, the blocks seem to fall faster, and the RNG appears to be more biased towards pentominoes. Since the strats to clear these boards would be mostly identical to 1-30, and the ending appears to be identical, there is probably not much entertainment value in TASing the second set of levels.
