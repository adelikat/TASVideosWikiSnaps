	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Pepper-Color's run|href=/6025M)

	"Just improving all stages over their run, no new tricks were found. And route is pretty straight forward. Obtain W-fist as soon as possible then Sub Up. Stopping at Life Up is 2 frames slower than Sub Up so it's needed only when specific sub attack is required.
