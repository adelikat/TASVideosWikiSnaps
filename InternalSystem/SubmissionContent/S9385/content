	"The run is performed on the Sinclair ZX Spectrum +2A. Back to Skool does not attempt to control its framerate, it simply processes the game as quickly as it can at all times. 128K versions of the Spectrum run their Z80 processor at a slightly higher clock rate, and the +2A and +3 also have some improvements in memory access speeds. As a result, the game runs fastest on these models. The +3 is a disk-based system, and Skool Daze has never been officially released on disk, so the run uses the +2A and loads the game from tape.

	"As Back to Skool does not attempt to control its framerate, when there is more to process, the game runs slower. However, the game is generally processing all characters all the time anyway, and so this framerate only slows down when there are visual or sound effects to play (e.g. the player fired a catapult or got punched to the ground). The game also pauses to scroll the screen, or when a teacher gives lines, so these are generally avoided whenever possible.

	"Skool Daze and Back to Skool were two incredible games that were unlike anything else at the time; an open-world sandbox that's fun to play even without trying to complete game objectives, with characters that have their own routines and personalities, and went on to inspire many other games, most notably Rockstar's Bully.
