		" I kill an enemy extra in the same room as where I get the Cotton Robe, the Mudman, to get a Mind Restore. This, alongside with unoptimal triggering of the DSS (Which was a must), cost me 30-something frames. When the frame-mob retrieved the debt, I got 140-isch back.

		" However I pick up the axe, which cost me 24 frames. I believed that it could be used to gain several frames, but I forgot how horrible the physics in this game are, so I ended up losing 21 frames here. This can be argued, since the axe helped me to do extra input before getting the 9th Potion which gained me time after Camilla (5, which brings the loss down to 16 (I could have managed with 12 Potions, but decided to go with 13 which maybe had made the entire after-Camilla different (Going with 12, that is (Also brackets are fun) ) ) ), but it was still a loss/bad investment. However the axe, in my opinion, gives some smoothness and adds a little extra to the run, so if anyone argues about the usage of the axe and that I should redo due to it, I'll bring out the "Sacrifice time for entertainment"-card.
