	"The grenade door location (stored at RAM address 0x00A2) is frame-dependent, meaning it varies based on the exact frame you exit a level. Previously, this required sacrificing frames at the end of a level. However, the new loading frames technique eliminates this need.

	": It's very impressive that you took that much time to try and optimize your own work even further.  It reminds me of a game or two that I've redone myself, that yielded a small chunk of frames. From my experiences, it is more rewarding to dig for those "hard to find" frames than to find places that enough effort wasn't given on an original attempt. I congratulate you on your work, as this appears to be a complicated game to optimize.
