	"The goal is to beat 1 player mode as fast as possible on Hard. This is different from speedrun, because we have no characters unlocked and i get challenged by black wargreymon, which is only avoidable by losing a match (completely 2 rounds) or by having unlockables. BWG is like Akuma challenge when you play well.

	"Renamon and Sakuyamon are recommended for both their high damage and versatile combos. Renamon has a big projectile which decimates big body enemies, but isn't as strong with small chars. Renamon has good damage though, is fast and if the stage allows for a lot of sequential abuses of the stage drops is the faster choice. Sakuyamon has a good super move and infinites.
	$LF
	"In the first round, i do some slower combos that avoid multiple digivolutions. Sometimes, i manipulate enemies into being into the air so they don't digivolve but on HARD difficulty this is very rare. When round 2 starts, I can't avoid the digivolution but at least i kept it to one per match.

	"You can infinite combos with Restand by hitting enemies when juggling close to the ground and you can combo from respawns at the stages drops. Wormmon fight is extremely fast because of the stage drop being faster than digivolve super!

	": A visibly optimized movie that reaches the end of this arena fighter rather quickly. Since he didn't use a previous save, the author needs to fight an additional fight that is not present in RTA (SRC) runs; hence, the longer time. It seems like further mini-game manipulation might be possible, but the author wasn't able to find a way to it. In any case, that does not preclude acceptance since it falls within obsoletion territory whether somebody else finds a solution for it. The "Hard" goal seems appropriate for being the default, as easy mode does not sound as compelling a challenge.
