	"The default "custom" board is 2 by 2 with one mine.  Initially, I thought I could just use those settings.  But the movie was 31 frames, which was unacceptable.  I thought about it, and I could really reduce some time if I didn't have to move around on the board as much.  So, I tried again, and changed the number of bombs to 3.  Fortunately, I don't even have to move as the "safe" spot is where I start.  This seemed like a stroke of luck (manipulation), but further testing shows that if you choose those settings this will practically always be the case when you are starting a fresh game.  Even stranger though: if you set the board to 10 by 10 with 99 bombs, the safe spot will still also be the upper left (starting) position!  Any square board that is filled but one seems to do the same thing.
