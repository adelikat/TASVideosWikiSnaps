		" The trucks were kind of a pain, after they pass by in the background, they always reappear in the foreground a specific number of pixels off screen, so hitting them as early as possible requires travelling the same way as them, and then immediately changing direction.

		" Keeping speed was a challenge in the area where the pigs parachute in, because I'm actually travelling faster than the crescent slice the sword shoots out. But it's important not to have to rocketboost too early on the hills after, because otherwise I'll hit the hill sideways while jumping and loose all my speed.

		" The four unskippable pigs are defeated much more quickly than in the prior version, by swinging the sword just before they become vulnerable, so the projectile passes through the near left one (which catches the tail end of the swipe) and hits the far left one. The sword swipe ends just as I have enough charge built up to boost and catch the two pigs on the right.

I have to be moving left constantly to keep from getting hit, but I can't move left and swing right unless I'm in the air, so I have to keep jumping. Unfortunately even the lowest jump I can make takes me to a height where I won't hit it with the crescent projectile if I swing.
