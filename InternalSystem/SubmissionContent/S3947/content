There's 4 levels which can be accessed in any way and it has the Michael Jackson mode: You can moonwalk by holding the select button. Notice the character's only damage source is his weapon which can fire if his last projectile (maybe grape extract) is "ended". There's no mario style.

	"So the fastest jump would be ( "A" and wait 1 frame ) x 8 --> (4+4) x 8 + 3+3+2+2+1+1 = 76. The highest jump would be ("A" and wait 6 frames ) x 8 --> (4+4+3+3+2+2+1) x 8 = 152! This means it will like "jumping" again in mid air, and actually "flies" very high. This had to be optimized by making the "jump boost" by ( "A" and wait 1 frame ) without sacrificing all "jump counts" to reach a high place.

Things can happen like a bridge goes to wrong order (doesn't saves time in this TAS, because you need to wait the delayed spawn), gas puff doesn't spawns (abused in this TAS), elevator get stucks (doesn't saves time), etc. Sometimes this can be achieved also by producing lag frames at these exact frames (with shooting and holding U (instant lag) ).
