	"Have to land the crystals on the boxes. Like Tetris, you can speed up their descent by holding down. Down is held for the entire run except for a portion where the angle is too extreme on one of the crystals, where down is let go for the exact number of frames it takes for the crystal to adequately land on the box.

	"This is the hardest game in the set and technically should be last, but the menu routing put it here best. You have to link all the columns with at least one flow of magic liquid. This was a nightmare to even figure out RTA. Once I figured out the combination, I went back and optimized the path to be the best possible in terms of movement.

	"Mostly battling against bad movement. I figured out you can clip into the clouds if you do the flying trick, which also causes you to immediately land and be able to jump again. I also discovered the first glitch in this game which is that if you hold left or right on a certain frame after jumping, you can shoot straight up, however this was not used as the vertical gains were too high and caused a late landing.
