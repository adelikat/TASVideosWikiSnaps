[div class=p 
	"The game takes place in 64 tracks spanning 16 countries, each of which contains four races, starting with Australasia (Australia and New Zealand) and ending in the United States. After each country is beaten, the player is given a password, which can be later used to pick the game back up from that position. Because of an agreement to naming rights, the Giza Necropolis in Egypt was renamed to Hugh Sitton, a photographer of Corbis Corporation.  Players need to finish in the top ten positions in each race to qualify for the next one. There is a map that shows the course layout, the position of the players, and the position of the car in the first place. The player is given 6 "nitro boosts" at the start which dramatically increases the car's speed for a short period. On certain courses, there are pickups along the road ranging from a "$" which is $1,000 cash, an "N" which is an extra "nitro boost", and an "S" which is an automatic nitro administered right when picked up and returns each lap. The other pickups can only be collected once per race. Players must take care to avoid too much damage to any area of the armor. If a section of armor is destroyed and the player takes damage in the area that the destroyed section of the armor used to protect, the car will spin out.  Players can spend money earned in a race to upgrade their cars. Upgrading the engine makes the car accelerate faster, helps the top speed of the car by a small amount, and makes it easier for the car to reach higher gears. Upgrading the nitro makes nitro boosts accelerate more strongly and reach higher top speeds. Upgrading the gearbox mainly improves the car's top speed, improves the car's fuel economy, and can greatly improve the car's acceleration starting with the third out of four available gearboxes, but gearbox upgrades require an engine that is strong enough to allow shifting into higher gears to be effective. Upgrading the armor allows cars to take more damage before the armor is destroyed in the area that is being upgraded. The paint shop allows the color of the car to be changed. Upgrading the tires improves their grip and the car's turning performance.

		"Turn Throttling - Turn Throttling is used at high speeds on Rain and Snow tracks, to perform turn throttling rapidly tap the direction of the turn coming up. In the run, I use Turn Throttling at high speeds if I didn't use Turn Throttling the car will eventually hydroplane and slip either to the left or right depending on which direction the turn is.

		"Extended Speed - Extended Speed is achieved if you time a nitro correctly, as the car speed approaches 228 MPH, and you go downhill your speed will increase by a little bit, thus giving you more speed, the more speed you have the quicker the track will be.

		"Wall Glitches - Defining a Wall Glitch is tricky to do because depending on who you ask, each person will most likely give a different answer.

		"Gear Optimization - Gear Optimization happens when your car is fully upgraded to it's maximum. Gear Optimization occurs when the car reaches 224 MPH while in 4th gear, then when it approaches 228 MPH you will gear up to 6th, this Optimization is done throughout the run especially at the start of races. Gear Optimization can also be applied while decelerating off from a nitro boost, wait till the car reaches a speed of 200 MPH or 195 MPH then gear into 4th, apply the same method as if you were first starting the race.  However, not all the time this works with the speeds needed if hitting a steep hill it may take until 185 or 175 MPH to boost again.

		"Car Hitboxes - Depending on the curvature of the track, you will be able to pass right through the CPU cars at certain angles, this can be seen at the start of races or sometimes during the race, I do this mostly when I have everything upgraded as it's easier to pass all of the cars and reach first rather quickly, and it a faster way to start the race, although not every race may work like this, some do and it's fascinating to watch it play out.
