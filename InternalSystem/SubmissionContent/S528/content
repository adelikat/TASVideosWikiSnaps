	"I used the special Gens on the forums, as with last time, to record this version as well. The making of the movie was alot more difficult, because I tried to be as particular to detail as possible (made mostly possible by the slow-motion addition). I understand already that I can do better, but this is a HUGE improvement over my first attempt, by the better part of eleven minutes or so. Thanks to 'Bag of Magic Food' and /*- on the forums for their words of wisdom!
