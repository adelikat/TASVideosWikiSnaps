	"Corner boosts were used to save frames(For some particular reason, ducking to corner boost works well in some levels and just jumping directly to corner boost can be the same or be better in some levels. Ducking works better in majority of levels.

	"In 8-6, 1 frame was lost to manipulate luck, for the red block could've taken the longer route to lose frames. The route in 8-6 saved 1 frame and could've gotten a 373, but the lost frames wouldn't back it up.

	"In 8-6, I decided to sync with the music a little. Dosen't do much.
	$LF
	"In many levels like 8-T2, Super seizures were performed, it looks like Mario's freaking out about death, so he looks scared.

	"Glitches/Tricks
	$LF
	"-On spring boards, you can keep your speed if you don't hold and direction buttons
	$LF
	"-The cliffs on 8-7... you can keep jumping w/o losing speed by not pressing any direction buttons and jump w/o landing for more than 1 frame.
	$LF
	"-By alternating left and right, you can freeze your animation or face the front which looks very silly when you freeze Mario's head in the ground after doing a triple jump.
	$LF
	"When progressing on a hill, try running down to the last point where you can slide, and do so. Running down a hill is faster than sliding down, but when you're at the bottom of the hill, try sliding,gives a boost to the speeding. When you slide off of a hill, hold on the down button longer to speed a little.
	$LF
	"In 8-5, the chain platforms will help you gain speed for a little when running up.
	$LF

	"    -The unstable rocks act to your running, try landing in the middle in favor of your running.

	"In 8-3, there are water currents, you can keep your speed for many frames w/o holding any direction buttons. This was a nice discovery by not me.
	$LF
	"Note: When you try entering pipes, you may be stalled to enter the pipe. The stall can be removed if you hold the forward direction longer and duck for a frame.
