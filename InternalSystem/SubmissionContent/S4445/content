	"This run features Mokujin who first appears in this game and later appears in all but Tekken 4. Where he is temporarily replaced by another Character named Combot. Unlike Mokujin, Combot can only mimic a different character's moveset for every match instead of every round. Mokujin is meant truly to test how well you know who you are, how well you can play said character, can you play the matchups you are given, and can you trick the opponent from guessing which character you are.\par
