	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"Ecco: The Tides of Time is the sequel to Ecco the Dolphin, and has been one of my favorite games for a long, long time. It is also highly resistant to speed-running. At top speed, Ecco swims just under 40% faster than Super Sonic can run, but has an eight-frame rule on steering (except orthogonal flips), and no way to slow down, except for orthogonal flips, which take too long, or crashing into walls, which slow Ecco too much. Otherwise it takes 30 frames without any form of acceleration before Ecco begins to lose speed, and even then does so at a maddeningly slow rate. Additionally, the way acceleration works is obscure, requiring a repeated pattern holding the button for 11 frames, than releasing for 1, the fastest way to get to top speed from a dead stop is to accelerate for 5 frames, charge, immediately cancel the charge, and then charge again eight-frames later when the cool-down wears off (maintaining the optimal acceleration input all the while). On top of all this, the game tracks position to the 65536th of each pixel, which combines with the eight-frame steering rule to snowball tiny variations in position and timing into gigantic differences in result. And, of course, the developers must have thought they were developing a PS2 game or something, because the game uses a wide variety of polygonal hit-boxes and detection boxes, and terrain collision is achieved by a bunch of invisible collision polygons that vaguely conform to where it looks like walls/floors/ceilings are supposed to be.

[p 
	"Also, there's an entire set of levels that involves navigating along mostly dry-land while the gravity changes almost at random, many levels are sprinkled liberally with obstacles or enemies that will kill you instantly upon contact, and there are five long 3D sequences that require literally jumping through hoops to complete.

	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"This movie completes the game on hard mode. Hard Mode differs from easy mode in that there are two additional autoscrollers, bosses have more HP, the collection quests are longer, and several levels have additional barriers that slow you down.
	$LF
	"Oh also there’s one added level that’s not an autoscroller.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This movie does not use the Japanese version of the game, because I did not learn that the Japanese version has less lag on 3D stages until I was nearly halfway through the run and would have had to spend an excessive amount of time retiming everything and probably rewriting portions of the special tools I used to help make this TAS easier.

	" Faster Acceleration
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"About halfway through my first draft of this movie, I realized that there was a faster way to reach top speed that I had been unaware of on my prior TAS.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There are three ways to accelerate in this game: 
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" Pressing the accelerate, which increases Ecco’s speed by a varying amount depending on his current speed and how long the button has been held down. This is most efficient in 12 frame cycles of 11 frames down 1 frame up.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Performing a short charge (charging with initial speed of at least 3 pixels per frame), which immediately increases Ecco’s speed by 4 pixels per frame, followed by overriding normal acceleration for 19 frames of charge acceleration (slower than standard swim acceleration at low initial speeds, faster at high initial speeds), then decreasing Ecco’s speed by .5 pixels per frame for 5 frames before ending and allowing a new charge. (Normal acceleration is possible during these final five frames of the charge). 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Performing a long charge (charging with initial speed below 3 pixels per frame), which immediately increases Ecco’s speed by 4 pixels per frame for 1 frame, followed by 23 frames of base 0.15625 pixels per frame (during which 1 frame worth of standard acceleration can apply for speeds of up to 0.65376 pixels per frame), then 2 frames of 4 pixels per frame per frame acceleration, 3 frames of charge acceleration, and then getting the full cycle of a short charge without the initial speed boost.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"Additionally, any charge can be cancelled at any point via the sonar button, unleashing a damaging sonar blast, and skipping immediately to the final 8 frames of the charge sequence.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"On my prior TAS, I believed fastest acceleration was simply 5 cycles of holding accelerate for 11 frames than releasing it for 1, which achieves maximum speed in 60 frames. 
	$LF
	"While a long charge achieves nearly top speed in 48 frames, it has the long period of near standstill, and then the unavoidable tail of deceleration, resulting in overall less distance covered in the 60 frames it would take to achieve top speed normally. 
	$LF
	"Additionally, I tested performing a single short charge as soon as possible during standard acceleration, and found that it was even slower at the 60 frame mark than a long charge.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"However, if you immediately cancel that short charge, and then follow it with another, non-cancelled short charge, this gets top speed faster than 60 frames, and results in a larger distance travelled at the 60 frame benchmark.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Angle Optimization
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Ecco’s swimming angle can only be changed once every eight frames, and only by intervals of 45 degrees. However, Ecco does not immediately turn to his target angle, but rotates smoothly at 4.21875 degrees per frame until reaching his target angle. As a result, you can achieve average swimming angles in between those 45 degree set-points by alternating directional inputs every 8 frames. In many cases, this results in a shorter distance travelled to navigate around distant obstacles than the old technique of travelling at the nearest 45-degree angle until it’s possible to swim in a straight line past the obstacle.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Nudging
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Because it takes more than 8 frames to turn 45 degrees, hitting a direction once for just eight frames before returning to Ecco’s original angle allows for relatively small position adjustments. Useful for adjusting position in narrow tubes without bumping into walls.

[p 
	"Each collision or detection polygon tests a specific point, box, or subset of these 7 possibilities. With proper information about the shapes and test point of these polygons, it’s possible to swim safely past certain enemies or obstacles in positions that would appear dangerous.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Super-breach
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"By charging on the exact frame Ecco leaves a body of water, he can exit with a velocity of 4 pixels per frame above maximum swim speed.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Jump control
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"When out of the water, if moving upward quickly enough, Ecco can initiate a spin-jump by pressing C. While spin jumping, every frame in which C is held increases Ecco’s height by two pixels versus if C had not been pressed. This allows for very precise control over the timing of re-entering water, so that Ecco can re-enter water at any desired time within the 8-frame steering cycle.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Breaching speed
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"When it is necessary to travel long distances horizontally, speed can be gained by traveling along the ocean surface and repeatedly super-breaching with a very low exit angle.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Camera Manipulation
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Camera position is based on Ecco’s position, angle, and movement speed. Game objects are loaded and unloaded based on their position relative to the camera, and even when loaded, many objects are not fully processed while off-screen. This can used to reduce lag, propel objects through obstacles, and a whole host of other things too varied to list.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Kill Boosting
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Destroying an enemy immediately ends a charge without going through the end-of-charge deceleration sequence. The most common way of doing this is by colliding with the enemy while charging, but that immediately sets your speed to 0, which is even worse than losing a tiny bit of speed to the charge ending.
	$LF
	"However, hitting an enemy with a charge-sonar blast also immediately ends the charge, and doesn’t set your speed to zero. In this way, whenever there’s an enemy in our path, we can gain ~4 pixels by hitting charge to get the single frame 4 pixel speed boost, and then hitting sonar to destroy it before we collide.
	$LF
	"Unfortunately, when an enemy is destroyed, it spawns a remnant star object which changes the meaning of the charge button from “perform a charge” to “prevent this enemy from respawning” when you are within its detection radius, so it’s not possible to get 8 pixel boosts from two enemies that are close together.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Charge Strafing
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"During a charge, Ecco will home onto enemies in a certain detection area. This allows movement perpendicular to the swim direction without a related reduction in swim speed. Helpful to adjust position slightly without having to go through the slow process of changing angles.

	" Ring Manipulation
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The teleport rings in 3D Levels appear in fixed positions. However, their movement type (stationary, slow moving, or fast moving) depends on the random number seed when they are spawned. And the random number seed updates every four frames.
	$LF
	"Teleport rings with the highest spawn location are fastest to pass through when they are slow moving, as their vertical position requires a low enough jump that it’s possible to return to water within a single charge cycle.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Barrier Clipping
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"In certain situations, there are barrier walls composed of a number of smaller objects that check head and tail box collisions. However, within a given frame, the game will stop checking for head collisions after finding a single one, and the game will stop checking for tail collisions after finding a single one. Therefore, depending on the loading order of these objects, it can be possible to swim through these barriers by overlapping the collision box with multiple objects at the same time.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Falling rocks that shield Ecco from currents will assume Ecco’s full vertical speed when his nosehole collides with them closer to their top or bottom than their left or right sides.
	$LF
	"In most cases, though, colliding with one of these rocks will kill most or all of Ecco’s downward speed just before it gets transferred to the rock. However, it is possible to avoid this effect somehow through careful approaches that I was not able to determine full boundary conditions on, but seemed somehow related cases involving corners.

But once the dive-swoop is initiated, the speed can be directed in any of the eight semi-cardinal directions without concern for gravity. This practically doubles the Seagull’s movement speed, and makes it possible to gain or lose height much, much faster than standard seagull flight, as the seagull cannot normally fly upward or downward at a greater than 45 degree angle. Embarrassingly, for the first TAS I wasn’t even aware that standard downward swooping was possible.

[p 
	"So, in 3D levels, constantly charging is the fastest way to move. But Ecco homes very strongly onto 3D Jellyfish, while charging which can make it difficult or impossible to navigate into the rings if jellyfish are in the other direction. So I spent a lot of time manipulating the spawn positions of jellyfish, and sonaring jellyfish to kill them so that I could constantly charge without missing hoops. Jellyfish are also the laggiest of the 3D level enemies.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This level is essentially a long boss fight. There’s a giant conch shell which floats down an undersea ravine, occasionally trying to crush you against the walls, or summoning gigantic eels that kill you nearly instantly. Once the shell settles at the bottom of a ravine, a large eel comes out that you can kill, ending the level.
	$LF
	"So, it turns out that Ecco can push the giant conch shell around. In the first TAS, I never learned this, because you take damage every time you bump it, so I never thought to check actively swimming into it.
	$LF
	"Simply constantly swimming down into it from above saves about 39 seconds. But the speed you run into it also matters, so hitting charge against it whenever possible saves just over 12 seconds more.
	$LF
	"There are some other factors like needing to refill health from occasional schools of fish, and regularly spaced eels in the walls that will kill you in two hits and don’t grant invincibility frames, but these are minor details (that happen to add a huge amount of complication to TASing this boss.)

	"While, in 2D levels, charging into an enemy brings you to a complete stop, in 3D levels, it has no effect on your speed whatsoever, but allows you to charge again immediately. 
	$LF
	"In 3D levels, charging provides acceleration based on a continuous formula that depends only on how many frames are left in the charge. The more frames left, the more acceleration you get.
	$LF
	"Combined, this means that running into as many sharks as possible actually makes the level go faster. So long as you don’t get carried away and forget to hit each ring.

	"But it turns out to be faster to just swim right in front of it in a few places to get it to swim directly at the gate, instead of through a convoluted series of waypoints.

	"I did not do any of the complex math required to prove that my steering is optimal. In fact, I did not even bother to figure out how to pose those math problems. Therefore it is possible that my steering is suboptimal.

	"Multiple real time Ecco speedrunners have reported that, on occasion, for no apparent reason, after a Time Travel cut-scene, the level starts normally, instead of taking a few seconds to make Ecco spin in. I was not able to reproduce this, and, in reverse-engineering the game I was not able to find a code path that should cause this to happen. There was also speculation that it has to do with failing to power-cycle the console before starting a new run after entering the debug/level select code.

	"Multiple real time Ecco speedrunners have reported that, in Vortex Future, they were able to get an antigravity ball to push them through a wall. I could not reproduce this, but also see no reason why the same thing shouldn't work in Black Clouds. Or why Vortex Larva wouldn't be able to do it in City of Forever.

	"Multiple real time speedrunners have video evidence of Ecco "randomly" failing to collide with walls and/or floors in the vortex future levels. I could not reproduce this, but it would allow for significant skips in these levels if the mechanism were determined.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Both Black Clouds and Gravitorbox have the level geometry required to initiate zipping in the way I used in Vortex Future, but due to collision box loading order or other reasons, I was not able to initiate any useful zips in those locations. Again, these would produce significant time saves.
