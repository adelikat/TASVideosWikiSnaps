	"SegaSonic the Hedgehog (yes that is the actual name) is an arcade game that was released in 1993. The game was only ever released in Japan, however unused graphics of SatAM Robotnik found leftover in the game files suggests there was a planned localization for North American audiences. The game plays similar to Sonic 3D Blast, in an isometric pseudo-3D game style. You control one of three characters: Sonic the Hedgehog, Mighty the Armadillo, and Ray the Flying Squirrel, and your job is to navigate through 7 levels filled with traps and obstacles in order to stop Robo- I mean, Eggman's diabolical scheme. Your character is NOT controlled using a d-pad, but a trackball. This can sometimes make the game weird to play, especially if you're acclimated to a d-pad, and it also makes the game extremely difficult to properly emulate. The game is pretty straight-forward, as the only way you can go is forward, because behind you is another one of Eggman's diabolical traps (be it icicles, a collapsing floor, a slope you can clip into (if you know, you know), etc.), and ahead of you is an obstacle course of which you need to navigate. The game does not run on the usual "take damage, lose rings" system that we all know and love. It actually has a health system, where everytime you hit spikes or fall off the edge, you lose a portion of your health. You can regain health by collecting rings, and if you run out of health, then you have to insert a coin to continue or it's game over!

[div class=p 
	"Rings are a very valuable asset in SegaSonic due to the fact that they restore health and allow more room for error. However, this game, like most other Sonic games, has a score tally at the end of every level, save for Eggman's Tower. There, it will tally up the rings you've collected, and if you've collected a certain percentage of rings in the level, will give you bonus rings. But there's one tiny little issue with this: Rings take one frame to tally for every ring you've collected in the level. Since this is the case, rings are best avoided, since you have enough health to make it to the end with the damage boosts used in the run. 6 out of 7 levels can be beaten without collecting rings, and the minimum rings needed to beat the game is two. So two frames are lost over the course of the run, meanwhile several more frames are saved due to skipping rings. As mentioned in a post in the old submission, jumping over rings (to my knowledge) does not cost much, if any momentum at all, so you don't have to weave around rings.

	"After selecting your character, the game begins with a tutorial which can be skipped with the player 1 jump button. Then the game will play a roughly 10 second cutscene setting up the story of the game. After the cutscene, you are required to jump into the bars to break them. 14 frames were saved by going for the closest bar to Sonic instead of going right. After walking through the doorway to the outside, you will be launched into the first level, Volcanic Vault.

	"This level is pretty straightforward, however some things happen that are not intended. When running down the first slope at the start, a boulder is supposed to be following right behind you. But if you have optimal movement and proper positioning, you will activate a glitch called the "boulder glitch." After the slope, spinning the trackball will speed up the mini-cutscene of Sonic being launched upwards by said boulder, saving over half a second. Then you open some grates, climb the bridge that collapsed, avoid some lava geysers, and finally, end the level.

	"Icy Isle is... well, an ice level. Gaining forward momentum is slower than the last level, and the ground is very slippery, which can lead to you falling off the edge. In fact, I do fall off the edge towards the monkey bars section. The original method was just to run up to the edge, which would cause Sonic to fall off if you do not hold a direction perpendicular to the edge. However, earlier today (at the time of me submitting this), I discovered a faster way to fall off of ledges! What you want to do is instead of being on the ground when you fall off, you jump up, which will cause Sonic to do an animation of him flapping his arms in the air. If you hold left while Sonic is doing this animation, he will move for a frame, and then fall off the edge. There are actually two ways to do this:

[ul 
	[li 
		" You can jump earlier, which, after holding left, will cause Sonic to do the cartoony animation of him just falling out of the air.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" You can jump within a 3 frame window of balancing, which will cause Sonic to fall through the floor facing backwards. This is 5 frames faster than the air fall, and is a lot more stylish than the former method.

	"Trap Tower has very big rolling cylinders that attempt to crush Sonic if he does not move quickly. It also features these square crushers with spikes that also try to crush Sonic. Normally, you have to wait for a couple of them to raise up to be able to move on. However, there is a very small spot on the edge of the pathway where you can run right past ALL of the crushers and save about a second over waiting for them to raise back up! There is one spot where you need to move in to dodge the electric poles that come out of the ground, and get back into the same position on the edge, which is certainly not easy as one small mistake can lead to either you hitting the crusher, or falling off the edge.

	"After leaving Trap Tower, one of the cylinders comes out of the tower and starts a chain reaction of the floor completely falling away. You have to navigate throughout the pathway without falling out of the sky, while avoiding boulders and outrunning the collapsing floor. There is a section where you are supposed to grab some vines and watch Sonic swing on them for a little bit. However, we can skip this by falling off the edge. When we fall off the edge, we get an intentional game over, and we insert a coin and continue the game. This places us on the other side of the vines, allowing us to skip them. This saves a second and a half, or 91 frames over taking the vines normally. There is actually a faster method that involves spawning in the second player after you kill off the first player, however, as this is a "one player" run, this is not shown, but it does save another second over the shown method. Before we get to the boss, we encounter some fiery boulders that we are supposed to navigate around. But going around them is too slow! A speedrunner named

	" showed me a trick that involves going inbetween the boulders, which saved yet another 15 frames. After the boulders, you come to the first and only boss fight in the game. However, instead of fighting the boss normally, we're going to use a trick to cheese the fight! Before getting up to the boss platform, I turn around and hit the fiery boulder to take damage. After landing, I bump into the boss to get a bounce back, and then I jump into a precise position into the boss, which gets me stuck bouncing between two invisible walls on the boss, which gets all of the hits in very quickly and eventually ends the level! Hitting the fiery boulder was 14 frames faster than the old method of hitting the electric fence. Taking damage at an earlier point will mess up the trick, so we want to not take damage before we get up to the platform.

	"After Sonic gets jinxed by Eggman, he falls down into a little Water Way down below. Down there, there are some Wild turtles and little badniks that reside in these gray blocks. We can jump into these blocks to break them, which rewards us with rings. But Spectral showed me that we can actually use these blocks to boost us forward! By jumping above the blocks with forward momentum, changing momentum completely backwards right before hitting it can give a massive boost forwards, which is much faster than walking! All in all, this trick saved 20 frames over not using the boosts! After climbing out of the water, we climb up onto the ledge and come to the first of two unavoidable rings. Performing frame perfect jumps on the little rafts in the next Wild Water Way allow for quicker forward movement, as just walking on them slows you down since the rafts are going the opposite direction. After climbing another wall, instead of going up onto the ledge immediately, we go as far left as we can, and THEN climb up. After collecting the last unavoidable ring, we can make a blind jump onto the next set of rafts and finish the level! The blind jump saved half a second over the old method of waiting.

Collecting rings during this sequence does not matter at this point, since we do not get a score tally upon leaving. Once we exit the doorway, we are greeted with the ending cutscene and SegaSonic the Hedgehog is officially beaten!
