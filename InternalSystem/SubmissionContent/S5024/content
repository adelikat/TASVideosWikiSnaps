	">Warning: I'd like to suggest who want to watch the run by my Youtube Encode, because I got some random desyncs in Hanzo x Galford fight when Galford cut Hanzo to get the timeover glitch I don't know if will happen with someone, so if you're having this problem I suggest to watch the encode, anyway the run generally don't give any desyncs itself if you continue watching the run but if Hanzo isn't was cut so the run will continue normally, but the right time will be Galford cutting Hanzo in the right timeover frame to get the glitch.

	$LF
	"When I watched the current playaround I got interested, and I decided to make one and I could show awkward stuff of other characters that was missed. Among them are Haohmaru and Nakoruru that I looked for bring their best things, moreover I drove the run towards some more than a simple playthrough by adding 2 players and presenting variety and stunning combos, glitches and bugs.

[p 
	"Basara is literally a bad character in combo terms, my choice in this fight was because Basara has this bug and Nakoruru which have cool combos, to do it you just need to leave him on the ground followed by a sword attack, it need to be in the right frame or it won't works, the effect: Basara make a kind of suicide and the screen freeze for sometime.

	"Galford can pass through the out side to explore the obscure screen, while Hanzo practice their ninja arts fading away from the screen, a easy glitch just need to do a Replica Attack with B+D and doing a tech roll with Galford, to disappear with Hanzo just do Ninpo Utsusemi after the tech roll.

	"As I told above, I choose Ukyo because he has better techniques and combos.
	$LF
	"Ukyo can't be a bad choice, he has some interesting tricks which can be really useful in TAS or in a casual match, most of them are based on back throws and cancel moves.
	$LF
	"On corners do back throws followed by forward, forward, down, forward+C it will allow you to do Hiken Tsubame Gaeshi without need to be in air.
	$LF
	"On same corner do medium punch (b) followed by a+b the punch will be cancelled into the dodge, you will be able to do more 2 hits with this technique.
	$LF
	"Also according to combovideos and some tests, Ukyo is probably the only character which can get 99 hits.
