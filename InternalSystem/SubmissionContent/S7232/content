	"This classic game is about a diamond chase underground with many obstacles. Try - as Rockford - to collect all required diamonds in a total of 16 caves (A-P) each with 5 difficulty levels, and find the exit in the time given. After every 4 caves (D, H, L, P) follows a so-called "intermission", a logical puzzle (without its own "cave letter"). Rockford can dig through the ground and push rocks. But these can also be dangerous. If he stands directly below a rock, Rockford can hold it on his head. But if a rock falls on his head, it will cost him a life. Rocks will not stay on each other or on walls. If Rockford digs away the supporting soil, rocks will start to slide. Furthermore, there are some not-so-friendly animals such as fireflies, amoeba and other things you'd better not touch. Butterflies and other inhabitants of the underground can only be defeated by letting rocks fall on them. When defeated, they turn into diamonds, which Rockford can pick up. As soon as the necessary amount of jewels has been collected (the number is shown in the upper bar), the escape tunnel opens into the next level. Strategy and thoughtful planning is the basis to master this game.

	"Once again, another game that I used to play on the Commodore 64 in my youth. As usual, this game was difficult enough that I could never get past the first few levels. There are no official speed-runs that I could find, for comparison; however, runs do exist but don't seem to be serious enough for me to provide.

Not knowing where the timer falls, it was an experiment of constant tests...when coming in proximity to these obstacles. Knowing how you would react,  within their deadly touch, could be determined and routing would be adjusted to make the best of the situation. Other than that, RNG was only an issue for Cave G.

As I learned more and more about this game, I had to go back and redo rooms before Cave G...which meant that I was Re-BOTing it in its entirety. This is where about 90,000 re-records came from.
