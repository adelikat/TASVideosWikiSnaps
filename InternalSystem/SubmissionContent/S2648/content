	"Virtual Boy Wario Land is one of the few releases for the Virtual Boy platform.  Arguably Nintendo's biggest flop the Virtual Boy sold it as a "Virtual reality" experience using goggles that sent separate video streams to each eye to create a parallax effect.  Unfortunately the seizure inducing red monochrome, the awkward interface, and lack of a virtual reality experience resulted in a

	"Virtual Boy Wario Land was a platformer released for the Virtual Boy system in 1995.  The main objective of the game is to traverse the 14 levels.  Each level has a key you must find in order to open up the next level.  There are treasures hidden along the way.  This TASes gets no treasures and thus achieves the "bad ending".

		" Alternating L and R quickly stops momentum, this can be used for quick turn arounds

	[li 
		" While Bull charge flying, tapping the jump button allows him to do a jumping bull charge.  This can be exploited to do a double jump and reach areas that shouldn't be possible (such as getting the key early in Level 13).
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Faster swimming - This makes the swimming level look drunk.  When swimming, Wario has a pushing forward, pulling back pattern.  Hitting into things at the peak of the forward momentum can cancel out the pulling back momentum.  The result is drunk, but it saves time. Eh, I hope that made sense.

	"Frame rule:
	$LF
	"Level 13 is the biggest frame rule in TAS history, 1500 frames!  That is the interval that the clock is on that gives the key.  I get there about 600 frames into the frame rule and thus have 900 to kill.  The result is rather unelegant time killing.
