James should be very careful with them. Changed sequence of rescue of first three girls, long time i was unable to choose between the best route 
	"[R->U->L]
	" and second-best route 
	"[R->L->U]
	". Minor changes in the middle, for example catch rope at specific Y-position, this and only this position, allow effectively use damage to save time. Ignore Q-pack also not get cartridge clips. Completely new route for the last the last third of level - skipped boss by neat pixel-perfect jump. To pass long moving vertical platform in end of level in one cycle instead of two cycles.

Changed route rescue of the third girl, used bottom path. there is no hand to hand combat in the game however James is well known master contactless battles, and even without using hands he can help guards take a hot bath in lava while waiting elevator. As preparation for fourth girl activate both moving platforms, vertical and then horisontal as soon as possible. While waiting these platforms James have a free time to play with Mayday. Mayday was disagreed to be bondaged and wait J.B. like all other girls, nope, she prefers more aggressive role of dominatrix. It's not that James like, but after all he managed to find the path even to her cruel heart. Get a Q-pack with grenades {= checkpoint} and only then run to "rescue" the last girl. To skip way back used yet one death as shortcut.

	") from research and development division of MI6 to built special spy gadget (lua script) to be able to measure exact interval between a volleys of fire. Result of testing says me that safety window to make skip possible is exist, about after 11 seconds from moment when flamethrower starts working. Jumping around while waiting. Sadly that so long waiting necessary, but anyway it is the great timesaver, patience is a virtue. Also skip killing boss at the end of level.

		"Jaws

	", you arch enemy is back and makes a last desperate attempt to kill you. Only if you manage to defeat Jaws this time will you be able to escape to safety. Greater half of improvement by smart using extra grenades, second half come from minor tactic changes and small tricks, like cancel of pistol re-charging animation and some additional shots during jumps. Actually it was an interesting fight, at least i enjoyed optimising it.

In addition to the new map routes and optimizations, stage 3 was especially notable in incorporating deaths to save time, as well as the ingenuity of taking damage from an enemy's bullet to "bypass" Bond's fall limit.  It was also nice to see the time savings made on the final boss, via use of grenades.  Overall, very nice work!
