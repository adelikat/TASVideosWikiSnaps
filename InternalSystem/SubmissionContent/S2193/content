	"The main difference between the two movies is the BOSS fight.A bug was used to change the protagonist into a SUPERMAN,who can beat anybody in one turn.Now is the principle of the bug:at least two persons,at least two tanks,then use a health-recovering capsule(in the movie I bought four at the beginning) at the bottom of the menu's right side.Then the protagonist's strength could be changed from 20 to 2000 or more.BUT this bug has a shortcomings:just after one battle the protagonist will come to normal.AND in the very last BOSS fight with Noah he will stop the war and talk a lot than start the war again.So I can't use the bug here,and the last part of this movie is almost the same to the old run.

	"Another bug I used is copying tank.Not all the tanks can be copied.The only available one is the first tank in the town where I get the first partner.The partner is an engineman.When I arrived in this town he saw my tank,then he run to me and wanted to join my adventure.Exactly when he got onto my tank I opened the memu and choosed "got on".And then there'll be two same tanks.I use this bug to save the time to rent the new partner a new tank.
