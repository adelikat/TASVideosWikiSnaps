	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Backdashing for one frame pushes the RNG the same amount as two hits. Destroying a chandelier or a candleholder pushes about 30 hits. Killing an enemy also pushes about 30 hits, but some enemies with longer death animations can push the RNG equal to 200 to 250 hits (especially Hell Boars and Slaughterers).

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Making the intro level optimal is fairly easy. Just kill the enemies on the first possible frame. I had an idea for a glitched soul/level-up screen on the Golem with the help of the Armor Knight soul, but it seems avoiding the soul travel for that long might be impossible. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I use a curious glitch on the Golem, I cancel a normal attack into a special attack on the first possible frame it spawns, which allows me to connect two special attacks in one swing. This seems to only be possible on enemies that are spawning, so fairly useless for the rest of the run.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The game starts with the Peeping Eye soul, the rarest soul in the game. How very nice. Right off the bat I start manipulating by adding hits to my movement pattern. I noticed that adding hits sometimes puts your momentum at 0, and sometimes bumps it up to 14336 (normally it just oscillates between 13784 and 11384). Turns out this is bug of some sorts, you don't actually gain any speed, nor lose any. Bizarre.
	$LF
	"In my ignorance I diligently avoided adding hits when it would bump to 0, it was not until later in the run in which I actually checked if this was any more than just a visual error.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Another interesting thing about the movement pattern is that if you start any sort of animation after the duck, it gets cancelled after 1 frame. This is really good when using bullet souls or Knives, since it takes Knives only 1 frame to connect. Sadly Knives kind of suck when compared to other weapons, so we won't be seeing it for that terribly long.

	" Flying Armor (250 hit points)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"He has several offensive attacks and a dodge maneuver of some sorts, where he swoops diagonally up and delays his first attack by some seconds. Generally when he does an attack he moves slightly in a direction, this being decided by the RNG upon entering the room. I wanted him to swoop either left or down. I went with down since it was much much easier to connect the very last Axe Armor hit than it was when he was going left, and well, it turned out to be faster since I could be closer to the ground. I showcase a curious trick on the last hit; on the last frame of a backdash it is possible to do something akin to the movement pattern trick I mentioned earlier - any and all animation is cancelled after the first frame. This allows me to throw an Axe and hit him while in the air, on 2 consecutive frames. This took quite some time to achieve, cause I needed to be in the right position on the right frame. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Since the last hit delivered on him is still in the air, it gives me quite some time to move towards the door. The seal is drawn on the center of the screen, and Soma will automatically move and stand to the left of the seal during the cutscene. The soul is collected while still in the cutscene, but you are allowed 1 frame of movement after confirming a soul screen so I use this one frame to slide towards the door. This caused less lag than a backdash and gave a very very slight edge in distance.

Anyone who has played Dawn of Sorrow knows that the Katanas are among the best weapons in the game, with a 2 frame connection time and a 9 frame cooldown (the Axe has 40 frame cooldown, to compare), and will be used pretty much for the rest of the game. Blunt Swords do drop from the Barbariccias, but this is ages away and the Blunt Sword is too good to pass up. Keep note of the way I pick up the Bomber Armor soul, I will refer to it later just before Gergoth.

[p 
	"I kill a Golem to upgrade the soul, it's a level 9 soul which adds 2 strength for each soul acquired. While Golem will not be used for that terribly long, it's still the best soul early on and I will tackling a lot of bosses in succession, so higher damage is always nice.

The general idea is the same however; standing on his fists is a good way to land many blows in rapid succession.

[p 
	"I started with the double hit attack. While the 2nd attack probably allows me to land more hits, dodging it is actually very tricky.

When he is hit by an ability, he is first stunned, then he stands up and channels for a while and then he copies that ability for the rest of the fight or until another ability is used on him.

The second Draghignazzo dropped his soul very early and after that not for another 250 random numbers or so (rough estimate, I tested for a few hours before I gave up, never actually found the soul), so I definitely didn't want to go too far on this one.

At this point he has roughly 900 hp, I added a kick from max altitude which does 495 damage with Devil. So the rest of the fight is very very short.

	"The Tanjellys illuminate the darkness, which is pretty cool I suppose. The darkness makes it extremely hard to see if a soul drops, so that was fun. The Gaibon and Slogra all have extremely bad positions and really bad soul travels. Nothing much do to about that I fear.

	"Death required some really good manipulation. I wanted him to start out with a normal attack first, and then swoop up into the middle of the room. I used a lot of mana on the first form to kill him in the right position before he flew too high up. In the second phase I want him to do his scythe throw attack. While it is nigh impossible to dodge, I can just take damage from one of the small scythes and the big one will not be a problem, while still allowing me to continue hitting him. The mana is extremely tight here, my mana runs out on the same frame the last hit connects, I don't even have time to turn off Devil.

	"Starting out with the only Arc Demon in the game, which a very rare soul with extremely little space for manipulation. How nice. Luckily I get the soul on the first try. I had to consume a Mind Up here, so I could use Devil to kill him. While at it I changed my offgear bullet soul to Imp. I thought this was a good move until I remembered that all souls effects and missile disappear upon changing gear, so I was forced to change my offweapon to Kotetsu aswell.

	"It is a shame that Hippogryph soul is so late into the game. It is my favorite movement soul in the game. It gives you endless amounts of jumps if you use Hippogryph on the same frame as a jump. The Hippogryph movement pattern is about 0.5% faster than the normal movement pattern but at times it causes a little more lag, so you can see me switching a little bit now and then.

	"This boss is super easy. One of the few bosses in the game where Dead Pirate is useful. I had to manipulate him to jump high the first thing he did and then immediately start an attack without turning around. This allows me to make full effect of the Dead Pirate.

	"The last soul in the game is the WakWak tree. It is horribly out of the way and takes quite some time to get. Again I opted to collect it when I had the Black Panther for obvious reasons. The Imp reduces the life of each branch to 1. The soulpickup allows me to backdash during the gate opening cutscene. While a slide would get me further it is so much slower that by the time it's over I have already regained control for 10 frames.

	"Menace is really annoying, since his heads are in such awkward positions. I used Guillotiner a lot since it does a lot of damage with a high cooldown and relatively low mana cost. The vertical hitbox is huge aswell, making it possible for me to stand on the ground and cast it to damage his first phase.

[p 
	"In his second phase he is a little simpler. The head on his legs is really easy due to the platform next to it. You only have to manipulate him to move back and forth to land maximum amount of hits. While waiting for him to move back I cast 2 Guillotiner on the upper head, which saves me some time later. After the lower head is destroyed I change to Malacoda. The upper head can only be damaged for 1 frame before it is invulnerable until the next time he opens his mouth. Malacoda hits extremely hard for only 15 mana per hit. The Malacoda soul however locks you in an animation and canceling that animation by landing or backdashing causes the tail to disappear. I had to use the backdash trick to cancel the Malacoda animation while in the air which allowed me to land single hits. This saved a lot of time since it reduced the amount of Malacoda hits by one and the head has a massive cooldown between hits.
