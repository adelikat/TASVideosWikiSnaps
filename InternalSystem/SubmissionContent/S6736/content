	"Bonk 3: Bonk's Big Adventure is the final Bonk game to be released for the PC Engine/Turbografx16. This one adds a new twist with candy powerups that allow Bonk to change size to become tiny or big. The plot of the game is quite simple: King Drool, villain of the first two games, decided to steal the top half of the moon. AGAIN. Maybe he ran out of ideas or really liked that specific half of the moon.
