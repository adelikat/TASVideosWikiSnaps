	"Goof Troop is a really fun game in which you control Goofy and Max. The goal is to make your way through 5 levels, and kill the boss at the end of each level. You usually need to pick up items such as keys and hookshots to advance through a room, that's what makes this game more non-linear.

[div class=p 
	"Max is faster than Goofy when they're not carrying anything, but when carrying an item, Goofy is fastest. To put things short, Max is a fast and agile character, while Goofy is a strong and slow character. Goofy deals 5 damage per thrown pot, while Max deals 4 damage. Goofy also picks up items a little faster.

	"Overall, I saved time in almost every room. By watching RAM addresses, I moved exactly as many pixels as necessary. In many rooms it's just to move from one door to another, so there isn't anything else to improve here besides optimizing movements.

	"Puzzles are completed a lot faster. I kick the blocks as soon as possible, and in a position that allows me to reach the next block faster. In some puzzles I also modify the solution a little, making it even faster.

]div
[div class=p 
	"I switch roles of Goofy and Max sometimes. For example, I pick up the board with Max on level 2, instead of with Goofy. These strategic changes are done mainly because Max moves faster, making me reach the place where I need to use that item a little sooner.

[div class=p 
	"Bosses are killed faster. This is because of better luck manipulation. Some bosses can be a pain to manipulate, the skeletons on level 3 is a good example. I did my best to manipulate optimal behaviour from them, but it's likely that they can still be somewhat improved. The boss on level 4 does not die when you have drained all it's HP, instead it dies after a certain number of hits. In fact, I deal more damage to them than Frenom does, but they still die at the same hit. :(

	"This run was at times very hard to make. It's hard to have an overview of both's characters X and Y position, on a subpixels level. I controlled Goofy with my gamepad and Max with my keyboard. I've gotten quite used to this was of TASing by now. :) I used gocha's memery viewing tool throughout the whole run, and it was invaluable. I also used TAS movie editor a few times, and it worked just fine.
