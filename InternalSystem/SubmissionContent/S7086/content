	"While driving the roads of New Mexico, California, or even Eastern Europe, you may find your way blocked by a pace of donkeys.  The question is whether Bill Gates had such an experience.  Odd question, you say?  Well, what else would cause someone to write 
	[a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DONKEY.BAS rel=noopener external nofollow 
		"DONKEY.BAS

	"?  Perhaps that question will never be answered.  We do know, however, that Gates's game inspired a

	": This game is an autoscroller, so you reach the end at the same time as long as you switch the lanes on time. You move upwards a little bit after every new donkey/ass that you dodge, which leaves you a little less time to react to the next one, but it resets after each new point you score. So across all levels, the difficulty isn't increasing. And it's basically a timed game. So it's too trivial of a game, and too BASIC to even speedrun.

	"Additionally, it's a somewhat obscure port, compared to the original game, and it's inferior because it doesn't have the windows informing you that "Donkey loses!", and about the game end after 10 points. But even the original game won't be acceptable due to the same gameplay problems.
