	"As I hinted at up top, the published "all levels" movie of M.C. Kids has long been considered one of the most outdated movies on the site (it's just a few months away from turning 15 years old). This is best noted by the fact that it predated a version of the any% that was beaten by close to a minute over a decade ago! Well, with all these new tactics and tricks that have since been found out, a new coat of paint was long needed, and I've finally been able to slay the beast, or something like that, whatever, enjoy.:p

	"The goal of this branch is basically what it seems like, to beat every level in M.C. Kids. You'll know you've done it if Ronald doesn't mention Puzzleland in his ending message. To do this, you have to collect every card in the game. Most of the cards are normal, but there are several "Secret" cards in each world that need collecting to. I chose to play as the other character in this run, just for some variety.

[div class=p 
	"This was first used in Aglar's old any% movie from 2009, and it saves a ton of time in pretty much every level. It's simple: if you jump the first frame the player moves, the character accelerates significantly faster than usual. The max speed achieved with this trick is 127, which can usually only be found from running on slope.

	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"If you walk off a ledge into a boat, duck at the last second, keep holding down, then press B while in the boat, for some reason your player and the boat will zip up and to the right, which can be used to go into (or through) walls. So far this only has one use, in 3-6 to get both cards without having to play the level twice like inthe old movie.

[div class=p 
	"In 4-2, you're meant to go upside down to grab the card, which takes a fair chunk of time. However, if you have maximum speed and very perfect x/y subpixel, you can clip into the trampoline for just enough boost to grab it without doing that.
