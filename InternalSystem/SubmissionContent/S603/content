	"This is the Super Adapter-less run which Gigafrost didn't want to spend more time trying out. The belief in getting Super Adapter was that while you lost time collecting the pieces, you'd gain time fighting Shade Man with it and at the various places where there's large pits or spiked floors you'd use it to get over. If you opt to collect Rush Jet instead, that turns out not to be true. So yeah.

	"For programming errors, Bass lets you hit him twice quickly as the last two hits, and in Junk Man's stage I took some damage right as I entered the door out of the elevator which let me get some more horizontal distance as the door was closing. There was also this weird glitch in Burst Man's stage, where I destroy the body of that robot baddie, yet it doesn't disappear; however I could slide through as if it wasn't there so it didn't affect anything *shrug*.
