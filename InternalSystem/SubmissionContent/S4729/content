	"All of us agreed that route designing was the most important part. At start we designed 2 completely different routes, which are surprisingly close in terms of time, and we chose the wrong one at first. And when we learnt how the new Catoblepas/Gorgon glitch works, we designed the third route which was presented in this run and started over again. Thanks to this and heavy luck manipulations, the rerecord count reaches more than 300 thousand.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Also known as “Super Catoblepas/Gorgon Glitch”, this glitch allows Julius to teleport much farther with a Catoblepas/Gorgon. When a Catoblepas/Gorgon is turning around, the game calculates the distance of movement of the character standing on it, by the character’s horizontal displacement from a certain frame during turning to the last frame before the game moves the character. So when Julius moves fast toward the same direction during turning, he could be teleported really far. Furthermore, an enemy will freeze when outside the screen, and using this trick may give Julius more time to move, thus teleport even farther.

[p 
	"This glitch, however, is not a glitch found by us. When Darkman, or 黑暗人, discovered 
	[a class=extlink href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZlE0JWRvQI rel=nofollow 
		"the way for Julius to access Julius room
	]a
	" couple of years ago, he was using this glitch. Since that seems to be the only approach for Julius meeting Julius himself, this glitch is necessary there. However, this glitch can also be used to replace any old-fashioned Catoblepas/Gorgon Glitch, and at the other places for warping.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This glitch is also applicable to Soma. If you are trying this glitch, remember the following rule: When the character is inside a wall, if he is at the left border of the screen he can slide towards left and warp to another room; but if he is at the right border of the screen he is unable to warp anyway. If one could warp toward right, there would be a shorter way to access Julius room.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This is a brand-new glitch that we found occasionally when fighting with Headhunter, related to the floating platforms. When Julius jumps onto a floating platform from somewhere below it, using Grand Cross on the frame he lands on the floating platform will make Julius free to move before the Grand Cross finishes. During that period, Julius may do anything normally except for using subweapons, and take damage, while the Grand Cross is still dealing damage.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Another version of this glitch is when Julius begins or ends a teleport between teleport rooms, Grand Cross could be used and when a teleporting animation finishes he can move with the Grand Cross. Darkman and hellagels found this glitch independently, but this glitch is nothing more than entertaining.

Under most time, when the character moves horizontally, lower Y position can lead to fewer black screen time; when moves vertically, not being too near to a wall can lead to fewer black screen time.
