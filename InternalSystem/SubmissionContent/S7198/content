	"Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse is the story of Trevor Belmont's battle against Dracula from the times before Simon's battle in Castlevania. In this complex and difficult game, there are three playable allies whom Trevor can recruit: Alucard (Dracula's son), Grant DaNasty (a pirate captain), and Sypha Belnades (a mystic warlord).

	"Unlike those other runs, which are played by recruiting Grant, Alucard or Sypha, this run has been completed with only Ralph Belmont. The methods of passing Stage 1, Stage 3 and the battle of Dracula are the same as the Samhain-Grim version.

	(__wikiLink|displaytext=this post|href=/Forum/Posts/508174)
	", this run loses time all throughout when compared to the 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Sypha run, which is the most comparable to this route|href=/3360M)
	". On top of that, we already have a published 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Trevor only run that uses an alternate path not seen in any of our other runs|href=/2753M)
	", making a second Trevor only publication redundant. I highly recommend studying our published CV3 runs and trying to improve the Sunken City path run if you are still interested in TASing Trevor only.
