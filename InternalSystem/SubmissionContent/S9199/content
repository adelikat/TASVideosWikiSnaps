	"This game is a clone of Lunar Lander, published by Commodore in 1981.  It is a single player arcade style game where you control a lander so that it finds it way to one of three landing sites. The goal is to land softly so that your craft is not destroyed.

[ul 
	[li 
		"Landing burns: When done at the right time, you can softly land. The screen switches between an overall view and a focused view. The transition between these two needs to be played with, as you can change some characteristics and enable a faster landing.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Landing speed Indicator:In terms of optimization, it is quickest to ensure that the "Meters Per Second" gauge reads the loest "yellow" position possible. By doing so, the bonus will not take a long...thus getting back to the next landing as soon as possible.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Landing Order: Because of the bonus multiplier, it is best to keep the "10X" for last, since it takes up more time, tallying the bonus points.

Basically, his idea was to reach the landing site without any consideration of destruction. On the other hand, I felt it necessary to protect the lander from damage or explosion.
