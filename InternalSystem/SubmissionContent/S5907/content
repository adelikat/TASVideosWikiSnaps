	"We meet our character when he arrives at Las Vegas. Like a lot of people, He hope he will become a millionaire during his stay in Las Vegas. But his mind is gonna' totally change when he enters in the Super Caesars Palace ! He sees hundreds of stressed people playing slot machines because they don't have enough money to come back home if they don't win this time. He sees thousands others on playing tables who are stripped of their clothes because they lost everything ! Our character is completely scared of this place and flees this city where the demon of the game takes everyone and never releases them !
