[div class=p 
	"Throughout the movie I manipulate luck when I can to make enemies drop extra lives (still rare) and bolts. I also manipulate luck to force bosses to delay as little as possible. Examples of the later include Turbo Man and the final battle against Wily.

[div class=p 
	"Well, perhaps it wouldn't be appropriate to include this considering I obtained the Rush Adaptor and didn't spend two months to see if not getting it was faster, but it *might* be faster. In any case, getting the Rush Adaptor makes the second group of bosses (Shade Man, Turbo Man, Slash Man, Spring Man) look a hell of a lot smoother. Those of you who saw my first version might recall that the Slash Man battle looked like shit (well compared to fighting him with the Noise Crush). Without the Rush Adaptor I would either have to fight Shade Man or Spring Man with the normal buster, both of whom spend a good amount of time too high to be hit. So, that's the trade-off.
