	"Well, I've been working on it for a few months (thanks to homework and anime, heh), but Mega Man can finally return to kick Wily's butt again! Hopefully y'all will enjoy this movie as much as I do. :)

	]br
	$LF
	"If you get hit at the same exact time you go through a mid-boss type door the movement from being damaged can force you into the door. (Note that in my movie I went through the door backwards to gain a little distance)

	]br
	$LF
	"Specifically, even though Slash Man died (at Wily Stage 4) the boss music continued playing until I left the room.

[p 
	"About manipulation of luck:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Throughout the movie I manipulate luck when I can to make enemies drop extra lives (still rare) and bolts. I also manipulate luck to force bosses to delay as little as possible. Examples of the later include Turbo Man and the final battle against Wily.

	"About fastest time:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Well, perhaps it wouldn't be appropriate to include this considering I obtained the Rush Adaptor and didn't spend two months to see if not getting it was faster, but it *might* be faster. In any case, getting the Rush Adaptor makes the second group of bosses (Shade Man, Turbo Man, Slash Man, Spring Man) look a hell of a lot smoother. Those of you who saw my first version might recall that the Slash Man battle looked like shit (well compared to fighting him with the Noise Crush). Without the Rush Adaptor I would either have to fight Shade Man or Spring Man with the normal buster, both of whom spend a good amount of time too high to be hit. So, that's the trade-off.
