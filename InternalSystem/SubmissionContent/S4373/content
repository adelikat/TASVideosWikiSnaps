Every time you play the cave's layout is supposed to be different, but now the Spelunker guy decides to make sure the cave is in his favour by finding everything he needs in no time before zipping his way to the end.

However if you're about to, the game will try to move you upwards by up to three blocks to avoid dying. If there's still wall after three blocks, you die. In this TAS however, I use it to travel extremely long distances in order to reach the end in no time. It can also be used to telefrag (instantly kill) any enemy except for the boss without it counting on your kills. This means it's possible to kill a shopkeeper and steal all their stuff without ending up on their wanted list. It's also used extensively in order to manipulate the RNG, which is why I teleport more than what's necessary to reach the end.

If you throw a lot of bombs at the same spot, it causes a chain reaction where they'll fly around randomly and explode everywhere.

			"Olmec's Lair
		]b
		" The boss room with Olmec. He's invulnerable to everything except lava, which is conveniently placed below the thick floor. I first throw a bomb to the right before teleporting myself to where Olmec is. Interestingly the thrown bomb will land exactly in the hole to the left of Olmec, which is important since I need the bombs to explode as soon as possible. Before it does that I climb down into this hole by crawling over the edge, making the Spelunker guy jump down and grab onto the ledge. This traps me in the hole however, but I made sure to bring my teleporter with me down so I can teleport out when the time is right. Normally jumping down from a ledge makes you lose your held item, but by taking out your rope, the game makes you drop that item instead. I throw a bomb inside the hole and wait a while before teleporting out and placing another bomb on the ground. The first two bombs are used to make a hole beneath Olmec for me to use later and the third bomb is for a bomb chain reaction later as well. After Olmec stomps and the first two bombs explode, I throw down the third bomb at the entrance to the new hole and climb it down the same way as earlier. Down there I throw out all other bombs I have and teleport out before the third bomb sets off the chain reaction. Then I teleport around to manipulate the RNG so the bombs will blow up the rest of the ground beneath Olmec and he drops into the lava. I have to wait a while for Olmec to properly melt before I can exit the level and win the game.
