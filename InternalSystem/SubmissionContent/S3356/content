	"Originally AnS debugged and dumped many useful informations regarding the game's objects (IDs, memory regions for different type of objects, etc). What I mostly did is experimenting with different inputs while watching the memory, what memory locations changes to what values. He mentions  that the "end of the level" object ID is 0x7F, which means you may press R+L+D+U+T+S+B (2^7+2^6+2^5+2^4+2^3+2^2+2^1 = 0x7F) on one of the "control" frames (the 2nd or 4th frame you respawn) to affect the desired address and "spawn" Level End!
	$LF

[p 
	"This only works if you die with a jet before actually loading the new, different "game rules", when you normally would pass through the checkpoint bar. Luckily, I didn't have to manipulate the pointer where it should get loaded, so only the object ID needed (and different objects need different memory locations, and most of them doesn't work because of the glitched up state).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Since you have to press T to input 0x7F, the 1st frame contains that T to do a pause-unpause very fast. The A on P1 pad 4th frame and R on P2 pad used to also ignore many lag frames.

	"It's actually much more complex and elaborate, debugging it would take months or more, so just to show the possibilities of this special state: pressing different buttons before respawn changes more than 100 memory values, also the pointers go wrong, the game could halt easily, you can also get a glitched game over screen and many more funny things that feos already found. The only possible improvement should be somehow moving the pointer before pressing the desired input (0x55 to warp 2 levels) on the 2nd or 4th frame. This can be done by manipulating the pointer location (which could be done mostly by trial and error because of huge craziness in the game logic) then dying and pressing the object ID's input on the next time you respawn.

After this, feos came up with a very impressive route by going through these crucial areas to finish the level without staying in bounds through the whole time (which is slower than going out of bounds).

	"However, this submission file has a 2 frame save possibility, which didn't made use of because the game has a timing rule: starting a level on an odd frame is different than starting it on an even frame. I realized that it's possible to shorten the cutscene before level 8 which leads to a faster respawn by 2 frames. This 2 frames is reserved because this level's route (the input used throughout the run) changes the boss movement pattern and also has to slowdown on some spots because you would get a much more problematic route (you have to avoid the 2nd enemy by going slower by 1 frame, later you have to go 1 frames slower again to skip being electrified). This means that it's not 100% you could improve this run by starting faster this level.
