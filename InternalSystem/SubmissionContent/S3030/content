	"After having finished Vampire Killer, I looked around for a few other possible MSX games to TAS. At first, Contra seems simple enough, run right
	$LF
	"and shoot things. In addition, the completion time was considerably shorter than Vampire Killer, so, eventually, using a run of Vampier's as a base again,
	$LF
	"in the matter of a few weeks, I created a testrun at 12:56. With far better lag management, optimization and better knowledge of the game mechanics, 
	$LF
	"I manage to improve 155 seconds over my testrun, with a final time of 10:21.
	$LF
	"Creating this run was far more work-intensive than Vampire Killer. Whereas I started and finished the final run of that game within a few days, Contra took me far longer. 
	$LF
	"Typically, a single stage might very well take 2 - 3 hours to do. I also had school to deal with, so typically I'd do most of the work on the
	$LF
	"weekends. The game is also far harder to optimize due to more precise movement required and very random lag. To elaborate somewhat:
	$LF
]p
[h4 id=Movement 
	" Movement
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Your X Speed depends on the blimps you collect. In addition to making you more resistant to damage, 
	$LF
	"they also boost your movement speed upwards to 4/3px a frame if you collect two of them.
	$LF
	"Walking, jumping and falling off ledges are equally fast, but later in the game, doing jumps makes you more susceptible to lag.
	$LF
	"While jumping up a shaft (Stages 4, 18), if you jump into the next screen from a higher ledge, you have more
	$LF
	"vertical momentum, which allows you to reach higher ledges without having to land on a lower one first. This
	$LF
	"influences my route choice in those levels, losing a few frames by jumping onto a higher ledge instead of straight
	$LF
	"into the next screen. Unlike the NES Contra, it is possible to adjust your jump height.
	$LF
	"Falling down shafts typically is more simple. If you press Down + Jump on the first frame you can, you won't lose
	$LF
	"any speed. As with many games, you land on the ground faster if you jump down a ledge instead of walk down it, though,
	$LF
	"after some time, you will enter your normal falling animation again.
	$LF
]p
[h4 id=Shooting 
	" Shooting
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"If you pick up an additional weapon, you first go through a small menu, allowing you to pick one.
	$LF
	"The Standard Peashooter is my weapon of choice for this run, as the machine gun isn't needed thanks to frame precision, the 
	$LF
	"rear and fire guns have no use and the laser is too slow. You can only have six bullets onscreen at a time, so often, you'll
	$LF
	"find me doing a jump, firing six bullets, and jumping again as early as possible. In underpass/maze stages, if you cover what you
	$LF
	"want to hit with your sprite, the bullets reach their target instantly as opposed to travelling there first. 
	$LF
	"Typically, shooting creates lag, its severety depends on how busy the screen is. 
	$LF
	"Later in the game, removing sprites by shooting them cuts enough lag in itself to make this viable.
	$LF
]p
[h4 id=GettingHit 
	" Getting Hit
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Getting hit typically boosts you in the opposite direction at an impressive speed. Getting hit while jumping will often send you upward in addition to back, and falling downward. 
	$LF
	"However, you'll lie on the ground for a couple of frames, nullifying the gain. Two exceptions arise to this: In Stage 8 (Energy Zone), you typically have to wait
	$LF
	"for the fire wall to pass before being able to go through. By intentionally getting hit, I can skip the wait and just wait for the recovery time to run out. 
	$LF
	"The second exception is in descent-stages (10, 16). Because the recovery time runs out before I can land again, I don't lose any time, able to instantly jump down the next platform
	$LF
	"I land on. Your control over the direction you're boosted in is limited and dependent on the direction you approach a hazard from. Your life isn't replenished at the end of a stage,
	$LF
	"so it can be treated as a finite recourse.
	$LF
]p
[h4 id=Lag 
	" Lag
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Oh, the lag. Part of what makes it so annoying to deal with is that it is very unpredictable and very unavoidable. Many different things can cause lag, such as the turrets turning,
	$LF
	"but typically, you want to have as few sprites on screen as possible and don't want to have any tiled background elements change their appearance. (Turrets turning, opening up) 
	$LF
	"Due to its screen-based nature, it is possible to just try out the screen a couple of times to find the most lag-free route, but that eats up time, is annoying and it's very difficult
	$LF
	"to verify a given screen cannot be completed any faster. Boss fights are also made more difficult by lag, because the game often won't act the way you want it to.
	$LF
	"Often, input feels very sluggish and unresponsive, and almost even worse, if bullets are grouped too closely together, they can pass through the target if the game is laggy.

	$LF
	"the screen to make lag an issue, I manipulate them to spawn less frequently. If you are in their line of fire, they stop to take a shot at you, otherwise, they run back and forth.
	$LF
	"If they come to a ledge, they can either jump to the next ledge or turn around and keep running. This can be influenced by facing them or not. The exact best strategy to deal
	$LF
	"with them depends on the screen.

	" Turret

[p 
	"Probably the enemy that caused the most anguish during the making of this run, Their starting rotation can be manipulated during screen transitions. If you are in their line of fire, 
	$LF
	"they can take up to three shots at you, otherwise, they rotate in your general direction. Since that rotating causes lag, it is best to avoid any unneccesary rotating. They are also
	$LF
	"near ubiquitous in the game, some screens feature up to three of them in one screen. A nightmare to manipulate and optimize!
	$LF

	$LF
	"for only one frame, at the peak of that jump, the bullets just fly over it. As usual, the collision for the tanks' projectiles is very off, allowing me to get inbetween

[h4 id=Stage9-AlienZone- 
	" Stage 9 -Alien Zone-

[p 
	"A rather simple stage. Again, it is impossible to pass while the Alien Head is alive. At one point, shooting one of those organ things cuts a frame of lag.
