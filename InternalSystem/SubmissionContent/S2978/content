	"I started this run when I was still a lurker here at TAS videos. Back then, I was excited with the idea to make my own runs, and maybe become a player here. But this excitement did not last long, and after some frustrated attempts, I put the project aside. Now, with a little more experience with those frame advance and memory address things, I can finally finish the project. I played the game in normal mode for two reasons; to activate the hard mode you must finish the game once, thus the game would start from a save state, the other reason is the amount of enemies on screen, which causes lots of lag in hard mode.

	"After Chiaki recovers her bracelet, she can transform Zenki into his Powered up Form. In this form Zenki deals more damage and has a much longer list of attacks; a Pillar of Energy, an Electrified Punch, and a Dashing Attack. By picking up scrolls Zenki can do a powerful Rudora Attack that damages all enemies on screen, but this attack damages Zenki as well. The Dashing Attack cannot only kill enemies, it also makes Zenki move forward faster than the Back Dash, if there's nothing in his way, that is. An energy field is blocking the door at the end of this stage, and Zenki must back track to destroy a Stone Monument.

Other than that, this stage is pretty straightforward; break some Stone Monuments to activate the elevators and you are good to go. Zenki must collect three scrolls to use one Rodora Attack, and since I have already two of them from the previous stage, just one need to be collected here, which will save a lot of time in the next stage.
