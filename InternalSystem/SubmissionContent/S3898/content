For a game as huge as this one, it’s natural that new tricks appear once in a while, but that Sligfantry guy found too many of them; DDG, Backward Jump, Stop & Turn and the combination of them.

If that happens, go back to the previous screen and he will be able to walk through the wall.

To set this up you must stop and jump twice. Running jumps won’t do. If you are using an explosion, Abe must hit the ground before the second jump as soon as the explosion occurs. The set up with bees is trickier as you have no visual cue. In a TAS that’s no problem at all, but playing in real time you can pay attention to his voice; when it becomes really high pitched, jump.

	"Samlaptop, his real time runs, even though on a different platform, gave me lots of new strategies to use on my run. He also promptly answered my questions on the forum and offered lots of time saving ideas, thank you man. Sligfantry; he is the man responsible for finding the new tricks in this run, I can’t thank you enough. antd; he’s working on a Lua script which will help not only my next any% run, but also real time runners on their tests. He also encoded my cancelled any% run, but I didn’t have the chance to thank him there, thank you very much.

	"Right at the start of the submission text I said this run has fewer mistakes, and it is true. But not knowing a trick can’t be considered a mistake methinks. Anyways, the Mudokon # 8 can be rescued slightly faster if you enter the fourth secret area using the Backward Jump on the wall behind the Bird portal of Mudokons # 9 and 10. I found that out when I was testing the strategy for RuptureFarms 2, that’s why it’s not in this run.
