[p 
	"New tricks found, new runs done. Not always in this order, but still. For a game as huge as this one, it’s natural that new tricks appear once in a while, but that Sligfantry guy found too many of them; DDG, Backward Jump, Stop & Turn and the combination of them. Well, let’s talk about these new tricks then.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Glitches and Oddities
	$LF
]h3
[h4 
	" Stop & Turn
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"When coming out from rolling stance, Abe will walk two steps before a complete stop. But if you turn around at the right moment he will stand, stop and turn at once. Useful to climb ledges on the opposite direction, but combine it with the next trick and you have a huge time saver.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Auto Turn Delay
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Some actions like climb ledges or mounting Elum will automatically turn Abe around if he is facing the wrong direction. If you run as soon as he turns, that action will be delayed until he turns around again. Be careful not to jump though as it cancels the glitch.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Backward Jump
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This is a combination of the Auto Turn Delay and the Stop & Turn tricks; do the Auto Turn Delay from bellow a ledge, roll toward a wall and perform the Stop & Turn. Abe will pass through any wall of the game with this trick. But some walls are too large for him to pass with this trick and he will get stuck inside. If that happens, go back to the previous screen and he will be able to walk through the wall. In Scrabanian Temple you’ll see me setting this trick up from above a ledge, but there are few of those “special” ledges in the game.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Diagonal Fall
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Like the Backward Jump, you must combine the Auto Turn Delay with the Stop & Turn trick; set up the Auto Turn Delay from bellow a ledge, roll and do the Stop & Turn. Abe will fall diagonally, eventually advancing to the next screen as he falls. But he won’t pass through walls with this trick.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Death Delay Glitch
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Also known as DDG, this trick can be set up in two ways; with an explosion or while attacked by bees. But the result is the same; a dead Abe that can perform actions as if he’s still alive. To set this up you must stop and jump twice. Running jumps won’t do. If you are using an explosion, Abe must hit the ground before the second jump as soon as the explosion occurs. The set up with bees is trickier as you have no visual cue. In a TAS that’s no problem at all, but playing in real time you can pay attention to his voice; when it becomes really high pitched, jump.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Invisible Abe
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"After setting up the DDG, entering any well will resurrect Abe again. But if he’s still invisible by a explosion he will have the better of these two worlds; he is immune to all sorts of things that otherwise would kill an alive Abe, like Slig shots, explosions, traps and animals. He can also stand things a dead Abe is unable to, like surviving high falls or bumping into walls. Advancing to the next stage cancels the trick though.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Bullet-Proof Mudokons
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Mudokons can survive explosions as long as they’re working and not on screen. This made some rescues a lot faster as I don’t need to put them out of a grenade or land mine’s range.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Infinite Pick Up
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Crouch and hold the square button near a grenade, rock or meat then turn around before Abe completes the animation, turn around again and he will pick up as many items as he wants, but he can't use the extra items in some areas nor carry them to other stages. 
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Screen Boundary
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Turn around while running before Abe reaches the next screen then stop. He is safe to chant as long as there's no Slogs, Scrabs or Chant Droids nearby. You can also jump when he is two steps away from the screen boundary. 
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Ghostly Elum
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"You must do the Auto Turn Delay trick on Elum near a flying mine, order bomb or grenade for this to work, but do this on the wrong frame and you'll have just an invisible Elum which won't move.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Walk Through Walls
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"While riding Elum, hold the R1 button and run towards a wall, when you are about to bump release the R1 button to walk through the wall.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Tamed Slogs
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"There are some Slogs that will attack even the Sligs. But fortunately for Abe, if a Slog kills a Slig after he says "here boy", they will become Abe's best friends.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Stage by Stage
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This run is all about rescuing Abe’s friends and I think it’s best to comment it Mudokon by Mudokon instead of Stage by Stage. I also promised to write details of what I’m doing while Abe is invisible, but a Lua script is worth a thousand words and antd is working on one at the moment.

	"Before the second secret area, Abe must pull a lever to disable an electric wall. To complete RuptureFarms with the new tricks I’ll need nine grenades, so, better pick them all from this Boom Machine. Any noise like a grenade exploding or a Slig shouting scatters the Bird Portal, also Abe would drop all of his grenades if he chants near a Chant Droid, or maybe not...

]h4
[p 
	"Okay, that one legged Slog would have a lot of trouble rescuing the Mudokons on the fifth secret area; two Sligs to kill, a land mine and a Chant Droid to destroy while avoiding to scatter the Bird Portal may be a little too much for him.

	"There are three easy Mudokons to rescue if you know where the sixth secret area is. Abe will die if he falls from those trapdoors while he is walking or running, but if he is rolling he will safely land on the ground below. The flying grenade at the end of RuptureFarms costs 20 frames, but I think it's a nice touch, so, I left it in.

[h4 
	" Mudokons # 34 to 37
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"There's two ways to get into the ninth secret area, the other one is slower and puts Abe on a bad location. While Abe is running the Mudokons do the same, even in the background, and it was used to make them reach the Bird Portal while avoiding a land mine.
