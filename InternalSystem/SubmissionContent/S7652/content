	"1. It's an SRAM-anchored submission without a verification movie. I was able to get it to sync with the instructions provided, at least, but we do still require verification movies for any submission that starts from a save.

	"2. There is no way to optimize for time in any Rhythm Heaven game, apart from very basic menuing, and some of that is even mitigated through SRAM as the game saves cursor position. Anyone who can reach 100 points in Mr. Upbeat has the time record, as the timing does not change at all. Because of this, we currently do not accept rhythm game TASes of any kind. We will be exploring the possibility of doing so in the near future, though!

	"3. This appears to be done purely in real time, with no effort put into optimization of any kind. Menus are visibly not cleared as fast as possible, often taking several seconds. This comes off more like a live demonstration than a TAS.

	"4. The goal itself is arbitrary, as Mr. Upbeat is an endless game and 100 points is not the maximum attainable score, nor does anything special happen at 100 points. The run also does not end once the goal is achieved, with the author attempting to go back to the Wii menu afterward.

	"5. The listed Dolphin revision is inaccurate, as this run does not work on base 5.0 Dolphin. Fortunately the run syncs on the latest Dolphin at time of writing (5.0-16793), but given how finicky Dolphin can be with syncing, it is necessary to provide the exact revision used.

Barring that, I could finally be given an outlet for my essay on why Flock Step is the best RH minigame, and sometimes a lady just needs an outlet. Either way, stick around, familiarize yourself with the site, and learn from us to grow as a TASer! c:
