	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"If you air dodge into the ground at an angle, you get a useful slide. Waveland refers to the technique in general, and Wavedash refers to the specific case when used immediately after a jump. Samus is one of the few characters whose wavedash speed is actually faster than her run speed on average, so this is used quite a bit. Wavelanding also speeds up the process of jumping onto platforms, especially when ledge canceled.

	" Ledge Cancel

]h4
[p 
	"If you slide into the ledge (for example after a wavedash or landing after an aerial), any remaining lag will be immediately canceled and you'll either fall off the edge or enter the topple animation depending on your direction and input. This is extremely useful as is allows for movement and combos that would otherwise be impossible. Frame precise ledge canceling can often allow for combos that aren't possible in real time.

During the frames where the character is frozen after getting hit (the freeze frames are most noticeable on electric moves like Samus' charge shot), SDI gives you a small teleport by tapping the control stick.

[h4 id=BombdashakaDaughterDash 
	" Bomb dash aka Daughter Dash
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"After using a bomb, Samus enters Morph Bomb mode. While on the ground, pressing one direction then immediately pressing the other will give her a momentary speed boost that lasts a single frame. This can be repeated several times, and is generally the fastest way to move while in Morph Bomb mode. More importantly, it leads to a pair of glitches called the Super Wavedash and Aerial Super Wavedash which give Samus the fastest horizontal movement in the game over long distances.
	$LF
]p
[h4 id=SuperWavedash 
	" Super Wavedash
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This is caused by performing a Bomb dash on the very last frame of the attack. The momentary speed boost is only supposed to last a single frame, but since Samus is no longer in morph bomb mode on the next frame, she gets to keep it. This gives her a massive speed boost that lets her quickly cover long distances.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"To maximize average moving speed from a Super Wavedash, Samus should jump immediately before bombing so that she gets to the ground faster. Once on the ground, Samus can use Bomb dashes to get some extra distance before the actual Super Wavedash.
	$LF
	"Samus can get even more distance out of a the technique by grabbing on the earliest possible frame. Unfortunately her grab is laggy, so this is only used when doing so would get her to the end of the level.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This is similar to the normal Super Wavedash, except instead of performing the Bomb dash on the last frame of the move, you do it while next to a ledge. Similar to the way Samus gets to keep the boost if she transitions to normal standing physics, she also gets to keep the boost if she transitions to aerial morph bomb physics. Unfortunately Samus can only keep the boost while she's in morph bomb mode, so it's important to do this as early as possible in the attack.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Of course if she gets to the ground before she leaves bomb mode, there's nothing stopping her from doing a normal Super Wavedash as well.

If you think it's hard to see the target moving, just know that once upon a time it was even harder to see. I spent a decent chunk of time trying to adjust it to be easier to see. At one point I gave up and just did a version that got all the names on high speed, but thankfully people told me they liked the slower version better.
