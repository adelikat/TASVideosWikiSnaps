In particular, it will NOT move between each turn of a battle (except if there is a status animation burning RNs like confusion or amnesia, but there is only 1 fight where it could have been useful), which means that once in battle, my luck manipulation options are pretty much limited to choosing another attack to burn a different number of RNs with the animation.

	"Outside of battle, the most effective ways of burning RNs are to move when the Danger value is higher than the level threshold (i.e. checking if the step is triggering a random battle), to dash (1 RN per frame at max speed, 2 RNs per frame in every other case), and to cross some screen transitions (can burn a fixed amount between 0 and 20+ RNs at each cross).

When you are Out of Bounds and "in" or close to a solid object, you horizontal and vertical speeds will always be 8, whether you are dashing or not (and usually you can't go Up or Left in these situations). Due to the dashing mechanic, optimal movement in this game is far from trivial, especially when you must also avoid random encounters.

]div
[div class=p 
	"Dashing works as follows : While you are keeping the dash button pushed, you can't move and the dash counter increases by 16 every frame (starting at 512) until it reaches the maximum (1024), then you are dashing to the given direction at max speed. If you release the dash button before this, then the dash counter will decrease by 32 every frame until it reaches 0, and in the meantime you are able to move a little bit in any direction (note that if you only hold the button for exactly 1 frame, the direction you are moving to is "random" and you can't modify it). Once it reaches 0 and if you are holding the dash button, then you will start to dash and the dash counter, starting at 512, will increase by 16 every frame until it reaches 1024.

		" Item Duplication (Battle) : A well known glitch of this game. Due to the way the game handle the items in the inventory, it's possible to 1) use the "Arrange" command to set an item slot to any item you own and with a quantity of 0 and 2) swap item slots in battle to consume the "wrong" item (it requires at least 2 members in the party). Since 0 minus 1 equals 255, you can get 255 number of any item you got at least once in your inventory. It is used to duplicate the 4 types of apples (+1 in one of the 4 main stats) and thus allowing to finish the game without any level grinding.
		$LF

]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		"Item Duplication (Shop) : By doing the previous glitch, you can have 2 or more item slots with the same item and a quantity greater than 0, which isn't normally possible. When selling this item in a shop, the game will always decrease the quantity of the one with the highest item slot number. So if you sell more than that quantity (because you have a higher quantity in the other item slot), you will once again do an underflow.

		" Character Switch OOB : A loadzone is usually 5 pixels in height to ensure that it will always trigger even when dashing (4 pixels per frame at best), however if you switch with another character in your party at the right frame, you can bypass the check for 1 frame, and if you are beyond the loadzone on the next frame then the game will not load the next room, effectively putting you Out of Bounds. Note that for some reason it doesn't work for all loadzone.

		" Body Blocking OOB : If for some reason the character you are controlling is at the same position than another character, the game will eject you at the closest available spot, even if said spot isn't crossable (like a wall or a mountain), putting you in an OOB situation.

		" Hollow Man : The most complex glitch, I will just describe what it does for this TAS. When triggering certain animations with 3 characters (picking up tools, earn Force Powers for example) with a party of less than 3, you will recruit Hollow Man (basically a very glitchy character). If you take the Mega Berry from his Rune slot then Cecilia will be warped to Elw World (her coordinates will stay the same than before so you have to be careful about her position before going to the Elw World), and it will happen every time he is recruited again.

	"The odds of this simple strategy are still pretty low since Cecilia is using Randomizer (Saint can't deal 6000+ damage on Boomerang) and Boomerang is faster than Luceid most of the time. Assuming that Luceid has 50% chance of acting before Boomerang and that Cecilia has 100% chance of acting before both of them, the odds are still only of ~0.4%. For your information, the strategy I used here only works with a RES between 113 and 119.

	"Zeikfried is relatively easy since he has 40000 HP (meaning a 3 turns clear isn't possible but a t=4 turn clear easy to achieve, though it can't be with more than 1 Saint), the only thing is that he is far faster than the 2 next bosses and acting first on turn 4 requires a mix of apples and "luck". We don't want to see his Negative Rainbow (33% chance of using it) but 1 or 2 Zeik Impulse is ok, though Hi-Shield is of course welcome as it's a free turn.

	"Motherfried doesn't have Holy resistance so both Saint and Randomizer are fine against her. However we don't really want to see anything else than Phatima's Miracle and Als Magna (the later one has a 40% chance of inflicting a very bad status), and it's not like Cecilia can take Phatima's Miracle forever, especially if she took some Zeik Impulse.

	"Now about this boss... first thing first, his HP means that Cecilia must kill him in 5 turns, and she must do 9999 damage or close to every time. Second, he is slow. So slow that even without the Courage Rune, the game isn't burning any RN to check who should go first. These two points means that 1) I can only use Randomizer and 2) I can't manipulate the RNG by switching between the Water and Courage Runes.

	"So my strategy is straight forward and I can only hope to find a starting RN that goes well from turn 1 to turn 5. There are only a few things the boss is allowed to do : a normal attack (15%), Sleep/Silence/Fatal Blow (10% each, with only 25% chance of missing) and Confusion (10%, 50% chance of missing).

	"If my calculations are not wrong, the odds of this strategy working are of ~0.03%, or once every 3350 RNs. Fortunately there was a working RN close (and I needed to burn at least 4000+ RNs for the next one) that only required to not dash in a small section of the way to the boss.
