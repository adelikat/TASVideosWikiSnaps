[div class=p 
	"Rhythm Heaven for the DS is a collection of rhythm minigames developed and published by Nintendo. Depending on how well you did on each minigame, you will be graded with a Superb, OK, or Try Again. Resulting in an OK or higher is the passing rating to move on to the next minigame. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Each minigame keeps track of 1-5 types of input. For every type of input, if you successfully hit enough inputs and do not miss too many, then you will be good enough to pass the minigame. Each minigame not only keeps track of how many inputs you've successfully hit or miss, but also the total number of available inputs. This means that any unavailable inputs will not be counted into your overall rating. Each minigame has their own set of strategies to register as few inputs as possible in order to save as many taps as possible.
