	$LF
	"OH NO! Dreams of soon-to-be Deja Vu & The Great Deku Tree is in need of help!
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Kokiri Forest - Fastest route in getting rupees so far.  No more diagonal walking unless needed in certain areas for a small distance.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Inside the Deku Tree - Ahh, the 1st dungeon.  In the room with the Skullita and web on the ground, there is a new method there which will take off 4 minutes or so in the next run.  I got lucky in the Pre-boss room.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"To skip a lot of backtracking, there is a part where Link grabs a chicken and jumpslashes over the Guerdo fence to go to the Spirit Temple.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Haunted Wasteland - There is a poe that navigates you through the desert, but with brilliant skill, Link surpases that.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Spirit Temple - What a fun 1/2 of a dungeon where Iron Knuckle meets his doom for the 1st time!  Also, there is a way to get the Mirror Shield early, maybe it will get used in a future run.

	"Fishing Pond - Swimmin into the middle of the pond after catching the biggest fish and holding Z & R while swimming to the owner will give you the Golden Scale, needed to dive deep and get the bottle.  There is a way to skip King Zora now without the bottle, maybe it will get used later on.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Hyrule Castle - The 1st of 2 seamwalks.  Seamwalks are tough when you start out, but practice makes it easier.  The sidehopping past the guards was fun because they just look to lazy to say anything to you.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Zora's Fountain - There was said to be a way to roll into Jabu-Jabu's mouth at the perfect pixel angle, but after many attempts, I gave up and did the next easiest thing, which is jumpslash on him to enter.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Inside Lord Jabu-Jabu's Belly - Fun dungeon with a stabbing bomb boost for the Mini-boss skip.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Dodongo's Cavern - 85% of this dungeon was skipped due to the bombchu's lighting the eyes.  No one could prove if it was possible to light both eyes with 1.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Death Mountain Trail - The 2nd and last seamwalk to get to the Great Fairy Fountain and jumpslash through the mountain side to enter since I had no bombchu's.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Market - At the Market, I went bombchu bowling for the bomb bag upgrade to carry 30 bombs.  Even though I didnt get the bombs, when I become an adult, they are automatically filled!
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Temple of Time - OH NO! Ganon, The King of Evil, has followed me into the Temple of Time!
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Graveyard - The dead Graveyard keep is wanting to race me in his grave!  He likes my style so he gives me the Hookshot!
	$LF
	"Back in the Graveyard, the Poe boost was never accomplished after thousands of tries.  So a new method was discovered!
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Shadow Temple - The funnest watching Temple of them all!  This is where I pick up the hover boots because they are needed for the other Temple's (Forest and Spirit).  Bongo Bongo met his final beat.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Lost Woods - Since Mido did not get any taller, I might as well just backflip over him!
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Sacred Forest Meadow - To skip most of the annoying enemies in this area, I used a "stored ground jump" to get to the top of the ledge and hover my way on down.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Forest Temple - Only thing needed out of here is the Fairy Bow.  Once I got that, I played the Requiem of Spirit and went to the Spirit Temple to finish the 2nd and final Temple.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Spirit Temple - Some obstacles were in my way because I did not have the Longshot, but just a few seconds were lost in climbing and such.  The witches could have been beaten a little faster but I could not position them so they would not move, got frustrated and gave up!  However, I did stab Twinrova to death.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Inside Ganon's Castle - ALL SAGES UNITE!  The most desynching part of the game is here in the Castle.  Redo, after redo was put into this, but finally got it done!
