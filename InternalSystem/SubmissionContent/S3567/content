	"I played mainly with Mizuki Makimura, because she has quicker movement and can jump over obstacles. But she can't pick up some stronger weapons. Masato moves 0,75 pixel per frame, Mizuki with 0,875 pixel per frame. In battles I switched the characters to do more damage.

	"I used a glitch, which allows to go through eight pixel wide walls, to go directly to the boss. I got medicine, an upgrade for Mizukis weapon and grenades.

	"Sadly there's no place where I can use this glitch, so this stage is really long. I had to collect many keys, which costs a lot of time. The boss was a big problem. At the beginning the boss has an energy of 100, according to the address 0xC14D, but the value jumps automatically to 200, no matter how much damage I did.

	"Here's also no place to use the glitch. This stage has two bosses. The entrance to the second boss is closed until the first boss is defeated. It is also needed to collect many keys on this stage. I collected a stronger weapon.

	": This is hardly the best TAS I've seen, but it was decent. It was nice to see you shoot at enemies before they appear on screen, which makes the TAS quality noticeable. The game is also an old classic that many people who went looking for Gameboy games when there were so few to choose from will remember. Decent audience response. Accepting as first run for this game.
