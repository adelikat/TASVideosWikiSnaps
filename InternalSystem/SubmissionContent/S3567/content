	"I played mainly with Mizuki Makimura, because she has quicker movement and can jump over obstacles. But she can't pick up some stronger weapons. Masato moves 0,75 pixel per frame, Mizuki with 0,875 pixel per frame. In battles I switched the characters to do more damage.

At the beginning the boss has an energy of 100, according to the address 0xC14D, but the value jumps automatically to 200, no matter how much damage I did.

	": This is hardly the best TAS I've seen, but it was decent. It was nice to see you shoot at enemies before they appear on screen, which makes the TAS quality noticeable. The game is also an old classic that many people who went looking for Gameboy games when there were so few to choose from will remember. Decent audience response. Accepting as first run for this game.
