	"Brain Age 2, also known as "More Brain Training from Dr. Kawashima" in PAL regions, is a sequel to Brain Age. It is a puzzle game to exercise your brain a little each day. You will play a variety of puzzles to train your brain. Although there has been controversy over the scientific effectiveness of the game in keeping your brain active, the game got very popular.

	"I was going to draw a detailed picture in every math problem. However, my previous Brain Age TAS got a lot of criticisms that it is slow-paced. After all, I gave up the idea of drawing a lot of detailed pictures and decided to make a quick-paced run that aims to launch a rocket in every game.

	": I personally thought the goal choice was great, and the movie was well executed, given those goals. However, as has been noted in this thread and the previous, the amount of actual TASing content versus the amount of cutscenes was an underwhelming amount. The piano part was only interesting in the sense that the game did not register incorrect notes. Beyond that, the description of cacophony was pretty accurate. While yes, this is a different game than Brain Age 1, it is still impossible to ignore the existence of the previous movie, which was an exceptional TAS. It seems like this movie is a repetition of the previous concept, without adding new entertainment. A large amount of the audience felt this way, and thus, I am rejecting this.

	"This decision was difficult for me to make. For example, both 
	(__wikiLink|1360M)
	" and 
	(__wikiLink|1715M)
	" are far more identical movies, yet both are published. However, Brain Age/Brain Age 2 are not pure speedruns. They are movies that aim for entertainment at the sacrifice of speed (I'm sure this movie could be done much faster, if speed were the only goal). Thus, I had to judge purely on whether the audience found this entertaining. While a 'majority' found it entertaining, almost every serious submission gets at least 60% yes votes. I balance that with the actual content of posts, which were majorly negative.
