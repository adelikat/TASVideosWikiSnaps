	"One of the main things I had to check was if it was possible to RNG manipulate what the item capsules give. With a little bit of work, I figured out that this is determined by the in-game timer when the item capsule is touched. I managed to change what I got by switching between braking and accelerating on different frames so the item capsule is touched at a different time. With that knowledge in hand, it's possible to reasonably avoid getting hit and losing speed in the parts of the TAS where the player gets hit.

	"Along with some non-RNG related optimization issues that I spotted with a casual view, this isn't quite optimized enough for publication. I can see doing another pass or two to get a much more refined submission but as it is there's definite optimization issues. You got a lot of time to refine each and every race, so take your time to make a much better submission in the future. I do look forward to that.
