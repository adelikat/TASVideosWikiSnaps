	"This is over 40 seconds faster than the current movie. A large part of this improvement came from discovering that there was a two frame window in which you can do a jump kick after an air dash without slowing down. This lets me to jump onto low boxes and over small pits without slowing down. I also take more damage than the previous movie and improved some of the boss fights.
