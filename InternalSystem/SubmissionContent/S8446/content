	"Beat in 7:57 Minutes!!!   The Cutting Room Floor - "Marble Madness II was originally going to be called "Marble Man: Marble Madness II". However, after the game failed during location tests, Atari decided to remove the anthropomorphic marble character and shift the controls from trackballs to joysticks. It still failed location tests, which was attributed to the overwhelming popularity of Street Fighter II, and the game would not see any releases.

	"Basically you're a Marble!!! Blue, Red, or Green!!! The game pretty much works like the first game!!! You have to make your way to the goal as fast as you can before the timer runs out!!! There are now enemies, obstacles, 17 Levels, Power ups, And 3 Bonus stages where you're in a pinball stage and have to hit all the pins!!! You get it! ^^ Then you have Flags which give you a certain amount of points considering the value!!! Flags can go up to 4000pts!!! There are also hidden Flags which you are unable to see unless you guide your marble to a yellow pad (Appears in Later levels) or using a power up!!! Lastly the final stage!!! You make your way up to the goal avoiding green and brown goblins throwing rocks at you!!! You only get 3 tries to beat the level!!!
