	"This mission require that you clear all the Sonic boards up to X-Zone. Probably the most demanding of the opponents. There was quite a bit of luck manipulation and frame specific shots that needed to be made given the predicament that the ball sometimes can face.

	"After beating Metal Sonic the game congratulates you with a false victory. Eggman appears to make his last stand to beat you. This mission requires you have more points within the time limit. With the physics leaning towards making you fail even more in this stage. Along with little to no Ball Saves.
