	"A kangaroo has trained itself to master martial arts, it also knows a lot of international financial politics. It collects money and attempts to destabilize the market by never spending the money. The kangaroo is a big threat to humanity, so four heros have be chosen to stop it: A resurrected Tyrannosaurus Rex; The Yeti, they found him on an online dating website; The Djinn from a lamp oil bottle; And a hunter who loads mosquitos into his gun.
