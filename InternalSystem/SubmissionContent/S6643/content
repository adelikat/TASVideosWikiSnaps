	"So this game has 2 different jumps, one is regular jumping and the other is a drop kick.  The drop kick give Buster a bit more speed than normal movement, however if you just press the drop kick button by itself, there is a bit of time before buster actually moves faster.  Instead I can time my jumps and drop kicks at a fixed tempo to maximize my dropkick speed and minimize the time it takes to get there.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Though this is not the fastest method of movement, that is the dash.  the dash is limited but can be used really well in many cases.  I can jump as soon as the meter runs out to preserve some speed, though jumping dash speed is not as fast as running speed is.  you can also keep some movement by sliding after a jump.  I have to avoid doing this too much since I lose a frame for each slide I do.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Near the middle of this stage in particular, there is some weird movement discovered where you can jump off a wall and have dash speed, but still allow your dash meter to fill up at the same time.  this makes the library section faster.  there is also a tech known as bunny hopping, but with a different meaning.  you can cancel a dash warmup if you press the opposite direction, when you do that you have one frame to jump in the air.  this makes getting up to certain places much easier and faster.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"in the art gallery I use a trick that allows me to walk with dash speed but not use the dash meter at all.  if you run up to a wall and press dash, jump, and the opposite direction at the same time, you can trick the game into giving you dash speed.  if you jump out of this state it cancels out.

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"while it is an autoscroller, there are some things done to save time.  for one, the 2nd time you have to run on ground, there is a weird glitch that happens where if you jump high enough, the game does not stop doing the fast scrolling for as long as you are holding the down button.  I can extend this a bit by dashing and sliding some more.  if I do this too much, the floor becomes instant kill.  (this also causes background graphics to screw up for the rest of the stage)
