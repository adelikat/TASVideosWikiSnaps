	"The Story Mode follows Goku as he goes on the adventure of his lifetime. Most of the Dragon Ball story arcs are here; the only one noticeably missing is the Piccolo Junior storyline from the end of the series. There are many items to collect in the game, most of which are hidden. Items can include those that increase the player's health and/or ki, the Dragon Balls, or objects such as Master Roshi's sunglasses and Mercenary Tao's cyborg headgear. Since this run aims for fastest time we only collect the ki upgrades to give us a more powerful kamehameha.

The combo was Dash attack -> Standing B (1) -> Standing B (2)-> Jump -> (mid-air) Up+B -> (mid-air) B {this final hit was usually changed to a dive kick for better positioning}.

	"Boss fights are generally much easier to optimize once you can figure out how to manipulate the best starting pattern. You just get in there and keep repeating the highest damage combo which is pretty similar to the combo used on regular enemies (Dash attack → Standing B (1) → Standing B (2) → Jump → (mid-air) Up+B → Dive Kick → (mid-air) B → Land and Dash Attack again). When fighting against bosses or enemies that can't be hit from the ground it's best to simply Dive Kick → Up Kick ad infinitum.

	"Regular sized bosses (such as Yamcha, Krillin, Devil Man, etc..) can only be combo'd for as long as they're in the air, and they can only be popped up once per combo with (mid-air) Up+B. The only other way you can keep them in the air is with the L+R rush attack. It initially seems like the L+R rush does a lot of damage, but due to its super long cool down time it ends up being faster to just continue with the regular combo as along as possible. For comparison the L+R rush does ~200 damage in 83 frames and the regular combo does ~240 damage in 91 frames.

You'll often see Goku punching and attacking the open air before and during the fights. This is to manipulate the RNG wherever I can.

All attacks do varying amounts of damage to it, and the damage can change (usually it's more) if you're interrupting a move.

In the second half of the level I picked up a purple turtle shell which is a fantastically powerful item. It makes Goku invincible and any enemy I touch takes about 30 damage. By far the most powerful aspect of this item is that I can cancel an attack into another attack every other frame, and the new move will do its damage on the very next frame (even before the move animation starts). So I can do ~25 damage every other frame. I wait until the absolute last frame to grab it on so that it can last all the way to the mini boss. I do 1305 damage in the first 97 frames (partly because I also do 35 damage per hit against the boss). It takes another 150 frames to do the last 450 damage once the turtle shell wears off.

After capturing Korin he will fade out and re-appear somewhere else. He will either fade-in in a position relative to Goku (usually a medium distance away) which can takes a long time to do, or he'll instantly appear in mid-air with several of his copies flying around.

All of the standard soldiers had 131 health instead of 120, so I had to add in an extra hit to the combo to finish them off. This was actually a relief since I didn't have to go crazy making sure every hit did high damage anymore (for the most part). All of the Lieutenant Metallics were manipulated to fire missiles for me to reflect back. In some earlier testing it was found that the fight checkpoints extend all the way up to an invisible ceiling, but it looks like they don't extend below the ground. This was used to skip two fights in this level. The first one was by crossing the large gap underneath one of the bridges in the middle of the level. The second fight skip happens right before the stage transition. I use a pixel-perfect jump to span the gap beneath the small bridge without triggering the fight. This can be done in real time by instead jumping down to the small ledge with a 1-up on it.

The level 4 Kamehameha does a whopping 192 damage when positioned correctly which more than justifies the wait time of knocking him down. Piccolo can get back up by either standing up normally or using the after-image technique to teleport behind you. It actually takes an extra 10 frames to get into a good position for firing the Kamehameha if he uses the after-image, but I do an extra 5 damage during that cycle of getting him back into the corner.
