	"This game was a NIGHTMARE! I couldn't play it, and I think I probably scored 2 or 3 dunks. If was majorly confusing and just too much for me to handle. Even in terms of TASing, it was a bit aggrevating to keep up with all the motions on the screen. One funny thing that I laughed at, was the mention of scoring in the article. You should read it to see what I'm talking about. I would love to track down the author and show him this, since the max score of 75 is absolutely not humanly possible...I could be wrong though. :P

	": While the action is slow-moving, I can see where the challenge would be for a human.  If ball drops could be better manipulated for more rapid drops or if the location of the platform holes could be better manipulated then perhaps this could be beaten, but it would take a lot of testing to determine.  As-is, nothing is obviously sub-optimal.  As a slightly faster run could be accomplished by getting a lower score (while still not losing any balls), an any% run could still be performed.  Therefore, I feel this run should maintain the "Maximum Score" branch label.  If someone were to attempt an any% run, I feel that losing any balls off the platforms (other than at the scoring marks) should be considered failure to complete the game.
