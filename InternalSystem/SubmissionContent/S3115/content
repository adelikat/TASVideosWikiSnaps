	"This is the newest (by 15 years or so) NES game released in 2010. It's mainly inspired by the freeware computer game "I Wanna Be the Guy" in how you're walking from screen to screen trying kill or dodge a large number of enemies and obstacles, and one hit always kills you. It's not nearly as unfair, though, because in most rooms you can pretty much see what will happen there as opposed to IWBtG.

	"I decided to make a 100% run of the game. By my own definition that means collecting every item and key before going to the last area, recollecting all items when they get lost, and getting the best ending by taking the right path at the end. I did this since the any% and 100% runs wouldn't really be different enough to warrant a publication of both, and chosed the 100% because the game doesn't have to much extra stuff to do, so I could as well just show them. This means a little more backtracking but when going through those areas the second time I had a better upgraded character and could thus use different strategies compared to the first time.

	"Due to the simple controls I had a hard time trying to exploit the physics in order do things I wasn't supposed to. One thing I found though was that under water, using the feather, I could float downwards 50% slower than it's meant to (the normal speed is 1 pixel / frame). This is because when you hold up to use the feather and then releases it, the character's y-speed goes back to the initial falling speed you get when walking of a platform and under water this results in falling 1 pixel the first frame followed by falling 0 pixels the next. Thus by pushing up 1 frame, not pushing it for 2, pushing it for 1 frame and so on - You'll float downwards in that slow speed.

	"There was only one sequence break I could think about, namely taking the second key without the infinit oxygen. This failed by around 100 frames. In the last underwater area, though, I had enough time to pull of a rather dangerous underwater journey - even though I wouldn't call a sequence break.

	"I'm not really sure what more to write conserning the run itself, more than just saying that I've spent a good amount of time on it and never left a room before making sure that it's as fast (as far as my knowledge about the game goes). I'll gladly answer questions about it if you have any.

	"Also I didn't really know what to fill in regarding the game version so I just guessed it's USA v1.1 since the creator of the game lives in USA and it says version 1.1 on the title screen. If anyone have a better suggestion, let me know.

	"I thank caitsith2 for his testrun and other efforts about the game, Randil for making me aware of the game demo a year ago and the creator, Sivak, for the game itself plus, via some playthroughs on youtube, explaining how certain bosses fully works.
