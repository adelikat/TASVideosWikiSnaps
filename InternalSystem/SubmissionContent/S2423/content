	"Train Station: First and shortest level so also the easiest one, but it does have a similar looking guy to Waldo 2 steps under him so it's a little tricky.

	"Forest: Wood levels are probably my favorite kind of levels.

	"The Cave: It's dark and Waldo is hiding but don't be fooled because he is still easy to find.

	"The Fairground: I had to find him on his pants so he would hide in a different spot on the next level.

[p 
	"The City: Waldo is far down the street here. I think he is using a skateboard so maybe that's why.
	$LF

[p 
	"The Subway: This is the only level where I take damage to save time. I also wait a few frames after grabbing Waldo's glasses to change his spot on the next level.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The Castle: Man, Waldo is really far away here. He is also wearing blue which I think is a bad choice of him because green would have made him harder to find.
	$LF

[p 
	"The Launchpad: I don't like having to wait here. Maybe you can manipulate the Waldos here but I tried and I couldn't.
	$LF

[p 
	"My only complaint about this game is that the story makes no sense. I understand that Waldo likes to blend in with the crowd, but why is he going to the moon in the end? Is he too afraid of people noticing him that he decides to hide on the moon? It would be a great hiding spot, but where would he get food and water? Maybe he packed that stuff on his rocket ship, but judging from the rockets suprised look, I doubt it. Also, I don't think the fishbowl on his head and the tin-foil wrapped around his body will protect him from pressure. He is so naive little boy.
