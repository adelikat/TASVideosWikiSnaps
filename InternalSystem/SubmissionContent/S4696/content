The VS mode only had 15 stages, so I thought it was going to be a breeze. >.<

For you, its annoyingly only 1; there's also a cooldown immediately after a shot lands on some target. This makes it useful to make sure the bullet lands on the NPC ASAP. At the later stages, it's also faster at times to wait a while to shoot multiple things in 1 shot. This can save over 100 frames due to how slow the shooting is.

Unfortunately when played so quickly, there ends up being way more fluff than actual gameplay. This appears to be the fastest way to complete the game, but not very entertaining. Accepting to vault.
