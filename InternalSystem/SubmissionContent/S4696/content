	"An obscure single screened action game where the main objective is to attack the enemy orb. However, a little known fact is that the VS Mode also reaches the ending, so that is used instead.

	"What was supposed to be a short TAS to take a break at Jurassic Park (NES) ended up taking a lot longer than I thought. I was going to do the normal mode, but then 30 stages of unskippable transitions, score tallies and clunky controls drove me away. The VS mode only had 15 stages, so I thought it was going to be a breeze. >.<

	"Shooting
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Hold "B" to charge up. The higher the charge, the straighter the projectile moves. You and the enemies can only have a set amount of ammo on the screen at one time. For you, its annoyingly only 1; there's also a cooldown immediately after a shot lands on some target. This makes it useful to make sure the bullet lands on the NPC ASAP. At the later stages, it's also faster at times to wait a while to shoot multiple things in 1 shot. This can save over 100 frames due to how slow the shooting is.

	"You can't aim down. You can however, aim up. Even though this was never utilized in the TAS, I can't say if its completely useless since its's potentially possible to manipulate NPC's better to shoot down 2+ bots at once.

Unfortunately when played so quickly, there ends up being way more fluff than actual gameplay. This appears to be the fastest way to complete the game, but not very entertaining. Accepting to vault.
