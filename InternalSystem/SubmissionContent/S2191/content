	"In Spindizzy Worlds, you control a top named GERALD (Geographic Environmental Reconnaissance And LandMapping Device), who travels to different worlds filled with all sorts of mazes and puzzles. The objective is to find the warp out of each world, and ultimately, reach the final world (EasyDizzy/SpinDizzy).

	":  Seems like a good game for TASing.  However, Kirq pointed out some rather large improvements with his WIP (posted in the discussion).  Therefore, I am rejecting this due to technical quality.  I hope to see an improved version from you.  Also, my apologies for taking so long to judge this run.
