	":  Seems like a good game for TASing.  However, Kirq pointed out some rather large improvements with his WIP (posted in the discussion).  Therefore, I am rejecting this due to technical quality.  I hope to see an improved version from you.  Also, my apologies for taking so long to judge this run.
