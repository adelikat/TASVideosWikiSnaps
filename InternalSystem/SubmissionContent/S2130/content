	"Karnov is an awfully programmed game.  One of the most appalling features is the inability to both scroll vertically and horizontally at the same time.  This feature is quite apparent in this run.  Often it is faster to fall straight down than to jump off cliff in order to prevent addition vertical scrolling.

	"My motivation for doing this run was mainly the nostalgia of having suffered through this game during my childhood.  Because of the shoddy programming, I hoped I could find some interesting glitches or at least exploit the game is interesting ways.  Unfortunately I wasn't able to do so.  In addition, Arc's movie is quite optimized.  The scrolling results in essentially a constant state of frame rules.  There is also a frame rule on bombs.  These negated a lot of the savings I did find.  The 292 frames come from various optimizations throughout the run.  The most significant was in water level where I avoided damage in the level in order use take damage against the boss instead.
