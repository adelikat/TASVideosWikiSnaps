	" is a 1987 action game released by European home computer magazine brand Load 'n' Run. Set in the Roman Empire, you play as a soldier, who has to rescue his wife - who is chained to a post - after running past dangerous rolling objects and a raging bull. It is not to be confused with a text adventure of the same name released in 1983 by Digital Fantasia, which I've also made a submission for.

	"For this level, we have to avoid all the objects that come rolling at us, otherwise we get knocked back. We have to press O to move left and P to move right. Too many knockbacks would push us off the screen and then it would be game over. When we manage to get to the top of the screen, we can advance to the raging bull level. Not really much else to say about this segment.

	"After a little bit of toying around, I managed to come up with my own strategy to complete it as fast as I assume is possible. First we travel diagonally by alternating between O (left) and Q (up) until we hit a certain point where the bull gets confused and runs the other way. From here, we mash O (left) and then start mashing A (down) just before the bull would've ran us over. Then we take the last few steps to get to the soldier's wife and the cutscene of them running free from the bull plays. Input ends on frame 15313.

	": Level 1...no mistakes. On Level 2, it would seem that a faster way is assumed...but the trick is to get the bull to ignore you for quick passage. Could find a way to improve.
