[p 
	"This game is hard to TAS, due to its strange mechanics and many lags. So I itemize some tips:
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" To reduce lags, minimize the number of objects in screen as possible.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Sometimes you had better not kill enemy. When screen is filled with objects, some succeeding enemies may not appear.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Subpixels do not consider sign. This is the reason why the game does not calculate position correctly when you move left or up.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" You can change your weapon with SELECT while screen transition, and it often affects the amount of lags before next screen.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" If you attack at the moment you touch ladders, your velocity is remained for a while.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" When an enemy is spawned, its subpixel is not initialized. So, movement of enemies depends upon previously spawned enemies. If you need to manipulate it, try killing some other enemy (which has the same index in object list) at different timings.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Driving stages are mysterious. Some obstacles occasionally disappear. And the amount of lags sometimes increase for unknown reason.
