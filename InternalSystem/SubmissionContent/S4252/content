	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In the original Super Mario Bros., the game expects you to complete 32 levels spread across 8 worlds in order to complete the game. However, they added 
	[em 
		"warp zones
	]em
	", which allow one to skip a bunch of levels. They hid the first one in 1-2, by going over the end of the underground ceiling, which allows you to warp to worlds 2, 3, or 4. The only other underground level in the game, 4-2, also has a warp zone at the end if you go over the ceiling, which skips only two levels, taking you to world 5. It was probably a prank from the developers for those who found the first warp, and they made this warp so easy to get to with a tall pipe to stand on reaching the ceiling near the end. They hid a proper warp earlier in the level which can take you to worlds 6, 7, and 8. For TAS videos, we feature the fastest route as can be used with warp zones, as well as a 
	[em 
		"warpless
	]em
	" run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In Super Mario Bros. 2 USA, they dropped selective warp zones, and instead offer sub-con warp pipes. They also littered these throughout the game, and existed everywhere you could find a potion and a pipe in the same location. For TAS videos, we feature the fastest route as can be used with warp pipes, as well as a 
	[em 
		"warpless
	]em
	" run, and the fastest run with a suboptimal character.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In Super Mario Bros. 2 Japan, they also littered warp zones throughout the game, but this time around decided to offer backwards warp zones, and put them in every single place someone thought they were being clever by jumping over a flagpole. For TAS videos, we feature the fastest route as can be used with warp zones, as well as a 
	[em 
		"warpless
	]em
	" run, albeit with some special circumstances due to multiple ports of the game and multiple players.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Super Mario Bros 3. radically changed the way things work. The game now offers 8 regular worlds, each being a map. The amount of levels in each world is no longer uniform. Levels now may have multiple ways to be completed, and some completion methods may change how the map is affected. You can also get some items to alter or bypass things on the map. Due to the map style, many levels are also completely optional. For larger skips, 
	[em 
		"warping
	]em
	", the game featured 
	[em 
		"warp whistles
	]em
	". A warp whistle would take you to a special 9th

	[em 
		"warpless
	]em

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Super Mario World came along and kept the map idea, and multiple level endings, but dropped the item idea, and also shook things up. A lot more emphasis was placed on multiple ways to complete levels, and this served more to alter the map and game progression than items. Since there are no more items, such as warp whistles, special locations hidden with top secret secondary endings off a beaten path were now used to reach the game's 9th world, the warp world, known as 
	[em 
		"Star World
	]em
	". The game also has a secret 10th world, but that's not relevant here.

[p 
	"If one wanted to come up with a 
	[em 
		"warpless
	]em
	" Super Mario World run akin to the previous Super Mario Bros. games, one would simply need to TAS the fastest route that avoids Star World. The 
	[em 
		"96-exit
	]em
	" branch is akin to a 
	[em 
		"100%
	]em
	" branch that would exist for Super Mario Bros. 3. However, this is much less natural within SMW, as the multiple exit idea with map changes is now fused with the warp idea, so a clear 
	[em 
		"correct
	]em
	" non-
	[em 
		"shortcut
	]em
	" route through the game is no longer obvious without direct comparisons to previous games.

	"The 
	[em 
		"real
	]em
	" fastest run of Super Mario World, 
	[em 
		"warped

	[em 
		"Star World

[p 
	"Unlike the previous games so far on this non-pro site, no one has submitted a route which can complete the game by warping more than the official warp methods allow for. But with Super Mario World, our beloved 
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/Masterjun 
		"Masterjun
	]a
	" has found a way to break the game and warp to the ending from the very beginning of the game, featuring a 
	[a class=intlink href=/2380M 
		"faster than fastest route
	]a
	". This makes naming for the 
	[em 
		"real
	]em
	" fastest route difficult. Right now it's 
	[em 
		"11 exits
	]em
	", even though that's not necessarily the best appellation for it.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Comparing this run and an 
	[em 
		"11 exit
	]em
	" run shows considerable difference between the two, and indicates there is a naming problem. Either this run needs an additional appellation, or the other set of runs need something more appropriate. However, what is up for judgment here is not some logistics issue of naming, but rather whether these two runs are compatible in their goals, and serve as the same route.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This run adds a 
	[a class=extlink href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminate_and_stay_resident_program rel=nofollow 
		"TSR
	]a
	" into the game to allow one to change Mario's position within levels by entering warp codes on the extra controllers. However, one questions why not do the same thing for the map itself? Why specifically these 11 exits? If one wants to really push the boundaries of the notion of 
	[em 
		"11 exits completed
	]em
	", the 11 exits completed should be anything but the standard ones, as we would for TASing notions elsewhere.

[p 
	"This sort of goes against the spirit of the existing branch. If we look at route name alone, it should technically obsolete it. However once code is being added/modified, why not go all the way? This run is trying to pigeon hole the criteria in drawing the lines between the different ones, without drawing any additional lines between the types of abuse occurring to the game itself. After all, the current 
	[em 
		"11 exit
	]em
	" utilizes built-in abuses for completing levels too quickly, so one questions, why not this too? After careful examination of what the audience wants, from the audience members I determined are representative (meaning the ones that agree with me),
