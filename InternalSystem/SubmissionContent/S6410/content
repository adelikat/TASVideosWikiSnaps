	"When I started this TAS, it was because I discovered a new trick that makes me able to manipulate events to get the items I need. But unfortunately, I noted early on that it wasn't worth. Nonetheless, I had created a route using the Lilty class, wich has 1 more strength at start than the Selkie (used in the previous TAS). It proved to be very effective, and, saving time almost everywhere, this new run saves 50 seconds over the previous submission.

	"As always, Japanese version of the game is used more than ever because food boosts are kept between dungeons (for a certain time).

	"The route is very similar than the previous TAS, main differences being related to the 1 strength difference. Per example, I eat more meat to get better stats (wich is why my father is a rancher). I also can skip some chest artifacts that I don't need anymore since I have enough strength. Adding to this, this TAS is simply BETTER. I improved a lot, and it shows with small optimisations here and there, some new techniques I discovered on the fly like using the monsters on the traps in Veo Lu Sluice, and bigger rng manipulated (shown mostly at the end of Kilanda).

	"Even if it's close to be, it's never perfect. Manipulating rng costs frames, and it might always be possible to save some here and there. Still, RNG is way better in this TAS than the precedent. Also, Meteor Parasite is such a hard boss I can't imagine there's no way to make it faster. But the way I did took me a really long time and I did my best, I'm not even sure I would be able to redo it as fast if I try.
