	"the main time save comes from an overall cleaner performance over the whole run, but there is also a new found exploit that led to more than two seconds of saved time throughout the run. this new trick is not figured out enough to be used consistently but it works by crouching in any place at specific frames to somehow skip over seemingly random lag frames every now and then, which saves loading time and makes the game process less slow. since it is yet unclear how exactly this trick works, it is just spammed as much as possible at every place possible to hopefully maximize the chances of the effect happening.

	"there are a few places where some frames could potentially been saved, however most of those cases are based on the current lag pattern and the global timer of the game, so even though there is potential on saving frames in one screen could mean that you lose some other frames in a later screen due to the same improvement, so it is hard to tell if or how much could be saved if everything would work out perfectly in every place and time.

Better behavior would have simply led to a normal rejection, as this version of the game is strictly inferior to the version used in the published run, and the two are nearly impossible to compare because of how much poorer this version of the game is. I apologize for my last post in the submission thread being misleading, it was meant to be talking about the act of early cancellation and not the overall rejection.
