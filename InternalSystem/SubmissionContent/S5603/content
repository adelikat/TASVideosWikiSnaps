	"Argos no Juujiken (A.k.a. Rygar) is a short action game for the SMS. I improve AngerFist's original run by ~20 frames mainly by improving the last boss fight.

	"This game is pretty simple, run right and hit the boss as fast as possible. I mainly improved the last boss fight with a better attack pattern by jumping at the beginning.

	"I decided to improve this run mainly because of a silly bug in the original, where on vertical scrolling sections, the entire screen scrolls, along with your status box. This is an obvious emulation bug, so I wanted to have a fixed version.
