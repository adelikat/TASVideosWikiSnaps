	"Blues Brother's is fast-paced platformer. You make your way through 5 levels,  and there are no bosses, and you can't kill any enemies, so you'll just have to avoid them. You can crouch to get under obstacles. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The levels are not straightforward, instead they're like mazes, and this often allows for a few shortcuts here and there.

	"General tricks and comments:
	$LF
]h3
[ul 
	[li 
		"This game lags a lot. The game tries to keep you centered on the screen, so the screen usually scrolls whenever you jump. This often causes lag. I tried to avoid lag as much as I could, and I shaved off several frames by reducing lag.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"By jumping off ladders at the right time, you gain some impressive vertical momentum. This trick is used a lot in this run as both opens up new shortcuts and makes climbing up ladders faster.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"There is a dog that you can ride in this game. When you jump up on him, he'll run straight forward (really fast) until he hits a wall.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"On level 3, I manage to jump through a wall, thanks to the spikes. When you're in the "ouch i'm hit" animation, you can walk straight through spikes.
