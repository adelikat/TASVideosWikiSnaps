		"Slide speed trick.
	]b
	" Sliding is the fastest way to move. To maintain the speed, first slide, then release all directional buttons and jump exactly when the slide ends. If you touch the ground for more than 1 frame or press left/right, the speed is lost. Rather common trick in games (Genesis Batman, NES Yo! Noid), but not obvious since people are tricked by the assumption that pressing right is a good thing.

		"Screen edge swap trick.
	]b
	" In the end of one autoscroller level (around 12:10), a small cutscene (about 5 seconds) is skipped by sliding to the left when the screen is scrolling to the right. I assume the player position goes too much to the left and overflows to the right (where the level end trigger is located). The timing needs to be precise for the slide to work.

	[b 
		"Stop animation trick.
	]b
	" Pressing B (attack) rapidly causes the animation to get stuck on it's current state. So, even though the slide itself can't be made continuous, the slide animation can be prolonged. This was useful in boss battles since slide delivers 2 points of damage (as fists and kicks do 1). Normally it is not possible to slide on some of the bosses because they are floating in the air, but with this trick it's possible to do a jump with the slide sprite. Interestingly, the first form of the final boss is not designed for a 2-point hit, so the game can't handle it. That's why I need to kick it instead of slide-jumping on it.
