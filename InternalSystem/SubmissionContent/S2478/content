	"This is a 1175 frame improvement to http://tasvideos.org/2470S.html and a 1373 frame improvement to the currently published run. The improvements are due to a lot more zipping, door entry optimization and other small improvements.

		"Door speed:
	]b
	$LF
	"If you hold up and left or up and right through a door you start in the next room with a speed of 14. This is why we turn in some doors. There is also some door lag, but it can be avoided with different inputs.

	$LF
	"This trick is not used in our run, as it is completely useless. If you zip and then fall off and on the wall in the top right corner or bottom left corner of the screen, you get warped back to the main stairway.

	"This run started about a week ago, when I notified Sonikkustar about a zip improvement I found. Then I slowly found more and more zips everywhere and this is the result. For the past few days we have been doing 2-3 rooms a day, and now we are done.
