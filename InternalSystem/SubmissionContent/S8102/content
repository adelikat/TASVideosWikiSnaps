	"Slide Boy in Maze Land is a homebrew released in 2021 by Vladimir Zuniga, the same person that made Peril, for the Atari 2600 and 7800 systems. You play as Slide Boy, who navigates through a collection of mazes while avoiding a vast variety of foes.

	"The Atari 7800 version already has a TAS made by Darkman425. This TAS plays through the Atari 2600 version. The significant thing about this one is that it's my first submission that isn't of an NES game!

	"Although you may not think it, the 2 versions actually have a lot of differences, the most significant being that this version has 50 levels instead of the A7800's 30. The first 14 levels are copied from the A7800 version, whereas the other 36 are exclusive to this version.

	"Apart from one small trick, the gameplay is pretty trivial. You just have to press directions on the 1st frames possible. That one small trick I use is what I like to call "Quick Score". This saves a huge total of... 6 frames. I know, pretty anticlimactic, right? That's because it's only used in 2 levels - 1 and 12. Here's how it works: if you finish a level 1-5 frames before the time bar ticks down, you can instead delay the final input for that number of frames. This trick only saves 5 frames per level at most and the circumstance for it is very rare.

	"I have to wait many, many times for enemy sprites to move. The waits vary from 1 frame to ~60 frames. After over 9 minutes of nonstop sliding, waiting, hitting buttons and being a boy in Maze Land, I can finally end input when I start sliding to the goal in Level 50.
