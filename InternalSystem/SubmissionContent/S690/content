	"Basically, after Blitzag's & Genisto's last submitted version was not accepted, I began playing around with it on my own. After I finally made a complete video, I then played around a lot with improving it, hex-editting the file many many many times. Eventually, the only remaining ideas would only knock a few frames off that part but would cause an overworld desync later that caused more than 20 frames of delay. I then tried to combine improvements and redo the overworld, but once again it did not improve the time. This is what resulted in this final video.

	"A big thanks goes to Blitzag for all of his original work putting the first few versions of the run together. More thanks to Genisto for his specific parts in Blitzag's run; I had to study him executing the healer glitch quite a bit to duplicate it, and I studied his Dark Link fight as well. Also, thanks go to Arc as well since I also studied his Zelda 2j run (mostly for the Dark Link battle).

	"Now, about the Healer Glitch, I made updated maps of Death Mountain and the Great Palace to take into account the glitch. Mostly it causes the game to behave weird when you exit screens to the left. If you scroll the screen to the right a bit, exitting to the left will either send you to an unexpected place, otherwise you'll enter the room to the left pretty much in the middle of the room. It's rather difficult to explain beyond that.

	"The Healer Glitch is what gives most of the Overworld and Palace warps. The other glitch, holding U+D on an elevator, is another which causes you to go off the top of screen and come off the bottom of the screen below you.

	"The one death in the game is not necessary, but it's 256 frames faster. If you exit that screen as it is, you get sent deeper into Death Mountain and it's quite a backtrack to get to the rock (which is what warps you across the world). Dying allows you to exit the room normally without activating the glitch.
