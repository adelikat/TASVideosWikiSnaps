	"Given that it was Visual Basic 6's 15th anniversary 3 months and 1 day ago, probably, I've decided to do what most VB6 beginners do, but with tools! That's right, I created a classic "Hello World" application, as fast as possible.
	$LF

[p 
	"The movie starts when VB6 is loaded (doesn't matter from where, so I chose the Start menu), and ends when F5 is pressed to run the created application. In between, a label is created and given the caption "Hello World".

		"The movie format is VERY similar to that of Gens', as the branch was based off of Gens' code. The only things different are mostly the content of each frame, and the framerate. This introduces two problems with the submission stats: the run is not @60FPS, but @20FPS (this is hardcoded), which brings the actual time to 8.65 seconds; and the fact that this isn't a Genesis game, but a Windows application (the file extension for the movie file is the same). These two issues are being solved as you're reading this.

	"Overall, this went smoothly. Definitely a run that many, MANY people have been wanting to see. I did run into some problems while aligning the cursor to create the label, but I ultimately ran across this layout for the label, which is the perfect optimization between label size and mouse speed. Enjoy!
