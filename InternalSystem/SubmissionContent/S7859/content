However, we never see the Murderer again, and instead have to deal with the quicker killing Jester and the slow reacting Bad Doctor. Timing the throw on the Jester is where the input ends as no input is needed to remove the Bad Doctor as throwing him out early will only bring the Murderer, and also wasting time by looking at the (fun)dungeon twice.
