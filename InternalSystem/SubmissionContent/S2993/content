	"<Well Lamborghini - American Challenge is a racing game of style begin-to-end-without-laps around the country of U.S.A, this game is know for being very limited ... It's requires you to pay a fee for go to each race and money is very hard to get in ammounts and buying itens without caution may give you a game over screen for spending all money but without letting any for the fee... you can just get around 60% of the prize because 40% is a fee... but I've found a glitch that I will explain how it went on this run and I manage to end the game in only 6 races.>

	"<Well... the way I've found this glitch may sound very Strange or uncommon(?), I found it around 14 years ago when I was around 7~8 years old...while i was playing SNES at my cousin house I remember when we always playied this game in career mode I were the one who always had to do it because i knew how to do it but without figure out why it would happen... and one day I accidentaly went into a hard race which if i lost it should give a game over screen because there would be no money to pay others race fee, then when i lost instead of it giving me an game over I could instead get an huge money and buy all equips in the first stage of the game and with lots of spare, so I just figured out now how it work and  that I could use it as an advantage for a video since racing games are way too boring for obvious reasons and this game can be very boring if you go without glitch stage-by-stage, thats why I take advantage of this and skip around 65-70% of the races.
	$LF
	"<Now about how the glitch may work... well I think the game cant give a minus value for your money... for example, when i go to the 2nd race i have actually 28000 and fee is 24000 so i got only 4000, however, there is polices there... and on depends of your speed you can get a fine for high speed, so I get caught while driving at high speed, my fine is 7000+ it gives a negative value for your money and somehow breaks the game giving you instead of immediat game over screen, amounts of money... thats a heck of a glitch, its seem there were bad programmers for the game huh!?>

	"<Well at least this one got a pretty exciting music, here is where the glitch takes action...I let a rival bump me in the back, so I dont get the careful driver bonus which is 50000. Since the cars are strongs than mine I could just win with 2 nitro and perfect precision without colliding into anyone, however, here I'm not aiming for 1st place... I make precise use of the second nitro to pass throught the 2nd radar police above 203MPH, because at 203 I could get a fine of 3900 and should just have 100 and then finishing the race it could give me instantly game over however I increase the speed enough to get an higher fine and instead I get somehow rich enough to buy everything I need>

I hope my work pleases your watches and not be a waste of time ... I really did the best I could even doing this run in 1 day but I did a long research before that because I tought it could be rejected for bad dump but its just bad programming...and it was a very pleasant TAS to work into... hope you all enjoy. >
