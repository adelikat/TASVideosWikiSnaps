	"Welcome to a new, small improvement for the Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee Maximum Casualties TAS. This run is 1246 frames faster than the current published movie (excluding bootup) due to some optimizations and not manually killing 28 Mudokons at the start of the game. I contacted Dooty a few weeks ago about what Oddworld TASes are left to improve and I asked him about the Maximum Casualties TAS and told him that exiting RuptureFarms to kill the 28 that get slaugthered at the end of the level is faster and he told me he regrets manually killing them as it was a bad choice speedwise, and he agrees with me that a new run would be a lot faster. Also Alphatemp has shown in an realtime speedrun that this new method is quicker. But since the new emulator core is here, this improvement is two seconds slower than PCSX-RR thanks to better loading times and accurate PSX emulation. This run also uses shortcuts taken from the 100% and any% runs. In addition to all of this, Abe marks is 20th Birthday this year since this game was was first released so this movie makes it perfect to mark Abe's 20th Birthday. Happy Anniversary Abe!

	"Often abbreviated as DDG, it makes Abe invincible and can corrupt his sprite and eventually become invisible when rolling into mines or UXB's allowing him to get past enemies that would kill Abe. Abe will die if he falls of a ledge or gets zapped. A video made by Sligfantry can show you how this glitch works:

	"By timing this glitch perfectly you can make Abe stop and turn. To set it up, Abe needs to be standing near a ledge (pressing up whilst tunring arround) you will be able to make Abe do a backwards jump. Notice that when you press the opposite direction to where Abe is standing at the incorrect frame, Abe will just jump up and stand. But if you time it perfectly, Abe will jump backwards and possibly jump to another screen. This will allow you to jump backwards to areas and skip Zulags. Sligfantry's video can show you how this glitch works:
