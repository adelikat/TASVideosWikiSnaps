	"In the bossfight, you're supposed to wait for Wally to turn back and wait at a barrel to damage him, however, you can simply wait for him to turn around, and, because of 
	[em 
		[b 
			"shitty
		]b
	]em
	" hitboxes, hit him from inside of the barrel while he's turned back and then do the intended way to play the level. And that was the Early Damage strat in my previous TASes of this game. But then, I realized, you could simply hold the B button and mash A really fast to keep hitting him from inside the barrel, and that's what I named 
	[b 
		"The Ultra Kill
	]b
	". Sadly, this technique is around a second slower on difficult mode, due to the game having a cooldown on the B button, so you have to mash B too, making the fight a bit slower.

[div class=p 
	"Almost the same thing as Level 1, trying to optmize movement as much as I can, mainly on the sloooow climb there is on the middle of the first section of the level. In the skiing section of the level, the rocks can actually give you a good amount of damage, so almost all of those have to be jumped over, which lost a little bit of frames. On the bossfight, when dropping a pinecone/hazelnut on Charlie the Polar Bear's head, he would jump to the other way he would've instead on the Easy mode, which lead to having to do a little re-route here, going straight to locking the boss in the right side of the screen.
