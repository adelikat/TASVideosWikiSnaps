Instead, I used C948 (Follower X pos on phone use) to get to E9 for the jump. The 03 offset for 5903 is because the 1st Denjuu's name last character (E0) is a 2 byte opcode, so it would mess up the payload.

	" end of the ending, just before the credits. This plays the credits, of course, but more importantly it sets the game completion state by unlocking postgame content. Triggering the credits directly would not have done this, and triggering anything before this would have lost time. I've verified that the postgame state was triggered in this run by locating and accessing a piece of postgame content, meaning that for our purposes, the game is considered complete. Note that other event flags are NOT triggered, most notably the flag for the final boss's defeat. Flags like these are not necessary for GEG runs: Since a majority of the game is skipped anyway, so are a majority of normally required event flags. As long as these flags do not adversely affect the ending by not being triggered, then triggering them is unnecessary. In this case, since the final boss flag does not directly trigger the postgame content, it is fine that it is skipped.
