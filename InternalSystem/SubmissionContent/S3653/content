	"I first played this game a year ago, thinking it might be possible to do a decent TAS of it. Then some other game got my interest and time passed. Then I became interested in Tekken Advance again after Cooljay started posting those Tekken 3 TAS WIPs, so I grabbed my old notes and did some more research of the game, then made this TAS.

[div class=p 
	"Well, it's a Tekken game, and it's for GBA. They've managed to capture the Tekken spirit in this one quite well, with very similar combat physics and all. A bit stripped down experience, with only 10 characters and some moves omitted, but it's still a surprisingly good fighter for a handheld console.

[div class=p 
	"Tekken Advance stands out because it has Tag Battle-mode in it, something PSX Tekkens don't have. Tag Battle is basically like Arcade, except you get to choose three characters to use and switch between at any time during a match. The opponent also has three characters to use in each match. This makes a Tag Battle TAS far more versatile and entertaining than just playing normal Arcade-mode using one character.

[div class=p 
	"The most noticeable thing here is the super speed trick, done by interrupting normal movement by for example pressing down every other frame. With most characters nothing too interesting happens, but Yoshimitsu and Jin are special cases whose movement speed increases about threefold when this trick is used. You can also do a backwards slide with them, which looks nice.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"It's pretty easy to manipulate the enemy in this game. Just moving differently or waiting some frames before an attack causes different results.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Starting air attacks is a bit glitchy in this game:
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- If you press up for 9 frames before letting go and attacking, you get a special effect. With a punch, the character suddenly appears inside ground for a frame before landing like normal. It looks strange and also allows you to evade things that you normally shouldn't be able to. With a kick, the character does their air kick on ground level, after which their idle animation freezes up. So the use is mostly visual.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- If you press up/right or up/left for 9 frames before letting go and doing a kick, the character does their air kick on ground level but afterwards the game thinks they are crouching. This allows you to follow up the kick with "full crouch" (fc) or "while standing" (ws) moves without any delay, allowing some slightly strange combos to be done.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- doing these variations can fool the opponent to think you're jumping although you never leave the ground.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p

[div class=p 
	"Hitting enemies after a juggle at a certain time when they're bouncing on the ground "resets" the juggle and allows you to continue longer than normal. This is used a lot by Jin in the later half of the run.

	"A strong impact (red flash) doesn't send the opponent flying anywhere if he is close enough to the ground. This allows to do the 100% flea combo in Stage 5.

	"Unlike in, say, Mortal Kombats, it's possible for characters to hit or even launch themselves simultaneously. This is used a few times in the run because it looks interesting. In some cases it's possible to speed up a slow launcher by taking damage right as you launch your enemy.
