	"Battle Kid features a password system and has bonus levels that can be accessed from it. This movie aims to complete the bonus level associated with the password SGCLEVEL. It is in fact the exclusive to Version 1.1 of the game. The level is beaten with the onscreen timer stopping at 19:26.

There is a decent chance that at least one of the rooms is done slower in my movie, but it is hard to do a proper comparison based on video dumps alone so I believe this is the best I can provide at this point.
