	"When I pause for no apparent reason it's often for luck manipulation, especially in the final battle where the number of attacks done by certain points in time determine how long the boss stays out of reach later. The final battle would have been faster if I'd had more ammo, but I chose to use more of that on earlier bosses that would have done more time-wasting things if not killed fast enough. How much ammo to use in each battle and level was planned out beforehand based mainly on the HP of bosses and what delays they had.
