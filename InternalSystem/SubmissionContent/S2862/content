	""Power Rangers" was a popular franchise back in the 90's, with several TV-shows, toys and video-games. This game is a quite decent platformer beat-em-up, where you can play as any of the five Power Rangers. There are 5 levels in the game, and 2 robot fights after the final level.

	"I'd like to start with explaining why Kimberly is the character you want to use in a TAS. She is the fastest Ranger (moving at 2 pixels per frame), her bow has a very nice melee range and she can take out 1 HP enemies by shooting them with the bow. All this makes her ideal for a TAS.

	"This is a no-damage run. I chose this sub-goal in hopes of making the run more entertaining. Taking damage would have saved perhaps 5-6 seconds.

	"You have quite an arsenal of different attacks in this game, both in your normal form and in your Power Ranger form. Almost all these moves come to use in this TAS, which is nice. Usually, the fastest way to take out enemies is to first group them together, and then take them all out with a combo. You usually have to manipulate their movement first to make them huddle together.

	"The TAS itself is pretty self-explanatory. Through out the levels, the screen will stop scrolling now and then and you have to fight off some enemies. After they're all dead, you can continue moving on. It should be noted that the screen won't start scrolling again until every enemy is dead, even the ones that spawned before the screen stopped.

	"Most enemies have either 1 HP or 15 HP. The ones with 1 HP can be taken out with any attack. The ones with 15 HP are usually taken out with either a "3 punch 1 kick" combo (good if you want to kill the enemies fast to make the next wave of enemies spawn) or a "6 punches" combo (good if you want to keep moving after you killed the enemies). In your ranger form, you don't have much choice - the fastest way to take out 15 HP enemies is your normal 4 hit combo.

	"The enemies with shields have 24 (shield) + 15 HP. These take some work to kill, but luckily, they only appear on level 2. There are also some enemies with swords (only on level 5, 15 HP).

[p 
	"The movement of enemies and bosses depend on your position. I've found that your distance to the enemies seem to have an effect on how they behave. In practice, you usually have to lose some frames if you want to manipulate an enemy or a boss into a specific behaviour.

	"I might add some more information later, but this should be enough for now. Enjoy the run!
