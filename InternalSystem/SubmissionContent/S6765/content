At midnight, I enter the stock to perform a day glitch, you have 3 frames between midnight and the frame where the game will automatically put you in bed.

	" require for different game modes to feature at least 50% unique gameplay in order to be accepted side-by-side, and it's considered regarding the game itself, and not depending of the contents that may or not end up in a movie. So I looked for the overall gameplay differences between the two character choices available, and I've come to the conclusion that these should be considered as two different game modes. There are differences about how the game starts and how it ends, but most notably there are differences in abilities and usage of the two characters, which unavoidably results in enough different gameplay, in both casual play and speedrunning. For these reasons, I consider the Girl and the Boy modes acceptable for Vault publication side-by-side.
