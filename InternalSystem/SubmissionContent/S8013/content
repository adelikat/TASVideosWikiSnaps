Given it takes 2 frames to turn off SFX, I had to check whether I was getting 2+ frames of SFX lag. I originally TASed up to level 5 with SFX on, but found 5 lag frames in level 5 that could have been avoided with SFX on. So I went back, turned it off and resynced everything. I’m sure there would be more SFX lag in later levels of the TAS, but given I definitely know of at least 5 frames in level 5, I know it was worth turning off SFX.

The only downside is that it shoots too high to kill the blue enemies. Although it takes time to get the upgrade, it’s worth it since it allows you to get through the levels quicker and deal damage to the boss much quicker. The missile locks you out of your movement for slightly longer than a punch, so most 4 health enemies are killed with 1 missile + 1 punch.

This can only be incremented in the 2-x levels by killing enemies, so this would be very slow to manipulate. Conveniently, punching in the 1-x levels increments the RNG for each punch. So I do 3 punches in the end of the 1-3 boss to manipulate a drop from the first robot enemy I see. This doesn’t lose any time to manipulate since I’m waiting for the fadeout anyway.
