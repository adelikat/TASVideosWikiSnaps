	"Well, since Mars608 and aiqiyou unveiled lvl7 spike wall strat I have to submit this movie (I made this run about a month ago but I tried to find some improvements at lvl 8 and didn't submit it right away). This is a 4 frame improvement of my previous TAS. Improvements come from spike wall kill at lvl7. I didn't find a way to kill the second wall in time unfortunately.
