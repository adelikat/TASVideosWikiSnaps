	"This run improves the published one by 4865 frames, the improvement comes from a lot of small changes in strategy, better boss battles, a powerful new combo and, believe it or not, a reset.

	"Almost no changes in the first stage, but as mentioned by mikwuyma, the backflip is faster than run. It is, but only when you don’t have to deal with a lot of enemies, so it’s not used often here.

	"The new combo was found here and is where it saved the most frames on the run. To perform it, you need to jump and do either a flying kick or a stab, the former do more damage but the latter can be executed in place, and since those bosses are manipulated by your position, it is preferred.

	"Even not morphed, Kimberly also benefits from the new combo to break doors. It’s not as effective, but still saves time. Well, finally a stage where the backflip can be used more often, also, boct1584’s wall jumps gave the idea to use it at the end of the elevator section too.

	"Randil, his memory addresses, and obviously his strategies that you can see all over the new run, helped me immensely. boct1584, as said before, his wall jumps saved quite some time on the new run, but he also suggested the "no damage taken" to make the run more consistent. mikwuyma, of course for his backflip suggestion. Thank you all guys.
