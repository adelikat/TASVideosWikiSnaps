	"In Stacked mode, you always start at level 1 of a selected stage. However, there’s a glitch that allows you to start at any level on any stage in Stacked mode. Highlight Hard mode, pick any stage and any level, go back to the mode selection (the flashing option is determined by what option you’re on, in this case, the Hard mode is flashing), then press right and start at the same time, and you’re on Stacked mode at the level you selected of the stage you selected. For example: If you start at stage 2 level 4, you’ll have the M, the A, and the G. Get all the letters that spell out MAGIC, you completed the stage.

Normally, highlighting Stack mode locks the level of a certain stage to 1 (I'm not sure if there's a progression system of any kind). But by using the aforementioned method explained, I used it to skip to the last level. I used minimal luck manipulation as the level is short and is beaten under 30 seconds,
