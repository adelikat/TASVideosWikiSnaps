	"Basically, when a bullet makes contact with any disc, the game has to check each disc in sequence until it finds the one that was hit.  Because of this, it's not always fastest to shoot the disc closet to the ship.  Sometimes shooting farther discs actually saves time by minimizing the time it takes to check though collision sequence.
