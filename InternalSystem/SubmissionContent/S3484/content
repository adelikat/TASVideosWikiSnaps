	"Like the previous run, I use a code (reset the game 13 times) to initiate a level select.  The really long gray screen at the beginning is from me "mashing" reset as fast as possible.  Yes, this is a "cheat code" but was deemed acceptable.  Partly because it is mentioned in the instruction manual and mainly becuase the alternative is to have a 37min, repetitive auto-scroller that offers little that this shorter run does not.

	$LF
]div
[div class=p

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"HOWEVER, I have a possible speed/entertainment trade-off in that I don't minimize points (in an attempt to minimize lives) during the level.  I don't want to do this because it is an auto-scroller with minimal entertainment value as is.  I don't want to exacerbate the problem for fraction of a second of non-input game completion time.  I could have chosen a no-death goal but in this case the death adds an extra layer of strategy that I don't like taking out for the sake of a cleaner goal.

	"1)  Zanac is underrated in its amazing music.  I rank the music easily in the top five all time NES sountracks.  It is equal, if not superior than that of the megaman series or the castlevania series.  The one downside of the warped run is that you don't get to experience all of the tracks.
	$LF
	"2)  This game features hords of enemies but absolutely no lag.  Considering this is one of the older NES games, this is quite impressive.  Especially when you consider some of the newer, "more advanced" games lag when ANYTHING happens in the game (*cough* mm3 *cough*).
