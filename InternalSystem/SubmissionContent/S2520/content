]h3
[p 
	"This game isn't a port of older Lode Runner games. It has new levels (most of them), a new enemy (the buried guy) and a new type of objects (boulders, though they may have been introduced in some other games).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The gameplay resembles other 2D Lode Runners, but it has something unique: when all gold piles are obtained, a portal must be taken in order to complete the level.
	$LF

[h4 
	" So why this game for a TAS?
	$LF
]h4
[ul 
	[li 
		" The graphics and sounds are not bad for an action-puzzle game, and to some degree they can be considered "good".
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" The game itself is very hard compared to many other Lode Runners.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" The game speed can be set to FAST, resulting in a faster-paced Lode Runner than others.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" There are quite a few time-saving glitches and exploits as well, meaning quite a few unexpected solutions can be discovered.

	[li 
		" A legitimate ending can be achieved in less than 20 minutes before it becomes too long.

[p 
	"In conclusion, this game is good for TASing being an action puzzle.

[p 
	"Both of Small World and Hidden World have level size of 15*10. Both of Middle World and High World have level size of 24*15. Hidden World and High World have more difficult levels than Small World and Middle World have, respectively.

[h4 
	" Portals
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"In older games in the series, you complete a level by climbing up to the highest row in the level after collecting/destroying all gold piles. In this game, however, you have to complete a level by taking a portal that only appears after collecting/destroying all gold piles.

[h4 
	" The buried guy and his teddy
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The buried guy is an unrespawning enemy hidden in one of certain brick blocks in every level. He carries a teddy bear with him, which is worth quite some bonus points. Otherwise, he is just a different-looking baddy as the others. He is unnecessary for completing a level. However, I featured the bear once on Round 19 at the cost of 16 frames, which would cost much more time if done in other rounds.

[h4 
	" Boulders
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Boulders are acting like plain boxes in other games. They can be pushed, used as platforms and baddy-crushers, or buried to vanish permanently. Baddies cannot move Rocks.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"For some reason, you can "climb down" a baddy's head for one frame and stay at that height without getting killed. When you have done this, the enemy AI thinks you are overlapping with the baddy, and the baddy will try to keep staying in your position.
	$LF

[p 
	"This is abused in many levels in the movie.

[h4 
	" Drilling while moving
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"when you are falling off ropes, grabbing onto ladders or walking off falling boulders (and maybe baddies as well), you'll move in uninterruptable animations for several frames. If you start to drill a block at the beginnings of such animations, you can keep drilling while moving.

	" Walking off/climbing down a boulder/baddy
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"For some reason, boulders and baddies have wider tops than other solid blocks. You can barely walk off their tops and drill bricks one-block away before falling down. However, you can't acquire gold piles hanging diagonally up in the air this way.
	$LF

[p

[p 
	"If you push a boulder out of a brick block that is just about to finish materialization, that brick will be nullified for the rest of the gameplay. The boulder is unaffected by this glitch if it is pushed to the left side, while it will visually vanish but stay immobile next to the nullified block if it is pushed to the right side.
	$LF

[p 
	"Similarly, if a boulder falls almost through a rematerializing brick block but gets stuck at the last moment, the brick block will also be nullified and the boulder will visually vanish but stay immobile on the bottom of the glitched brick block.

	": A well received TAS of this puzzlegame. As mentioned in the thread, games like these are well suited for competition, but this TAS looks well-planned. The hardest difficulty wasn't picked for a valid reason, as it can only be played after completing easier difficulties, and a way longer movie probably wouldn't be received nearly as well.
