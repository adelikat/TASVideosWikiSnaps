	"This movie, like the other two that you submitted, doesn't count as fastest-completion nor full-completion, so it could be accepted only if the audience considers it entertaining. For the other two submissions, it was so obvious to me that I didn't need to ask for further reception from the community. Instead, for this submission, I wasn't 100% sure, so I made a temp encode in order to make it easier for the people to watch the movie. The result was negative: few people were interested, and they gave mediocre votes in the submission thread.
