	"Millenniummon's also has more chances of being a dick. Then again that applies to all the AI in the game on Hard... if this wasn't a TAS and I didn't spend 90 seconds in each battle pinning a Digimon up against a wall and murdering them.

	"Guilmon has a special charge up which allows increased damage but only for one attack a charge, and no air attacks.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"I found out through some checking out that the most damage you can do to Millenniummon at anytime is with a sprint attack as it deals 3 damage, which is a whole one more from a normal charged attack of 2.
