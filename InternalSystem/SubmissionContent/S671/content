	"Donkey Kong is a game that needs no introduction.  This run plays the game on B mode, which is supposed to be more difficult.  As expected, only the first three levels are played since those three are repeated infinitely afterwards.  It's 7 seconds faster than a previous submission of 1:29 http://bisqwit.iki.fi/nesvideos/301S.html , but it's difficult to really compare them since that one was done on Famtasia.

	"The main reason why this run is faster is that luck was abused.  Jumpman doesn't jump over a single barrel or flame.  It's not a perfect run, because I had to twist around for one frame a couple of times to affect the "randomness", and near the end I couldn't get around that flame without waiting for a moment.  That one pause took up about 4 frames.  If someone were able to find a perfect way to manipulate luck, probably about 6-10 frames could be taken off of this time.

	"Most of this run was done with frame advance, especially at ladder ends and when trying to manipulate luck.  Only on straightaways and while waiting for to control Jumpman before the level did I not use frame advance.

	"Well, this was my first run (though I had two runs of this game before that I didn't submit, and there were many other times that FCE crashed so I lost those attempts), and I hope people enjoy it, regardless of whether it's accepted or not.
