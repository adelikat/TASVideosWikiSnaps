	": This is a nice run, but after you watch the first few minutes, you've basically seen all it has to offer entertainment wise. Yet the action is dense, and it's more than carelessly running right. The feedback was very narrow, but positive. And the game's quality is quite high, you feel the Amiga spirit in it very well. Accepting to Moons.
