		"The Lost Strawberry
	]b
	" is a platform game developed by Egor Dorichev for the Ludum Dare 40 game jam. The game, heavily inspired by other PICO-8 platformers such as 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Celeste Classic|href=/4585M)
	", tasks the player to jump and climb their way out of 25 precision platforming levels.

	"The game itself is not particularly complex, however, it introduces some interesting elements not seen in Celeste Classic. For starters, it does not have a dash like that game does. Instead, the player can execute a double jump whenever they touch the “evil essences”. This can be at any point once a player has touched one of these, but only in midair, and the available dash is lost if the player touches the ground. Players can also climb poles found across maps.

	"… There’s not a lot to say about the game, really. The most relevant game technique is pole jumping. Your character automatically grabs poles when he’s close enough to them, and you can climb up or down holding the proper button. If you move out of range from the pole laterally while holding up, during the next 3 frames you may press or hold the jump button to jump as if grounded. This is used in several levels, be it to perform skips or to climb faster, as jumping speed is considerably higher than climbing speed.

	"I’d also like to mention that in two levels, I was unable to get to the moving platforms in a good cycle so I was forced to wait. In the first I use the idle time to collect a berry, and in the second one I just showcase some silly clipping while I wait. I tried to exploit this clip to maybe get out of the level right away, but I had no success.
