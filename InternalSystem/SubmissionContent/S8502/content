	"This game features your standard side-scrolling shooter mechanics: The character can shoot in 3 (4 mid-air) cardinal directions. If an enemy is in close proximity, Hominid will use a melee attack instead. The player can only have 3 bullets visible on the screen at once, meaning spam-firing can result in missing out on damage and optimal kills.

	"Downward shooting mid-air is used frequently in this run to take out enemies entering the screen as quickly as possible.

[div class=p 
	"One unique feature of this game is the ability to ride enemies. This is performed by pressing Down+Jump above an enemy. Devouring an enemy's head in this state will scare nearby hostiles. One notable mechanic of this feature is that ridden enemies are suspectible to friendly fire. This mechanic is used a few times in the run(see 00:35).

	"The game has additional ammo types obtainable as power-ups: Fire ammo and "Big" ammo. The former will deal x2 damage to the enemies and bosses but it introduces a lengthy death animation on regular enemies. The latter will deal x3 damage and can penetrate enemies. Both power-ups provide a limited number of bullets before reverting to the default type.

	"The intended mechanic is to use the awning of the nearby building to avoid the robot's running attack. Instead, I stick to the edges of the screen to stay as close to the boss as possible. The boss' second attack is a sweeping laser beam in two different heights. Luckily, the boss is dealt with before the floor sweep begins.

	"While the enemy variety is limited (besides the bosses and the singular grenade enemy, the same two enemy instances are continuously recycled), the enemy movement is reliant on RNG, making optimizations quite tedious due to frequent de-syncs.

	"Similarly, power-up spawns and types are RNG dependent, with "Big Ammo" being the preferred type.
