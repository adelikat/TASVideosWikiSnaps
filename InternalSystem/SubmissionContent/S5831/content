	$LF
	"Before you doing a jump, you be obliged to be in "running" state, because your X speed increases, you lose you speed when you hit before your Y position increases (I recall you that when you jump your Y position decreases and  when you fallout, your Y position increases), when you do an double jump you lose a few speed (some little %, but not a lot), if you use an attack in double jump position, you lose your speed, best solution is to attack when you fallout and don't be in double jump, it haven't you to remake inputs to run when you landing.

	"-HOW TO SKIP THE FIRST BOSS IN LEVEL 2-
	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"It's possible to skip the first boss at the end of level two.
	$LF
	"To do this, you will have to climb the tree branches, on the left of the screen, before going through the door.
	$LF
	"This is the only solution, because when you jump after climbing on the branches, you lose a few pixels and accumulation + double jump make a perfect Y position for landing and don't close the door.
	$LF
	"The game considers that you haven't passed the trigger zone, because the door is open and the boss does not appear to start the fight, you can pass the second trigger to complete the level and kill the second boss.

	"-CONCLUSION-
	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"For me, this is a great Shinobi game, when I forget the digital graphics, but who are not very bad, I prefer the old artistic direction.
	$LF
	"Else this game is better that her predecessors (yet I'm a big fan) , good difficulty, best gameplay, good levels, excellent musics...
	$LF
	"I have just a little disappointment, because it haven't a giant boss and not more of ninjustu.
	$LF
	"Don't forgot, that this game have now 23 years and that it can not be compared with the old Shinobi, who must be play only with shurikens, they are very different and are all the very good games.
	$LF
	"I'm a very greatest fan of ninja games (or samuraï), my favourite is Ninja gaiden on Xbox classic (and NG black), I hate shinobi on PS2, who for me have killing the licence of the best game on Genesis and when I view that Ryu Hayabusa is become an ninja in a very easy game and not interesting...
	$LF
	"I say, go to hell, gamers who find that these games are too difficult and all creators who listen just the global gamer's commentaries instead of fan's opinions, just to business!
