	"I was considering getting into TASing, but didn't know how I should go about getting my feet wet, so I decided to go with a game I know fairly well, so I could focus more on learning how to use the tools without needing to also learn the game as well. That said, there isn't really anything groundbreaking in this TAS compared to the currently published one, it does make use of a minor wallclimbing glitch to save time (turnaround kicks), and improves on lag reduction in many areas. Overall strategy usage is essentially identical to Hetfield90's TAS, though at his suggestion I opted for a different maverick route, ending with Mammoth instead of Octopus (for luck manipulation purposes, among other ideas that didn't pan out).

[p 
	"When right up against a wall to the right, pressing left+right will cause X to grab the empty space to the left to slide down. To take advantage of this, press jump the frame after the left+right input and X will kick off the empty space on the left instead of the wall on the right. This allows for more optimal climbing of a single wall straight up, and is exceptionally good for walls that are fairly short but still require 1 wallkick to get past (since you can use the forced momentum of X kicking away from the wall to make real progress through the stage, rather than going the wrong direction, see Kuwanger stage). As far as I can tell, it's only possible on a right wall, probably because of how the game treats left+right inputs, sort of giving priority to left over right. This trick also works in X2 and X3, though I don't know how helpful it would be. No clue if this was a known thing before, but I found them by accident during the creation of this TAS.

	"This stage is probably the one that's most like the published TAS, for lack of anything unique to do. One of the few differences is the use of a glitch where you hold both weapon swap buttons which make X not glow himself during a charge, but keeping the particle ffects around him. This is a wacky stage, seemingly arbitrary inputs created/removed lag frames (using the currently-useless weapon swap buttons, for instance). I managed to gain an edge on lag management, only for virtually all of it to go away due to cars and Vile's ship. I finished the stage 1 frame ahead, somehow picked up another frame during the ensuing cutscene, then lost both frames because X walked a longer distance to the center to teleport out of the stage (then lost a frame on load times for penguin's stage, but that wasn't accounted for in my timing scheme).

	"Hetfield was helping me try to improve the log zips at the start of the stage, since the first one is fairly weak, but the best I could do was a marginally improved first zip for a delayed slope jump, and then the second one was completely ruined. So I just went back to the tried-and-true method of doing slope jumps as soon as possible and everything worked out nicely. The penguin fight was when I discovered the turnaround kicks while being lazy and not erasing right dpad inputs in TAStudio, so I went back and added them into the stage in the spots they'd be helpful. Normally, you'd want to jump out of the Ride Armor as late as possible, since the Ride Armor dashes faster than X, but with the turnaround kick you just want maximum height when you reach the ledge you wallkick off of.

The elevator skip is a bit different, but still the same idea, get to the top and reach the checkpoint, then commit suicide. The very next section can potentially be done a few frames faster, but for the life of me I couldn't manage to do it and still get the right position+subpixels to get the gap jump on that third ladder, so that bit remains basically unchanged from Rolanmen1 and Fractalfusion's old WIP.

I don't know exactly what determines where the rocks fall, but I tried killing or not killing an enemy or two and the result was always the same, so maybe they're just on a global timer or something, that or I just got really unlucky with luck manipulation. The movement looks a little goofy in spots, that's just subpixel manipulation since you have to wait for the boulder guys to fall down anyway. One rock I had to wait a moment for so I could kill it without bonking, and I had to use a boomerang as I left the cave to avoid another rock.

	"As for the Ride Armor, it takes 43 frames to enter, but dashes 4 pixels per frame, compared to X's ~3.5px/f. This means that in about 4-5 seconds of dashing, the Ride Armor breaks even. Over a large enough section (like the long flat stretch in this stage), the Ride Armor proves to be a good bit faster if you can mitigate the lag and deal with the enemies properly. Disappointingly, punching the opposing Ride Armors is a terrible idea due to excessive lag. Instead, it's better to take damage from a nearby enemy, then jump past them, causing them to attempt a jumping punch toward you, getting them off screen and despawned as soon as possible.

Minor improvements in this stage for the most part. Slightly different phantom grab setup, different climb pre-Penguin fight.

	"Eagle was rough to manipulate, I needed a handful of dust sprites back at the penguin refight, which is fine, but the timing of killing an enemy was guaranteed to coincide with a drop if i used the right number of dust sprites, and there's no way to avoid killing said enemy. All I could do was make less dust, then delay entering the fight for a frame to get the right pattern. The ideal (I believe) pattern for the Eagle refight is if he uses two short wing flap attacks, one tornado, then goes upward to dive. His wing flapping attack can last 2, 4, or 6 seconds (maybe more, actually, I'm not sure what the cutoff is, but I haven't seen longer I think), then he pauses for 40 frames before deciding his next attack. His tornado attack lasts 180 frames. That combination of attacks enables you to get the final hit while he's off screen just beginning a dive with minimal time from when his invincibility expires.
