	"This is an unlicensed demake of Donkey Kong Country (1994) ported to the NES by Hummer Team called "Donkey Kong Country 4". The game is mainly based off of the base game, with visuals being hand drawn to lower quality and music reproduced by ear. Amusingly, it bears a copyright symbol in the opening credits, irony notwithstanding.

	"Some emulators set the dipswitches of this game to "either", on FCEUX 2.2.3 it defaults to DKC4, so make sure that you set the dip switch correctly if using a different ROM or emulator. Otherwise the file will instantly desync.

	"Running is the fastest method of movement, and all optimization is to ensure that the kongs are running most of the time. Jumps are cut to the shortest amount they can be without missing, jumping on enemies is put to a minimum (except where it aids platforming) and barrels are thrown away immediately.

	"Slopes misbehave in the game, sending the kong a pixel forward or back when jumping, and can easily be a source of wasted frames. Hopefully in this submission that is reduced to nil.

	"Diddy appears to have faster base speed on land and Donkey in water. Different Kong water speeds is used to optimize pathing in water levels. This is used to optimize the first water level, however in the second water level a clip out of bounds combined with a zip technique is used which nullifies this speed discrepancy.

	"There is little lag in the game, but where it does exist, such snakes in industry levels, it has been attempted to be minimized by killing snakes as fast as possible and picking up bananas to reduce the sprite count. For underground levels, the lag is particularly unavoidable due to the spike wheels.

	"Resubmitted with revised second water level inputs provided by Samsara, increasing the efficacy of the clipping and zipping. I am very grateful for this fix, saving 1000 frames (give or take due to resyncing). Personally I am very happy with the movie as it stands now.
