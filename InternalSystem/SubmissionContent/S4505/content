	"Super Aladdin is a pirated port of the Genesis version of Aladdin to the NES. It's fairly decent, but very short due to the fact that only half the stages were ported over. It's also rather glitchy.

	"Due to the nature of Aladdin's falling animation, it can be used in small spaces to clip downwards. This is used to skip some platforming in the Desert.

	"Jumping constantly at certain walls lets Aladdin climb the wall. This is used in the Captain fight to easily murder him with apples.

	"-When jumping at the ropes in the Agrabah Rooftops, slashing while jumping sometimes lets you grab them earlier.

[p 
	"-Using the sword lets you skip any poles, ziplines, and ropes while the animation is playing.
	$LF

[p 
	"-Using the sword before taking damage lets you skip damage while the animation is playing. (e.g. constant autofire makes you practically invincible to obstacles.)

	"You need to collect the two scarab halves before you're allowed to leave. Pretty easy. A clip was used to get the second half easily.

	"Unfortunately you need to grab the rope flutes in order to beat the stage, so not too much glitching getting to the bosses. The last fight with the Captain is easily broken by walljumping to behind him and throwing apples, instead of the intended way of jumping and slashing.

[h4 
	" Why do you jump so much? I don't like it!
	$LF

[p 
	"I feel like it. It's not any slower.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Ew, your input file has autofire. You suck.
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"I'm not going to optimize every single jump I make while walking. Besides, I did test just in case autofiring is any slower while doing certain actions. Most of the time, it isn't.

	": Thus bootleg's run could potentially be obsoleted by a run of some other NES Aladdin bootleg, if the latter is liked more. How the port was made ends up looking a bit boring, but it has some variety of the original preserved, so I don't think it's a Vault case. Accepting to Moons.
