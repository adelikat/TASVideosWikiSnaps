	"All of my gameplay in this game is for both speed and maximum score. No events skipped nor completed anything less than 1 frame off of impossible. I always thought speedruns of Track N' Field style games were dumb, because basically all the events get failed or half-assed. This is how it should be done for these types of games IMO. Actually there's a great thread of like 100 people complaining about that on a Track & Field run:

	"All maximum positions were found by me and only me. Not bragging, saying it was a pain in the ass because I not only wanted to do it, I wanted to make sure it was done right. There's two Twin Galaxies entries for pole vault both way lower than what I achieved, but that seems right for human capabilities. This is a tough game. It should be noted that Archery and Skeet are both physically impossible to beat as they achieve a perfect set of arrows and hit all 20 clay pigeons respectively. So while I'm certain 100% of this is the best it can be, those two are physically impossible to beat and it's obvious. Triple Jump hits an invisible wall and then some, so that one is pretty set in stone. The other ones are set in stone too but never say never.

	"This is an interesting one. I found a game breaking bug in which it doesn't like the TAS for some reason, so on any height except the first one you play, you have to fail attempt 1 every time and do it on attempt 2 otherwise you can't jump. I'm guessing some flag in the first attempt is getting corrupted by the pure speed. Luckily, I realized you can skip doing it over and over again and just boost your way to the game-breaking height (or rather, the height before). This not only is optimal but also bypasses the bug. I actually spent 2 hours doing all of the heights before realizing this OP skip feature, how useless it is for normal gameplay, and how great it is for TASing! You can just skip to whatever height you want, which is weird because if you're going to skip the easy ones why on earth would you want to do the hard ones? Anyways...

There is an extreme shaking from the out of shape player Gary, likely because he's having heat stroke and liver failure from all the stuff he just did, so your character shakes violently as he struggles to pull back to bow, and you're also aiming in a hurricane set of winds, so there's really no way to pull this off RTA for even a single round. Oh, and there's 3 rounds of this.
