	"This is an any% TAS of the SNES action-adventure game Illusion of Gaia, completed in 16:48 with TAS timing and 16:27 with RTA timing. It is about an hour faster than the current any% RTA WR by solarcell007, and about 3 minutes faster than my old WIP. By coincidence, this also happens to be a run where no damage is being taken.

Turns out I remembered wrong and the game was mostly just the title screen, a cutscene, and a boss fight with a BGM that absolutely slaps.

I've relabeled the published run "100%" to fit that as well.
