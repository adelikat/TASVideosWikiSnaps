		" The inside of the house has also remained unchanged since the very first TAS of this game. One of the first improvements I found when starting to play this game again was that you can jump over the lights and damage-boost through them. This resulted in a save of half a cloud platform cycle, or a time save of 107 frames. Worth mentioning is that 'Thing You Know' left a comment for the youtube encode of the current submission saying you can jump over the lights. I saw this after discovering it on my own, but still thought it was interesting.

			"Note for future reference: if you move a bit left during the drop at frame 18331, you can start running to the right before the next jump and thus clear the gap with a smaller jump than jumping from a standstill. A smaller jump means less air-time and more time for screen-scrolling. I was able to be 10 frames ahead at one point, but then literally everything was unfavorable (screen transitions, sub-pixels and enemy placements) from there and I finished one frame behind the submitted movie. With better game knowledge, it's however possible that this could be converted to an actual time save.
