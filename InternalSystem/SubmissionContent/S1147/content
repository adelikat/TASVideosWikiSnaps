	"This is a gem of a game for TASers.  It is relatively unknown but is action packed, and has loads of strategic and route planning possibilities.  It is much like megaman in that you take the levels in any order and get weapon power ups from the boss.  Two of the weapon power ups are a cloud for flying and a throwing spear which you use to create ledges.  Much like rush power-ups in megaman, these add to the route possibilities; allowing creative shortcuts.  The game's best moments are the vertical zones in which the character must 1) fall and avoid ledges as much as possible, or 2) ascend up ledges as quick as possible.  These areas are very interesting to watch and plan.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In addition, enemies can be manipulated to drop important power-ups including a magic potion (functions the same as energy tanks in metroid), a flint spear head that increases your attack power, and a head dress that increases your defense.

	"This is a very difficult & time consuming game to TAS though, ESPECIALLY the vertical sections.  This is my second run through of the game.

	"A number of optimizations led to the 30 sec improvement.
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" Route change.  I got the cloud and spear first in order to maximize the shortcut possibilities of these items.  Almost all levels benefit from the spear especially.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Flint spear head.  The bosses can all be beaten in 5 hits with the spear head upgrade.  The optimal weapon for each only kills them in 6.  Since the bosses have a whopping 75 frames of invulnerability time, this is quite an item!  I manage to manipulate it from enemy kills (which cost a little time, but only 10-20 frames).  The first boss you meet would take 9 hits without the spear.  That is a 300 frame difference!
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Using the throwing spear to get enemy drops without losing time.  Certain (very few) enemies can be killed in one hit from the spear.  When I encounter these enemies, I shoot the spear from a distance and manipulate the drop that I want.  That way I don't lose time getting them.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Using the throwing spear to ascend vertical stages quicker.  By "extending" ledges with the spear, I am able to minimize horizontal movement in these areas, thereby speeding up vertical movement.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Having all 3 magic potions for the final boss.  The dragon weapon is the best weapon for the boss but uses up 1 heart  of your life.  It use it the most, I make sure to have maximum energy.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Having as much energy as possible at the end of each level.  You energy is filled up at the end of each level which costs time.  So, while taking damage often saves time, it has to be balance with the cost at the end of each level.  Also, I can manipulate hearts from enemies (and hidden ones).

		" Jumping of ladder instead of walking off.  This is a minor improvement of about 4 frames.  But it adds up over the course of the run.
