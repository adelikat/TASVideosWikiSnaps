	"Collective name of the many techniques you can do with boxes. Boxes are often great to skip puzzles with, by getting an extra platform to reach higher places, hit buttons, block wind turbines and so on. Here are some of the ways of bringing boxes to new places:
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"1. By double-jumping close to the ground you can re-grab the block in midair to bring it higher up.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"2. You can bring a box to a different screen, where you aren't normally supposed to, by grabbing it at the edge of the screen. This is only possible in rooms that have not been flagged to prevent objects being carried over as in the case of some bomb and Likuri rooms.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"3. It's possible to bring a box up a ladder/vine, by throwing the box into a wall and re-grabbing it with each jump.
	$LF
]div
[h3 id=RJumping 
	" R-Jumping
	$LF
]h3
[div class=p 
	"There are many situations where you want to double-jump, then fall back down quickly. If you press A on frame 1, you have to wait until frame 3 to repress it, while Klonoa will be moving higher up "then wanted" on frame 2. By pressing the R button with the first jump, you'll pause the game while you are able to look around on the screen. Release R again and you can avoid moving upwards and extra frame. There are also situations where this is needed in order to bring a box through tight places, before the box will automatically get pushed back to its original position.
	$LF
]div
[h3 id=CeilingJumps 
	" Ceiling jumps
	$LF
]h3
[div class=p 
	"Usually when jumping into a ceiling, you’ll clip it slightly and then be pushed down a few pixels again. If you just barely make it into the ceiling, you’ll avoid the push and stay clipped into it. At the right pixel, you are then able to perform a jump to get further distance forwards. There are sadly not many uses of this technique.
	$LF
]div
[h3 id=SpeedCycleManipulation 
	" Speed cycle manipulation
	$LF
]h3
[div class=p 
	"Klonoa's normal movement cycle is 1-2-1-2 pixels/frame. There are several situations where you can release forwards for a frame to alter this movement cycle. This is useful when you are for example pushing against a wall or during a double jump, to make sure you are moving 2 pixels instead of 1 on the first possible frame.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Holding forwards, even when pushing against a wall, Klonoa builds up a "speed value", adding 82 to it for every frame until it caps at 6144. If forwards is released, Klonoa moves 1 pixel at a "cost" of 336 each frame until you reach about 3200. If this is done when grabbing a red ball, jumping into a wind turbine and while fluttering, Klonoa moves an additional pixel for each frame you release forwards.
	$LF

[div class=p

This saves a different amount depending on which level it is done on, due to the next levels loading in, as well as for the boss fights.

Here we actually changed up the strategy to not bring the box with us into the next room, it was quicker to just use the single box in there to get up the star instead. Then, like the published run, the box is taken back to get through the wind to the door.

If you instead have the bomb go off at the peak of your jump, it will also reach the block. This saves time because the bomb timer is paused while the plant is growing. After that, we still have to grow the plant though…

If you execute a doublejump while the bomb is moving towards you, it will not yet have time to fall down onto the ground, this makes it possible to regrab it higher up and thus get a higher jump, being able to reach the platform with the bomb. Make it through the next room and jump up onto the higher platform as before.

If you put it in the same frame it will explode, the plant will grow and the bomb will pop up with a reset timer. Though because this isn’t the bomb’s origin room, it’s not supposed to respawn in here, so it gets a glitched timer of 255 ticks. Now that we have two bombs in here, we can set up the other plant with the second bomb, put the first bomb onto the button and get the star.
