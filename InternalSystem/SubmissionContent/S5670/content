	(__wikiLink|href=/5669S|implicitdisplaytext=5669S)
	".This time,our protagonist is Guy,descended from ninja,he possesses incredible agility.This run is 12933 frames(215.55 seconds) faster than Marx's run 
	(__wikiLink|href=/3853S|implicitdisplaytext=3853S)
	".It looks that Guy can fight the enemy more easily than Haggar,his advantage is that he can combat two man at the same time.Moreover,Guy has many useful combat skills,(jump,down+B)(jump,back,up,B)(B,B+forward),which can manipulates luck easily.

	": I liked this run more than "Haggar". It is not just marginally shorter due to some shortcut, it does feel faster and more aggressive. Still, it's basically just 2 moves all along, so I don't see how it can break the Vault barrier the published run couldn't break.

	"That's an important part btw, because the existing run has been around for a reliable while and it only has 5.3 average entertainment rating. It means 22 people don't find it enjoyable, there's almost no rates above 6, and quite some below 6, which is a non-official Vault borderline in ratings.

	"I deliberately watched the published run first, and while I have an idea of what this game is, I don't know it very well. The run is a nice one, not ground breaking, but quite ok. I gave it 6, since it still wasn't "really good" for me. Then I watched the new Haggar submission, and it was basically the same as the existing run, with just faster elevator room. While it was quite a bit shorter, its gameplay remained the same to a person who's not an expert in this game. So I would also give it a 6, and voted Meh.

[div class=p 
	"Then I watched this run, and as I said, I liked it better and gave it a Yes. However, due to being the same 2 moves all the way through and looking overall similar to the Haggar run due to the nature of this game, I can presume that it will get the same average rating as the existing run, with some marginal positive difference maybe.

	"What I'm trying to say is, all these 3 runs are still Vault content, despite of my and some others personal opinions. At least 20 raters just disagree with having the existing run in Moons. Probably my extrapolation is a bit premature for this particular movie (which can be moved to Moons later), but it still applies quite well to the new Haggar run: we can't moon that one. And in Vault, we can only have a single any% branch. Which now is Guy.
