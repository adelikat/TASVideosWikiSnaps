	"Prehistorik Man (not to be confused with the game of the same name on the SNES, which is the sequel) was a platform game for the Game Boy, made by Titus Interactive. This game is actually a port of Prehistorik 2, which was made for MS-DOS and Amstrad CPC. Even with the major cuts out from the original PC game, Prehistorik Man seems to still be a rather faithful port, and pulled off some very interesting technical feats for the Game Boy.

	"This level is rather simple, not too much to comment on. There is quite a bit of lag reduction work going on, which is mostly stay away from enemies. There is also a nice warp that sends me a bit further in the level. Note that to progress past the big traffic (?) sign, I must collect a key item in the level. For this level, it is a giant lighter.
