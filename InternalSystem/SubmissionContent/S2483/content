	"This movie does use a dirty sram to unlock a mini game in Resident Evil 3, The Mercenaries : Operation Mad Jackal.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"The memory card can be filled up simply by replaying 
	(__wikiLink|1289M|this movie)
	" and saving after credits.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"This mini-game take place in the raccoon center exactly like in the main game, you start from the trolley and go back to hangar (game start).
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"A voice will explain to you that they putted a bomb inside your body (escape from LA?Oho) and that in order to dispose of it you have to reach your target before the timer run out.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"On the way 6 "hostages" can be free up, giving time bonus as well ammos, killing monsters also give time bonus.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"3 characters are at disposal, all from the Umbrella mercenary force, each carrying different arsenal.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"Michael have the most heavy gears, rocket/shooty/magnum, Nikolai have a knife/handgun, finaly Carlos have a rifle and custom hand gun (only weapon in the game having critical hits).
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"The reason i took Carlos is simply because of the custom handgun, i try to (ab)use as much as possible the critical hit feature unique to this gun, speed wise the riffle is like shooty, decrease for about 5% your movement speed while holding it.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"By constantly using head shoots on zombies, the handgun is obviously way faster to clear everything than the riffle, and the ammo supply is no trouble compared to riffle since only 1 bullet is enought to kill any monsters.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"The reason im killing everything is simply to try making something entertaining, this mini-game can be cleared in less than 5 min, running just for the purpose of speed is somewhat limited here, instead of making a movie clearing with all 3 characters the minigame within 15 min (and bad score), i choosed rather to go for massive kill in a bigger movie with just 1 character
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"I attempted first to mix in between by simply rescuing all hostages and going as fast as possible, while doing that i noticed that killing everything wouldnt take twice the time than just running by the various location to save peoples, also need to note here that pure speed wont give the highest grade (i had B, took damage to save time...)
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"A few passage will probably look somewhat sloopy, mainly with birds/snake/floor-zombies, i used the riffle there, because it was too tedious to use the handgun and not having good results with it, snake seem to always respawn so i just killed them once, for the whole rest im just using the gun, some demo licker at the power plant might look sloopy, i kept that outcome because of the crazy dodging, looked cool to me.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"Note that at the end, my timer show as much time left than it took to run (14:11), i tought to mention it, its pretty neat i think :p
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"Obviously using Michael would be faster due to better arsenal, i realy did wanted to avoid using the rockets because i felt it was no fun, just hit once and the nemesis is dead, overall carlos seemed the most balanced and most interresting to tas due to luck manipulation on head shoots.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"Maybe i should have first do a run aiming for fastest time, yet, after my initial attempt i felt a "kill everything" was in order, so i hope youll all enjoy this butchery
