	"Bald Bull's Punch-Out!! is a hack of Mike Tyson's Punch-Out, which brings back the Gold Punch-Out!! and replaces every opponent (except the last) with Bald Bull. While you may think this would make it repetitive, each fight is still different in one way or another.

	"This TAS was originally finished years ago, after McHazard's 17:37 improvement to MTPO. I think I was originally going to submit it for April Fools 2021, but college and procrastination made that not happen. I wasn't even sure if this hack would be publishable, because at that time, quite a few fights were repetitive. The same thing happened in 2022 and 2023, and I think I forgot about it in 2024.

	" I didn't find out about it until March 22, but I re-TASed it and got a 33.61. Yellowdice asked if they could see the TAS to look into improvements, so I said yes. The improvements they found are nothing short of amazing. Here are the times:
