	"I found that it's not necessary to either take or examine SNAPSHOT in order to beat the game. Because I don't pick this item up, I don't have to discard it in the sewers later on. All this saved ~10 seconds.
	$LF

[p 
	"It's not necessary to examine LETTER1, which saved about 3 seconds. LETTER1 is evidence against Sternwood and Vickers, just as MEMO and DIARY, and because I don't examine those two items, I figured that I might not need to examine LETTER1 either, which was the case. :)

[p 
	"Then there were the usual frame improvements here and there. I saved a few frames by having less items in my inventory (it takes shorter time to load), and there were a few optimized cursor movements.

[p 
	"All in all, most of this run looks identical to the published run, but Deja Vu fans will probably spot the differences. :)
