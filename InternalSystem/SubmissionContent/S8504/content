	"Routing in this game is pretty easy as you need to beat the dungeons in the intended order as each new dungeon requires an item from the previous one. The only routing choice is whether or not to go to the desert cave and collect a red key and attack powerup. Ultimately it saves around 30 seconds to not do so, and so the route is pretty much fixed from there. There are however numerous tricks and glitches used in this TAS:

	"Corner boosting: pressing up against a wall as you go around a corner gives a small but noticable boost, saving a couple frames each time. 
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Damage boosting: each hit saves around 20 frames, and you eventually need to deplete your health anyway to death warp.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Death warp: You can die immediately after getting the key in dungeons 3 and 4, saving many seconds. Also the game doesn't update your last position when entering the screen of the fourth dungeon for some reason, so you get set back even closer to where you want to move to.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Multiple hits: If you time a sword slash and a dynamite explosion at the right time (and in the right position) you can register many hits at a time. Bosses fall very quickly with this trick, including the last boss with 200 HP dies in only a single combo.

	"Enemy despawn: Some enemies can randomly not spawn. This is especially helpful in the Bat boss refight, where the bat has much increased HP, but I manipulate him to simply not spawn.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Also RNG manipulation is required throughout the run. Initially you must collect 100 gold to buy the dynamite. After that you need to farm up arrows and dynamite at a pretty constant rate.
