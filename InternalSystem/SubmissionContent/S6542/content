	"Since you are picking branches that are not eligible for Vault, they must receive good feedback and have compelling differences from already existing branches. Unfortunately, the branch you have chosen is not receiving good feedback, and I will explain why. If you look at some of the more unusual goal choices that we have accepted for SMB1, including 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=all items|href=/3648M)
	" and 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=maximum coins|href=/2977M)
	", you'll see that the gameplay is very clearly changed in almost every single level of the game compared to a typical speedrun. Those gameplay changes compared to the published warps or warpless TASes provide major entertainment merits for having those branches published. Not only is it very different, but a lot of people found it entertaining!
