	"For console players, this game is difficult to say the least. A lot of the jumps and the boss fights are unforgiving. Some boss patterns are downright undodgeable and some jumps require frame precision.

	"There are some frame and pixel squeezing tricks I found while I was already in stage 3 and beyond. Luckily, the game happens to be sync-friendly (except for the Stage 3 boss) so I didn't lose much of my progress. I'm glad how my TAS turned out and I hope you like it.

		"I didn't get the pencil because the detour takes too long (I tested it). At the staircase, I jumped straight up briefly in order for the bat to move left more so I could bypass it. I also needed to wait at the skater guys briefly. The boss pattern looks to be consistent and the best strat I came up with was to make the dude move right repeatedly. He won't attack until the little bat thingies go offscreen so I optimized for that.

		"The boss is luck-based - depending on timing, he might take some extra turns zapping around but by adding some delay frames before each hit, I could manipulate him to get on the ground as fast as possible each time. After each hit, he would move towards you before starting to zap around, but since he will move offscreen to the right upon death, it was important to make sure he would end up close to the right side of the screen after the fight. Each possibility was tested and the best way I came up with was to make him attack you leftwards, leftwards, leftwards, rightwards. (There was another attack pattern that was equally fast but I forgot it.)
