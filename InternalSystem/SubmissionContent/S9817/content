	"Door transitions could be improved even more. In general, we want to reduce the size of Trace's sprite along the axis of the door as much as possible. Because when entering the door, the animation lasts until the whole sprite is inside the door. Also for the exit, Trace is placed so the sprite is entirely inside the door, and we take back control when the whole sprite is a fixed number of pixels away from the door.

	"So, for horizontal transitions, we want the sprite that has the smallest width size. The best one is when looking up or down in the air, so we jump while looking up just before entering the door, and press forward the next frame, so that the previous sprite is kept when entering the door. This is an illustration compared to just walking, with how long the animations of going inside and outside a door take:

	"One specific jump was made possible by some framerate manipulation during the jump. By setting the framerate to 30 during the rise of the jump, Trace will bonk on the ceiling later. Then, using a high framerate (300) on the fall of the jump, it will just barely help clearing the gap. This is not a bug, but is due to the fact that the engine is tied to framerate, and to how and in which order the game updates Trace's position and velocity on each frame.

	"This is fastest movement possible with the grapple. When we are very close to a ceiling and we grapple up, Trace will snap down a bit because the grapple has a minimum length. However, Trace's position is not fully updated yet, so if we press right or left on the next frame, Trace will swing considerably on the opposite direction to try to match its vertical position. We can then cancel and grapple up again, to move horizontally very fast.
