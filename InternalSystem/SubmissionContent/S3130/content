	"I was going to draw a detailed picture in every math problems. However, my previous Brain Age TAS got a lot of criticisms that it is slow-paced. After all, I gave up the idea of drawing a lot of detailed pictures and decided to make a quick-paced run that aims for youngest age on Brain Age Check and maximum score on Piano Player.
