	"Glitching improvements:
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		"Green Hill 2 - The strategy of getting inside the wall after bouncing off the bee was performed before by nfq. Zipping from the wall to the goal was discovered later by Upthorn.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		"Marble 1 (*) - There is a glitch in each entrance to the castle in marble zone. On the first act AKA made it useful and the level could be completed in 15 seconds. It requires a bit of sub pixel positioning to get off screen jump to work. This glitch enables traveling from almost the beginning to the end of the act.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		"Marble 2 (*) - There is a hidden way to cross a wall that involves many seconds. To perform the glitch hit the monitor making it fall down, then get under it and Sonic will be pushed inside the wall. It seems a bit complicated but it can be done in real time easily with some practice.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		"Marble 3 (*) - The main marble zone glitch can be also performed in this act. This time Carretero showed how to use it to reduce the time significantly.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		"Laberynt 2 (*) - Can't imagine how nobody discovered the glitch used here before. It is a very easy glitch that can also be used in Laberynt 3 (not useful there).
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		"Starlight 3 - Upthorn made better optimization of slope roll and slope jumping that allows for some sick speeds here.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		"Scrap Brain 1 - The basics of this glitch involve ducking on the platform to enter the wall. Once inside, pressing left will blast sonic to the right at a ridiculous velocity the screen can't hope to match. Because Sonic is going so fast, he can pass through certain walls / obstacles. By the time the screen finds Sonic, he has already ran through an area that normally would require a lot of pausing, due to fire and crushers.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		"Scrap Brain 2 - ChaosControl showed an ingenious glitch that helped to beat this level.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		"Scrap Brain 3 (*) - In this act there is a quick way to go directly to the end; the glitch could not be in a better place. Once lodged into the wall, hold left and sonic becomes absorbed like in quicksand.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"(*) All marked improvements are the result of some never-seen-before glitches. They were discovered by Carretero playing Sonic the Hedgehog backwards. The hack
