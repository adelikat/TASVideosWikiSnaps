	"Anyways, this is a short and simple game that I decided to TAS for the "goo dending" [sic]. There isn't a whole lot to talk about since it's straightforward but it's a nice break from more complex projects and ideas. I made this TAS months ago but felt this day was probably the best time to submit it.

	"Jump height and float time is greatly increased upon bouncing off a peasant. The use of that height is limited since some peasants are close enough that bouncing too high means waiting to land on the next peasant. Some jumps were also carefully done to avoid landing on a knight and instead land right next to them such that Trogdor runs into a peasant and thus doesn't bounce.

	": As much as I probably should be turning to dust and scattering into the wind by the fact that I've been a Homestar Runner fan for roughly as long as Trogdor has been in existence, I've also been on this niche video game website called TASvideos for 16 years and I constantly feel like I'm getting Thanos snapped every time I remember that, which is all the time. People all the time be asking me "Samsara, why come you feel old with TASvideos but not H*R?" I dunno! I guess H*R is just absolutely timeless. Like me, it is unstuck in time, constantly drifting, eternal. It also takes a very long time to get around to updating things! Unlike me, though, it is actually funny. Most of the funny things I say are just inspired by almost 20 years of watching dumb animal characters do word speaking at each other.
