	" (たけし の 挑戦状, Takeshi's Challenge) which is a Famicom exclusive and cult classic developed by Taito Corporation and released December 10, 1986. The ultimate goal of the game is to acquire a treasure by traversing a group of unorthodox levels and gameplay styles until your goal is accomplished. This is an alternative goal to the already quite uncovential glitched run

	"As stated in FractalFusion's published run this is a quite unconventional game created with the box cover even warning that it should not be approached with traditional gaming skills.

	"There are two memory addresses in the game for recording the number of times that a punch is thrown 0060 which measures on a count from 0 to 255 and 0061 which again measures from 0 to 255. 0061 only iterates after the 0060 value has looped through meaning that to get to a value of "1" in 0061 requires you to have thrown 256 punches, to get to "2" you need 512 punches and so on. The animation for each punch takes 17 frames but in actuallity the punch value can be iterated every 4 frames.

	"It turns out that to go with the games quirky attitude of this game if you get the 0061 value to 120 or an equivalent of 30,720 punches while still on the title screen you will be warped to the final level eliminating the vast majority of the game.  After that you simply have to finish the last short platforming level and you win.
