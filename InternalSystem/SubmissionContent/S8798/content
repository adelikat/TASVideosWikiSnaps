		" I thought up a very specific method for the boss fights. My initial plan was to just back off to the rightmost place where the frog can't attack us, which took 129 frames. But then, about halfway through production, I had a different idea - weaving left and right as early as possible while shooting every possible frame. This turned out to be 2 frames faster and tpok 127 frames.
