	"This game wouldn't run on my XP Virtual Machine, so I ran it on Windows 7 (with Aero turned off). This greatly decreased savestate stability to the point where loading a second savestate during a session would usually crash Hourglass. The rerecord count is therefore roughly the number of times I closed the game window and reopened it to test a different strategy. Glad we have that turbo feature!
