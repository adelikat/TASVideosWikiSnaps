	"The 3 fights against the ninja's are somewhat frustrating since it's hard to keep them from dissapearing. I knocked them over a couple times, just since it's faster than waiting for them to re-appear. I took a hit in one of them since the orb knocks me closer to where I need to line up the next attack.

	"The Goliath fights may be improvable, but not by too much (unless someone finds a way to land two hits before needing to line him up again)
