I initially had no intentions of improving the previous run back when we finished it. I said as a "joke" that I would not make another run "unless Flippers skip is found". Then about 7 months after the TAS was published, that very thing was found. Eventually, more and more new tricks and glitches were discovered and I knew that a new TAS had to be made.

	"While working on the new run, even more things were found as well. Which meant that I fairly often had to redo larger parts of the run in order to include the new timesavers. This, in combination with huge struggles with RNG, made it quite tedious to TAS and I lost all motivation and enjoyment from it for many months at a time, practically giving up on it.

As I respawned, if you don't go into the inventory menu, the camera will pan back to Link and the guard will start moving before you can, blocking the path.

This can be good as I can delay a few frames entering the next screen, where changing RNG in other manners (slashing/rolling) usually costs more time. Another method, which was also used in the old TAS, is to waste bombs that can kill enemies and thus changing RNG. I can do that without wasting time between rolls.

It involves essentially being pushed into out of bounds using a Rock Beetle. First step is to lure it into position. Once awoken, it moves in one direction for a set time, stops, waits a while and then becomes a solid rock again. During this period, it's possible to slash it with the sword in order to move it around. Barely enough time to get it into position in one go.

Second step is to push against the Beetle, increasing Link's Push Value up to 6. This address is used both when Link starts pushing against push-able objects but also when about to jump down a ledge. I then want Link to move into the wall on the right. In order to keep the Push Value while moving, I slash the sword. You can just hold it directly and walk to the right, though this charges up the spin attack and will make a spin once landing on the ground. I avoid the spin by slashing while waiting for the beetle to settle into position and then move right. Once the beetle rests, the rock will become a solid object, pushing Link into the wall to the right. Normally, this would push Link back out again, though because the Push Value is charged up to 6, and I'm walking into a ledge jump section, Link jumps down the cliff before being pushed into bounds again. Link gets out of bounds and can then navigate far south into the next area of the game and read the sign which starts the Pegasus Boots quest.

Each time a boulder hits, Octo will pause his actions for 24 frames. Waiting to hit until all three boulders are out thus saves time.
