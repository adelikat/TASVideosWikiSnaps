]h3
[div class=p 
	"There are six levels: Country, Lakeside, Snowy Mountain, Forest, Plateau and Desert.
	$LF
	"Each level has 3-6 screens, one of which is a boss fight.
	$LF
	"The boss is always Bugs Bunny who tries to use various tools and weapons in order to stop Daffy from getting the treasure chest.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Daffy has only one weapon. It is a small dynamite, which has a two-second timer.
	$LF
	"This weapon bounces around and interacts with almost everything in the game, sometimes in surprising ways.
	$LF
	"For example, there is a little monkey, who starts running towards Daffy, if the dynamite lands on top of it. There is also a foxman with a shield that deflects the dynamite.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The animations are very well done. When Daffy gets hit by something, the damage tosses him around in various ways, potentially causing a long damage chain.
	$LF
	"The damage chain effect is funny and the developers knew it, so they even put some statistics after the credits, showing the maximum damage combo you took during the playthrough.
	$LF
	"Randomly generated enemy placement enhances the effect, putting Daffy at risk of going through many kinds of damage chains, in an old-school cartoony fashion.
	$LF
	"Unfortunately, the recovery animations are long, so it never saves time to take damage, even when it would temporarily toss Daffy forward at high speed.

	"Fowl Play has a surprising feature: Every 8th jump is higher than a normal jump.
	$LF
	"The most notable high-jump is seen in the final level, where Daffy calmly jumps over the famous "rolling ball trap" that Indiana Jones escaped in panic.
	$LF
	"The jump counter resets after a short time, so to get the 8th high-jump, the 7 preliminary jumps need to be done quickly enough.

	" Panic-running
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"When walking over a deadly pit, Daffy can stand on air for a short time, before realizing that he is going to fall.
	$LF
	"This effect is part of the funnily designed game physics and it is also often seen in cartoons.
	$LF
	"If Daffy stands on air, there is a short window of opporunity to escape the pit by pressing to the opposite walking direction. If done correctly, Daffy will panic and run away from the edge of the pit as fast as he can.
	$LF
	"Everything seems normal and cartoony until you realize that the running can be prolonged as long as Daffy won't bump into a wall or an enemy.
	$LF
	"Normal walking speed is 16 (which means 1 pixel per frame), but the panic run is 38, so it saved a lot of time to manipulate enemies out of the way, to be able to panic-run through levels.
	$LF
	"Even a speed of 40 is possible by peforming a jump just before starting the panic run, but then no subsequent jump can be made without stopping.
	$LF
	"So, usually it is better to have 38 speed plus the opportunity to make jumps.
	$LF
	"Jumping and then releasing directional buttons will keep the current speed, but unfortunately the cartoon physics are realistic enough to reduce 2 speed units each time Daffy touches ground, so after a few jumps, the speed will decrease significantly.
	$LF
	"All in all, the panic-run trick is very effective, but also very limited. Mostly, when the running has started, nothing can be done, except continue running or stop running.
	$LF
	"Normally I would regard this as abusing a programming error, but in the context of the game, it doesn't feel any different than escaping pits normally.
	$LF
	"The panic is just prolonged by precise playing and planning. Setting up a prolonged panic-run can be done even in real-time, but the chance of getting past the whole screen without bumping into something is low.

	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"The game has random enemy placement for some of the enemies. This makes the game surprising and gives it lots of replay value.
	$LF
	"(Actually, this is one of the very few games that I enjoyed playing even without tools, because so many funny things can happen and you never know what enemies you encounter next.)
	$LF
	"So, each time a screen is loaded, a few enemy types are spawned at semi-random positions.
	$LF
	"Firstly, it is important to manipulate all enemies out of the way, so that the panic run trick is not interrupted.
	$LF
	"Secondly, small speed boosts can be gained by landing on enemies that travel the same direction as Daffy (jumping at enemies from below also works).
	$LF
	"A truly optimal run would manipulate perfect enemy types in each screen for maximal boosts.
	$LF
	"This run here gets pretty good boosts, mainly from birds.
	$LF
	"Also, a very noticeable boost from en anemy arrow is used in the final level.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"To change enemy randomness, delay frames can be used in the bonus game, overworld or before entering the next screen and. Also, using the dynamite at different times affects the RNG, so the possibilities for manipulation are endless and very few frames were wasted here to achieve good enemy randomness. Not all enemies are manipulatable, though. Some of them appear in the same place every time. Actually, the whole first level is always the same.

	$LF
	"This is again very nice detail in game physics and animation.
	$LF
	"However, if Daffy pushes a wall just before hitting the ground, the pushing animation is used instead of the fall recovery. The pushing can be stopped at any time, so it saves time to push a wall instead of landing directly on ground. This is used twice in the final stage. (The second time probably looks like a mistake, if the viewer is not aware of the game mechanics.)

This means that Daffy must time seven setup jumps perfectly before the eighth high-jump. Anyway, nothing too spectacular.
