	"Big problem. Taking the lower path to do the wall clip goes through 3 unavoidable coins. Taking the upper path goes through 3 unavoidable goombas. What do you do? Be patient. And then just barely jump over them and do the slow 2 backward bump method for the wrong warp. You also just barely hit the vine block, was very difficult.

	"I think you could probably save time in 1-1 by doing a wall clip into the floor to avoid the coins in the underground section. In 1-2, if someone could find a way to avoid the goombas without slowing down, and if the faster wall clip saves the frame rule then that could be used to improve the time. If a new type of shortcut is found to skip the waiting for the goombas to move out of the way, it could be a SIGNIFICANT improvement. IF you cou.d make it past the koopa without slowing down, then you would save at least 3 frames (possibly not the frame rule. If the wall jump was performed better (backward jump?), then you would accelerate faster and save at least 1 frame. If the cheep cheep disn't exist, then the fast decelerate/accelerate would be performed normally (it can pro ably be done better even with the cheep cheep).
