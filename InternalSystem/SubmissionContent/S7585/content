This TAS aims to beat the game without the use of the screen wrapping and out of bounds glitches as fast as possible. Despite having more content, the NES version is noticeably faster than the original PC release by virtue of faster loading and smaller rooms.

For the most part this is the preferred method of getting off the top of ladders. Dismounting from the top of ladders can take 1 or 2 down input frames, depending on how long jumping has been done before doing the input. I didn't catch this until the end of the run,
