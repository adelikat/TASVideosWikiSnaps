	"Circus Charlie is a very simple game, very easy with 5 levels (depending on which difficulty you want). You must defeat a level of advancement, avoiding obstacles and objects in the road, and finally a jump on the pedestal to the next level. You also get points by jumping through rings of fire, jumping over circus balls, etc.
