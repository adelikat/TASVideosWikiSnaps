	"Each level is divided by two sections, one in which you simply have to survive for 60 seconds, avoiding taking damage and eating to regain health that you lose over time, and the other section, in which you fight against a boss, all bosses are about the same, only difference being the amount of health they have and the skulls that appear.

	"In the survive sections, all that can be done to optimize is prevent lag, which is done just by manipulating RNG so only spikes appear, not skulls, since those create some lag no matter what in those levels, and by timing the attacks.

	"In the boss levels, it's faster to let the boss throw a second projectile, so the boss its hit just as the projectile appears, and the second hit is also done as soon as possible, since every hit refreshes the projectile cycle.
