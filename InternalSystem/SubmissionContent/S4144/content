	[a href=http://harddrop.com/wiki/Random_Generator rel=noopener external nofollow

	" seed for Push Mode is always the same, provided it is the first game played on startup, even if a variable number of frames have passed until the game starts.  Since Push Mode only rewards line clears (not T-spins or combos), my goal is perform 2 Tetrises as quickly as possible.  Due to shortcomings in the level 5 Push AI, this is sufficient to win.  I use "hold" twice.

	"As for tetromino efficiency, there is only 1 mino above my platform after the 2 tetrises are performed, so the number of pieces used (23) is optimal, I think.  However, I do use "hold" twice, which costs 2 frames total.  If someone found a strategy that places 23 pieces but uses no holds, it would be 2 frames faster than mine.

	"Similarly to ToonLucas22's TAS, the replay file ends several seconds before the Push Mode game itself has completed.  This means that if a Push Mode TAS were to be combined with any other modes, the extra seconds would need to be included in the replay file, and the strategy used here would become very inefficient.  For this reason, I do not recommend trying to include this in a TAS of several Tetris DS modes at once, as efficiency in the individual modes will suffer.
