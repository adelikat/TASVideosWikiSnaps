	"Street Fighter II: The World Warrior (ストリートファイターⅡ Sutorīto Faitā Tsū?) is a 1991 fighting game produced by Capcom, originally released as an arcade game. A sequel to Street Fighter, Street Fighter II improved upon many of the concepts introduced in the first game, including the use of command-based special moves and a six-button control configuration, while offering players a selection of multiple playable characters, each with their own unique fighting style and special moves.

	"Street Fighter II is credited with starting a fighting game boom during the 1990s. Its popularity led to the production of several updated versions, each offering additional features and characters over previous versions, as well as many home versions; the game itself also established many of the core concepts of the fighting game genre. Some of the home versions of the Street Fighter II games have sold millions of copies, with the SNES port of the first Street Fighter II being Capcom's best-selling consumer game of all-time as of 2008.

	"Street Fighter II at this point is a old hat game were everything or at least almost was discovered by the community who still play this franchise nowadays, both me and SDR picked World Warrior to work some years ago deciding what routes would be good enough for a good playaround featuring off the best combos & glitches.
	$LF
	"At start we decided to goes for 910522 however due some researching we decided that switching to USA 910206 would be a better choice since this is one of the versions who does not reset so often like 910522 does while doing Guile glitches who even resets the game when doing Scrollings which is one of the most important glitches for us, also for entertaiment purpose and run development, so playing the main rom wouldn't make any sense for the run progress having in mind our initial playset.

[div class=p 
	"A interesting result between a slow projectile collision while doing normal move will turn into an air stun state, easiest way to setup it up is having a character like Guile doing a slow Sonic Boom in a corner and having the 2nd player at the otherside of the corner, after releasing a Sonic Boom walk with both players until reach the otherside limit, then before the projetile hits do a normal move (need a good frame time to hit the right time between the ground and the air stun animation) the other character will get stuck in air being able to do a air move or even blocking while you keep pressing kick or punches, the state for the float doesn't stands forever so keep in mind that 2nd player will fall off eventually, but you can still make some cool combos with it, this glitch also works for all sf2 games except Super Turbo.

[div class=p 
	"One of the most old hat known glitches from sf2, for who still don't know how it works it's basically a spot from the car bonus where a character get stucked in the mid air while doing a infinite heavy/medium punch/kick animation, it seems a easy glitch to setup but it's not at all, you need to break one part of the car until can't be any longer destroyed while doing stand moves, then press back followed by back + up at the same time hitting the right spot before starting the trigger animation, this glitch also works on Champion Edition.

	"Before starting: all Guile glitches need to charge a Sonic Boom or Flash Kick before any setup, keeping that in mind might help to understand what is hapenning and how it works.

	"Works the same as Stance while holding forward for a bit longer and then pressing heavy kick and heavy punch nearly as the same time, if you did the right input at the right frame Guile will throw your opponent without even touching him, you can keep doing it infinite times even while opponent entered in the dizzy state, also to keep switching positions all you need is pressing right/left before pressing both kick and punch.

[div class=p 
	"One of the mainly reasons why we pick USA version over the main one was for this glitch, doing it at the main rom will cause game reset while in some versions the game start corrupting allowing crazy/funny animations during scrollings. The way to perform is the same as Handcuffs but instead of doing a MP throw will be a HP throw and then releasing a Flash Kick in sequence.
	$LF
	"Lot of effects happens while pressing a sonic boom at determined states depending on the screen position, sometimes game resets, crash, freeze, give odd states like a E.Honda freezing in a stuck frame animation, to proceed scrolling doing a Flash Kick will reset back.
