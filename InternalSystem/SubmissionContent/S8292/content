	"Rafting, especially in a powerful river, is a dangerous adventure. But with "White Water," you can enjoy river running in the safety of your own home. In this game, you must guide your raft down eight rocky rivers. But bewareâ€”you're not alone. Crocodiles and Hover-craft share these waterways.

This game lives up to that recognition and stands above most of the games that were ever published by Compute's Gazette. I only wish that I had the experience of typing this one in, back in my youth.
