There are many dead-end routes which force backtracking, and troll springs placed on places where they are guaranteed to slow you down or bounce you back. Everything in the game is designed to make you go slow. Despite this, the game can be quite fast if you know how to abuse the engine.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This run was made with constant reference to a partial in-progress disassembly of Palmtree Panic 1 Present, with skeletal disassemblies of other zones being done as needed. This was possible because the game shares a common code base among all zones, with a few tweaks here or there (for example, you can play as a full-featured, if invisible, mini Sonic in all levels by using the PAR code FF195A:0001; he is even visible in Tidal Tempest). These disassemblies were used to determine exactly how a few things worked so they could better be abused; they are not available anywhere yet. All in all, very little was found that helped.

	$LF

		[em 
			"press

		$LF

		"when you 
		[em 
			"press
		]em
		" or 
		[em 
			"hold
		]em
		" down while charging a peelout, the game determines whether you should duck (if you had pressed down to start the timer mentioned above) or start charging a spindash;
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"after either of the paths above, the game goes into the normal code that applies natural deceleration when running and not pressing right or left; 
		[em 
			"this code is skipped in the normal course of charging a peelout
		]em
		";
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"after this, the game updates your X and Y speeds based on ground angle and inertia;

		"after this, the game checks whether or not to start rolling.
		$LF
	]li
]ol
[p 
	"The variant used by Nitsuja and Upthorn simply pressed down. This caused a frame's worth of deceleration to be applied (but because of (2), the deceleration applied was wrong: 13 instead of 12), the game checks for zips on this frame, and there is the possibility of rolling. In the end, you have 4 cases:
	$LF
]p
[ol 
	[li 
		"1-frame charge + 1-frame deceleration (Launch speed 87), no zip: speed is insufficient for rolling, so you don't roll and get to keep the launch speed;

	[li 
		"n+1-frame charge + 1-frame deceleration, no zip (Launch speed 87+100*n): you move for 1 frame, and your inertia is sufficient for rolling, so you get converted to a spindash and lose the charge when you release down;
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"n+1-frame charge + 1-frame deceleration, with zip (Launch speed 87+100*n minus 256 times the number of pixels Sonic gets inside the wall): inertia gets set to 0 due to zip, which prevents rolling; you get to keep the quoted launch speed after the first frame; you lose the current charge;
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"n+1-frame charge + 1-frame deceleration, no zip, the launch movement plus the smaller rolling hitbox makes you go over an edge (Launch speed 87+100*n): you get to keep the full speed of the launch, and you will keep moving when you land and will resume charging from the inertia you keep from landing.
		$LF
	]li
]ol
[p 
	"The variant I discovered presses down+forward. This prevents the deceleration from being applied, and moreover, you can't roll when you are pressing right or left. This means you get launched at your full current inertia (the peelout charge) 
	[em 
		"and
	]em
	" you keep charging your peelout since it is not converted into a spindash (as long as the timer mentioned above is zero when you press down+forward). And since zipping is disabled when charging a peelout, you get to run through walls on all frames except those you pressed down+forward on. Finally, you are also not affected by slopes, meaning you keep your full speed even while running up a slope.

	" The Japanese and US versions have a slightly different way of handling the in-game time and lag frames. The US version works like the other 2D Sonic games and only updates the in-game timer on non-lag frames; the Japanese version, however, appears to update the timer also when there are two consecutive lag frames. This happens in a couple of places in Quartz Quadrant, making these levels longer in in-game time.

	" Time is in the pseudo-centiseconds used by the game. What the game really does is have an internal frame counter in the [0,59] range that is used to update the seconds every 60 frames. The centiseconds are obtained from this frame counter by multiplying it by 100 and dividing by 60, rounding down (the game does an integer unsigned division and sets the remainder to zero).

	"I disassembled the boss to find out the fastest way to beat him. As it turns out, you can start damaging the boss right after hitting him the first time (which must happen on-screen). Sonic accelerates at 12 subpixels/frame/frame, whereas the conveyor belt accelerates at a rate of 8 subpixels/frame/frame; the conveyor's speed maxes out 32 subpixels/frame slower than Sonic's top speed, and is the rate at which the boss gets damaged. If you are moving slower than the conveyor, its speed decreases by 7 subpixels/frame/frame, unless you are on air, in which it decreases only by 1 subpixel/frame/frame. So you want to be on the ground faster than the conveyor belt whenever possible, and just holding right is enough to damage the boss as fast as possible.
