	"My goals in this movie were to complete the game on the hardest difficulty as fast as possible while only killing the enemies that were absolutely necessary to kill. (editor's note: i.e. this is a pacifist version.) This applies to enemy bullets and missiles as well; I donâ€™t shoot them either.

	"I had to use luck manipulation when fighting the worm boss on the last level in order to get it to spit the larva monsters straight instead of down. That way I was able to shoot the boss without killing any of the little monsters.

	"In some scenes the player appears to have bullets or monsters pass through him without taking any damage. This was able to be done by hitting the down button every other frame. If started on the proper frame, it would change the player's hit box while keeping the animation the same. On another note, if I started hitting the down button on the wrong frame, it would change the animation, but not the hit box, so it would appear that the player was being killed by bullets that were missing him.
