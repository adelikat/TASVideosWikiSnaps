	"The king is dying without an heir, so he sends Sir Graham out on a quest to recover three magical items from the realm.  If Sir Graham is able to recover all three items, he will be granted the crown as the next king of Daventry.  Graham must search high and low, using his wits to solve problems and recover the three magical items (A chest of never-ending gold, A mirror that shows the future, and A shield that guarantees safety and victory in battle).

	"This new TAS is 15.844 seconds (according to JPC-rr itself).  The current publication is 18.297 seconds.  So this new run is an improvement of 2.453 seconds.  Given that the first 2.9 seconds of the run is the loading time gettign to the actual gameplay, the actual duration of gameplay is 15.397 seconds for the old run and 12.944 seconds for this submission.  The 2.453 second impmrovement is therefore a roughly 16% cut (2.453s/15.397s) off the original publication in terms of gameplay time saved.
