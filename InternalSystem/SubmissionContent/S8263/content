The main difference between the character mechanics is that Obelix is bigger and can break the silver blocks by punching, ground pounding or headbutting them, whereas Asterix needs to pick up potions and use those potions to destroy blocks.

	"On it’s own this would suggest that most levels are faster with Obelix, however with Obelix’s extra size comes more lag. This makes Obelix generally a bit slower, especially with RTA where lag reduction can’t be done as precisely. That being said, the difference is small enough that it’s about 50/50 whether Asterix or Obelix is faster on a level and it usually comes down to whatever route you end up taking through the level.

Usually you can duck for a frame on the ground without losing any speed, so jumping out of this extends the visual of ducking and costs literally no time at all, making it an effective general movement strategy for Obelix. This also changes your hitbox a bit, allowing you to squeeze under roofs you would normally not be able to.
