	"By pressing down the minus, b, and 1 buttons all at the same time you can activate a debug feature and skip any track in the game! Using this technique, I skip all of the tracks except for the last one. I then drive the last track normally from there. Unfortunately, this means that there's a LOT of loading screens, since the game has to load every single track just for it to be skipped in 1 frame...

	"Additionally, this same button combination can also be used in the main menu to get lots of chocolate coins and buy the fastest car in the game immediately from a fresh save.

	""Can't you just skip the last level?":
	$LF
	"Skipping the last track sends you to a "debug" track where it's impossible to win so it's unfortunately not possible to skip the last level and still win.

	"The game has no credits because like all great games M&M's Kart Racing understands that the joy of a game comes from the journey, not the destination
