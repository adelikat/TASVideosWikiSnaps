	"The final battle with Dedede is not necessary to unlock all of the secrets in the game,

	$LF
	"Besides, Kirby must defeat Dedede to fulfill his goal of restoring the beautiful starlit sky, right?
	$LF
	"I fight Dedede in normal mode rather than extra mode. In extra mode, Kirby deals half as much damage 
	$LF
	"to Dedede, which prolongs the battle but makes it none the more interesting.
