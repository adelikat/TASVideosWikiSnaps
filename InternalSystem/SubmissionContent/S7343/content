	"This game has interesting routing quirks. Certain level patterns lock out certain other level patterns, leading to losing a few frames in some levels to guarantee a good pattern in other levels. Though it looks like I'm bleeding frames out of stage 1 vs the current TAS, it is necessary to use a slightly slower level 1 to obtain a faster level 2 which is the bulk of the timesave. There were other minor optimizations through beginning stages sooner. I ran through various permutations and couldn't find a faster path.
