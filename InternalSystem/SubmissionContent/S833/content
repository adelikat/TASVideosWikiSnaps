	"This is a strange hack of the Super Mario Brothers game for the NES. When Mario eats a mushroom he becomes Samus in a one-piece like outfit.   Not much different other then that, and Mario has blue hair.  This run can definitely be done better.  I'm just not skilled enough to do that. I've included the rom itself into the zip file with this.
