	"Manip TID 26F1 (RAM Address 1358 in BizHawk), current manip waits 4-3-12-2 frames on the first 4 inputs of the TAS to get this.  This data matches the first half of the party count address.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Start a new game, and hold B while text is appearing while clearing text with A, switching which input holds and which one clears as needed to avoid consecutive input lag.  This achieves the same effective text speed as Fast without setting options before New Game.

	"Name your character the default Yellow, which corresponds to a data value of 61 which can be swapped into the owned pokemon count.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Name your rival the default Blue, which has a side effect of improving the speed of the battle transition before Oak catches Pikachu.  The transition reads from invalid memory because battle transitions are based on your first pokemon's level and the opponent's level, but you don't have any owned pokemon yet!  This out of bounds read ends up pulling from rival name.  By either writing 5 characters into a non default name and then deleting 4 of them (useful for glitchless) or in a shorter run like NSC using a default name, you'll guarantee the ~30 frame faster transition.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Set options using fast options: inputs Start->Up->Up->Left+A->B->Start.  This is the payoff for not setting options before new game, it is faster in TAS timing to set options after the game loads as the start menu is a few frames less laggy than entering options from the main menu.

	"Pikachu Manipulation Strategy
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Before leaving the house, set up rDIV in System Bus FF04 so that the desired Pikachu DVs are possible.  A Pikachu with DVs 70C8, 70C9, 70D8, 70D9, 71D8 or 71D9 is needed for ACE and the optimal rival battle.  These DVs are generated from successive calls to HRandomAdd, and HRandomAdd is calculated by addition of its current value and rDIV, so for instance to generate Pika 70C9 HRA=C9 and rDIV=A7 are needed so that HRA2 = HRA + rDIV= C9 + A7 = 70.  In decimal the ACE-worthy Pikas come from rDIV values of 151,152,167,168, and 169.  Within a given map, rDIV tends to be stuck cycling in increments of 18.3125 so that it repeats every 14 frames.  In order to break the cycle efficiently, the amount of time spent on previous maps needs to be varied to find different LCD disable lengths between maps.  The last textbox before DVs can then be delayed to get to the right part of the cycle for 151-152 or 167-169.  Also, in Oak's house where Pika DVs are obtained, textbox delays (especially before the last end of paragraph text box) will shift the initial HRA value (C9 in the example) without shifting rDIV on a given frame.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Practically this means delaying the last input before Pika DVs at least 14 frames to provide buffer space for the rDIV cycle, then changing up turns while walking, delaying walking, pressing A to check for NPCs, and delaying textboxes (especially end of paragraph boxes) on a previous map such as parts of Mom's house while watching Pika's DVs until DVs that correspond to the good rDIV values are found.  Then in Oak's house removing a frame before Pika DVs and adding it in different areas of Oak's house will generate several different initial HRA rolls, hopefully landing on or near C8/C9/D8/D9.  If C7/CA/D7/DA are found, removing another frame from before Pika DV generation and adding it to the immediately prior textboxes is more likely to shift HRA by a single value.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"For this TAS, MrWint was able to find a 5 frame delay for a 70D9 Pika, putting us at only 17 frames of intentional delay to setup both Trainer ID and Pikachu DV RNG.  This TAS gets Pika DVs at frame 7789, whereas the previous TAS in 9:52 got Pika DVs 128 frames later at 7917.

DSUM seems to line up pretty consistently for Pidgeotto to be in a good spot after the earlier RNG manipulation.  The new TAS saves 38 frames between delay to avoid route 1 encounters, forest encounters, and delay for finding Pidgeotto, blacking out to Pidgeotto 173 frames ahead of the 9:52 at frame 26454 vs 26627.

These swaps use the wild encounter's DVs (76 from attack and defense) to point to the Hall of Fame and then the item count to set the Hall of Fame Script straight to the credits past the initial Oak dialogue.  The Yellow character name is also swapped into owned Pokemon count to prevent an input when Oak assesses your pokedex.  This saves 18 seconds over an ACE route that does not change the quantity of seen Pokemon.  The TAS ACE route now used is unique from the RTA route due to the near impossibility of manipping the unbuffered trainer ID (4 consecutive 1 frame 60fps inputs) and the impracticality of manipping Pikachu DVs through several textboxes and NPC timers.

	"We save another 47 frames through the end in part due to the Voltorb encounter from 3 special on the Pidgey instead of the old Nidoking encounter from C special on a Rattata.

	"In summary, we save 128 frames from MrWint's botted Pika DV manip, 7 frames finding crits in the rival battle, 38 frames to encounter manip through Pidgeotto deathfly, 46 frames manipulating a 76XX DV encounter, 37 frames executing THE manip, and 47 frames on Voltorb's cry+sprite decrompression lag vs Nidoking alongside triple-checked mart and party underflow inputs.  This leaves us 293 frames ahead in total for a 5 second improvement to 9:47.
