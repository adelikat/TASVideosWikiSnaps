	"I initially tried to TAS this game on FCEUX, but it kept crashing at a certain place in Level 2, so I had to use BizHawk instead. I might switch to BizHawk for laggier games like Action 52 as FCEUX doesn't handle it all too well.

	"The strategy involved for all 3 levels is to hold off the meteorites for as long as possible. This is done by weaving up and down - holding up for 48 frames and then down for the same amount of time (or 49 if the game decides to lag a bit). However, there are 3 caveats to this strategy.

	": At first, I didn't know what I was looking at...but I finally figured it out. This is another game that repeats the same style of game play, represented in the other Action 52 games, where you survive to win. Aside from surviving...the only real advantage here, is the ending of the input as early as possible.
