	"Mission Mode in Tetris DS challenges the player to perform various tasks such as clearing a line with pieces that spawn in random orientations and can't be rotated. The Time Trial sub-mode in it has 5 levels, each with 10 missions given in a random order, with the objective being to clear all 10 missions as fast as possible.

	"Luck manipulation was pretty difficult since Tetris DS uses a bag randomizer, i.e. it deals one of each tetrimino in random order, then repeats. Additionally, the game doesn't seem to pick up entropy after startup, although the initial seed is determined by the system time. It may be possible to shave a couple more frames off the time with some seed searching, but I don't have enough real-life time to do it.
