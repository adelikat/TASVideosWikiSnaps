	": Here at TASVideos, PAL versions of games are generally disallowed. It is only in rare cases when a PAL version of a game will be accepted. This is when there are entertainment or technical merits to using the PAL version. It has to be different enough in order to be accepted as a different branch or significantly better to obsolete the published NTSC run. Please read these sections of the movie rules: 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Use the Correct Version|href=/MovieRules#UseTheCorrectVersion)
