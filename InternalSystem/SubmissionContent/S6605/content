	"A short summary of the story is followed... A player was requested to save the world inside a book and when he woke up he realized he is there already. So his purpose is, to beat 5 bosses of enemies to get 5 miracle capsules and to save a mayor's daughter, in addition he needs to gather 2 items which are necessary to go back to the original world - a small stick and a reg gem.

		" Raise a level to 2, as a result gain EP by 30. Use ESP life up which requires 250 EP point. Suddenly the player's EP will be gone up to 9780 because EP auto-recovery pill is to recover EP to a current maximum EP value. In this case, it should be recovered to 30 but as ESP life-up needs 250 EP, even after the recovery EP will be negative, can't offset -220 (30-250). Then, for some reasons, memory underflow is happened and EP will be gone up to 9,780, which equal to 10000 - 220.

	": Optimization seems pretty good in this one. There are a couple of weird spots, but it seems these are just for despawning and/or enemy manipulation. The overall routing looks reasonable enough, and you made good use of the EP underflow exploit. The battles are also admirable compared to the RTA run.
