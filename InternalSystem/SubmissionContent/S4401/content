	"This is another one of my favorite titles from the genesis era of gaming so i decided to TAS it and see what i could do, its been quite fun to see this develop from a test run, an improvement of 11761 frames was made overall from the testing phase.

	"I tried to use as much variation as i could for the entertainment value of this submission, hence the pong impression on those idle spots during the side scrolling sections.

	"I attempted to group the enemies together and defeat them as quickly as i could to save time, making use of how they follow you and attack in close proximity, this is useful against the slug enemies and many others, there is also use of the vault attack to dispatch enemies hanging onto houses and other objects.

	"Attack spamming on the bosses doesn't have any extra benefits, they become invulnerable after being hit for a second or so, so i tried to use this fact to conserve energy when possible and keep them in a flashing state as much as i could.

	"A very interesting programming error was found with the kangaroo enemies, a multiple hit glitch is triggered just with them by holding forward while executing the rolling attack, which saved a lot of time.
