	"Aiming for fastest time relies a lot on your timing with the creatures in your path. First time through: 4:07, Fixed pathing 4:04..

	"By waiting on the previous screen, you can place them in a better position so that you are able to walk right underneath them without pausing or walking backwards.

	"Other than that, this was a pretty solid run that only needed fixing in the last stage of Condors Bats and Scorpions. The game looks simple, but try playing it in real-time!

	"This is my first of two TASes for Pitfall II, as stated above this is fastest time, the next upcoming TAS will be maximum completion.
