	": A playaround submission that gets only 50% of voting support, no posts that mention the movie was entertaining, a few "sloppiness" comments, and even difficulty complaints? I have to reject this movie. But yes, for playarounds, any difficulty that would allow for a more entertaining movie is allowed.

	"In the end, I want to say that playaround TASes are possibly even harder to make than speed-oriented runs, because it should include all one can invent and still be funny to meet people expectations and our common playaround standards, so a good playaround would require much more work and co-operation to get liked. Better luck next time!
