	"Cosmo Tank is an action game for the Gameboy with a variety of play styles including first person shooter / maze exploration, auotscroller, and overhead exploration. The main improvement in this run is upgrading the laser as quick as possible. In the original run, it seems tool23 mistook the 'L' upgrades (which are life upgrades) for laser upgrades (the actual laser upgrade is 'P') and so purposefully missed several upgrades and never reached the fully upgraded laser. Obviously, fixing this saves a lot of time. Other improvements include some improved RNG, slightly better maneuvering, and improved enemy / boss fights.

	"TASing this game is incredibly tedious due to the RNG which always seems to be working against you. Many hours were wasted trying in vain to improve RNG to get better enemy spawns, and ultimately I just settled for good enough. But, now with this, Asmik World, and Catrap done my grind through tedious gameboy games is over. Time to find something more interesting to work on.
