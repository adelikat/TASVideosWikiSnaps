	"Some years ago, I set out to make the most entertaining playthrough of Def Jam: FFNY as possible. And lo behold, I think I did an alright job. This TAS is about 7 years old, and remains one of my more viewed and well received TAS I've made over the years. I never submitted beyond userfiles upon completion, however, because it didn't fit with stars and wasn't purely speed so couldn't go straight for the vault. However, with the changes that have taken place to the submission ranking system over the years and haven spoken to a couple of judges on whether it might pass the process, I think this TAS would be a perfect fit for the alternative category. (There's also been no more TAS of this game besides 1 abandoned project by

	"In this movie, I aim for maximum user entertainment while keeping a brisk pace. I take a few detours throughout to alter my character appearance, upgrade stats, change my moveset, extend combos to impossibly long lengths against the AI, take on every single fight in story mode (except for postgame bonus fights, because I did not use a save file) and just generally make a joke of the opponents trying to take me down. You'll see all the biggest mainstream rappers of the 00s get their faces bloodied with combos and reactions that human players simply cannot replicate, as well as setups and tricks that are impossible without other players helping or TAS manipulating the AI in just the right manner!

	"This is essentially a feature length film, clocking in at 1:46:29.58! Despite all the detours taken for entertainment, this TAS actually stood as the Hard any% WR for 6 years, until being beaten by the runner togemme in 2023 (who took no detours and optimized purely for speed, foregoing entertainment). As of now, this TAS is the 2nd fastest Hard any% run of this game. I hope everyone enjoys and gets a kick out of one of my favorites from my backlog.

Unfortunately, he doesn't recall what emulator / config he used either.  Rejecting since we haven't received any updates which indicate progress has been or will be done regarding this.
