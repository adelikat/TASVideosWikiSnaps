	"Action 52 is an unlicensed game made for the NES and Sega Genesis, featuring - you guessed it - 52 different video games. The NES version was published in 1991, whereas the Genesis version was published in 1993. Both versions were published by Active Enterprises.

	"From now on, all NES Action 52 TASes will be made on BizHawk, even though it takes 4 frames longer to play out the opening cutscene. This is because FCEUX keeps crashing whenever I try to TAS Action 52 on it, sometimes making TAS production impossible.

	"At the end of Level 8, the cartridge crashes. It's unknown why this happens, but my best guess is that the cartridge can't handle a game with 8 unique levels well. This is considered the ending of the game.

	"Level 8 is where we have to end input early. The last frame we have to move left or right is 31316. From there, we slowly buffer down inputs so that we barely make it past all the bullets unharmed. The last down input is on frame 31800. From here, the game crashes 1 frame before we would lose a life to the white wall.
