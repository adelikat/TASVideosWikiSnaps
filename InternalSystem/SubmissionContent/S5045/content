	"The game covers the Saiyan and Namek arcs of the Dragonball Z manga/anime. As Goku, you fight enemies or accomplish certain tasks to become stronger and go on to protect the universe from the evil Frieza. While that sounds cool and all, this game has been implemented rather poorly.  Here you have Goku, tournament winner and the world's strongest, who has protected Earth from Piccolo Jr and now his son has been kidnapped by his evil brother Raditz. Before you get to fight him, you have to complete tasks that are - objectively - rather boring, ranging from picking flowers to rescuing people. Most enemies you fight in this game are wildlife or no-name soldiers.

	"I first attempted TASing this game back in 2008 on the old VBA emulator. While I already knew about the faster flying technique (by switching between flying and walking repeatedly), I restricted myself to not using it, so I ended up walking for most of the run. This looked more clean and watchable to me but produced a run that was longer by more than, I estimate, 3 minutes. I never played past the Ginyu Force back then so the run was never finished. While dealing with other projects, I glitch hunted the game some and found some interesting things. You can read all about that on the 
	[a class=intlink href=/GameResources/GBx/DragonBallZTheLegacyOfGoku

	"After mGBA became available for TASing on Bizhawk, I started looking at the game's addresses and stat growth (see 
	[a class=intlink href=/Forum/Viewtopic.php?p=419070#419070 
		"here
	]a
	") and started working on a luascript. It took a very long time and dedication to finish my research. I found some interesting trivia, for example: The leveling up is not consistent. There are some odd gaps in the experience needed to level up, as you can see in the right chart. Level 20 and 21 only required you to gain another 100,000 experience, while Level 22 required a whopping 1,200,000. Maybe the devs intended for you to get this level up in the Frieza fight, and not before.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"As far as this run's experience gaining and grinding is concerned, there aren't many options to work with in the first place. Grinding on random dinos or guards just isn't worth the time it takes. I did the mandatory forest tasks and opted to talk to Yamcha and Puar to level up earlier and have a faster Raditz fight. I killed Snake Queen to be a level higher for Nappa and Vegeta, thus speeding up those fights as well. I found that you could skip rescuing the missing kid in the snow forest by flying over the military border in a certain way and fortunately that task didn't give any experience so it didn't ruin my route. The next decision-making was done at the Ginyu Force: You could 
	[a class=intlink href=/GameResources/GBx/DragonBallZTheLegacyOfGoku#SkipTheGinyuForce 
		"skip it altogether
	]a
	" but that would leave you underleveled for Frieza. I don't have the notes anymore, but I think it would have wasted over a minute if you didn't level-up at the Ginyu Force.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"So next thing I had to decide was to either kill Recoome, Jeeze and Barta (RJB) and leave Ginyu alone OR to kill Ginyu as well. Through thorough testing it appeared to me that killing Ginyu too was only a mere 1 second faster so I did that. The first plan to deal with RJB was to fight them all at the same time but I later found a better route: Recoome has lower health, so by prioritizing on killing him faster, I could level-up and deal more damage to the other two. I also found that I could kill a nearby guard to level-up and kill Recoome himself faster. Another thing I found is the use of Kamehameha being worthwhile. My luascript showed me that Kamehameha had a lot of potential for dealing more damage than punching so I ended up using it when I saw the chance. The Frieza fight (and also all the other fights to some extent) wasn't very optimized. I'm sure you could squeeze a lot of frames out of it but I had no insights on how RNG behaves. All the damage dealing was done purely on a trial-and-error basis and I had worked a very long time already and wanted to be done with the project. I estimate I worked:

I resorted to a lot of trial and error to find the most optimal frames to punch enemies. If your punch is successful, it will make a crack sound. But when you punch and it makes a soft sound, that means it didn't do any damage. This can be because you hit a flop frame (a frame where your hit misses) or because the enemy is invulnerable for a small time.

He also becomes invulnerable for 80 frames whenever you successfully deal damage to him. Those two possibilities for invulnerability are treated separately - if either of the timers is nonzero, you can't deal damage.
