	". I'm aware the run is currently labeled as a playaround, but from what I understand it wasn't originally submitted as such. If the overall aim is for speed, then there's too much variation in fight strategy and too many awkward pauses for it to qualify, not to mention that options could have been changed to further bring fight times down. If the aim is to entertain, then ironically there isn't enough variation in fight strategy, as they end too quickly to really show off the kinds of things we want to see in fighter playarounds, namely variety in characters, movesets and matchups. The run ends up in kind of a weird middle ground between speed and playaround in that way.

	"For future runs, please ensure that you are doing everything as fast as the game will allow, especially in menuing. Make absolutely sure that you are clearing menus and text boxes on the first frame possible and that all of your fight movement is done similarly. I can tell you're using TAStudio, so that should make it easier to check these things. Here's a tip that helps me out a lot: Set easily accessible hotkeys for "Delete Frame" and "Clone Frame" in TAStudio! It allows for really efficient adjustments to your input so you can quickly test whether or not you're doing something on the first frame the game allows.

	"If you are aiming for speed, set the game options to ensure the fastest possible fights and find the best character/combo to finish every fight as fast as possible. If you are aiming for entertainment, showcase the game as best as you possibly can. Show off multiple characters, multiple combos, bugs and glitches if this game has any, mess around with the CPU opponents. You said this is your favorite game, so surely you're the best choice to give it a proper showcase, but feel free to reach out for help if you need to! There are plenty of people here willing to help out!
