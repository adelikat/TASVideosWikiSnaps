	"Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective is a Puzzle adventure game from 2010 on the Nintendo DS.  It was created by Shu Takumi, who also created the Ace Attorney.  In this game you play as a ghost who has recently died and has no memory of who he was, and finds himself with ghost like abilities, with the ability to possess and manipulate small objects.  Using this strange power, he sets off to figure out his identity, and in the process discovers more than what lies beyond the surface.

	"So this game does not let you skip text on a first playthrough, it only lets you skip text if you either have a completed save file or it's dialogue you've already seen (although sometimes the game doesn't let you skip certain dialogue even though you've seen it).  Because I started from a clean state instead of using sram, this run is going to be longer than RTA runs which use completed save files.

	"This doesn't pop up that much, but there are some cutscenes that activate if Sissel possesses certian objects for the first time.  One that comes to mind is in Chapter 14 when swapping the round objects on the seasaw.  I'm trying to avoid Sissel possessing the right side of the saw here as it activates a cutscene where he points out all the round objects, and the characters talk for awhile and it just wastes time.  So the movement here may look weird and suboptimal, but trust me it saves time.

	"This is something I've had to figure out if it's worth it to save some lag frames, as usually it means I have to move the camera away from areas that would generate a ton of lag.  I decided to only ever do this for really bad lag areas so that it doesn't sacrifice too much of the viewer's experience.  I tried to make sure I showcase as much of the real time events as possible so viewers would know what's currently happening in the game.
