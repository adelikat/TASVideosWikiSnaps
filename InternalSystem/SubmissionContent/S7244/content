	"Unfortunately, 5-3 is impossible coinless due to the looping system in the level. It is impossible to bypass the loop object without the use of hacks, tho we (ThreeCreepio and I) were 9 pixels off of doing so. To bypass a loop object, you need Mario to be grounded and have the address $CE (Mario's Y pixel) at the value F0. Collecting a power-up (mushroom or fire flower) puts Mario in a grounded state, which would've done the trick. Unfortunately, power-ups don't have a hitbox between value F0 and F8, making 5-3 impossible coinless, thus making the coin count go up by 16 coins.

Aside from a few places where you need to really go out of your way to avoid them (and in one place you just can't, and we haven't seen the second part of the game yet), mostly you just need to run or jump through a different part of the level, with little to no slowdown, and you've successfully avoided the coins.

	"One may ask why I'm comparing to the SNES port. It's because gameplay is very similar, and in terms of in-game mechanics it's basically the same game. We just use the SNES version for the all-levels branch because all the levels are available right away, while in the FDS version you have to replay the main game several times to access the second part.
