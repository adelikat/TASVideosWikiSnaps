	"This is a pretty straight forward game with some lovely music that I mostly skip over. The controls are Left, Right, Down, Jump, and Shoot. When Fievel lands he will take several frames to recover before he can move again. This landing time can be negated if you jump again right away or if you land on a moving platform. Sometimes it can also be negated (or greatly reduced) by landing on a slope.

	"Waiting for that platform was the longest I had to go in the game without running right (outside of boss battles). I fire my gun right before exiting the stage, which I also do on a couple of other stages. That represents the final frame I have control of my character. In every level I have to try and land as softly as possible before reaching that point or else frames will just be wasted waiting for Fievel to recover before the game automatically moves him past the edge of the screen. Even if I land past the edge of the screen it still takes time to recover.

	"Dousing some fires. Your hit points do not regenerate each level. At the end of each chapter you get bonus points for each heart you have left at the cost of losing a bunch of frames. Fortunately, getting hit doesn't cost any frames, so I intentionally get hit so that I can end the chapter with the lowest health possible.

	"Apparently the developers were too lazy to come up with a different sound effect for swimming. Jumping while under water is close enough to swimming, I guess. You don't lose time by swimming or even walking underwater, but you do still have the landing animation if you touch the ground.

	"Boss Bird. After beating him the ground will disappear and you'll fall to the desert floor. Falling off the bottom of the screen right after delivering the final blow accelerates the transition. The side of the stage you fall off of correlates to which side of the screen you'll appear on when landing on the desert floor, so being on the right side is faster. It's also worth noting that your bullets de-spawn once it goes past the edge of the screen, so I have to wait until the bird gets hit before I can move towards the edge of the stage any further.
