Walking is generally only done at the beginning of the game, before the running shoes are obtained. It is also done as opposed to running for going past spinners, as running near spinners will have them "snap" to your position (note that this does not apply to biking, just running).

Another way to avoid a turnframe is to simply "bonk" onto whatever is in front of you, as you are no longer "motionless" and thus will not turnframe.

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Plasma Skip skips several trainers within Chargestone Cave. It abuses "Trainer Skip," an exploit where NPC trainers can be skipped by having their line of sight obstructed by a phenomenon (e.g. dust clouds). This obstruction mechanic appears to be intended (as the game has an explicit check for phenomenon being in the line of sight), although it leads to being able to skip otherwise mandatory trainers.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Every 20 steps in an area where encounters can happen and a phenomenon is not present, a phenomenon may appear. Phenomenon spawns within a 11x11 area, with the player in the center of that area. Whether or not a phenomenon appears is first decided by an RNG roll that rolls a number between 0-999. If the roll is less than 100, a phenomenon might appear. If that passes, another roll will be done to determine which direction to scan for possible spawn locations, rolling a number between 0-3. 0 scans rightwards, 1 scans leftwards, 2 scans upwards, and 3 scans downwards. This then thus makes the area limited to a 11x6, 5 tiles away from your current tile to the direction to scan and 5 tiles away in each perpendicular direction. Once all valid locations are scanned, another RNG roll is done to determine which location should spawn the cloud, rolling a number between 0-N, where N is the number of valid spawn tiles - 1. Note that tiles with the player and NPCs currently on them are considered valid in this context, but if the RNG roll lands on such a tile, the phenomenon will not spawn. There are some extra restrictions here however possibly, as the checks won't go past the current 32x32 "chunk" the player is in.

	"In theory, all 7 Plasma grunts could be skipped using dust clouds. However, after one trainer is skipped, the dust cloud has to be despawned to skip the next trainer. Entering a battle, interacting with an NPC, picking up an item, or leaving the map will despawn the current dust cloud. Since fighting a Plasma grunt obviously eliminates them from the pool of trainers, fighting 1 grunt effectively acts like a 2-in-1 deal, as the next grunt can be freely skipped. This then means fighting 1 Plasma grunt to despawn the cloud is equal to encountering 2 wild Pokemon in terms of advancing through the pool of trainers. Due to this, the 2nd trainer is not skipped, as it is slower than encountering 2 wild Pokemon.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"For the 4th and 5th trainer, 2 wild Pokemon are encountered to despawn the dust clouds, as it is faster than fighting the 4th trainer. The current repel is aligned so it wears off after skipping the 3rd trainer, allowing for these wild encounters. After the 5th trainer is skipped and the dust cloud is despawned, another Max Repel is used.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	""Interacting with an NPC" will despawn a dust cloud. I've discovered when making this TAS this actually includes the movable crystals. Pressing "A" in front of one of these movable crystals as if you were to talk to an NPC will end up despawning a dust cloud, although no actual text will be yielded for such an "interaction." Using this, the 6th and 7th trainers can be quickly skipped without doing any wild encounters.

	"Doing all this of course requires very, very specific RNG to happen. As such, a save+quit is done, along with a soft reset. This gives 16384 possible RNG seeds, abusing the 13 possible keypad inputs, along with timer0 able to be varied by 1 by adjusting the exact frame the soft reset happens. One of the tools I created searched through these seeds to find the best workable one.

	"To save on repel usage, the next Max Repel isn't used until right before the third tall grass patch. While it would be faster to just walk the planks entirely over the first and second tall grass patches, this isn't possible, as a trainer faces the end of the first plank line. This trainer is also notably a rotation/triple battle (depending on game version), which requires 3 non-fainted Pokemon in the party to encounter, which will be the case in this run. As such, the planks are only partially used, resulting in a slightly slower path.
