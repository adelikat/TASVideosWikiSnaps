	"This is already my third submission of this game, the first two were not as accurate (and indeed were many bads for tas) and at that time I did not understand very well how to make a tas. This I focused more on speed and accuracy suffering damage, dying and using the gun to win the largest number of frames, I used all lives up to the last boss. Compared to the previous submission I got Improves in virtually all stages in total were 4129 frames Improve (1:09).

	"Act 1 - At this stage I just put precision in leaps and follow the hint of "Archanfel" not to kill the mouse near the door
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Act 2 - Again following the Archanfel tip not kill the spider before the checkpoint but jump on it. The boss used damages to kill him because the difficulty to hard Harker knife is smaller and you have q come close to the enemy to hit .And remembering that this boss is the one with more horsepower is 16 hp, you can see the hp of bosses in lua script.

	"Act 2 - I used death at first because this is a checkpoint phase, to be able to quickly go through the spears. The boss I suffered damage to win frames, this only have size is the weakest it has only 10 hp (notice that even his music is different).

[p 
	"Act 3 - The boss used death to be able to use already damage that had only one life and I was not going to turn away because I would lose many frames the bad part of this boss is that in time he will release the power not of to hit him , the boss has 14 hp.

	"Act 2 - In this stage the bad was that the zombies are stronger, and the boss already arrived shooting not to lose Boating Trips, there was only after the knife

[p 
	"Act 3 - Once again used the revolver to activate the lever that has 3 or 4 spears in the way, I lost 2 life in spiders because he did not like jumping or kills them, the good thing is that the boss was easy to divert and acerta- I at the same time so did not need to die.

	"Act 1 - Earlier this stage in my other submission I had shot the lying man, now I saw that gave to destroy the bottles with the knife. Later on I jumped bald guys because they are very strong and quick and had 2 of them died in the bat on the book already thinking of another phase.

	"Act 2 - I left out ignoring the first 4 enemies killed 5 because I could not die there, jumped the bald box, shot the other to kill him quick before the hit him behind me. Kill the rats that were stronger and had no other way. The boss I left arrived shooting, got 4 hp damage with two bullets I shot and the rest was easy.

	": Hello again, CReTiNo.  First off, much respect for coming back to this one and making additional passes through it.  In total, you've shaved over 4 minutes off your first submission!  As for the run itself, routing and movement optimizations are now very tight, with smoother boss fights containing more precise hit timing.  All in all, impressive work and an entertaining watch!
