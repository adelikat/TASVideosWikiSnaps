	"This is already my third submission of this game, the first two were not as accurate (and indeed were many bads for tas) and at that time I did not understand very well how to make a tas. This I focused more on speed and accuracy suffering damage, dying and using the gun to win the largest number of frames, I used all lives up to the last boss. Compared to the previous submission I got Improves in virtually all stages in total were 4129 frames Improve (1:09).

The boss used damages to kill him because the difficulty to hard Harker knife is smaller and you have q come close to the enemy to hit .And remembering that this boss is the one with more horsepower is 16 hp, you can see the hp of bosses in lua script.

As for the run itself, routing and movement optimizations are now very tight, with smoother boss fights containing more precise hit timing.  All in all, impressive work and an entertaining watch!
