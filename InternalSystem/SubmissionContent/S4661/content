Square did a pretty good job with the graphics, since the 3D effect is very smooth, which is saying something about the NES. As important as it may be to go fast, careful steering and braking will ensure you don't go crashing off the side of the road in a hurry. To add to this, you're not the only car on the road -- Watch out for other cars, as they may send you swiftly off the road if you're not careful, or in more extreme cases, make you crash outright.

Still, this has given me some pretty decent memories, and I still have got to love those times where my car just inches to the next checkpoint long after the timer has expired.
