	"An update to my previous TAS of Nonsense. This time, instead of 22 exits, it's only 16. Thanks to one of the team members (Jolpengammler/Jolpe) I was able to remove 8 exits, find a faster final level route, and save over 10 minutes. Turns out, Yoshi isn't needed. For 21-exit (The 20th in 22-exit isn't necessary) it is, but otherwise, you can just do a midair to get in the pipe. Also, while doing this, it's worth noting that I realised 10 exit isn't quite possible. You see, the keyhole in the first level (The 
	[em 
		"actual
	]em
	" first level) isn't an actual sprite. It is just a graphic to look like a keyhole, since noone should be getting over there anyway. The link to the hack:

It is to note that this hack is pretty aware of some glitches so stuff such as walljumps are patched and L/R Scroll is disabled. Therefore some capeless skips aren't possible. There's alot of going back to get a cape as well.

After actually optimising to the best of my ability, as it turns out, most of the previously "impossible" parts are now possible! For example, the start room. By doing a spin jump in the start to turn left and doing only normal jumps from there, the camera takes a while to actually start moving, delaying the spawn of the Dino Rhinos, allowing you to enter the door without touching the one guarding the door. Also I optimised the boss by manipulating RNG to get attacks that won't force me to wait longer than the frame the boss can be hit

However, getting into the second and third mini-boss, RNG is always advancing, making it harder to determine.
