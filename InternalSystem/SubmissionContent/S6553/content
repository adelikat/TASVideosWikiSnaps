	"Power Blade is a Platformer for the NES, released by Taito in 1992. In the game you take control of NOVA, who is tasked to destroy a maverick computer with a boomerang. This movie aims to improve Aglar's 2009 run, saving about 90 seconds over the previous run from new glitches and routing.

	"Power Blade is a great and original game for the NES which is in no way derivative of any popular culture or similar games of the time. You take control of Not-Arnie who destroys killer robots by hurling flaming bananas at them. And bats. Somehow these games always have bats. The game is split up into six stages which you can complete in any order, similar to Mega Man. After you beat all stages, a final seventh stage is unlocked which contains the final boss. In every stage, before facing the boss, NOVA needs to find a contact which gives him an ID card to open the boss door. This makes the levels fairly nonlinear, and routing a large concern of the run.

	"To contend with his foes, NOVA gets a boomerang, which can be upgraded several times to be more effective. When you throw a boomerang, its power depletes and needs a few frames to recharge. During that time, its range and speed is reduced. I need to make sure I have the right amount of power at the moment I need to throw a boomerang. Additionally, you can jump over or duck under returning boomerangs, sometimes making it possible to hit enemies behind you. Nova has to stand still and go through an animation when throwing boomerangs, but it can be interrupted by ducking or jumping. Additionally you can pick up grenades from enemies, which act as a one-time consumable screen clearing item with a few surprise applications noted below. In every level, there's one or two Power Suits hidden, which gives NOVA three extra hitpoints and a higher-damage attack that goes through walls. It is essential to pick this suit up at some point, as it makes certain boss battles significantly faster

	"I was looking for a while for a game to TAS, and eventually came across Power Blade. While messing around with the game, I noticed a few Up + Down glitches with ladders, which made me decide I wanted to TAS this game. The new glitches allow for large shortcuts, significantly changing the route in many of the stages. In the end, I save 9015 frames over Aglar's run, or just over 90 seconds.

NOVA moves up into the screen above, but the game also thinks he climbed down the ladder onto the bottom tile of the previous screen. Depending on what tile was at the bottom of the screen in the previous room, several things can happen:

If you press down, NOVA will climb down the ladder, wrap around vertically, and end up at the top of the screen. From there, NOVA can drop down into the screen, or climb up further to end up in the screen above. This allows scaling vertical sections extremely quickly and significantly subverts many of the stage designs, provided the tiles are laid out right.

	"As you can see, I only get 3 grenades every 64 enemies killed. Since the shortcuts also mean I kill significantly fewer enemies along the way, this puts the entire run on a significant crunch for grenades. An enemy kill is only counted when the explosion finishes, so leaving the screen too early may mean that a kill doesn't count. Enemies may not always be placed conveniently to pick up their drops either, so sometimes, I need to forego killing an enemy because it would drop an important item, but I cannot reach it.

You need a perfect vertical subpixel position for this to work. I don't use the grenade on the ladder like Aglar does, because I need to save it for later. This means I'm forced to take damage and need to refill my life later. This also means I miss out on a boomerang drop, which kinda messes up my item route. I still manage to pick up the final Power upgrade by the end of the stage. In the second to last room, I deliberately keep a couple of bats on screen for a while to prevent a turret from spawning. The turret would otherwise shoot a tomato at me in an inconvenient spot. I also pick up a ration here which is used later. Not much else to mention about this stage.

	"This stage features the first significant route change of the run. Instead of going the upper route, I go the lower route, using a ladder warp to quickly reach the contact. This route forces me to take damage from a floor monster, and also forces me to go through the crusher section twice. By hitting the crushers with boomerangs, it is possible to briefly stun them, making it possible to jump under them. The hit detection on boomerangs is pretty finnicky, as boomerangs only check for damage on every other frame. Taking damage is highly undesirable in this section, because NOVA always jumps with maximum height when he has hit invulnerability, which means he often jumps against ceilings. On the way back, I can take damage, since there's fewer walls in my way, and a health recharge happens to drop conveniently right afterwards.

I also cannot kill any enemies here because I'm waiting on a convenient enemy for a grenade drop, which only happens several screens later.

	"The beehive boss was easily the most difficult part of the run, and the only place where RNG significantly factored into it. There's 4 beehives, which all open after a set amount of time. They close after 24 frames, but while they are in their hit invulnerability phase, their close timer is suspended. Therefore, it is possible to kill a beehive in one cycle. Each beehive has 16 HP, and a boomerang does 2 damage. However, it is not possible to spread out your damage enough to kill all beehives in one go. By throwing boomerangs in the right position, it is possible for a boomerang to linger over the hitbox of a beehive, hitting it up to 4 times, for 8 damage total. Additionally, I must make use of the recoil of a boomerang, hitting more than one beehive. Still, I must let the bottom beehive close on me once. It opens again after 1 - 256 frames, which is dependent entirely on RNG. The RNG in this game is based on the game's idle CPU cycles per frame, so it can be any value.

The Power Suit's attack is ludicrously overpowered, and its hitbox is massive. I get the fourth and final grenade here, saving up every grenade I could have for the rest of the game.

By using three grenades, I can embed myself into the wall and use it as a platform to go to the next ladder. From there, I can do another ladder clip, skipping a huge section of this level, saving some 30 seconds. The final boss is entirely fixed, and speedwise identical to Aglar's run.

The bee boss fight can be completed 16 frames faster, and it is possible to tank the 2 hits from the waffles using the Power Suit, saving some ~9 frames from recharging.
