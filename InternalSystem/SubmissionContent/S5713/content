It was been placed when an item was placed correctly, it appears as an extra and the bottom says the password to start at the next time. If you press start while the game start or the password to put less than 1905 and more than 776 BC, the questions you answered is different. If you answered it incorrect, it warped into the time that gave the question and you need to start again.

Bowser is rolling for seven seconds after you stomped Bowser.
