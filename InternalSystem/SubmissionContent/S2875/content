	"About this hack:
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"- I decide to run with lowest items as possible, so refill them is very important! The hack itself also foces player to take a long way to collect items!
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"- No Mother Brain in this hack, and Phantoon is the final boss!
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"- An interesting thing in this hack is: if you want to open a grey door, you have to shot a Blue/Red/or Green door in other room! But it's very difficult to know exactly what door to shot, experienced players of this hack might know!
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"- Power Bomb is nowhere to find in this hack, and of course you can't open Yellow door!
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"I can brief the run as follows:
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"- Missile, Morphing Ball and Bomb are the first!
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"- Wave Beam is used to open a Blue gate to get Grappling Beam, but you can use Missile instead!
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"- Grappling Beam is the must to get Hi-Jump Boots, and you can only reach the room of Super Missile with this boots!
	$LF
	"- Now it's time to fight Crocomire for Varia Suit!
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"- After acquired Varia Suit, you can enter Norfair, fight Golden Torizo for Speed Booster!
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"- There is a room with 3 Grey doors which have to shot 3 different doors in 3 different rooms! And you have to pass this room to reach to Phantoon! The 1st door to shot (Red door) is after Crocomire's room, which requires Speed Booster (ONLY Speed Booster is needed under TAS condition) (in realtime you have to get Spring Ball and Speed Booster)! The 2nd door to shot (Green door) is the big room on the way to Ridley! I used some tricks to shot the Green door without opening the Grey door (which required Ridley to be killed)! The last door to shot (Red door) is in Botwoom's room! After that, there's only Phantoon left!
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"- Phantoon can't be vulnerable except Bomb, and it takes 3 round to finish him! (1 round I did not make his eye opens immediately to refill Energy, cuz he does much damage to Samus!)
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"- Finished time: 00:19:25.32

	": While I'm in no particular hurry to have a Super Metroid hack published, enough people seem to find this one entertaining to warrant acceptance. However, both Nach and I were less than impressed with the overall level design and "polish" of the hack, so I would suggest that a future run of a more impressive hack should probably obsolete this run. Anyway, congrats to the author for the first accepted Super Metroid hack on TASvideos
