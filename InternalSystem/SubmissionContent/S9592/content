	" was a cheap plug and play system featuring a compilation of what I like to call "demastered" Intellivision games, and was actually licensed by Intellivision themselves. The games run on some stripped-down NES hardware, otherwise known as "Famiclone" or "NES-on-a-chip", all contained within the controller. Rather than develop new hardware from the ground up to suit the original games, remaking the games to run on existing NES-on-a-chip hardware was the far cheaper option at the time. Many of the games in this collection are believed to have been made by Nice Code Software.
