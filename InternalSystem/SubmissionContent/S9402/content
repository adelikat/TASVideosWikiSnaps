N2 Red is skipped because E2 doesn't need to be unlocked at all, but the larger route change is based around the path taken to unlock S3. Instead of doing W4 Red, N4 Gray, and N5 Gray to unlock S3 in an unintended way, it ends up being around 3800 frames faster to unlock S3 the intended way by doing S2 Gray, W3 Red, and N3 Green instead. This is possible because traveling to the East map isn't required at all in this movie due to not needing the Gold Glove, which is normally required for the final boss.

This dash has a top speed that alternates between 2 frames of 2 px/f and 2 frames of 3 px/f, averaging a top speed of 2.5 px/f. Jumping during a grounded dash will continue Wario's dash into the air, allowing him to cross gaps with dash speed. Grounded dashes have 7 frames of startup where Wario does not accelerate and should be avoided wherever possible. Jumping the frame after initiating a dash allows Wario to skip this long startup but keep the benefits of higher top speed, so this is typically how dashes will be utilized.

Top speed while rolling is 3 px/f, making it one of the fastest movement options in the game. However, unless the optimal path through a level requires travel through a lot of 1 block tall gaps, it's usually better to use other forms of movement because of the long startup, and because of the need to bounce off of a wall to exit the rolling state. Jumping while rolling sets Wario's speed to 0 px/f for one frame, so it's best to minimize the number of jumps performed while rolling.

	"Landing from a dash jump normally immediately sets Wario's speed to 0 px/f and stops him from moving for two frames. However, dash jumps can be canceled at any time by pressing the direction opposite the direction Wario is facing. As mentioned earlier, the moment Wario starts descending in the air his speed drops to 1 px/f, so doing this mid-dash is far from ideal. If a dash jump is canceled the frame before Wario lands, however, he is only airborne for one frame, lands the next, and can immediately start walking on the ground again. This technique avoids the delay incurred by landing from a dash, and is the main movement trick used in this run.

	"Remember how level data is just RAM? The rest of RAM is just level data too, if you really think about it. Using the Pneumo flight, Wario leaves the normal level data and enters RAM. The tile data here is very volatile and hard to predict, but becomes a little more predictable farther in. Wario travels up into a slightly more manageable area of RAM and begins to head to the right. A camera wrap is done and another Pneumo inflation is used to reach a glitched warp tile located at 0x72DB. A dash jump is done right before touching the warp tile to set up for a wall clip later.

	"This room contains the green key and chest in S3. The dash jump from the last room is canceled into climbing the wall which stores the 3 px/f speed value. On this wall, climbing vertically, climbing horizontally, and jumping and regrabbing vertically will all keep this speed value stored, but jumping and regrabbing horizontally will reset it. On the right side of this room, A transformation clip is performed and Wario moves OoB once again.

Traveling a fair distance to the right, a wall is located OoB that has many unpredictable effects when blocks are broken. When some of these blocks are broken, for reasons I don't entirely understand, eventually, 0xCED4 is set to 0x07 and the credits sequence is initiated.
