	"Since the original TAS was recorded by Janus in 2010, a number of glitches were found that meaningful reduce the time it takes to complete the game. Consequently BoFII speedrunning has branched into glitchless and any% categories. Since the 2010 TAS predates those glitches, this submission can be considered a spiritual successor to that video. Notable improvements are:

	"The most significant departures of this TAS from ordinary gameplay are the almost total avoidance of random encounters, and the optimization of boss fights at much lower levels than usually possible. Both of these are achieved through heavy use of RNG manipulation. The RNG function in Breath of Fire II is updated every frame, which allows even very unlikely results to be achieved with only small amounts of waiting. The RNG function is however not affected by very many other things besides time, so we have little ability to improve results beyond simply waiting longer. As a consequence we sometimes take sub-optimal results, when waiting for an optimal result would lose more frames than the optimization would save.

	"The weapon glitch sounds like it should save a much more significant amount of time, given that the early bosses are killed so much faster, but the game itself presents a problem: The dragon form. The dragon form is an AoE attack that seems to do a set 512 damage to every enemy. This is used extensively in both runs as soon as it's acquired, meaning that the later bosses end up not being nearly as big of timesaves in any% as the earlier ones. Any% bosses are still faster, just not on the same level as being a full minute+ faster.

	"The text glitch... The text glitch, or rather the explanation behind it, is one of the biggest reasons for my decision. It is apparently extremely powerful, leading to OoB and unrestricted access to the game world... But this isn't achieved in the run, and the reason for that is because the game is incredibly strict on flags. Nothing can be done out of order, and as a result it only makes one part of a run a bit faster. This is... Well, it's a bit of a shame, really. If OoB were viable, that would greatly change things, and it would be far, far more likely that glitchless would be an acceptable alternate category.

I'm hoping that this game and its glitches are studied further. The OoB is the most obvious choice here, even finding a single early trigger could be all that this category really needs to be able to stand on its own. If there's ever another major change to the any% run, I'd be glad to take another look at this submission, and it could be acceptable even with the known improvements (the dragon statue thing stuck out to me, but it's super early on in a 4 and a half hour TAS that's full of RNG manipulation so it's nothing I would reject over on its own).
