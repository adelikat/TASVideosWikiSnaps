	"The best theoretical strategy would be to maximize our roll values while simultaneously forcing the AI to take the shortest turns possible. So how do we do that? By giving it nowhere to move. We should therefore force the AI on its first turn to blot (i.e., leave a single checker at a point), where we will then hit it. After, we would force the AI to make rolls so abysmal (i.e., rolls whose values on the dice are blocked by white's checkers at the corresponding point) that it will never enter back into the game. The more home points we close (i.e., fill with at least 2 checkers), the more likely the AI will be unable to move, saving some intensive RNG manipulation and therefore lots of time!

	"You're able to move the cursor around after the computer has finished their turn and before you roll the dice. In theory, it would be fastest to move the cursor over to the point where you're planning to move checkers from while waiting for RNG to advance. You'll find if you analyze the input roll for this TAS that I don't always do this optimally, as cursor movements can sometimes change RNG.

	"Q: Why not roll double 6's on turn 1?
	$LF
	"A: Some backgammon rules demand that any doubles rolled on the first roll of the game be discarded so as to not give the player going first an unfair advantage. This backgammon port implements this rule so it is best to roll the highest non-double value of 5,6 instead.
