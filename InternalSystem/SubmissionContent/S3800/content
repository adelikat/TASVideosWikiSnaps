	"Eye Of The Beholder brought this game to my attention when I was submitting a run of Timecop. A few days later an almost complete run was in my hands, just a final battle to do and it would be submitted. Then Omnigamer found a way to start rolling instantly and that forced me to restart the run from scratch. A few days later and an improved run with the new trick were almost done, even the submission text was being written. Then, another time saver was found on stage two. I could have simply written this one on the known improvements section of the submission text, but instead I decided to restart the run once again. In one of those restarts, I decided to take damage to save time, now I’m playing around a little bit more, collecting more items and betting on the Slot Machines. And here it is; a project that I thought would take a week to complete, given the simplicity of the game, proved to be a real challenge. As always, I hope you enjoy!

Congo will roll immediately instead of sliding for a long time and then rolling.

So as long as you keep moving you can start rolling again by high-jumping into a wall; keep pressing against the wall or the opposite direction if you want to go the other way, a higher platform or a low ceiling; press Down again one frame before you enter walking animation.
