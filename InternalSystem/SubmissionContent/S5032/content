	" In the initial version of Red and Green ("v1.0"), it's possible to perform the closed menu Select glitch after exiting the items menu from within battle. In all other versions, Select must be pressed on an item from outside of battle.

	""Select glitch" or "Select glitches" may also refer to individual exploit derived from the Select glitch, such as the dokokashira door glitch.
