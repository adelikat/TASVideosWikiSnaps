	": A very creative movie for an uneventful game. Here the author manages to present the submission notes INSIDE the movie itself, and he does it (apparently) without losing any frames. This is because, in the questions where text needs to be inputted, the author provides the correct answer first, and then quickly inputs the notes while the fanfare plays.

[div class=p 
	"Another important aspect of this movie is that the author manages to skip all the 'simply wait XX seconds' questions by immediately failing them (not waiting). In line with its premise, the game is so easy that it allows you to re-take the failed questions during the 'Redemption' round. Since the only thing to do then is to wait, all of the waiting questions are taking well after the last movie input. Clever.
