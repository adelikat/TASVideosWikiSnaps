	"The Phantasy Star series has enormous nostalgia value for me, and I wanted to try something a little heftier for my 2nd TAS, so here we are. I watched the previous TAS by nfq and was so impressed with the cleverness of the routing. Much of that routing remains unchanged here, but two key changes helped to bring the time under 2 hours.

	"There are no bugs that I know of. Considering the inventory glitches in the later games in the series, I'm surprised. There IS, however, a bug in the Phantasy Star Collection GBA version of Phantasy Star. I read a lot of old forum posts talking about how, at certain character levels, a certain monster would always miss. But after some investigation, I found that the bug is a little more interesting than that. It seems that the variance in damage rolls is broken, and as a result, with the right defense values, you are guaranteed to dodge. I made a
