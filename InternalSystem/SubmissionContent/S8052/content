	"1. Identifying the "Branch" is an important detail on how a movie will be judged. In this case, we can only guess by the techniques used in your playback, that you are performing "warp glitch". This has been brought up by

		"Spikestuff

	". If this is you goal, it lacks the optimization to compete with 
	(__wikiLink|href=/4234M|implicitdisplaytext=4234M)
	". Additionally, 
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/Arc 
		"Arc

	" makes mention that you are also attempting a run that appears to have elements of a "No Major Skips" run. In this case, using the "warp glitch" is forbidden, and cannot be accepted over the existing run of 
	(__wikiLink|href=/4367M|implicitdisplaytext=4367M)
	".

	"2. "Submission Text" is very important for the audience here at TASVideos. It helps to identify details that could pre-answer any questions viewers would have. Please try looking up some other publications to see the "Author's Notes", for an ideaa on how you can incorporate for any future submissions.

	"3. Response, on your part, is very important. There are often times that judgement requires extra details, and answers to questions. In this case, you haven't made an effort (as with your previous submission) to get back to comments and/or questions...utilizing the discussion thread. It is possible; however, unlikely in this case that your movie could receive acceptance. Clarification on such matters could prove helpful and may open up the idea of a new branch, even though it doesn't appear possible in this situation.

	"We certainly don't want to sound discouraging on your efforts, but our sites does have the goal in mind for accepting and publishing the highest quality work that members can offer. Please take in consideration the advice that was given in the discussion thread. I do believe, with enough effort, you are more than capable of finding improvements to any existing runs for Zelda 2.
