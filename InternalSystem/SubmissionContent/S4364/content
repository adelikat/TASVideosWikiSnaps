	"Magician Lord is a side-scrolling platform game developed by ADK (Alpha Denshi Corporation) that was released in 1990.  It was a launch title for both the SNK Neo Geo MVS (arcade) and AES (home) systems.  It was also one of the pack-in games for the Neo Geo AES, after SNK expanded the Neo Geo beyond the rental market--for those who could afford the $600.  I was not one of those people, but I did play this game quite a bit at the arcade.  The hero, Elta, equipped only with a pointy wizard's hat and fancy book-learnin', must battle his way through 8 Stages and defeat Az Atorse, the God of Destruction.  Magician Lord is (in)famous for its difficulty, colorful and detailed graphics, grotesque and imaginative enemies, and excellent music.  But it is perhaps best known in Western markets for its poorly translated cutscenes, accompanied by a weird, echoing voice-over as the evil Gal Agiese taunts Elta.  I always felt this only added to the overall eerie feeling of the game, but the consensus is that it is simply hilarious.

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The most important technique used in this TAS, "Momentum Maintainum" comprises the fundament of all of the other most useful techniques used.  Very simply put, after Elta has gained momentum, pressing Left or Right for 1 Frame every other Frame allows him to maintain his momentum.  This is but one example; Elta's momentum can be maintained with numerous combinations of input.  This technique is used almost continuously throughout this TAS.

	""Levitatum":
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"This technique allows Elta to "levitate" to the left or right, or to hover at his current location, without a surface to stand on.  This is essentially what "Momentum Maintainum" becomes after Elta has walked off of a ledge.  It functions in the same way, with fewer options than with "Momentum Maintainum".  Pressing Left or Right for 1 Frame every other Frame causes Elta to "levitate" to the left or right at his current momentum.  Pressing Down for 1 Frame every other Frame while using "Levitatum" cancels horizontal momentum and allows Elta to hover in place.  If Elta jumps or fires, then "Levitatum" is cancelled.

[div class=p 
	""Elevatum Levitatum":
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"This technique allows Elta to "levitate" upward to the left or right.  When Elta takes damage, he is pushed 17 pixels vertically and 17 pixels horizontally backward.  After taking damage, Elta will remain in the "damage taken" posture until he lands on a surface, or until the invulnerability timer expires.  While Elta is in the "damage taken" posture, not input can be entered.  However, if Elta is standing slightly below the level of a platform when he takes damage, he will be pushed upward and land on the platform on the first Frame on which he bisects it.  When Elta bisects the platform above him, the "damage taken" posture is cancelled, and input can again be entered.  More importantly, Elta's momentum from taking damage can be maintained--both horizontally and vertically--by using the "Levitatum" technique.  This allows Elta to elevate to the left or right at an impressive 4 pixels per Frame: "Elevatum Levitatum"!

	""Walk Through Walls":

[div class=p 
	"This technique allows Elta to pass through a vertical surface.  This is essentially what "Momentum Maintainum" becomes when Elta has reached a wall or other vertical obstacle.  It functions in the same way, with fewer options than with "Momentum Maintainum".  Pressing Left or Right for 1 Frame every other Frame allows Elta to maintain his momentum as he passes through a vertical surface.  This is the most basic example of "Pass Through Stone".

[div class=p 
	""Jump Through Walls":
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"This technique allows Elta to pass through a vertical surface at a particular entry point and trajectory.  If Elta is jumping or falling toward a vertical surface while facing the opposite direction, he will pass into the vertical surface.  If the B button is pressed to jump left or right, and then on the next Frame the joystick is pressed in the opposite direction that Elta is facing for 1 Frame, the jump will continue to move forward in its original direction, but Elta will be facing backward.  This allows Elta to easily jump backward into a vertical surface.  To jump through a vertical surface in close quarters with maximum horizontal momentum, stand at least 1 pixel distant from the surface, press the A button for 1 Frame, delay for 1 Frame, press the joystick toward the surface for 1 Frame, and finally press the joystick away from the surface for 1 Frame.  This will build momentum and turn Elta around before he collides with the surface, allowing him to move within it.  Using the "Jump Through Walls" technique will invariably result in a "Surface Zip" on the first Frame that Elta has entered a sufficient distance within a surface.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	""Surface Zip":
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"This technique allows Elta to "teleport" through a smaller solid surface instantaneously, or to hurtle through any larger size of solid surface at tremendous speed.  When Elta has entered a sufficient distance within a surface, and then either cancels his momentum or changes his Y location, the game will attempt to push Elta out of the surface in the opposite direction that he is facing.  If the surface is fully within the screen, Elta will be "teleported" instantaneously to the opposite end of the surface.  If the surface extends beyond the screen boundary, the game will push Elta to the screen boundary (either X -21 to the left or X -108 to the right) and then scroll the screen at the breakneck speed of 11 pixels per Frame until he exits the surface.  This is theoretically true of both vertical and horizontal surfaces, but great care must be taken when using a "Surface Zip" through a vertical surface, as it will invariably push Elta down to the bottom screen boundary if it is not fully within the screen--killing Elta.  During an extended "Surface Zip", the direction that Elta is moving can be changed by pressing the joystick in the opposite direction that he is facing.  As long as the surface is not fully within the screen, the direction of the "Surface Zip" can be changed as many times as desired until Elta exits the surface.

	""Out & In":
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"This technique allows Elta to bypass the surface he is standing on.  If the surface is a solid block, rather than a thin floor, Elta can also Surface Zip out to the edge of the surface, in addition to bypassing the surface he is standing on.  It requires a corner where a vertical surface and a horizontal surface meet.  Jump toward the vertical surface and turn backward so that Elta will pass through the vertical surface.  The jump should be only far enough to just clear the corner of the horizontal surface.  Allow Elta to fall into the wall, but change the direction he is facing just before he is Zipped out of the surface.  Changing the direction he is facing at the last moment will cause Elta to be Zipped back out of the vertical surface the same way he entered it, but below the level of the horizontal surface from which he jumped, thereby bypassing the "floor".

	""Preemptive Strike":
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"When Elta opens a door, the transition to the Stage's Guardian Area begins.  During this transition, there is 1 Frame during which input can be entered.  The Frame on which to enter input for a "Preemptive Strike" is 1 Frame prior to Elta's Y position being set.  This occurs 4 Frames prior to the screen beginning to fade to black.  Entering any input except Up on this Frame will prevent the Forced Crouch when the next area begins.  Generally, the best option is to press Right or Left or the B button on the "Preemptive Strike" Frame, and then hold Right or Left for 2 Frames after Elta spawns in the Guardian Area, but this is dependent on circumstances.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The Frame on which Elta spawns in a new Stage can also be used for a "Preemptive Strike".  Elta always spawns at a substantially higher Y location than the level of the surface below him, such that he is "dropped" into the Stage.  However, on the "Preemptive Strike" Frame, the game considers Elta to be standing on a surface.  It is generally slower to enter input on this Frame, due to momentum issues, but it is used to great effect on Stage 4.  It is also used before certain Boss battles in order to achieve a higher jump than would normally be possible, for entertainment purposes.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Another opportunity to use the "Preemptive Strike" technique is in Stage 8.  Between each of the Guardian battles, the screen fades to black, similar to the transition to a Guardian Area in other Stages.  Using the "Preemptive Strike" technique in this situation is superior for 2 reasons compared to using it during a Guardian Area transition.  Because a new area is not loaded between Guardian battles, a projectile fired on the "Preemptive Strike" Frame will remain on the screen after the next Guardian battle begins.  Also, opening a door causes Elta to be unable to take any action until the "Preemptive Strike" Frame.  Because Elta is free to move around the area before the transition to the next Guardian battle begins, and because a projectile fired on the "Preemptive Strike" will remain after the transition ends, Elta can place a projectile virtually anywhere on the screen, and so can hit the next Guardian on the first possible Frame.  This is useful not only for the damage, but also for manipulating the AI of certain Guardians.

]div
[div class=p 
	"Many horizontal surfaces in the game can be passed through from underneath, such that Elta can jump through and land on them.  Normally when Elta jumps up through such a surface, he will continue to move upward as per the strength of the jump and will not land on the surface until he has begun to fall back down toward it.  Elta's Dragon Warrior Form is peculiar in that firing his weapon during a jump sets memory address 00104065 to a "falling" status.  By firing his weapon after holding the jump button for the desired number of Frames, Elta will immediately land on any horizontal surface through which he passes, rather than needing to wait until after the jump has passed its peak.  The weapon need only be fired for 1 Frame to set the "falling" status.  Because a stronger jump has a greater rate of elevation, it is best therefore to use the strongest jump possible to jump up through a surface which still allows time to fire the weapon, regardless of the actual elevation needed to successfully make the jump.  This technique conserves horizontal momentum.

	"Instant Light Pillar:
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The vertical location at which the screen locks for Stage 4 Guardian battle can be manipulated by Surface Zipping into the area.  This allows Elta to land a bit lower on the screen than would normally be allowed, and also causes a solid surface to remain at the top of the screen that would normally be scrolled off-screen.  This causes a glitch with the placement of the light pillar that descends after a Guardian has been destroyed.  Normally after a Guardian is destroyed, the screen would center on Elta, the light pillar would descend from the top of the screen, and Elta would begin to ascend only after the pillar has reached his location at the bottom of the screen.  In this case, the game considers Elta to be located within the light pillar on the first Frame that it spawns, allowing him to begin ascending instantaneously, without even needing to wait for the screen to center on him.  This saves 47 Frames.  This also causes the Minions to be Surface Zipped through the "ceiling" at the top of the screen as they are summoned by Warlock.  Not that Warlock has time to summon anything in this TAS...

	"If Elta falls for 10 Frames or more, he will be forced into a crouching posture when he lands.  This forced crouch can be cancelled by pressing any button or direction on the joystick, but doing so requires at least 1 Frame.  Using the Dragon Warrior Form, a forced crouch can be prevented by firing his weapon 4 Frames prior to landing.  This technique cancels all horizontal momentum, but in a situation where Elta lands in front of a door and there is no need for momentum, it is still useful for entering the door on an earlier Frame.

Stage 1 through Stage 7 each consist of an Outer Area, followed by a Guardian Area which must be accessed via a particular door in the Outer Area.  At the end of each Guardian area, Elta must defeat a Guardian (a sort of "Mini-Boss").  After defeating a Guardian, a Boss battle ensues.  Upon destroying a Boss, Elta retrieves one of the 8 books, and the Stage is completed.  At the end of Stage 7, Gal Agiese reincarnates each of the 7 Guardians.  Stage 8 is simply the Guardians on Parade (a sort of "Boss Rush"), wherein each Guardian from the previous Stages must again be defeated in succession.

If Elta loses all of these pink Hit Points, he will be reverted to his normal Form.  Prior to the Final Boss battle, Elta is allowed to take a Form of his choosing (except his normal Form).  For the Final Boss battle, Elta is provided only with Hit Points equal to his normal Form, regardless of the Form that is chosen.  In this case, the Hit Points colored blue represent Elta's overall Hit Points.  If Elta loses all of these blue Hit Points, he loses a Life, and he loses his chosen Form.

Dragon Warrior does 3 Hit Points of damage per projectile.  The range of the weapon is rather limited, but this is certainly Dragon Warrior's only weakness, and a minor one at that.  The weapon can be fired at any of 16 different angles for pinpoint accuracy.  By holding down the A button, 1 projectile will be fired per each 4 Frames, and the direction of fire can be changed without releasing the A button, creating a sort of "flamethrower" effect at a rate of .75 Hit Points of damage per Frame.  However, by pressing the A button for 1 Frame every other Frame, the normal rate of fire can be doubled.  This changes an already powerful Form into a real monster!  But still Dragon Warrior is not satisfied.  While holding the A button, if any direction is pressed on the joystick other than that which is already being held (or that which Elta is already facing), an additional projectile will be immediately fired.  By changing the direction being held every Frame, 1 projectile can be fired each Frame, thereby quadrupling normal damage output to 3 Hit Points of damage per Frame.

While continuing to hold the A button, alternate between pressing the joystick in the initial direction, and any other direction but Down.  Thus, Dragon Warrior can shimmy to the right or left while firing his weapon at optimum rate.  Alternately pressing the initial direction and then Up and the initial direction provides more rapid right or left movement than other input combinations.  Using the proper combination of directional input, Dragon Warrior can move left or right while firing either in the direction he is facing, or in the opposite direction.

After this first projectile has been fired, the joystick can be pressed in a different direction while continuing to hold the A button, and another projectile will be fired on the next Frame.  This second projectile will be fired at a secondary-intermediate angle.  Continuing to hold the A button and pressing the same pattern of directions on alternating frames will fire 1 projectile per Frame while maintaining a specific angle of fire.  This is quite useful, but in many situations, not every projectile fired will hit an enemy, or it is otherwise problematic to fire a projectile on every Frame.  Considering how easily Lag Frames may be generated by firing so many projectiles so rapidly, it is generally best to minimize the number of projectiles fired to only those which are critical (shots in a TAS shouldn't miss anyway, right?).  This creates a problem, in that if the A button is released even for 1 Frame, the angle of fire is reset to one of the original 8 directions, which can cause Elta to miss subsequent shots which could have hit if the A button had not been released, and a secondary-intermediate angle of fire had been maintained throughout.  To maintain just the right angle for just the right Frame while firing minimal projectiles, continue to hold the A button as normal, but instead of alternating the joystick direction on every Frame, do so on every 4th Frame.  If the A button is held for 5 Frames without a direction change, another projectile will fire at the same angle as the previous one.

The A button must remain held until the projectile has fired.  This projectile will fire straight ahead of Elta.  However, on the Frame before the projectile is fired, if any direction is pressed other than that which Elta is facing, the projectile will fire to the right at an intermediate angle between right and up-right (67.5 degrees).  The advantage here is that this angle of shot cannot normally be achieved without first firing a projectile at a primary or intermediate angle.  This would require an additional Frame, plus it would introduce an unnecessary object on the screen, which could cause Lag.

	"Momentum is typically maintained by a 1-Frame jump once per each 4 Frames, alternating between facing right and left with each jump.  Rather than jumping up onto the slightly raised stone floor, Elta instead uses "Levitatum" to continue to move to the right, just below the level of the stone floor's surface (Elta's waggle becomes a wiggle).  After levitating to the right a sufficient distance, Elta fires at the Trilobite, cancelling "Levitatum" and causing him to fall to the right.  Elta lands on the outstretched hand of the Shiva statue.  Why this Shiva statue, and only this Shiva statue, in an inaccessible area, has hands with a solid surface is anyone's guess.  Perhaps it is a remnant of an incomplete, unimplemented section of the area.  Regardless, the statue is the only thing which makes it possible to bypass the upper portion of the area, and so I say thank you, O Auspicious One.

	"Boss Tower of Terror has 96 Hit Points and is worth 10000 points.  Tower of Terror projectiles have 1 Hit Point and are worth 0 points.  Tower of Terror can only be damaged by hitting the center eye.  The center eye has a protective shell which opens and closes periodically so that they eye can fire a projectile; the center eye can only be hit while this shell is open.  Even while it is open, the shape and location of the shell near the center eye, combined with the large size of Dragon Warrior's projectiles, make it difficult to hit the center eye consistently while Elta is standing on the ground.  As such, a jump is used instead, which also allows Elta to move closer to the center eye while he is firing, while maintaining maximum momentum.  Tower of Terror's projectiles can be destroyed, but they can also block Elta's projectiles, preventing them from hitting the center eye.  The Boss's first projectile is destroyed with a shot while Elta is falling from the spawn point.  A 5 Frame jump is used after falling from the spawn point, which keeps Elta's angle of fire just below the path of the Boss's second projectile, allowing uninterrupted fire at optimum rate.  A 6 Frame jump or greater means that some of Elta's projectiles would need to hit the Boss's second projectile.  A 4 Frame jump or less would not allow Elta to remain airborne long enough to fire sufficient projectiles to destroy the Boss, which would mean more Frames of delay waiting to land and fire again.  Nevertheless, a Boss with only 96 Hit Points which can be immediately engaged is a rare treat from this game--just 86 Frames from Elta's spawn to final input.
