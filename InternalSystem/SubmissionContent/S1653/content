				" All the movements in the PAL version were adjusted for lower frame rate when the game was ported, in order to make the PAL version feel as fast as the two NTSC versions. However, they weren't adjusted perfectly due to discrete (integral in this case) mathematical problems. As a result, some movements were made faster (eg. the ROF of the blade weapon is once per 10 frames in the PAL version, while that in the NTSC versions is once per 13 frames), while some were made slower (eg. the walking speed is slightly slower in the PAL version.).

	" The Odd Rule
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"In this game, when you are walking on the ground or jumping forward, your horizontal acceleration is 2. When you release the D-Pad, your horizontal acceleration will be -4 on the ground or -1 in the air, which is decelerating your velocity. If your horizontal velocity is going to be below 0, the game will set it to 0. If your horizontal velocity is going to be over 25, the game will set the accelation to 0 and keep it below 26. Therefore, if your current horizontal velocity is even, the game will keep it 24, while if your current horizontal velocity is odd, the game will finally keep it 25. Thus it's better to keep your horizontal velocity odd when you are moving. This is called "the Odd Rule" by me.
	$LF
]p
[h4 id=Blade/ItemBoost 
	" Blade/Item Boost
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"A trick called "Blade Boost" (also by me) features in this movie. When you are jumping forward with high velocity, pressing the B button on the controller to swing your blade or throw your item (a bomb etc.) will set you to a special status, where your horizontal velocity is boosted by about 90% and it can exceed 25, while your horizonal acceleration is limitted to -2 for a few frames, until the game realizes it isn't good and suddenly drops your horizontal velocity heavily and remove the acceleration limit. This procedure can be repeated as much as you want as long as you are in the air. The faster your weapon is, the shorter the cycle can be, and the higher average speed you can get. The ninja blade is the fastest main weapon in this game, whose ROF is one swing per 13 frames. The chain weapon has different ROFs in each grade, which are 1/26f in the firt grade, 1/21f in the secong grade and 1/16f in the last grade. The shurikens and bombs are both as fast as one throw per 4 frames. Since the higher the speed is when you perform this trick, the larger the 90% boost can be, it is best to follow "the Odd Rule" to get the maximum boost.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"However, this isn't over yet. As soon as you land, your horizonal velocity will always drop down suddenly. Depending on your moving state before landing, the landing velocity varies.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"1) Landing as boosted(still unable to accelerate yet) will halve your velocity.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"2) Landing as not boosted with Left/Right Button pressed will temporarily set your velocity to 0 for one frame, then it restores your velocity to how great it should be with acceleration.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"3) Landing as not boosted without Left/Right Button pressed will decrease your velocity by 1.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Obviously Case 2 should be avoided when moving forward because Case 3 is always better than it. However, Case 1 or Case 3 may result in an even velocity, and in Case 1 the landing velocity may be decelerated too much. Therefore, you may need to wait for several frames before doing Blade Boost or release Left/Right Button before landing to get an optimal landing velocity. Just like in other games that require constantly jumping for a TAS, you have to adjust the length and maximum height of your jumps according to the terrain everywhere, and it gets harder when you are TASing a game like Kage involved in such complicated accelerate mechanism.

So you may see that I was "just hopping there" after I got bombs in Stage 2-2, but I did got boosted there. However I didn't jump much in narrow passages because of the dropping down of the horizontal velocity when landing.
