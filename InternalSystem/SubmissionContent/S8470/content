	"In general, Midas has strictly linear horizontal movement; there is no acceleration whatsoever in the x direction. He does have acceleration in the y direction, but holding jump while in the air does nothing, so the relevant factor is *when* the jumps are made. Each level transition takes the same amount of frames no matter what, making syncing pretty convenient. One thing that is annoying is that every time the level starts, you can press left or right but then if you hold it nothing happens. I don't know why this glitch exists but the only way around it is to wait a frame before making any inputs. If someone can get around this, it would be a 15 frame save or something like that.

I have tried a lot in other levels to achieve this, but usually it just does not work out. perhaps there is possible improvements in other levels by leveraging falling blocks being jump-able. This is also the first level I utilize a fast turnaround when triggering a block to turn into gold from a jump. The game checks your position a frame before and it looks really weird when done optimally. (BTW the jittering is purely cosmetic.)
