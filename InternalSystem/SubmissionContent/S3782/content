However, 8-3 is mainly done by KFCMario with little of my perfection work. KFCMario managed to save 1 frame in the underwater stage of 8-4, and another one in stage 4 (unfortunately it was covered by my 3-frame improvement). The rest of the improvements came from me. KFCMario's demos are very important and provided lots of entertainment suggestions, and I'm much grateful to him.

			"Better place of getting the flower - 21 frames are saved:
		]b
		" One of the things that kept me grinding for a couple of months is that there are so many choice of places to get the flower: one in 1-2, one in 4-1, two in 4-2, and another one in 4-4. Though they all end up pretty much the same time, few of them can actually save 21 frames, and according to our test result, only one - 1-2. And I said with great pleasure instantly: "Alright, problem solved! No more bloody tests needed!" That became one of the major improvements of this run, and did make the run even more entertaining.

		" It's an action that involves extremely strict optimization and pressing down and right at the same frame, allowing to enter the pipe with screen scrolling but without speeding up to 10, by optimizing the x subpixel value to 240 and entering the pipe before landing with speed 1, making it possible to enter the Warp Zone 12 frames earlier.

		" It's a fully optimized run, so nothing needs to be explained about the first two improvements. As for the third one, you can see that I made a turn on the pipe and jumped with speed greater than 24, which was just a regular test, and turned out to be 2 frames faster than KFCMario's demo that used speed 24 and had already saved 1 frame. The last improvement came so easily that even made me feel strange a little bit.

		"1-2:
	]b
	" Since Mario has found a quicker route through the first stage last year, it somehow becomes more meaningful for Luigi to keep his improved old route that differs from Mario, which is why I've chosen the wall passing glitch in this level to be the suggested screenshot.

		"4-1:
	]b
	" There are a little music playing, mostly with the sound of the fireball. The reason why we didn't stamp on the Lakitu and fly to the flagpole like Phil did is that the action requires slowdown, and any little slowdown would probably cause 21 frames of loss in this particular level.

It costs about 3 frames for this performance, very worthwhile for Luigi, but for Mario I suppose there wouldn't be enough time. In the middle part I chose the upper route, and the Bowser was really killed by 3 fireballs, making this level surprisingly different from the Mario run.

	" Various of performances, including music playing and "ghostrun". In the underwater stage I tried so hard and finally managed to kill the first Bloober that Mario couldn't possibly kill. To entertain people when crossing the long tunnel, I even made a poll in Baidu SMB Bar of how the music playing should be done, and some said I could play some Chinese song, some suggested songs like "U.N. Owen was her?", but none of those ideas would work out fine with the castle music, so I had to create my own type of beats that fits (hope you like that).
