	"Finally after starting this TAS over a year ago and restarting it several times, it's finished. The idea to make a "100%" TAS of this game came about after it was found to be faster to forego acquiring the Shoryuken in "any%", since "100%" became a more appropriate antithesis to "any%" at that point than "low%, best ending". As per the 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=judgment message|href=/Forum/Posts/429429)
	" from the "all upgrades" submission, this TAS is intended to obsolete both the 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext="low%, best ending"|href=/1392M)
	" as well as the 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=all upgrades|href=/3096M)
	" runs. As a side note, the rerecord count for this run is completely inaccurate, since it was made from separate projects which were hex edited together.

	"Determining the optimal route for "100%" was the most complicated and time consuming aspect of creating this TAS, as a lot of variables needed to be taken into account: Maverick weaknesses, miniboss weaknesses,  X-hunter weaknesses, on which stages the X-hunters are fought, when they are fought, and how soon mobility upgrades such as charged Speed Burner, Strike Chain, Neon Jumps, and Crystal Hunter are acquired.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"I figured the most efficient way to test all of these things would be to first test how fast each stage and boss could be completed with full upgrades, then find out how much time is lost by not having each upgrade where it can be used to save time. Then after brain storming as many remotely viable routes I could think of, I simply plugged in the amount of time lost for each shortcoming of each route and added them up, in which case the route with the lowest number would be the fastest. Here is a

		"Mobility-Related Weaknesses:
	]b
	" Since this part is the most time consuming to test, I saved it for last, and thankfully most of it ended up not being necessary. Since I was only trying to find out which route is fastest and not necessarily by how much compared to other routes, the only route that needs a complete table with all values filled in is the fastest route (#16). If the time loss of another route surpassed #16 without that route's mobility weaknesses being tested, then it merely means the other route is even slower by comparison than what my data suggests.

	[b 
		"Boss/Miniboss Weakness-Related Weaknesses:
	]b
	" This was the most straight forward part of of the tests. Having the X-hunters' weaknesses when fighting them is somewhat of a double-edged sword: you kill them faster with their weakness, but you generally need to fight them later in the run to have their weakness(which results in time loss from more warping on and off the map between stages).
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"X-hunter Location-Related Weaknesses:
	]b
	" Aside from whether or not you have their weakness when fighting them, there are 2 other factors which determine when and where you want to fight the 3 X-hunters: 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The first is the location of the X-hunter room in each stage(shown in the pink table). Some X-hunter rooms allow you to take a shortcut through the stage and even eliminate door transitions where you lose control of X whereas others force you to take a detour. Crab is the best stage to fight one for several reasons: it takes a shortcut through the stage, the shortcut is underwater where X climbs twice as fast, the door transition leading to the X-hunter room is much faster than every other door transition, and you eliminate the water draining sequence that is in the normal route through the stage. Gator is the second best because it also takes a shortcut through the stage, but unfortunately fighting an X-hunter on Gator requires doing Gator 4th at the earliest because of the X-hunters' warp patterns, and losing the buster upgrade on 2 stages isn't worth it. Also, neon jumps save a little bit of time in getting to the X-hunter rooms in Crab and Stag. I didn't bother testing the Sponge room since it not only takes the longest by far to get to(you have to wait for the elevators going to and from it), and doing Sponge later either forces you to either significantly delay picking up the arm parts or fight Gator without strike chain.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The second is when you fight the X-hunters(shown in the blue tables). The sooner you fight them, the earlier you get them off the map between stages, but if you beat all 3 of them before defeating all 8 Mavericks you get an extra 500 frame cutscene where Dr. Cain tells you he needs more time to reassemble Zero. Because of these two things, the ideal timing for fighting X-hunters would be on stages 3, 4, and 8.

		" Sea Canthler(the giant fish miniboss) has a number of different hitboxes with varying amounts of hp, and you only have to kill a certain number of them to finish him off. How high or low he swims is based off RNG, so you need to manipulate him to swim low so he'll open the bridge earlier. How quickly his swims is based on X's X position. Being to the left of Sea Canthler will cause him to swim slower, and being to the right of him will cause him to swim faster. This is extremely important in getting the off-screen kill on him with spinning wheel, since you have force him to open the bridge at a specific time so your he won't start to swim down before the spinning wheel finishes off his final hitbox.

		" We got completely bodied by bad luck on Violen's first pattern. There really isn't anything you can do to advance RNG in this stage since speed burner does not have any randomly-particles while underwater, so we simply had to delay frames(I think it was around 8 or 10) to get the proper starting pattern from Violen. As far as I could tell, Violen has 5 different possible actions: horizontal ball & chain, vertical ball & chain, jump, shoot, and jump & shoot. I tried doing the fight with the other starting patterns, but I couldn't get any of them to yield a permutation subsequent actions that allowed for the same number of full-screen doppler effects where Violen falls on top of a shot.

Delaying the clearing of that text box also allows you to retain movement before the Wolverine fight, which was already known. Additionally, if you are in Shoryuken animation when Wolverine's hit points finish filling up, the animation will be interrupted but you will retain the animation's invincibility status during the fight. Unlike X1, text boxes don't add lag during explosions, so I just left it up during the Sigma Virus fight. For some reason, this also caused Sigma Virus to be invisible after the fight where he's normally seen flailing around the room.
