	"Fortran is a Mario look-alike with a pale face, red teeth, and odd-looking feet from the Chinese bootleg “Dian Shi Ma Li” or Mario Lottery.
	$LF
	"Fortran was originally part of a dead fad started by an artist at DeviantART named “TheMarioBrother” but has since broken away from Weegee and now has it’s own fad. The fad involves taking a sprite from a pirated game or creepy piece of official artwork, revamping it, giving it a name, and powers. Fortran’s signature catchphrase is “PUSH START TO RICH”, an engrish saying in the game, ! some versions of Dian Shi Ma Li have the phrase “PUSH START TO GET RICH” instead. Fortran is joked about because of his scary appearance.

	": Let me tell you a story. Once, a man walked six hundred miles. Then, he walked six hundred more.He had reached the ocean, and continued walking. He drowned approximately 5 minutes later. His body washed ashore about 10 miles downstream. The moral of the story is that if you shave on Wednesday, don't eat bread on Thursday. Also, walking is dumb.

	": You damn kids and your electronic typewriters, making you lazy rapscallion delinquents.  Now-a-days, you just have to press 'start' or 'A' to rich! Back in my day, we had to walk 6 miles in 10 feet of snow, up hills both ways, if we wanted to rich. We'd get to Johnny's Convenience Store, and only have 3 nickels to spend to rich. Ol' Johnny would come see us, and tell us about his time in the War, and then he'd chase us off with a broom. I tell you, those were the simple times, before electronic typewriters, or that bannana myphone. If we wanted to make a phone call, we had to walk down to the only phone in town, which was usually in use by Maudy. Man, that woman would talk for ages about anything and everything. If you needed the town gossip, she was the one to go to. She knew the whole town's business, down to the last...
