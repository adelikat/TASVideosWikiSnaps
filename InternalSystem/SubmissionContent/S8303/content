	"Despite the longer input length, this is an improvement over the current TAS done by Uroboros and arukAdo by a few minutes in gameplay time from the implementation of various glitches found over the years, alongside optimization of various rooms. Most of the time discrepancy comes from more accurate loading emulation, which extends transitions by a few seconds each.

	"Guns generally have a long cooldown between shots if the shoot button is held down while targeting. This cooldown can be shortened significantly by letting go of target for a frame, which cancels part of the animation and allows guns to be fired at a much higher rate.

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"However, it's possible to avoid this with a method similar to Blood Cutscene Skip. By opening the menu as the camera changes into the cutscene, it's possible to gain control of Jill while the cutscene is playing. Leaving during this state confuses the timer of Richard dying to be set to the length of the cutscene. While this does cause a bit of waiting around, it's still much faster then getting the serum and saves about 2 minutes.

This can be avoided by leaving the room the same frame Plant 42 is killed, which gives you control during the cutscene upon re-entering once you open and close the menu. Killing Plant 42 again then spawns the key, allowing the cutscene to be skipped and saving a few seconds.

		" The PC version of the game has the ability to skip Yawn 2's intro cutscene by firing Acid Round through a wall. From testing, it appears how walls interact with rounds is different on the PSX versions, making this not work. Having this be available would save about 20 seconds, barring routing differences from the extra ammo.

		" A very odd bug exists on the PSP emulated version that changes a door location near Yawn 1's boss room to the entrance to the Garden, skipping the need for the four Emblems. While more then likely an emulation error, having this work on a real console would probably save a minute or two.  (

	": The longer time compared to the previous publication comes down to more accurate emulation leading to longer load times. The gameplay improvements with more refined movement and techniques, the implemented skips found over the period of 12 years, and even killing a few more zombies makes this a much faster run of Jill's campaign. Nice work improving on an old run over a decade old!
