	"I started this run in July 2009 because I was very confident that very much time could be saved off of JXQ's run. He inhaled many enemies on his way and does other stuff which slowed him down greatly. I was afraid to make a new run because a new run could perhaps have been less entertaining. I considered JXQ's run partly as a playaround and left it be until July 2009.

	"This game is very laggy and much time can be saved by lag-reduction by swallowing enemies. The lag counter was a great help in this run. Without it I wouldn't even have attempted doing a new run. I found a lot of new tricks and glitches which motivated me to do this run even more. I left the project alone a couple of times because of luck-manipulation issues or bad lag behavior but in other times the progress was so fast I did several rooms in very few days. I'm very glad I finally made this run... or should I say, I'm glad that I don't have to deal with this game anymore. :)

	"I had to redo some of this level when I found out that I needed 3 HP for Kracko in order to use all three bomb drops. While the initial TAS was pretty optimal, my redone TAS stumbled into a nightmare of random lag. I had saved some frames but lost all of it and was at the end 13 frames behind my old version. I tried a very long time to avoid this by changing RNG and redoing some sections but I couldn't manage it. I then found out that I would only need 2 HP for Kracko since I found a way to use his 3 bomb drops with the activity trick (floating in the room before Kracko disactivates this glitch, so I needed to do the first round by taking damage). I didn't want to go back and implement the unused health point on damage-boosting. Not only did I not know a convenient place for implementing it, I didn't want to re-enter this lag issue and the boost would only save 2 or 3 frames maybe, so I went on.

	"If you inhale an enemy from afar there will be a notably long delay where you can't jump or inhale again. If you swallow your inhaled object or enemy and then inhale something from a close distance (or from below / above) you will have the object inhaled and the delay is skipped! You can instantly spit your star, swallow the object or jump. This is very useful for bosses and also allows for some neat tricks (using all three bomb drops of Kracko or using both stars from Dedede's stamp). The effect of this glitch is canceled if you float or inhale normally.

	"Usually, the more enemies there are onscreen the greater is the lag. So I swallow many enemies in my path. I always tried to track down the most efficient and lag-free way of doing something. For example, in room 6 of level 4 (where there is a large row of blocks) I needed to manipulate the RNG so that there are few falling stars, making for less lag, so I jump and land once (see: Changing RNG). I needed to shoot my fire in the earliest frame each time and I investigated how to gain distance without lagging to much. If I stand still and hold B, the lag count might be 600 after a certain amount of time, if I proceed to the right for 1 frame and stand still it might be 604. If I stand still for 1 frame and then proceed for 1 frame the lag count might be 601, so this is the input that I want to use.
