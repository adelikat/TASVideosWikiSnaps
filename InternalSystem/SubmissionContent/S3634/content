	"Genesis Home Alone 2 completed quickly. I was inspired to do this run after jlun2 ran the putrid NES version with awful graphics and terrible music. So here's one with great graphics and good music.

	"Well, actually, I started making this run a while ago, after I saw paul_t's

		"TAS
	]a
	", but I couldn't manipulate the bubbles in Sewage Pipes so I gave up. When jlun2 submitted his new run, I was reminded of this game. 2 days later, I managed a better level and finished it up, so here it is.

	"This TAS probably only took 3 days of work, due to the shortness of the game. It's a fairly decent one too, except for 1 problem: there is no Screw Attack! What a fatal flaw. The best moment of the entire series is just gone in this game. I feel ashamed for even TASing it. What a terrible game!
