	": Great game and miusic! As for your efforts, there is no doubt that this is a fully optimized movie. You never slow down at anytime. Considering that you are the first to make this, it pretty much solidifies your hold on maintaining the lead. The only thing I can think of, is if a mechanic is found that causes mini-zips or even full duration zips for significant cuts. This game seems to be well written and probably doesn't expose much faults that can be exploited.
