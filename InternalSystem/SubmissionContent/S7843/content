	"Turns out there's a dodgy spot in the bottom wall of the first room that warps Kubo straight to the gem room, skipping the entire game. Perhaps this was just a way for the devs to test the end screen easily but it'd surely make more sense to just start the test run in the gem room or even on the end screen (idk I haven't used NESMaker before). Either way, it's just miraculous this gap in the wall even exists in the first place but also warps straight to the end of the game. Kubo just seems to be the game that keeps on giving.

	"To my frustration, the only spot that seems to exist in the first room is to the bottom right of Kubo, which attentive readers will know is the side Kubo can't diagonally walk to the right OR down so not only is time lost not being able to shave a corner but the glitch I've spent way too much time playing with can't even be included.
