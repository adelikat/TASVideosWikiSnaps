	"DecapAttack is a Genesis platformer.  it features Chuck D. Head as the main protagonist and his mission is to stop Max D. Cap from concurring the world.  What's interesting about this game is it's localization in the west.  the original japanese game was based off of an anime known as "magical hat" or somthing like that, they didnt think american audiences would find a game based on anime to be appealing so they reskinned the game to make it more Halloween themed, as that was hip in the days.

	"Don't let the submission time fool you, this run is a 54 frame improvement to the currently published tas, the reason the time looks slower is because gens (the emulator the previous tas was made on) runs at a flat 60 fps, where bizhawk runs at 59.922 fps, more accurate to the refresh rate on a real genesis.  If this run was played back at 60 fps, the time would actually be 19:34.59, which would be a 0.94 second time save.

	"The first powerup you see is a skull that sits on top of Chuck, when you use your main attack (your face) you can Chuck De Head (this game is full of puns if you havent noticed).  even if the head is on the ground, it can still do damage to enemies, this can be useful in many boss fights.

	"When I convereted the old tas to bizhawk, it almost synced perfectly, the only real difference was having to add one frame at the beginning to 1-1, so TECHNICALLY this run is a 55 frame improvement of that counts as an emulation difference.  because of this, I actually believe that this run could be console verified.  so if anyone wants to take a shot at it, let me know and I'll see if I can get it working on gens again (since gens is easier to console verify with)

I timed each level (from the first non-black frame at the start to the first black frame at the end) in each run to see where the improvements were. Here is the table:

	"You can see that all 54 frames of improvement were within levels and both runs had very similar lag. Upon closer inspection in the improved levels, there is a noticeable improvement in the movement in a few spots, so the time save is valid. No time was lost in other levels either. I also can't find any evidence of new skips or tech since the old publication, so the run is up to date.
