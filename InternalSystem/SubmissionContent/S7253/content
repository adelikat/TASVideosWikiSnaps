	": There were a some errors that cost about 10-20 frames, for example I was able to avoid a few brakes, but resyncing the rest of the level was hard and I was slower in the end. I avoided more cans in one segment too, but that cost me 20 frames instead (due to having to travel more on the barrel). Getting knocked down to pass through a truck kills the pace but I couldn't improve those either. So this movie can't be easily improved by a lot, at least not without proper understanding how everything works. Accepting as a fastest completion branch.
