	"As pointed out 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=in this post|href=/Forum/Posts/501297)
	", there are a number of problems with this run, but I'd like to point out two other major flaw that haven't been brought up in the thread. First: 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Glitchless is not|href=/4002S)
	" an 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=acceptable goal|href=/4381S)
	" for 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Super Mario Bros 1|href=/6540S)
	" submissions. This extends to every possible version of SMB1: Lost Levels, VS, ROM hacks, All Night Nippon, 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=you get the idea|href=/HomePages/Samsara/SMB1)
	". As you can see from the judgement notes on the listed glitchless submissions, the glitches in SMB1 do not drastically change the gameplay enough to warrant separate publications. I don't see us ever accepting a glitchless SMB1 submission, even one that's as highly optimized as one of our published runs.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Second, and along the same lines: I don't consider VS SMB1 to be different enough from SMB1/Lost Levels to warrant publication when we already have both of them published. 
	[a href=https://www.mariowiki.com/VS._Super_Mario_Bros.#Detailed_set_of_level_differences rel=noopener external nofollow 
		"This is the full set of differences between SMB1 and VS
	]a
	", and most of these changes don't really mean much in the long run. Over half of them aren't even seen in the TAS because of the warps, and whatever IS seen is already in our 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=warpless SMB1|href=/3728M)
	" and 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Lost Levels|href=/3456M)
	" publications. Any further level layout changes are trivial to the point where they're unnoticeable to casual viewers, or even people like myself who are more intimately familiar with the games.

[div class=p 
	"If I had to give a recommendation that isn't "don't TAS SMB1", it would be to spend more time experimenting with each level. You want to be as fast as possible in every single stage. Compare frame counts between your run and other runs as you go so you're absolutely sure you're never losing time, and go through each stage several times trying new things in order to make absolutely sure that you're using the fastest strategies. Good TASes take time, some published runs have been known to take upwards of 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=years|href=/3226M)
	" to make and most tend to be done over the course of weeks or even months. Take your time, especially for SMB1, which I'd argue has one of the highest barriers to entry for getting a run on the site. You're going to have to work extremely hard to get an SMB1 run published.

[div class=p 
	"Alternately, don't TAS SMB1. Hone your skills on other games before tackling it again. SMB1 looks simple, but it's surprisingly complex, and a lot has to be accounted for over the course of a run. It's not new TASer friendly. It leads to a lot of false senses of security and a lot of suboptimal, rejected submissions and a lot of people with promise being turned away from the scene because, well... Second time I'm linking this, but 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=we've seen so many SMB1 submissions. So, so many of them.|href=/HomePages/Samsara/SMB1)
	" It tends to make us a little

	"Some people take their submissions getting rejected personally, and I want to make it clear that the community is always judging the submission itself, not the TASer.
