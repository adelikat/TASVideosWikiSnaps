	"The primary technique to go fast in this game is damage boosting. You get boosted opposite the direction you are facing when you are in the air. The boost is very large, so you if you are near the peak of a jump you get boosted quite far. About half way through the game you get a double jump, which lets you stay airborne at boosted speed for even longer. There are also speed boosting items in some levels which contribute to some of the skips.

	"This game has 3 difficulty levels. The only difference between them is starting health. I left it on normal difficulty to get a few more damage boosts compared to hard. I don't think easy mode offers any additional advantage in terms of damage boosts.

	": There is a big difference between this TAS and the WR run. It doesn't appear to be heavily ran, but it does provide a bench mark for comparison. This TAS surely blows it away. One of the techniques caught my eye early on and it was interesting to keep me watching throughout the run. That trick was the damage boost. In this game, it seems that it is one of the most useful ones to exploit over and over. Additionally, I like the idea of using "Normal", as it provides more of an opportunity to perform the damage boot.
