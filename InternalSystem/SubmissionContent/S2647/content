	"I started this run about a week ago, and now it's done. This TAS will look like it doesn't use running on air enough, but the strategies are the best possible without taking damage. If you jump 8 times in a row, you get a higher jump. This is used a lot to save time. Each level has four parts, except the 6th. The first three parts in the level are platforming, and then the last is facing Bugs Bunny and trying to steal his treasure while avoiding his projectiles. The last level has 5 platforming parts and a final boss fight.
