	"Daffy Duck - Fowl Play is a nice little platformer for the GBC. Your mission is to blow the crap out of Bugs Bunny with dynamite, while he is flying in an UFO. The time limit in this game is the % meter at the top, sort of like how much life you have left. If you reach 0%, you die.

	"I started this run about a week ago, and now it's done. This TAS will look like it doesn't use running on air enough, but the strategies are the best possible without taking damage. If you jump 8 times in a row, you get a higher jump. This is used a lot to save time. Each level has four parts, except the 6th. The first three parts in the level are platforming, and then the last is facing Bugs Bunny and trying to steal his treasure while avoiding his projectiles. The last level has 5 platforming parts and a final boss fight.

I also had to jump that high after the scorpion to avoid eating the pizza. It might look sloppy but it is the fastest way. When I am falling down the pit thing, I have to land on 3 of the sticking out platforms. I do this because if I make one huge jump, when I land there is a really long landing animation. So it is obviously faster to avoid this. Then I stop to avoid the fire.
