Still, once they get there, Jed is missing, and his animatronics have gone haywire. They find M.F.M. CEO Winslow Stanton and his assistant Marcy, who inform them Jed is responsible for sabotaging M.F.M. and has stolen not only some expensive animatronics but also an ample supply of Mubber (a special compound used to make animatronics into life-like special effects monsters). Scooby and the gang thus take it upon themselves to track down Jed and recover the stolen items.

Normally the game prevents you from sliding again as, at the end of a sliding state, the animation of Scooby getting up has a lot of end lag. In order to prevent the end lag of the sliding state, Scooby must have another Costume in the inventory to switch to. Switching to the other costume will cancel the end lag state. By switching I can switch back to normal Scooby and continue sliding as long as there is enough room to navigate around. This trick is used if there is a long stretch of ground without enemies or pits.

Scooby doesn't have these costumes right off, so sliding is out of the question completely until there is at least 1 OR 2 costumes in the inventory to swap too momentarily.
