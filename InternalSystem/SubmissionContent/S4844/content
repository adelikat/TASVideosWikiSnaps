	"This was a tough decision to make. As an entertainment-based run, it does not qualify for Vault, as Vault only allows fastest any%/100% completion times. So it needs to be deemed entertaining enough to make it to Moons, and to be frank, the game itself isn't that entertaining. I spent yesterday asking for opinions (shoutouts to IRC for not getting sick of it) and the majority consensus was that it's just too repetitive of a game. The recent thread/voter feedback (5 yes, 3 meh, 3 no, 59%) is reflecting this as well.

	"DwainiumB, you did a fantastic job on the run itself! I took some time to understand the game better and found it impressive how much you were able to manipulate without losing too much time. The move variety was nice as well. It is a fast run, there's no doubt about that... but with the goal choice being entertainment, that means it could still be quite a bit faster. The game would have a place in the Vault for sure, should you choose to redo the run. Regardless of that, I'm looking forward to your next project!

[div class=p 
	"Audience feedback was mixed-to-poor. The run is technically sound. However, rejecting due to goal choice (entertainment over speed) and game choice (not entertaining enough for Moons).
