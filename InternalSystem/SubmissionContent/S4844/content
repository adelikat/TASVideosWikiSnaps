	"The Story:
	$LF
	"It's been three years since D-Mob chased you out of the New York fight circuit and you swore you'd never go back. Now your 
	$LF
	"pal Manny is in trouble and he needs you to bail him out. The plan is simple: get in, win a few fights, pay off his debt, get 
	$LF
	"out. No problem.
	$LF
	"Well, it turns out that things aren't as easy as they appear. Once in the scene, your past comes back to haunt you. Soon 
	$LF
	"you're over your head and your only chance to get your life back together is to settle a score that has gone too long 
	$LF
	"unpaid.

	"Marines for striking a superior officer, Briggs lost himself in the New York fight scene as a way of forgetting his
	$LF
	"past. Your basic street fighter, Briggs uses a mixture of martial arts and brawling. He excels at power slams and

	"Tricks
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I manipulate the RNG in some stages to get a 'hard' grapple on the opponent early on in the match.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"As the rounds progress and the CPU fighting style changes, some opponents do not allow you to attack on the first frame, so 
	$LF
	"you have to for a few frames before they can be attacked.(This can be anywhere between 1 and 15 frames.)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I manipulate opponents so they are not able to counter my attacks.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I activate 'BLAZING' !!' while their health bar is near or it has just entered the 'DANGER' zone, this is to stop/reduce the 
	$LF
	"chance of opponents  reversing my grapples.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"tl:dr Manipulate RNG so my 'Hero' doesn't receive any damage and he is able to win every single round.
	$LF

[p 
	"Tag Team Fights
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The reason why 1 character used in Tag Team instead of 2 is because there is a set timer on how long 2 players can stay in the ring for and it switches the characters around so you'll be facing the opponent who has a full health bar, rather than the one in the ring. 
	$LF
	"This affects the score at the of the round as your teammate may receive damage.

	"This was a tough decision to make. As an entertainment-based run, it does not qualify for Vault, as Vault only allows fastest any%/100% completion times. So it needs to be deemed entertaining enough to make it to Moons, and to be frank, the game itself isn't that entertaining. I spent yesterday asking for opinions (shoutouts to IRC for not getting sick of it) and the majority consensus was that it's just too repetitive of a game. The recent thread/voter feedback (5 yes, 3 meh, 3 no, 59%) is reflecting this as well.
	$LF

[p 
	"DwainiumB, you did a fantastic job on the run itself! I took some time to understand the game better and found it impressive how much you were able to manipulate without losing too much time. The move variety was nice as well. It is a fast run, there's no doubt about that... but with the goal choice being entertainment, that means it could still be quite a bit faster. The game would have a place in the Vault for sure, should you choose to redo the run. Regardless of that, I'm looking forward to your next project!
	$LF

[p 
	"Audience feedback was mixed-to-poor. The run is technically sound. However, rejecting due to goal choice (entertainment over speed) and game choice (not entertaining enough for Moons).
