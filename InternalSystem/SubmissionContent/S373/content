	"Super Mario All Stars is a collection of the Nes games Super Mario Bros 1, 2, and 3, and the japanese version of Super Mario 2, dubbed "The lost levels" all with updated graphics.

	"I created this movie with snes9x, and it took me about 2 hours to make, often repeating jumps and such, testing whether, for example, jumping over a pipe with a pirahna plant in it was faster than jumping on the edge of the pipe and jumping over. I finished this game in 5:14 seconds from title to when I hit the axe on the final level, taking no hits whatsoever and no powerups. Most of my information came from the video of the nes version by Michael Fried, but the rest came from trial and error. Although he managed to abuse a few bugs in his version, most of them have been fixed in All Stars, so I had to find other means of completing it quicker. Lastly, I managed to beat my last recording by about 45 seconds. I hope you enjoy/ed this movie.
