	"It's a bit of a buggy game. You can't complete a level till it's loaded all the way, or else you have to reset. In most of the levels I'm capped by this. Also, if you hit a red block before the level is fully loaded, it breaks the functionality of all the blocks and doesn't allow completion either. The last level is optimised for earliest final input. The game comments mention something about right clicking. I think it does something, but I can't really tell, and I don't think it could save time.
