	"This fmv is for Mike Tyson's punch-out (not Mr. Dream's Punch-Out, it won't
	$LF
	"work. or should I say, Mac's gonna get his butt kicked). It uses the
	$LF
	"infamous 007 code to get to Tyson, since it's that fight that I wanted to
	$LF
	"make. Basically, it is not really a TIME attack, but it would rather be
	$LF
	"called "Mike Tyson getting the @$$-whoopin of a lifetime". Not once does Mac
	$LF
	"get hit by Tyson (although he must block some of Mike's blows when the
	$LF
	"lightning-quick jabs start flying on second round, and on that 2:30 mark
	$LF
	"when Mike thinks he's Piston Honda or something).

	$LF
	"intending to refuse your submission, but the movie was
	$LF
	"interesting enough to keep me watching it all.
