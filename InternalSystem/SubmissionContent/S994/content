	"This movie was very very time consuming to make. I never thought that 20 minutes of game play would take so long to perfect. I tried as hard as I could. As I went through the game I took the time to figure out exactly how much time I saved for each level.

[p 
	"1-3: -08
	(__wikiLink|-0.133s)
	": My most disappointing time save. I tried using toad, but in the dungeon area you need luigi to make the far jumps. I was able to save in some very minor areas.
	$LF

[p 
	"2-1: -339
	(__wikiLink|-5.560s)
	": The strategy was pretty much the same as Guanobowl. At the beginning I didn't slow down like he did, and I overhauled on the sand area. I think most of the time I saved was from using enemies better. When I got to the Super Star I paused only one time.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"2-2: -90
	(__wikiLink|-1.500s)
	": I once again saved a lot of time in the sand area.   I also tried defeating Ostro from under the platform, but seems impossible. This game is very good about keeping solid blocks solid. I optimized the super jump, Guanobowl wasted a few frames jumping too  high and too far.
	$LF

[p 
	"2-3: -221
	(__wikiLink|-3.683s)
	": Same as 2-1 and 2-2. While digging for the key I 
	$LF
	"dug up one less sanf block and on the way back up I saved time twice 
	$LF
	"with one jump, I started one layer higher, and in turn was able to jump out of the sand area for the door with more speed.
	$LF

[p 
	"3-1: -497
	(__wikiLink|-8.283s)
	": I used Toad instead of Luigi. I was very happy when I discovered that I could do that. Almost all of the time was saved just simply because Toad is faster then Luigi.
	$LF

[p 
	"3-2: -50
	(__wikiLink|-0.830s)
	": Then came the disappointment. Toadstool is soooooo 
	$LF
	"slow, but she is the only character that can get through the shrtcut 
	$LF
	"here. I saved my time from Ostro, I got an egg instead of a fireball 
	$LF
	"and used that instead to pick her off.

[p 
	"3-3: -618
	(__wikiLink|10.300s)
	": This one was a huge time saver. The biggest one was using the ladder right before the door holding the key, shooting up about 3 screens instead of jumping on each platform. I also saved time on Mouser. I had a lot of trouble with this one. When I finally figured out what I was doing wrong I ended up saving 30 frames over Guanobowls' run.

[p 
	"4-2: -187
	(__wikiLink|-3.117s)
	": I picked up a cherry earlier in the level to avoid having to stop later on to pick one up. After reaching the whales I was able to pick up the first enemy, allowing me to travel much faster.

	"4-3: -165
	(__wikiLink|-2.750s)
	": Most of my time was saved from the boss battle. I

	"5-3: -1015
	(__wikiLink|16.917s)
	": This was my biggest time saver in the game. I  delayed my foreward movement for about half a second, so that when bombing the blocks to get into the door, I didn't have to go back to 
	$LF
	"get another bomb and wait for that bomb. This strategy worked by only 
	$LF
	"one frame. Took me so many tries to get it. I saved more time by 
	$LF
	"picking up bombs. Even though they explode, it was worth picking them 
	$LF
	"up. I didn't have to power jump when the two bombs come flying at you 
	$LF
	"about midway up the underground area. After submitting this movie I 
	$LF
	"discovered a huge time saver that I had missed. I was able to hit

[p 
	"All in all, after redoing all that I did I ended up saving 4239 frames or about 71 seconds from the previous run. I think I will go as far as saying that I am proud of that number.
