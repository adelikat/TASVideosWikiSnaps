	"The run is performed on the Sinclair ZX Spectrum +2A. Styx does not attempt to control its framerate, it simply processes the game as quickly as it can at all times. 128K versions of the Spectrum run their Z80 processor at a slightly higher clock rate, and the +2A and +3 also have some improvements in memory access speeds. As a result, the game runs fastest on these models. The +3 is a disk-based system, and Styx has never been officially released on disk, so the run uses the +2A and loads the game from tape.

	"After doing two games from Matthew Smith, I thought I'd complete the set and do his first published game. It's a very short and trivial game, taking less than 15 seconds to complete a loop, and the game doesn't get harder on subsequent loops. Enemies move randomly, but rarely actually get in the way, and didn't need much manipulation.
