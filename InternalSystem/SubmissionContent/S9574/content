		"The Impossible Game
	]em
	" is a 2009 platforming game developed by Fluke Games. It released for many systems, including Xbox 360, PS3, PSP, PCs, and mobile devices. It's well known, as this game served as Geometry Dash's main inspiration. A Flash demo, 
	[em 
		"The Impossible Game Lite
	]em
	", was released in 2010. I have chosen to TAS this as I could not get the Linux version working in libTAS at the moment. This demo only has one level. ... Scratch that, less than one level. After climbing up a block staircase, the game pauses and a pop-up appears, prompting the player to buy the full game.
