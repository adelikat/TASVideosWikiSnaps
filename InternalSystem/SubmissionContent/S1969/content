	"Deign and Nitrodon told me that Zugzwang, who is/was making a speedrun at SDA, had posted a movie of the first three levels. He used a different strategy on level 3-2, and if TASed, his strategy was 7 frames faster than the currently published TAS. The improvement comes from using an egg to ride to the other side of the level instead of walking around it. I had obviously already tried this in previous versions, but the way I did it didn't work out.

[p 
	"Luckily, this new version isn't entirely due to this improvement... I also found another improvement myself! In level 2-5, there was a small wait before getting the heart in the lower left corner. This wait is now avoided by shooting the enemy nearby. I however had only 1 shot left to complete the rest of the level, so I lost a few at the end for manipulating enemy movement, but it was still 9 frames faster!
	$LF

[p 
	"9 frames from my improvement, and 7 from Zugzwang's improvement makes 16 frames in total. However, due to unfortunate lag, that couldn't be avoided, I lost 2 frames in other levels. In the end, this movie is 14 frames faster than the previous version!

	"You only have to press a direction in Lolo every 8 frames for Lolo to move. This allows a lot of freedom to put in other input, without affecting the Lolo TAS. This particular movie file will not only complete Adventures of Lolo (U).nes, but it will also complete Defenders of the Crown (U).nes!
	$LF

[p 
	"I picked Defenders of the Crown because I like the game, and there is no TAS for it was or will be made. I know the game if a poor TAS choice, but I think the few people who did play the game will enjoy it. For the others it might be a nice thing to know that this movie file also completes another game (without of course slowing down the Adventures of Lolo TAS in any way).
	$LF

[p 
	"The Defenders of the Crown TAS is completed (for as far as I know) in the least turns possible. It isn't possible to complete it in this few turns in normal playing, due to the luck manipulation involved. The Defenders of the Crown TAS obviously isn't perfect, since Adventures of Lolo was obviously sometimes in the way (especially when I had shots there I couldn't fire yet). I am also not sure about the catapulting and if I really needed to shoot that much there (probably not). In any case, besides those small things, it's a very fast completion of the game, enjoy!
	$LF

[p 
	"Also note that this isn't a dual TAS of anything and isn't supposed to look good together. The games are completely different, and this was only done to add a funny easter egg. Maybe it even shows that dual TASes of completely different games with different lengths are pointless :).
