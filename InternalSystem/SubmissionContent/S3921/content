	"A while ago, I was watching through the gruefood delight section of TASVideos, and when I came across the Color a Dinosaur videos, I was absolutely disgusted at how inartistic they were. Though they were full of color, they were not full of soul. That's where I came in, to truly show them how it's done.

	"Now, if you're reading this after watching my submission, you may be wondering why I chose what I did. Well, you see, I wanted to represent something in my TAS. The lack of color symbolizes how it blends in to the background, meaning no-one will ever pay attention to him. However, it does show the mental strength of this dinosaur, because he knows he needn't change a thing about himself in order to be perfect. Notice how even without colors, he is happy, for he is truly blessed with divine grace. I also wanted viewers to see an even deeper meaning, if they focus and think hard enough about it. I won't spoil what that is, but I'm sure after watching it several times it will be clear to you.

	"If you 'truly' understand fine art, this will make you weep tears of blood. If you don't, you will not enjoy this. I suggest doing at least a bachelor's in art and at least a diploma in art history.

	"Potentially, I could make it have more soul by making the dinosaur frown at the start, because he doesn't want to change, and then have him smile when I finish because I realize his perfection, but the RNG is far too crazy for me to understand.
