	"There's 64 stages in this game, with 8 of them vertical platforming. Due to finding new tricks while TASing, I had to redo past stages numerous times. Despite only 4 stages requiring an obstacle that utilizes RNG, lag occasionally appears/disappears whenever I tried to splice stages back in. To aid in my efforts, I used the in game frame counter to make sure syncing back the lag frames were indeed lag frames and not actual delays. I also used the timer to compare each stage, so that improvements would be independent of the current movie's frame counter.

	"Here's the google sheets for the game stages. Column G (Fade Frame) is the only column that uses the movie's frame counter, while the rest are all in game time. Since I focused on real time first, the oranged-out boxes indicate the stages I wasted in game time to save real time. I'm not exactly sure how to denote how many frames the stage took, since right before the stage loads, it actually accepts input for 1 frame. This allows you to jump, move, and open the creatures interface before the stage even loads completely. So instead, I will use column E's frame counter (the last frame before the stage ends and starts lagging) as the time it took to beat the stage.

It's a bit odd, and I'm not able to replicate the exact frame transitions in every stage, but I do know that being in the air while reaching the camp is faster, and if you landed, every 4 frames based on 0x0190, you would slide to the tent rather than slowly walk back. I'm not sure how far you slide exactly works, so it ends up being trail and error of jumping and delaying at different times. This applies to every stage that starts with the tent.
