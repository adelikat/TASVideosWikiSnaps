	$LF
]h1
[p 
	"Alien Carnage (a.k.a. Halloween Harry) is platformer shooter, with hero Harry facing hordes of space aliens and humans turned into zombies while trying to get Earth rid of alien infestation.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Harry can't jump. Instead, he has jetpack enabling him to fly (which however uses fuel, and gets unreliable when fuel is low).
	$LF
]p
[h1 
	"Game mechanics
	$LF
]h1
[p 
	"Well, the game mechanics are defintiely unfriendly for TASing (and would be even worse for speedrunning).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The biggest PITA is pixel alignment. When anything involving flying is involved, having the correct pixel alignment can mean gain or loss of several frames... Per each flying segment. Unfortunately, there are no good ways of manipulating this in most cases (most methods cost more time than what they would save). 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The problems don't end there. Harry runs 16 pixels per in-game frame, and controls are only polled once per in-game frame. Thus, position of takeoff is really inprecise. Real nasty when one needs to squeeze into narrow gap.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Also, wall collision detection is just plain weird. There's zone near wall you can't enter from left or right, but can enter from bottom or top. Worse yet, game interprets sloped tiles as fully solid for purposes of checking for collisions with jetpack enaged, which really causes overflying in mission 4 (where there are lots of sloped tiles adjacent to ledge.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Ceilings are also weird. You can run in and into two-block tall passage. But you can't fly there, nor enter via flying. If you try to fly there, you get stuck until you disconnect the jetpack. If you try to enter via flying, Harry just won't fit.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"You can't fly against ceiling sloping down. If you try, Harry just won't move.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There's helpful physics weirdness as well: When wall or ceilling blocks flying motion, Harry still accelerates (even without moving), up to maximum speed (10 frames horizontally/vertically per ingame frame).
