	"In most pinball games, you control the flippers and the ball goes wherever the heck it wants to go. As the ball here is sentient, Sonic's direction can be influenced mid-air. This makes it easy to get the shot I need without taking too much time to set it up.

	"As an example, you would normally go right over the final boss's head, because of the setup. If you hold down as you shoot up above him, you hit him easily.

	"This is a short little game (four levels), where you have to collect all the emeralds in the level before reaching the boss, which is usually dispached quickly by jumping inside it.

	"I fail the bonus stages, since, "it's really the biggest waste of time ever." - Cherry. In spite of that, it's rather difficult to actually fail them quickly, considering the undersides of the flippers don't exist.

	"In general, Sonic goes right where I need him to go, with one major exception in the last level, where I have to get him to the other flipper to get where I need to be going. There's little waiting to be done in-game, the most being the first emerald chamber in level 3.

	": Okay, I suppose I see your point. The more I think about it, the more it does seem to fall into the trap of just correcting mistakes and not trying to look perfect and/or impressive. Therefore, I'll save you the trouble of rejecting it and cancel it myself. I may decide to redo this, but if I do it'll be a long ways off.
