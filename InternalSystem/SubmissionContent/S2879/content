	"In the first world, the dash continuous can be a bit boring. But since the second world, Crash takes the long dash. This enables a fast and enjoyable game.

	" I apologise that this took so long to judge but I took some extra time to investigate the optimisation concerns and have decided that they are not large enough to warrant a rejection. On the whole the quality is decent. Entertainment-wise several users greatly enjoyed this. I found it to be close to borderline as the first world was dull as were the surfing and space based levels. However, I did enjoy the later Egyptian levels and I also particularly enjoyed the boss fight against Fake Crash. Audience response tips this one. Accepting for publication.
