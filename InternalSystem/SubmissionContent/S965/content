	"This game is the sequal to "Kid Niki", so this game could probably be called "Kid Niki 2", but it never came out in the US. It's a very simple and straightforward game, but quite fun non the less. You are a ninja equipped with a shuriken, and you smack down weaker ninjas on your way to the boss on each level. Then you beat the boss and proceed to the next level. There are no special attacks available in the run (but there are some in the game that are not acquired in this run), so in this run it's just you and your shuriken.

	"This is a 919 frames (15,32 seconds) improvement over the currently published run: http://bisqwit.iki.fi/nesvideos/50M.html. A lot of time was saved on boss fights, but genereal movement has been improved as well. I also kill a lot more enemies than in the current run, thus getting a higher score.

	"It was fun making this movie, I actually made most of this several weeks ago, and then found out that I haven't finished this movie recently, so I decided to finish it... It's in my opinion not such as great improvement timewise, but in terms of playing precision and entertainment value, this run is very good. It's a sad thing this game never reached USA. Anyway, Enjoy the movie.
