	" Good god this game is broken. Only one new tech is used as compared to the original K.O.L.M., pause abuse; it is used at the beginning of the run to skip mandatory dialogue and take control of ROB earlier than otherwise possible, and to be able to get through sun areas where you would otherwise instantly die. Decreased time over RTA comes from superior execution, such as not being distracted/confused by the visual noise from the pause spam, pause spamming as little and as briefly as necessary, etc. This took me roughly two hours to record, discounting the time I spent pissing around or responding to Discord messages and whatnot.
