	"Hello Bisqwit and all you others on this site!
	$LF
	"This is my latest submission for you: a Rockin' Kats run
	$LF
	"which is faster then the previous run. My run is 21:43 minutes long and it's completed with 78208 frames.
	$LF

[p 
	"It is 1 minute and 56 seconds faster than Teowind's run.
	$LF

	"My aim is to be fast as possible and to do stuff that you don't expect.

	"For an example, I use a glitch on the first level on the train.
	$LF
	"Normally you are supposed to wait for the train to leave before
	$LF
	"you can start to play again, but I don't stop, thanks to my
	$LF
	"glitch that I use at the end of the train!

	"I play with the punchgun only, meaning no special weapons.

	"When I start to the game I play with channel 4 first then I go
	$LF
	"backwards (It's almost backwards because you can't play
	$LF
	"channel 5 until the other channels are completed.
	$LF
	"Why I play this way is for two reasons:

		" I think it's better to begin with the hardest level first, (which is channel4) then go backwards

	"Willy, the Rockin' Kat, (our hero!) and his girl, Jill, are the cutest couple 
	$LF
	"to jazz around New York in years!  Unfortunately, while Willy was doing a 
	$LF
	"solo, the local crime boss, Mugsy, caught a peep at Jill and knew he had to 
	$LF
	"have her!  In his underhand way, he sent his loyal pack of thugs to kidnap 
	$LF
	"poor Jill.  It was cat-burglary, all right. By the time Willy finds out, his 
	$LF
	"girl has been hidden away deep in the city. The fur starts to fly when he 
	$LF
	"takes on the crime world to save her. Willy must find his way though the hot 
	$LF
	"streets, a not-so-funny amusement park, and the wild west (among other 
	$LF
	"dangerous adventures!) with only his punch gun at his side. You'd better go 
	$LF
	"along to help out!
