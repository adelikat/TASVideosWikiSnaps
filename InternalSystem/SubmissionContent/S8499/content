	"Bejeweled 3 is a game where you have to match gems of the same color in sets of 3 or more to earn points and clear levels. Matching 4 or more gems together at once causes special gems to spawn which can potentially clear lots of gems around them when matched.

Here are the quests I worked with:

				" 
				[b 
					"Stratamax
				]b
				": Clear a minimum amount of gems with a limited amount of moves. You run out of moves pretty quickly in the higher tier quests with only 3-gem matches, so at least some specials are probably required. Getting as many cascades/double matches as possible is also super beneficial.
				$LF

				[b 
					"Balance
				]b
				": Clear a minimum amount of red and blue gems while not matching too many of one type at once. Just like Stratamax, specials & extra combos are pretty beneficial here.

			[li 
				" 
				[b 
					"Buried Treasure/Sandstorm

Hopefully that's something that works fine, otherwise I'd unfortunately probably have to remake the whole project due to Bejeweled 3's randomness.

	": This is one of those unfortunate cases where the game is actually misleading in how it defines completion. The game has a percentage value for indicating the amount of stages completed for this mode, which apparently may be considered as a sort of indicator for full completion. However, completing 50% of the stages results just in revealing the fifth relic, the throne, which isn't much different from revealing any of the other four relics. On the other hand, completing all stages results in the game giving you a congratulatory message and marking the Quest mode a completed. As such, I can't consider 50% as a form of fastest completion, as we need the game mode to be played in its entirety.

	"Beating all stages would include the contents of this movie, which is another reason why this movie is considered incomplete. Still, I see that RNG plays a huge factor in optimization and routing for this category. For this reason, I think this goal still has some merit on its own, so I'm allowing it for Playground.
