	"I started this a few weeks ago. This is a really obscure game, and that is why I love it. At the start of every screen I jump to gain maximum speed as quick as possible. You may notice how I sometimes seem like I am avoiding lollipops, this is because sometimes when I land I get a landing lag and get 15 speed instead of 16 (max running speed). Of course I made it so I only get the lag when it is completely unavoidable (happens once).
