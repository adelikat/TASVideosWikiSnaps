	"13 years later, it's finally here! My biggest contribution to this run is simply inspiring xipo to pick it up, though input-wise I contributed the post-boss playarounds, part of the routing improvements in 2-2, and the application of the quick pause glitch in 7-2 (though xipo improved that improvement, and discovered the glitch in the first place). Note that because the published run is 13 years old, it uses 60FPS as the framerate. The actual time of the published run is
