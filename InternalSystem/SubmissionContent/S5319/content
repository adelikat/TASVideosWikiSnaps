	"Technically, there are three different versions of this game. Sierra originally released this EGA game in 1989 under the name "Hero's Quest". It was one of the first graphical text adventure RPG's and won Computer Gaming World's Adventure Game of the Year award in 1990. Shortly after their initial release, Sierra had to rename the game to "Quest for Glory" because of copyright issues, and re-released it with a number of bug fixes and small enhancements. In 1992, Sierra released a VGA version which ditched text input for their new point-and-click interface.

However, in Hero's Quest 1.0.0, the password works regardless of when you use it, making the cave path available right from the beginning of the game. This is used to skip the majority of the game and go straight to the brigand's hideout.

On RTA's, High-Speed Hero is almost never used, as it is too easy to overshoot your destination. However, in a frame-precise TAS, High-Speed Hero is an amazing tool to be harnessed.

	"The absolutely slowest part of the game was the text entry. The game polls the keyboard buffer once every 7 frames (0.1 seconds). That means it can take an excruciatingly long time (in TAS time) to type out anything, and it is vital that the least possible typing be done. This means that having the hero run, instead of walk, only is worth it if you can save more than the 28 frames it takes to type in "RUN<enter>". And seeing as the hero can walk across the screen in less than 12 frames (in High-Speed mode), there are a number of times that walking is the better mode of locomotion.

	" that you can just type "Open" instead of "Open Door". I had to redo another two screens after I realized that, instead of typing out "Push Candle", it was faster to repeat "Push Chair", then delete the "hair" and type "andle". Other examples of shortening text was changing "Close Door" to "Bar Door" and "Throw Dagger" to "Toss Knife" (when that was still part of the route, see below).

To get the better ending, you need to grab the magic mirror, exit the room, and then go off to save Spielburg Valley from an evil ogress.  The Any % route involves just accomplishing the good ending.

If you fail to use the potion (or if you don't have it), the leader kills you in typical Sierra adventure fashion with no chance at redemption. Or, at least that's how we all believed the game to work. However, last year, while working on the speedrun for the VGA remake of the game, I discovered that there was a glitch that unlocked the movement of the main character in the final room and allowed you make quick escape that was very unintended, but ended the game with a win in hilarious, troll-faced fashion.

	"The original Quest for Glory 1 EGA route was done by a speedrunner named Renault in late 2007, and while at the time it was viewed by Quest for Glory enthusiasts (that small group) as a neat achievement, it was very unpolished, collecting all of the things required for the dispel potion and winning in 9 minutes, 29 seconds. My optimizations to the route brought the time down to 5 minutes, 32 seconds. I later attempted the same skip that I had found while running the VGA remake in the original EGA version and found that the glitch exists there also. The VGA remake code uses quite a bit of code copied from the earlier EGA version (verbatim in some cases). With the large skip discovered, the time came down to 2 minutes, 9 seconds. This TAS is less than one-third of that time.

]div
[div class=p 
	"The route is a matter of finding out how to get to the Brigand Leader as fast as possible. The normal course and philosophy of the game is a progressive stat-based adventure-RPG hybrid. Whereas most Sierra games depend on items to progress through the game, the puzzles in the Quest for Glory series have multiple solutions depending on your skills. The classic example is Toro the Minotaur, who is the gatekeeper to the endgame, as there are multiple ways to get past him. The Fighter can, obviously, fight him. Any class is able to fight and potentially win in battle, but with the Fighter in particular it is expected. The Magic-User is able to use the Calm spell to put him to sleep, and then use the Open spell to get into the Brigand's Fortress. The Thief's route involves sneaking past him and climbing over the fence in one of the two possible places. But because of the skill distribution system at the beginning, you can create a hybrid character that can do a mix of these solutions. We used the hybrid approach in routing to get past obstacles in the fastest way possible... at least before TASing came along and found a new way past the previously mentioned Minotaur. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Magic is a panacea that cures most skill-requirement issues in routing. This is seen in solving the first task of getting into the secret passage to the Brigand's Lair. The second part is learning the password to get into the passage without fighting the troll, who is arguably the most difficult battle in the game; he can be killed, and indeed, is killed in the 100% speedrun of the game due to point requirements, but at our beginning game stats, it would be literally impossible even at TAS levels - I would love to be proved wrong :D. The password learning is skipped for reasons already stated above in the Game Choice section. The third hurdle then is getting past the Minotaur; which originally was solved with a quickly acquired Calm spell... until it was discovered Calm was not needed at all in the EGA version.
