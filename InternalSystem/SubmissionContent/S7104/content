	"Full gameplay of Bad Omen. This is basically Devilish: The Next Possession in Genesis. I use Japanese version tho, cause i think it is cool. The truth is, i didn't beat meerkov's time in the US ver. so it's obsolete. But hey! I include all of this in gameplay, especially after boss. What i hate on this TAS is Stage 4 because it slows up the time, especially boss. Good thing, i didn't use any keyboard or controller in making of this (cuz I don't have controller). I'm using the button frame scrolling tool in TAStudio (what do you called that thing?) to advance frame. So when it comes to output, it is perfect, even tho it slows the time. God help me. Please review this bk2 file if i failed.

	"A: Maybe, but this game is the best. You know why?? It has a better sprite graphics, better sounds and music composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto, who composed the Final fantasy series and stuff, better gameplay, and has 2 game modes, which is fine for me.
