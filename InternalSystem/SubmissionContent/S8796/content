	"I found an interesting glitch where if you roll of an edge, you are held in a glitch state where you are still ducked down for the purposes of hit detection. So you can run around and attacks that can only hit you when you are standing will miss you. This saves a lot of time. Death abuse also saves time in a couple levels.
