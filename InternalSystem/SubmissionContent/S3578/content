	"This run uses a trick that is erroneously called in-game cheat to collect all 75 Kremkoins on Pirate Panic. Compare it to a Warp Barrel; when you want to beat the game fast, all the Warp Barrels are used as shortcuts, then why not the 75 Kremkoins trick? This trick made it possible to pay Klubba's Kiosks before I normally would, but the time spent to perform the trick surpassed the backtrack needed to pay him. Towards the percentage, the trick gives me nothing and since I want to achieve 102% of the game, I still have to collet all 75 Kremkoins the way it's meant to be collected. No advantage on Klubba, also not a single percent of the game given, so why use the trick then? The answer is a chat with Cranky at the end of the first K. Rool fight, it's too long and it can't be skipped, the trick made it possible to leave it outside the run.
