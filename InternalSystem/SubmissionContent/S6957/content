	"This is an unlicensed demake of Donkey Kong Country (1994), ported to the NES called "Donkey Kong Country 4" by Hummer Team. The game is mainly based off of the base game, with visuals being hand drawn to lower quality and music reproduced by ear. Amusingly, it bears a copyright symbol in the opening credits, irony notwithstanding.

The next version of the bingo cards will just have that square free as well. Also, it'll ensure Samsara finishes her jokes in her submission texts, instead of leaving them completely open and not noticing for several hours.

	"The issue here lies in optimization this time. Most of this run looks optimized, however there are two stages that stand out: The swimming stages. There is a zip used in the second swimming stage that, upon my investigation, can be used far more effectively throughout both of these stages to save a solid chunk of time. After a little more investigation, alongside being clued in to a clip discovered after the creation of the run, I discovered that these can be used in tandem to save

	"This makes things... Well, interesting. By itself, the clip may not even save any time, but combined with the ceiling zip that was known at the time of this run's creation it turns into a single massive improvement, so it ends up being kind of a weird choice to make regarding whether or not the run as a whole should be rejected for suboptimal play. Without the clip (which, again, was discovered after the creation of this run), the improvements from zipping would be much less substantial, likely only a handful of seconds per stage as opposed to that nearly 17 second improvement. Given the rest of the run's optimization, I wouldn't consider that reject-worthy, but there was something else brought up that's leading me to the decision I'm making here. According to the

		"linked VOD with the floor clip in the swimming stage
	]a
	", this run is a couple years old (clip is dated from early 2019 and this TAS predates it), and it was apparently not originally intended to be submitted. That leads me to believe that there's likely more improvements hiding around the run that just aren't obvious on plain viewing, something that a future improvement can take more advantage of. Given that, and given that there's now an estimated 20 seconds of known improvement just in the swimming stages, I'm rejecting this for now. It's INCREDIBLY close to acceptable, to the point where I'm not even convinced I'm making the right decision here. It could possibly be given a second look in the future, but right now it's hard to overlook the fact that known tricks weren't used to their fullest potential.
