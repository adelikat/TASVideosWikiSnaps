	"Recording info: I did *NOT* put --no-gui in Ruffle (because I forgor), and adding it in would require editing 4 frames of the recording where I pre-emptively hover over, and then click 2 menu buttons. Nothing really to note, besides that I acquired the SWF file from Flashpoint Archive, although there aren't any other versions that I'm aware of.

I could get a TON of minor timesave by going back and editing the recording to cut my corners better, but that would take a ton of effort and generally not be trivial, so I'm confident that this recording won't be obsoleted in, like, a day.
