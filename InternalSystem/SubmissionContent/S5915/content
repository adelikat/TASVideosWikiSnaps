I asked a judge who has TASed this game before, and the answer was the same: it can't be known beforehand. So right now, we don't know where exactly this trick can be used, how much time it can save in every such spot, and what the overall timesave would be.

				" Turns out, the time that locking the miniboss room takes due to spawning the wall delays miniboss activation. So if you spit the fireball before entering that room, it will just get deflected. In order to hit him right when he activates, you'd need to leave the fireball that you've thrown way behind you, so it keeps flying while the room is being locked, and only hits the miniboss afterwards. But fireball speed is very close to Mario's, so I couldn't find places where such setup was possible.
