	"As for the tier, it's a tough decision, because I really enjoyed the run, but the audience was not so sure. So I either accept this to Vault and it never sees the light of day whatsoever (I mean it won't get rated), or I accept it to Moons and see whether people actually like it, hate it, or are indifferent about it. After all, there's rarely clear idea what tier a run needs to go to after only looking at the submission feedback for such simplistic games. I either have to make a magical guess about its future rating feedback, predict it beforehand, and decide the tier based on this non-existent data (which somehow completely disregards and outweighs submission feedback), or go out of my way and explicitly call for this rating data, to then base the tier decision on it with at least
