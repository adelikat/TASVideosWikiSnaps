	"A OutRun-like racer from way back then, somehow got a remake for the Sega Genesis in 1992. The same year games like Virtua Racing would drop. I TASed this game out of curiosity, as I played TD3, a much superior sequel, when I was younger but never had the patience to play this one.

	"Well, I decided to spend a couple hours and have fun manually TASing it. I set up to play all 3 sceneries for completeness, driving a lambo (fastest) and on the easiest difficult for automatic shifting. The key in this game is to reduce the turning angles to the minimum possible to prevent skidding and loss of speed. Don't expect this to have a frame-perfect optimization nor a bot-like execution; it was just me having fun.
