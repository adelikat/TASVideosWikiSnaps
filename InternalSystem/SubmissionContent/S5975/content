My last warpless run was already more optimized than anyone would think. I had tested everything I could think back then, including getting Fireflower in 1-4 and 5-1 Bullet Bill shot. However, I failed to find these four time improvements in 2012 for a reason, not because of laziness or mistakes during my tests, but simply because these new improvements all require bold imagination and optimization to a new level, a level in which exhaustive search tools are way more useful than any human TASer.

Even a brilliant TASer, MrWint, who is so good at calculation that he even analyzed the code and created exhaustive search tools to help do the job, only managed to save 2 frames. So how did I save 10 frames? 2 frames from hitting the vine and climbing up the vine faster, 3 frames from faster falling by pressing L+D+R for vine teleport, and 5 frames from better movement of kicking the shell of a Koopa Paratroopa.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"At first, I only managed to save 4 frames from the vine in total, and found a faster way of kicking the shell by jumping on the pipe instead of the block, and only 2 frames from saving 21 frames. This was when I realized 6-2 could be a potential improvement. I knew the only way to get those 2 frames is to kick the shell 2 frames faster, so I tried all the combinations of stomping the Koopa Paratroopa, including manipulating its X sub position, Y position and loading time, a few of which came close, but still couldn't be any faster. Later I revisited the vine and saved another frame. I thought this might be the key, so I tried all the combinations again, yet still no chance of getting 2 more frames from the shell.

[div class=p 
	"Then for the next few days I started to think saving time in 6-2 was very close but impossible, just like 1-1, since all stage has limits, and that might be the limit for 6-2. After all, I had manipulated everything possible and done manual exhaustive search. Until the day Kosmic got his SMB warpless WR. Watching his run motivated me to do more tests on 6-2, so I tried a bold idea I had in mind: to make use of 1.160 acceleration for the jump before touching the vine. Although Mario had to start jumping a few frames later to get the required acceleration, to my surprise, Mario could touch the vine at the same frame, while gaining 2 pixels to the right relative to the screen, sending Mario to the very edge of the screen after vine teleport. I immediately felt that if this puzzle were solvable, those 2 pixels had to be the key, as it could potentially give Mario more space for slowing down before hitting the Koopa. So I did manual exhaustive search again, and just when I was about to run out of combinations and all the rest failed, I finally got a combination that worked, kicking the shell 2 frames faster therefore saving 21 frames in 6-2.

	"Just after I finished 6-2 as the first stage of this project and started teaming up with Mars608, 6-4 hit me hard. It was every SMB speedrunners' nightmare, an unavoidable Firebar in 6-4. Although the Firebar itself has no randomness, it inherits the Y speed of the first Podoboo, which is random and impossible to manipulate. The last time someone got this situation in a warpless TAS was Phil & Genisto in 2004. It was hard to accept that I had to lose the framerule I saved for a stupid Firebar due to mere luck, and ended up only saving 3 lag frames at Bowser.

In my 2012 submission text, I wrote: "I've came up with a crazy idea once, that is to get the mushroom in 1-3 instead of 1-2, and then get the fire flower in 1-4. What really shocked me was that the idea almost saved 21 frames. Although I've tried my best to manage to get that flower in a quickest way, there are still about 3 more frames to go in order to save time. And since this new route would be a bit less entertaining, I still kept the old route."

	"My calculation and analysis told me that the only hope of saving 21 frames in 1-4 was to get the Fireflower in running speed. One night I started seriously testing this, and told Mars608 that I got really close, only half a pixel away from getting Fireflower in running speed. Mars608 said that was closer than thought, so the next day he tested it himself and told me that he had done it, saving the framerule in 1-4. I got astonished hearing his news, and asked him if he used a different method by bumping into the left corner of the block turning the X speed immediately to zero, he said yes.

Mars608 later told me that he had thought this method of jumping early to hit the corner of the wall, but didn't bother to told me before since he thought I had covered it during my tests.

The double Bullet Bills were also in much more difficult position than before, so sliding down wouldn't work, and I had to reach the perfect Y sub position and Y sub speed by jumping. The requirement is extremely strict and almost impossible to reach through mere calculation, so I had to manually search through combinations of every jump heights and every moments of killing each Bullet Bills. After long and exhausting manual exhaustive search, I found it impossible to reach the requirements of killing two Bullet Bills before the ground clip through mere jumping. Just when I was about to give up on the double Bullet Bills plan, I realized there was a missing key item in my manual exhaustive search: the lift. Banging Mario's head on that lift could change the Y speed, so I did the manual exhaustive search again, and finally found a combination that worked.

	"I'm deeply honored to work on this project with my friend and a great TASer, Mars608. As a result, Mars608 found two out of four improvements in this run, any of which alone is quite a remarkable achievement.

	"Mars608 also did tremendous work on manipulating luck in 2-3, 5-3, 6-3, 7-1, 7-3, 8-2, and 8-3, and discussing and testing details on entertainment. I used great parts of his setup, including full 7-3 setup, and altered setup of 7-1 and 8-2. I appreciate that Mars608 respected my work with slow place, and took over the hardest levels.

	"Through this project, I've learned one important thing: never lose hope, until you've really tried everything. Many things that seem impossible are just bloody difficult. However, miracles don't happen by themselves. I'm glad that many of our crazy ideas in this project have actually been worked out, so we can witness something miraculous together.

	"Audience response on this was somewhat of a disaster. Most of it had nothing to do with the run itself. Some people made demands and offered suggestions which went against everything ever done till now and made little sense. Few people appeared to be responding rationally. Filtering that down to the responses that seemed on topic and had some sensible bearing on this submission itself, it looks like the audience response was terrific.

	"Regarding the authors of this run, our practice has always been to list as authors those who actually contributed input to the current run itself. If authors were just a collection of who contributed ideas, then I should be credited as being an author of every single warpless run since

	[a class=intlink href=/Forum/P/16481#16481 
		"my idea to get a fire flower and use it to kill Bowser 7 times
	]a
	". As I've never been credited as a co-author, Phil, Genisto, klmz and others have not been credited as co-authors by later authors, then it makes no sense to credit myself, them, or MrWint and his bot for this submission as co-authors either. We even 
	[a class=intlink href=/4029S 
		"had a case
	]a
	" where someone contributed 2 screens worth of input out of well over a hundred, and got a "thank you" but not a co-authorship. So while MrWint undoubtedly contributed ideas to this run in some minor but crucial aspect, he is not an author of it.
