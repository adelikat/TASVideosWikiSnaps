	"This game is known as King's Field 2 in Japan, hence it is often referred as King's Field 1U/2J. The original King's Field was never released outside of Japan, as the Playstation wasn't released anywhere else at the time. It is the first game released by FromSoftware, and you can see a lot of similarities with their later Dark Souls games. The game is supposed to run at 30 FPS, but it will often be slower when rendering too many elements at once, going as low as 12 FPS.

While standing, the turning speed increases (or decreases) by 8 per frame, capping at 35. So even under optimal conditions, you would need 30 frames to do a 45° rotation while standing, 37 frames while moving.

	"Unlike games like Doom or Goldeneye 007, running and strafing simultaneously isn't faster than doing only one of them. However, when doing it close to a wall with an angle of ~45°, the game messes with the calculations and the speed can be boosted up to 480.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"In a similar way, if you are only running or strafing and almost parallel to a wall, the speed can be boosted up to 652. However, unlike strafeboosting, there are 2 limitations. First, the angle value must be accurate to the unit, as being 1 unit off will result in a speed of either 542 or 337, and getting this accuracy fast can be tricky due to how the turning speed mechanics work. Second, straightboosting only works when going east or west with the wall on the north side, or when going north or south with the wall on the east side.

	"If you load a game right after a sector transition loading room, the game will mess up with the loading and put the player at the wrong coordinates, resulting in a wrong warp.

[div class=p 
	"While OOB, you can only move from one ceiling to another one which isn't at a higher height, though you can freely go from one floor to another as long as the rooms are geographically connected. It is thus easy to get softlocked and hard to get out of an OOB, as you must either reach a room without a ceiling, which is uncommon, or reach a sector transition loading room as the transition will update the height coordinate and put the player at the most likely place given his X and Y coordinates.

	"There are 16 weapons and 20 magic spells (4 for each attribute: fire, water, earth, wind and light, though not all of them can deal damage). In addition, some weapons have a special magic that can be used once your stats are high enough, which will never be the case in this TAS. Since weapons use physical stamina and magics use magical stamina, you will always have a better DPS when using both of them, but there is so little combat in this TAS that it wasn't even worth the time to take a detour to learn any magic.

With this extra shopping, I needed at least 6600g, and the fastest way to get this was to pick and sell the Fire Crystal at the beginning of the game for 7000g.

I particularly liked that friendly fire enhanced archer kill, though the Minecraft player in me feels like you should've gotten a CD drop from it. The epic final battle of harmlessly standing on a dragon's back and slowly slashing it to death was genuinely hilarious to me. It felt like a mockery of Fromsoft's notoriously high difficulty, and that is absolutely up my alley.
