	"Manhole was a Game and Watch game relesed WAY back in 1984. But, in 1994 they released it and other Game and Watch games known in Japan as Game Boy Gallery, or known here in the US as Game & Watch Gallery released in 1997.

	"This is my VERY first submission, and it took me about a week to make in secret. It plays through the Manhole mini-game in the Game Boy game Game and Watch Gallery. It aims to get 100 points on Hard difficulty. I may someday aim for 500 or 1000, but I'll do that once I run out of projects.

	"Manhole is a game all about eye-hand coordination (on a real Game Boy, of course) and about luck. As you see, you control Yoshi trying to hold up platforms as Toads, Donkey Kong Jr.s (yes multiples of them) and Wario run across the platform. Once a platform is stepped on, it falls. It is Yoshi's job to hold them up.

	"The one almost-fatality in this movie is the ONE Wario that runs across the screen nearly falls. This was finally able to be prevented.

	"There are some parts where Yoshi has a seizure or something, I don't know. He spins around freakishly. This is done by going frame by frame, left, up, right, down, left, up ,right.... ect.

	": It seems many people do not like this submission/think it belongs in Pekopon's mini-game thread. (which it does) Therefore, I think it is right to cancel this decision and move on to better Game Boy/Color/Advanced games.
