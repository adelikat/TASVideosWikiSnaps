	"This run is based on mine and got4n’s “serious” attempt at TASing this game. But instead of beating the game in proper way, it finishes the last act in a way causing Sonic to die after the “level clear” screen, throwing him into a glitched version of the same act. Rememberring the negative feedback regarding Sonic being offscreen most time, I decided to keep him on screen at this time. Enjoy. :)
