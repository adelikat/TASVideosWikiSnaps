	"Metal Max Returns is a post-apocalyptic role-playing video game developed by Crea-Tech and published by Data East for the SNES in 1995. It is a remake of the original Metal Max for the NES, featuring improved graphics and sound, revised areas, references to Metal Max 2 and decreased difficulty.

[p 
	"Set in a gritty, post-apocalyptic/wild west hybrid environment, a nameless youth decides to become a Hunter, one who fights monsters and cashes in on bounties, usually with heavy artillery. Enter Metal Max’s defining feature - tanks. You’ll spend a lot of time playing with your tanks - twinking them out, customizing them, even attaching little baubles to their dashboards. Most of the game is spent with your tanks, but it’s important that you don’t ignore your human characters´ development, because there will be times when you can’t use your tanks.
	$LF

[p 
	"Metal Max is light on story, but heavy on gameplay. There’s a ton of stuff to do, such as hunting the weekly bounty head, improving your Hunter rank, toying with your tanks, exploring, getting a tattoo. It’s really up to you to figure out what you want to make of yourself in the wide world of Metal Max, but you’ll have a blast doing so!

	"This movie of Metal Max Returns is unlike the one of Metal Max in almost every way. The high degree of completion of Metal Max Returns cause that we can’t use any bugs to get through it. Therefore in battles we make a critical hit in every round for the most damage to enemies and keep our equipments without damage, in this way we can win the battle. The reencounters in the wild can’t be avoided in this edition. So we can only reduce it by Luck Manipulation. Even though the remake edition increases trouble to make a movie, it also provides a convenience for us by add some scenes, especially the subway ruins.

	"The fastest movie of this game is that in 32:17 at present. The movie was well done so I borrowed my movie from it. The most obvious feature in my movie is that I took full advantage of the subway and the rental tank. It made the distance greatly reduced.
