	"I used Famtasia on this. This was also my first timeattack.I used all of the warps 1-2, 4-2. I tried to do this as fast as possible. It was no programming errors in the game. It was hard too jump on the side of the pipes and yes i took 1 hit in this timeattack This game is g00d i like it VERY much.
