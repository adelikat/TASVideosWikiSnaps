	"While the time looks to be longer compared to the previous publication, this is in fact an improvement of 174 frames.  The reason why it appears longer is due to the old TAS using an earlier version of GBHawk (the one found in BizHawk 2.3 to be exact), which had 1 frame worth of loading time.  This has since been changed in later versions of GBHawk.  All that time lost from the 1 frame loading added up and managed to be longer than GBC mode (even with the GBC BIOS being significantly shorter than the GB one).  Because of this, I have provided a super cut comparison encode that removes all the cutscenes with Goofy, so I only have to compare gameplay, rather than account for the inaccurate loading.  I should note that I do not know if the use of EqualLengthFrames=False has any effect on the comparison encode, but if it does, I doubt it would have any significant differences.

	"However I should be addressing the bigger elephant in the room.  This TAS is using GBC in GBA for the purpose of console verification.  TiKevin83 has verified a modified version of the older movie on console, he is planning on testing this movie soon, so once that is up, I'll add it to the submission.  A side effect of using GBC mode for this game is some of the lag is reduced compared to GB mode.  However I can assure the judges that there are other gameplay improvements here, which I will get to in the level by level section.

	"One major change you might notice with this new movie is damage sounds are emulated this time, previously some sounds didnt play on either GB core, but now they have been added.  I never mentioned it to the devs because I thought the damage noise was only exclusive to the USA release.  It was only once I made the modified version of the old movie did I realize Gambatte was actually playing it back.  So thank you to whoever fixed this.

	"If you couldn't tell, this game is laggy in some parts.  One of the easist ways to reduce lag is to have less sprites visible on screen, you can do this by jumping high enough to force them off screen.  The biggest part of optimizing this game is to reduce lag as much as possible, even with the amount of effort done to reduce it, the only way to truly optimize it fully is though method of botting.

It would cause more lag to damage boost in the second 2 encounters, so it wouldnt be worth it.  The quick kill involves damage boosting and using all the i-frames to continue to throw bricks at Pete.

So even if a movie is overall shorter due to using GBC mode instead of GB mode, it will still need to be faster in actual gameplay execution.
