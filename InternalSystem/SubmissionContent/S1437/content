	"Shortly after the previous run was submitted, a subtle trick which can be used to reach top speed 5 frames faster from a standstill was discovered -- on the ground, Sonic accelerates at a rate of 12 per frame (this is increased to 24 while in air), but he brakes at a rate of 128 per frame. So pressing the "wrong" direction for a frame, and then immediately reversing it causes sonic to have a speed of 128, instead of the 24 (or 36, given a jump to increase acceleration) that holding that direction for two frames would achieve. This was used to shave 3-4 frames off of most levels.
	$LF
	"Some further improvements were achieved by better optimization of rolling at the start of slopes, and downslope jumping for the speed boost.
	$LF
