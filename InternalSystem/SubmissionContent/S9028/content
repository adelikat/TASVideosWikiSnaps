	"I remember this game very little. I believe that I typed it in, but not sure. However, I'm glad to finally getting around to this one. I do feel this game has a classic feel for the genre of games that existed back then. Only this one, was even more simple than most.

	"There is no difficulty selection, and no increase in difficulty from screen to screen. The ending occurs when the gold is snatched out of the tomb. There is clear indication of this, by a message being displayed. Thereafter, there is no more unique content and no difficulty increase. All that is seen, is three guardians...which move randomly.

	"The effort was very little. The only changes, from each run that I did, was to test different "Seed" RNG values. When I found the correct value, it was evident, as my progress wasn't hindered at all while moving towards the gold. How do you determine that? If you are able to advance to the right on each move...then its optimal. Some board layouts prevent this, which is why I ran the RND command to find the one that worked the best for speed.
