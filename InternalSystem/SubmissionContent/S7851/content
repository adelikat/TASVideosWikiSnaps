Shovel knight has a steely resolve when she digs in defensively. Panda is tanky and I'm not wasting a pun on him; gotta keep my pun finances in the (Jack) Black and out of the red.

	"Anyway the combo system lets Ryouga (our character) do ridiculous amounts of damage. Certain moves can be chained/canceled into other moves, and you can do that when the little hit indicator turns red. Generally we throw 3-4 hit combos to dizzy the opponent, and 5-7 afterward to finish them. Generally the combos go:

	"The AI likes to block and avoid our moves, so there's a lot of manipping involved when it comes to move selection, when we jump, etc. The panda and Herb (the boss) are the only fights we hit 94 instead of 95/96 IGT, I think they just take slightly reduced damage so the main combos aren't quite enough to two cycle them. At least all the fights aren't identical, making it slightly more fun to watch I guess? Some of them even get finished with basic moves.
