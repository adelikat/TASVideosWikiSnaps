Note that playing on an already completed file lets us skip many cutscenes throughout the run, saving about 10-20 minutes of lore, which isn’t very interesting from a TAS point of view. Also, since Super Hard CPUs act less passively in minigames, they can lead to faster completion times. Therefore, Super Hard could actually be the fastest difficulty, though further testing should be done.

	$LF
]h2
[div class=p 
	"While this game can seem to have an unbiased representation of any given RNG value at first glance, there are moments when it seems to have big biases for a very small set of particular values before switching to something different, sometimes for up to 100 frames. This is especially noticeable when it comes to dice rolls and minigame choices. So, while it may seem like the RNG of this game is fine in regular gameplay, the algorithm used by the games certainly did make RNG manipulation quite difficult for this TAS.
	$LF
	"Indeed, the RNG manipulation forced us to redo entire board turns to scout for better luck on the next turn. On average, each singular turn was redone about 3 times, and some up to 10 times.
	$LF
	"Note that on the game board, the RNG can only be manipulated by delaying the game, either by pressing Start to briefly pause the game during a CPU’s turn, or delaying an A press to close a textbox during your turn. Note that pausing the game loses a minimum of 12 frames, so while it is often used in this TAS due to it being the only technique available at certain moments, it is by far the worse one to use.
	$LF
	"We noticed that inserting lag frames did change the RNG for minigame spawns positions and CPU strategies, while preserving the RNG results for dice rolls and minigame wheel choices. We tried to use this information to the best of our abilities, but we still have a very limited comprehension of the inner workings of the RNG and how to control for lag.

While getting a Wacky Watch from Toad on an item space is possible, the hidden box has a shorter animation.

It happens before the pre-game ceremony, after closing the textbox to start the game which says, "Ready for the Battle Royale? Then let's go!".

This can be manipulated by delaying closing the textbox that comes before the dice rolls. To manipulate what place Luigi gets, we simply delay Luigi's dice roll. As long as Luigi hits his dice before all the CPUs do, no time is lost doing so.

[div class=p 
	"In this game, there are 3 hidden boxes (item, coins and star) that can spawn on any blue space that can't switch to a star space. For the purposes of this TAS, we want the item box to spawn near the beginning of the board, and the other two to be far enough so that we won't land on them during the game. The spawning locations are generated upon starting the first board phase. We can delay the closing of the last textbox after the first star spawn is shown to manipulate the spawn of the hidden boxes. A Lua script was used to help with this section, by incrementally delaying the frame at which the text box is closed and by manipulating the dice roll of the first CPU to check if the first few spaces had any item boxes.
	$LF
	"The content of the item box is determined upon stepping on the blue space that contains it. An item box has a 5% chance of giving a Wacky Watch, so pausing the game was necessary to manipulate those.

[div class=p 
	"For Item Spaces, these spaces are used as a last resort if we need some extra green spaces to manipulate minigame types or to avoid tiebreakers at the end of the game (since a character does not get coins when landing on them). On any turn that isn't the last one, the fastest scenario of Item Spaces is to let a CPU land on it, then lose an item minigame. This loses about 5 seconds compared to landing on a default blue space. However, landing on an Item Space on the last turn simply gives a textbox saying that it's the last turn, losing only half a second. This is why all Item Spaces are landed on in the last turn in this TAS.

	"When a game is chosen, it will not show on the minigame wheel again until the list of remaining minigames gets short enough, or until you leave and rejoin the game. Boards do not last for enough turns for a refill to happen. Also, it takes at least 17 seconds to reset the game list via saving and quitting, which is way beyond the time gain that you'd get out of replaying some minigames a second time which would never be above 10 seconds.

	"Any way to manipulate the RNG on the board that does not require pausing would save an indescribably gargantuan amount of frames. Alternatively, we would welcome a deeper understanding of the Random Number Generator. Indeed, minigame choices and dice rolls seem to oscillate between a small set of values for long periods of time before switching regimes, which led to some long RNG manipulation periods.
	$LF
	"We tried to minimise the (many!) lag frames as much as we could, but we rarely understood what caused them in the first place, so there’s probably work that could be done on that front.

		" One idea would be to make an "all minigames" TAS of Mario Party 3, which could be a nice playaround/demonstration of the minigames that this game has.
		$LF

	[li 
		" This is technically the first TAS of a main mode of a traditional Mario Party game (sorry, Mario Party Advance). This TAS only optimises for time and skips a lot of game content, creating a "most uneventful playthrough". An example of a more entertaining TAS would be an All Boards TAS of Mario Party 1, where 100 stars would be gotten to unlock the final board of the game, therefore requiring more actions to be taken during the gameplay. Of course, such a TAS would take years to make, as the final time of such a run would probably be around 3-5 hours, but it could still be a cool TAS to watch.
