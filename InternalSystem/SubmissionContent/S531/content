	"Finally! After several days of attempting Sonic the Hedgehog 2, only to wind up with desync problems (this happened to me several times), I now bring you my next version of the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Speed-Run! Yay!

	"Now, before you rush for the forum to vote 'No', I implore you to watch the movie: this one is FAR better than the first two i've submitted, and it's more than obvious that all the runs that I made over the few days (and, which weren't submitted, thanks to the aforementioned desync problems) were improving my skill and knowledge of each particular Zone. So, it comes around to an incredible show, and Sonic 2 fans will surely delight in the stunts that I was able to pull off with that super-nifty slow-motion.

	"There were a few things that I find wrong with the movie, however. Though most of the maneuvers are flawless, there are points in the game where the game's time conflicts with where I want to go. In this case, platforms are generally in different places than they were, etc., though this also applies in an opposite sense, with a platform being in a certain place, etc.

	"The next problem was Metropolis Zone. It's comprised of THREE zones, not the normal two. This makes for tedious gameplay, making it difficult to improve. The only way I could find to possibly shave seconds off my time was to make use of Tails to get the screws to move faster.

	"Update: Just to throw this stuff in here, there were several parts that made beating 'records' impossible. For example, in Oil Ocean Zone, the record-beater goes under the oil to reach places previously unaccessible, and thusly, beating the levels in a much shorter time than going through the maze above. I spent several hours trying to achieve this trick as well with a previous version, but apparently, the console version has advantages over the version I picked up. Also, on Chemical Plant 1, there's a non-existant door leading to the end of the level quicker. Either i've missed it, or it's not in my version, but I followed the movie to the utmost detail. Oh well.
