	" is a platformer with gameplay, graphics and music more similar to the NES. Just like its predecessor, it requires exploring the world to collect upgrades and six hearts in order make progress. However, this movie skips many of the required upgrades and all of the six hearts, only collecting three upgrades in the process.

	"This is a TAS of Super Win The Game that aims to beat the game in the fastest way possible. The end goal of the game is to meet an NPC at the end of the Lair of the Hollow King in order to get to the end screen. Normally, this requires the Magic Snorkel, Springheel Boots, Spider Gloves, Mask of the Arcadians, Arcadians' Seal and Deepskin Catalyst, all just to enter the Lair. However, the Snorkel, Seal and Catalyst can all be skipped by using glitches.

After savequitting, returning and jumping as soon as the save reloads, the player can clip through the ceiling. This is used to jump over the lava in the room right before Lair of the Hollow King, skipping the Deepskin Catalyst, and used in tandem with another glitch below to skip the entirety of the Lair.

After getting the boots, we use the book to get back to the beginning of the stage and get into the Subcon to get back to the starting area. Then we head west to the Sky Pillars to get the Spider Gloves. In the process, we trigger the bell checkpoint by the right side of the bridge and deliberately all other bells so that we can die straight after getting the gloves to get back faster than if we were to use the Subcon normally.

	"Amusingly enough, the Lair skip doesn't require this upgrade, but not having this upgrade will cause the NPC inside the house at the end of the Lair to not load (which is strange, because in normal play you can't get into the house without the Arcadians' Seal, which already requires having the mask). Therefore, we must head towards Lakewood Dungeon to get this item. Once again we avoid touching any checkpoints in the process in order to cut much of the backtracking. We enter from the top by triple jumping for a couple of reasons: it allows up to line up better for the moving platform room to take a speed boost from one of the platforms, and it allows us to avoid a checkpoint at the start of said room. We then quickly walljump up to get to the room and precisely manuever around to collect the item. Then we die on a nearby spike to put us right back at the starting area. We then start heading towards the Lair.

	"Normally, in order to reach the Lair, you need the Steelskin Catalyst (which in turn requires the Magic Snorkel and the Arcadians' Seal) in order to pass through the pool of lava on the room shortly before it. However, by bell clipping into the ceiling, we get on the ceiling, skipping the requirements. We enter the Lair and as soon as we get past the silhouette room we do a ceiling bell clip and initiate a series of double air jumps to get on top of the ceiling, not only skipping the 6 heart requirement to enter, but the entirety of the Lair as well. We do a super jump to avoid having to climb a wall spanning several rooms, and we keep going right until we reach the house at the end.

[div class=p 
	"Normally, entering the house requires the Arcadians' Seal, but we can also reach this room by jumping off the left of the tall roof and up above. This works because the inside room is stored just above the room the actual house is in. We get on the ledge to replenish our jump, walk off, immediately walk to the right and jump to just about make it inside the room. Finally, we talk to the NPC to end the playthrough and put us in the credits screen.
