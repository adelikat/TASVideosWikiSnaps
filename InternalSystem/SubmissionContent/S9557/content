	" is a homebrew NES demake of the 2013 PC/mobile rhythm platformer game, 
	[em 
		"Geometry Dash

	". Version 1.2 of 
	[em 
		"Famidash
	]em
	" features demakes of the official main 22 levels and 21 custom community-made levels, compared to the 13 main levels and 7 custom levels in Version 1.1. Initially, this run didn't have any timesaves out of menuing and ending input early, but now that this update is out, we can take advantage of certain level design errors to save time. I won't go super in-depth into the mechanics of 
	[em

	", so if you're familiar with the game, that's great. If not, no worries. You can still follow along. I'll keep the basics of the game brief though.

Dying at any point puts you back at the start of the level. Throughout the levels, you'll find jump pads, jump orbs, and portals to assist or hinder your progress. Portals can change your gamemode, size, gravity, and speed (we'll get back to this in a bit). Additionally, each level has 3 Secret Coins that the player can collect. This TAS aims to complete the 22 main levels while collecting 3 Secret Coins in each level.

	"In level 15, Electrodynamix, you are introduced to speed portals. Speed portals are these arrow-shaped objects that will increase or decrease your icon's speed upon contact. From slowest to fastest speed, they are: orange, blue, green, pink, & red. If you follow the 
	[em 
		"Geometry Dash
	]em
	" speedrunning scene closely, you'd know that players are able to skip speed portals that slow you down, saving time by playing the level in a faster, unintended speed. Speed portals can also be skipped in

I measured the time it takes for the icon to reach the results screen from the last input for each level and Clutterfunk has the most frames at 249. The second longest is Dash at 125.
