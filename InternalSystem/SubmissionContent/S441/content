	"First a few words about the game before I go on.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Astyanax is a straight forward slashing game. It's pretty hard because the controls are really stupid and the hero and all enemies are really twice the size, this makes this game hard and that's what makes this run interesting. Or something.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The best in this game is the bosses. They look really cool and evil. Atleast I think they do.

[div class=p 
	"Anyways, in my previous version I tried to avoid damage as much as possible. Sometimes it was impossible though because of the size of enemies and the clumjsy controls.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"In my new run I take damage everywhere. This is good for several reasons compared to my previous attempt.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"1. When taking damage you become invincible for some time, allowing me to ignore some annoying enemies.
	$LF
	"2. At the end of stages your remaining energy will count down. This means I have less energy that has to be counted and thus it saved me some time.
	$LF
	"3. It's overall much faster since I don't have to stop and kill annoying enemies.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Oh. Forgot to add a few things. I guess I could have taken a bit
	$LF
	"more damage here and there but I didn't for a few reasons.
	$LF
	"First, if I had done that it would have looked even worse and it's bad as it is
	$LF
	"so I decided not too.
	$LF
	"Second, I want to keep moving forward as much as possible and
	$LF
	"if I wanted to take more damage I have had to stop and wait for enemies.
	$LF
	"This is a bad idea whatsoever in my opinion.
	$LF
	"And third, I could have fought more inside bosses I guess but I choosed not to
	$LF
	"in most cases because that too would have looked horrible..
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Another thing that saved time is the use of magic. I used it better this time, mostly because I didn't have to use magic during the stages and therefor I could kill the bosses faster.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Lastly, one thing that didn't save me time is the lag.It seems
	$LF
	"that if a ridicoulus small amount of enemies is on the screen simultaniously the game lags.
	$LF
	"For the same reason as I didn't take more damage during stages I had to live with this.
	$LF
	"Else I would have been forced to backtrack to kill those lag-sources and that would have been slower
	$LF
	"and worse-looking.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Hmm. I think that was it. Im aware of that this isn't a great run but I doubt I can do it any better because the game is really stupid.
	$LF
	"Atleast it's alot faster now and it looks.. well less sloppy.
