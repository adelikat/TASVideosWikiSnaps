	"This is yet another Sonic Advance run, but it is Tails that gets his time in the spotlight! While it doesn't make use of the Ultra Dash, it also uses its fair share of glitches that gives Tails a pretty good chance at beating the game in record time. I must state that Tails' mechanics are very weird, but also interesting at the same time.

Mecha Knuckles was a nightmare! I've actually had given up on the TAS a time or two because of him... Sadly, I couldn't get any better results than this.

	"Ohh Egg Rocket, how I still and forever will hate you so! This run made use of a glitch that pushes Tails through the floor and causes the level to lose solidarity. Thus making it possible to complete it in one go. A route change was made here as well, which made it possible to complete it even faster than the Knuckles run.
