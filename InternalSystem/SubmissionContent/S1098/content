	"In this run I control both characters and try to finish the game as fast as possible; it’s about 25 seconds faster than the previous version, and ends when no more input is required.

	"Each Level I gain a few frames on the previous run, but the major gains occur in levels 2, 5, and 6.

	"The largest gain is made on level 2 where I gain 759 frames total. This was mainly due to better accuracy and not using the laser as it is weaker than the crush missiles.

	"The most interesting improvement is made on the last level when I kill the bird boss before it can start to teleport around. Once the bird dies the game’s music gets screwed up; I think it’s playing two songs at the same time. This fixes itself later on though.

	"This run was very difficult to make because controlling two characters on one keyboard is very tricky, especially on the level 4 boss and on level 5. I tried my best to keep the movie interesting and I hope you enjoy watching it.
