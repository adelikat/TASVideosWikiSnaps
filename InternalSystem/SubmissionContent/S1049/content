	"Entering the password might seem a little strange (slow), but this is due to the fact that you can only move the cursor every 3-4 frames, and after entering something, you can't movie the following 9 frames. I could write a lot about the rest of the movie, but the movie speaks for itself I think. Even if you don't know the game, I'd still recommend watching it, the movie is very well suited for tasing.
