		" Rocket Launcher: This does massive damage to everything that the rocket hits, able to destroy walls, and open regular doors. The only downsides of it is that its ammo can be hard to find and, when fired, blasts the character backwards a considerable distance. Whenever I fire this weapon I try to keep the character's back to the wall, preventing them from getting blasted back and allowing them to move right after firing.

		" Fire Extinguisher: Freezes enemies that it hits. The longer it's used on the enemies, the longer they're frozen.. This is useful for stopping enemies that would take too long to kill and to decrease the kill count at the end of the game. At the end of the game all of the enemies that were killed are counted, which takes 6 frames for each enemy killed.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Weed Whacker: Thorny weeds hurt the characters and webs from the spider boss prevent the characters from moving, the weed whacker destroys both of them. It's also able to do massive amounts of damage to enemies and bosses, but since its range is so low its not all that viable.
		$LF

The keys can be found on some levels, but are often very far away from the door they are suppose to be used on. They drop from mini-bosses like the giant baby and snakeoids. Can be found randomly(0.05% chance) in containers. A large amount of routing of this run is devoted to getting enough skeleton keys.

These can also be used to seed the RNG(More on this in the RNG manipulation section)

	$LF
]h4
[p

	" RNG Manipulation
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"RNG manipulation is very important to this run. Above all other things I needed speed boots, rocket launchers, and skeleton keys and I only had a few chances to open containers throughout the run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The RNG depends on what frame you open the container or use a mystery potion. It does NOT depend on character's movements, button inputs, or enemy position. However it MAY depend on WHICH enemies are loaded into memory or the position of the screen, but it's very inconsistent and rarely happens.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The RNG is re-seeded whenever the RNG is invoked. This means if I open a chest and find a water gun inside of it I would be able to change that by opening another chest or drinking a mystery potion right before that.
	$LF
	"The RNG re-seeding is dependent on the frame that it was re-seeded. This mean if I open chest A and find a water gun inside of it I would be able to get something different depending on what frame I open chest B. If I open chest B one frame before chest A I could get a key. If I open chest B two frames before chest A I could get a first aid kit. If I open chest B three frames before chest A I could get a popsicle. And so on.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Visual Glitches
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The game doesn't like it when a button is pressed for 1 frame, unpressed for 1 frame, and repeated. If a character is moving while this happens the character will stop all animations. You can see an example of this in level 11: Weeds gone bad. On the credits level I use a different variation of this glitch to leave my rocket launcher behind for a second.
	$LF

[h3 
	" Freezing Enemies
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"I freeze as many enemies that are in my way as I can if it doesn't lose time to do so(as opposed to killing them). At the end of the game all of the enemies that were killed are counted, which takes 6 frames for each enemy killed. I may also freeze an enemy because it is too strong to be killed quickly and needs to be taken care of.

[h3 
	" Routing
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"I know it seems like the routing for this game would be to just take the shortest route to the survivor, but there are several things to consider when doing so.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Skeleton Keys
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"One of the biggest parts about routing for this game is getting enough skeleton keys. There are 21 "skeleton doors" (My term for doors that require skeleton keys) in the game. Roughly 14 of those keys were intended to be found on the ground in levels, but their locations are purposely far away from the skeleton doors that they were suppose to be used on. 
	[a class=extlink href=http://www.vgmaps.com/Atlas/SuperNES/ZombiesAteMyNeighbors-Level46-DayOfTheChainsaw.png  rel=nofollow 
		" Take a look at level 46
	]a
	" for example. The characters spawn at the top right, One of the keys is hidden near the top of the map guarded by a chainsaw guy, the second key is on the left side of the map next to the house, and the skeleton doors are at the bottom right. If I didn't already have 1 skeleton key when I got there I would have to get that key on the side of the house. The shortest path would require 14 more walls to be destroyed and significant amounts of backtracking and zig-zaging(The walls that look like bricks and the vertical hedge walls that don't look like they have a bit missing from the top can't be destroyed). This leaves the options of collecting keys from the easiest places on previous levels, killing more bosses than needed, and finding keys in containers(More on this in the RNG manipulation section). 
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Bosses
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Bosses are the largest ammo consumers in this run right behind the rockets used for walls. I need to make sure I have enough rockets, Pandora's boxes, and the flame thrower from level 22. For more information on the bosses take a look at the level breakdown section.

	" Bonus Victims
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"When a character reaches 40,000 points the player receives a bonus victim, allowing the player to have an extra victim to collect. This can be devastating for a speed run if this bonus is gotten on a level where the 2nd victim is in a place that is far away from the final victim or if the 2nd victim is in a place that the enemies can't get to them to get rid of them. I needed to manage their scores so that the bonus victim appeared on level 36. This is why on level 35: Boardwalk of Terrors I pickup the dollars and gold to get exactly 40,000 points on the ideal level for a quick kill on the 2nd survivor. This is also why one of the characters ends the game just under 40,000 points.

	$LF

[p 
	"I found a trick with the rocket launcher on this level. When you shoot the rocket a small white cloud "poofs" out in front of it before the rocket does. That poof does the same amount of damage as the rocket. So it's possible to roughly double the damage from the rocket launcher by making sure the poof hits the target. This seems to only work when facing north. This is how I manage to 1 cycle the first two snakeoids.

	"This is the one of two or three places in the game that would be faster to get hurt, it seems like walking over the spikes near the end as opposed to waiting for them to go down would have save about 20-30 frames. The animation of taking damage is pretty long.

	"This is the level that I discovered how to manipulate the RNG more. I was struggling to find anything useful out of the cabinets before the doors had a chance to finish opening. I found that if I invoke the RNG by opening one of the cabinets before the other I could choose from a larger pool of items. I was aiming to get a skeleton key, but it seems that these cabinets were only pulling from a pool of about 10 items, speed shoes being the best of that pool.

	"At this point I was in desperate need of another skeleton key before. This level being one of the last chances to get one in a short amount of time Before Level 46: Day Of The Chainsaw. I go into more detail about how important it is to have at least 1 skeleton key when going to Level 46 in the skeleton key routing section. I wrote a Lua script to check the the cabinet on different frames and save screenshots of the outcomes to a folder. I used a mystery potion to invoke the RNG like a did in Level 41: "Martians Go Home!" I ended up getting the skeleton key after only waiting 3 frames in front of the container and a ghost potion from the mystery potion which helped collect the survivor that was in the water. Score!

	"Luckily I did have one skeleton key for this level. If I didn't I would have to take a massive detour to the opposite side of the level that would require lots of backtracking, zig zagging, and would require a minimum of 14 more walls to be destroyed for the shortest path. See the routing section on skeleton keys for more information.

	"This level was fun. I manipulated the first two snakeoids to die close together, then kill the third closer to the exit. I use the time that it is exploding to collect the first two skeleton keys and use a football player to boost the character back to the last snakeoid about 2 frames before it drops the third skeleton key. Pretty damn slick if in my opinion. Then finish the level by getting a skeleton key out of the cabinet

	"At the start of the fight a Dracula shows up. I'm fairly sure it's programmed to do that the time the fight starts. I manage to have him appear inside of the boss and freeze him with the fire extinguisher.

[p 
	"After the first phase is complete I remove the webs with the weed whacker because the webs inhibit movement if walked on them. I also think it looks pretty cool when cleaning them up. While this is going on the female character is refreezing the Dracula. The Dracula becomes unfrozen during the 2nd phase, but he doesn't cause too much trouble.
	$LF

[p 
	"I tried hard to find out the boss's health for the 2nd phase from the memory, but it doesn't seem like there is any place in the memory that counts down, or up, reliably. I looked at guides online for what weapon I should use, but they weren't much help. So I went with what was used in other speedruns and the other TAS, water gun and flame thrower. However, They do seem surprisingly effective against this phase.

	"While I personally believe this is a very solid run. There are a few things I've learned along the way about RNG, routing, and game mechanics that I found out too late to implement them to the fullest extent. I did do a lot of research before starting the run, but some of the information I gathered turned out to be wrong, wasn't available, or could only be gathered by experience though speed running the game.
	$LF

[p 
	"1. Have a script for RNG manipulation at the beginning of the game.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"For most of the game I manually manipulated the RNG(Checking the container, advancing the frame by 1, checking the container, repeat). Having a script helped me find items I needed much easier and helped me check a wider range of possibilities. The script I used did the same method I used, but took screenshots of the outcomes and saved them with their named saved as the frame the container was opened. With this it would be possible to get more skeleton keys out of the containers.

	"2. Pandora's boxes are terrible for most things in a TAS. Don't collect them after Level Level 8: Titanic Toddler.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"All of the guides I looked at online said that the Pandora's box was the most powerful item in the game that was able to do the most damage to enemies and bosses. The last TAS of this game used them on bosses as well. So I considered this when planning the routing for the game, picking up all of the Pandora's boxes I could. When I actually got to the boss and got the idea to search for the bosses health in the memory I found out the average Pandora's box only does about 2 damage on average, while a well place soda or rocket could do about 6 to the spider boss. Pandora's box also stops the character's movements when activated.

	"However, against the toddler boss they are still very effective. Especially since that boss is very fast and able to hit the player easily.

[p 
	"This was a no damage run for two reasons. I feel that it is more impressive when no damage is taken and there are only about 3 instances in the game that taking damage could have saved time. Those 3 instances also wouldn't have save much time either. The animation for taking damage is very long .
