	"The category itself is, of course, the interesting part. Full map completion for various different types of games has not always been received very well. And on the surface, in this game it may not look to add much more than what the

	"I've watched the run a few times now, and I feel like there's still some interesting content shown in this movie that isn't in other categories. For example, Buried Chamber is passed through here, while it is entirely skipped in every other category of this game. Other locations like Sandy Grave or Nation of Fools are also usually only minimally seen as the shortest path to the boss is taken. The run does a good job at showing just how much there is to offer in this game.

	"One more thing also helps the map completion goal in this game - it is the game's official percentage completion goal. The game defines 1000% completion simply as getting 100% map data in each of the 10 locations, and therefore this movie fulfills the game's own definition of full completion. Defeating Brauner and Richter who are in "off-limits" areas is a slight extra, but it's small enough that it can be considered a relatively minor trade-off for a feel of added completeness.

	"Now, while accepting this movie would entail publishing a 5th branch for this game, I think in this case it is still reasonable. Two of the branches are essentially side-modes that use different sets of characters. The primary game and story mode (with Jonathan & Charlotte) can do fine with three branches, with one skipping the majority of the game, then one middle-ground run with maximized action, and finally a full-completion movie. Considering this movie counts as full completion, the Vault rules alone would already justify the existence of this category - although it clearly passes the entertainment bar for Moons.

	"In conclusion, I'm accepting this to Moons as a new branch (labeled as "1000%"), with the 100% completion tag.
