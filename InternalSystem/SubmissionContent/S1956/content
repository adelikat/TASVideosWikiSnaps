	"On a personal perspective, I believe a lot of people totally disliked this game and the way it was played.  Some of the reasons include the physics, the GFX, the controls, and perhaps even the story.  As a movie, you see everything.  As a game, it skips several acts including the "2 weeks" scene.

	"But the objective here is to TAS this game to the extreme, whether it sux or not.  After you watch this, you'll see this game is known for walking in the air after coming out of stage 3 (security hall checkpoint), a red soldier moon-walking on a subway train, and finally the infamous dance to enemy gunshots at Quaid's apartment.

	"As explained in the previous runs, Quaid knew what all to do.  And watching out for signs of lagging is important.  One symptom is picking the right time to fire shots.  Another symptom of lag is in the driving stage of Mars, you'll notice the screen slows down like a camel while Quaid's green car starts heading toward the   right-hand side of the screen.  If you experience these problems, chances are, this might result in a sloppy run.  For an entertainment system more than 20 years old, most games will put too many objects (like vehicles in Mars) or even too much speed (like Zelda II - check out the glitches Inzult used), that's where NES's processor has a hard time keeping up with "everything!"  From there on, that is where things get sloppy.  But here, it's the game's fault, not mine.

	"This is a run improved by 4 seconds, leaving me to settle with barely under 7 minutes.  This my third TAS attempt for this game as I already contributed a lot of speed with a little entertainment to this game within the past week or so.  But 7 minutes is still the fastest I have seen and done thus far.
