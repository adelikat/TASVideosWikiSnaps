	"Drake & Josh is a GBA game based on the Nickelodeon show of the same name. Taken from scenarios of several of the show's episodes, this game is a problem-solving, stealth, exploration game. In this run, the duo decides stealth just isn't their style, and rushes through all their problems.

I actually wanted to do a 100% run that also grabs all items, and actually posted a route for it on the forum thread, but the luck required drives me away from doing it. A lua script with the game's address is also on the thread's first post.

The black sheep had a somewhat bad spawn location, but when I made it closer it faced the entrance and would immediately stun me as I got near. So instead I manipulated the nearby white sheep to be spawn lower south, then use the sheep clipping glitch to trap the black sheep. I also managed to lure another white sheep to run near the doorway so I can grab it quickly. All these great spawns were rather ruined by the last 2 sheep's terrible luck.

Since getting stunned makes me able to walk through doors, there's nothing much to say except that losing the state using the janitor is faster than restarting from a checkpoint. I have to do this, since walking past the trigger will not load the new section I need to be. Instead, it leads to a dead end. Oh, and the paintballs interrupted the caught animation, so I was able to go past the camera.

		"End camera movement earlier - Once you hit a switch and the camera moves to the door, as soon as the door opens you can open and close it to immediately gain control again. This is only worth it if the camera moves far away however. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Slightly faster diagonal movement - Moving diagonally makes you move at 204 rather than 272 speed. So if you want for example to move a bit up/down, it is sometimes better to autofire up/down while moving horizontally, since this makes the speed change from 272 to 204 every frame. This is occasionally slower however.  Same applies to running with Josh.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Start pipe flow early - At the pipe minigame, the game allows you to start the flow without ever placing a single pipe. This allows me to set up and playaround a bit while the soda flows.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Skip dialogue - Press start 2 frames before the screen fades to black; this causes the dialogue to get skipped. Note: This should not be done at the end, since it may make the game stuck. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Sheeps and walls - Throwing sheeps up/down while there's a wall to the left causes them to zip through and get thrown further. Same for a certain spot at doorways.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Caught state - If you get caught, getting stunned, pausing, sheep escaping, calling girlfriend, etc. all  interrupt the animation and allows you to continue. This is far less useful than it seems, and is used in 1 place.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Ending foodfight early - While the goal is to avoid having 5 people reach the exit, they failed to actually check if that occurred, so as soon as 5 people/sheep reaches the end, you "win" regardless. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Bumping NPCs - The NPCs immediately pause and face you if you bump into them. Thanks to their conic vision, they have a very narrow view to immediate sides of them. This can be used to make moving NPCs pause and also grab thier attention.
