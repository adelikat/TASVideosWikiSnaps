	"Run lasts around 18:39 seconds (take off 15 for the title
	$LF

	"Improvements?  Maybe you can gain seconds by ignoring the
	$LF
	"weapon dropships in the overhead levels, but then said
	$LF
	"levels become MUCH harder to cope with later on. I miss the
	$LF
	"odd missile here and there on the side-scrolling levels.  
	$LF
	"Without hunter these are impossible to kill.  There is no 
	$LF
	"way to get hunter earlier in the game, and weapons from

	"top-view levels don't carry over to side-view levels.

	"After this movie finishes, you'll eventually get back to

	"the title screen.  Press A+START to get to the options.

	"You will then be able to select
	$LF
	"and start on ANY level from 1 to 9.  Good luck trying 9. ;P
