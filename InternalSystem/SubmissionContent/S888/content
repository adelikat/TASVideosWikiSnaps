	"I worked hard on this run, and take a break some month. But I now there are some little errors in this one. Most are in the earlier Stages, but I have done already many other things as someone found these errors. So I have not found the time to do all again. Sorry. But at all these little errors take maybe only some little seconds which you will not notice in this run. So enjoy this run and see how fast you can defeat some Bosses.
