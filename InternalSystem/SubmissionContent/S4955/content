	"It's not a speedrun. The point of this movie is not for speed. Also, the first 22 levels don't contribute much in the whole 1000-level movie. So, I didn't optimize them much. Level 23+ are not bad.
	$LF

[p 
	"The Pac-Man eats fruits since level 7. It doesn't eat fruits in the first 6 levels, because the speed is slow and the value of the fruits is low. The goal of the movie is not to minimize the number of levels. It's the similar reason why it doesn't eat ghost.

	": For a run to be hosted here, it has to be as optimized as possible in every possible aspect, which this run clearly isn't. You said yourself in the description of the YouTube video you posted that your bot only outputs a working solution, not the fastest solution or the best solution. What we would want in this case is the fastest solution, a movie that achieves the goal of overflowing the counter in the shortest possible time.

[p 
	"I get the feeling you don't fully understand the purpose of the site as of now and that you weren't expecting that this would be judged as a speedrun, and that's fine. It's an honest mistake. We host speedrun records first and foremost, not just any run that is tool-assisted. In the future, I would recommend posting things like this in the general forums instead of submitting them to the site, as submitting them to the site means they will be judged as all other submissions are judged.

[p 
	"I'll have to reject this run, but I do hope you stick around and join the community. There's definitely a place on the forums to discuss the bot and this input file, and perhaps you can continue working to produce a much faster, submittable run someday.
