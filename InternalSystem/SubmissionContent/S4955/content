You said yourself in the description of the YouTube video you posted that your bot only outputs a working solution, not the fastest solution or the best solution. What we would want in this case is the fastest solution, a movie that achieves the goal of overflowing the counter in the shortest possible time.

We host speedrun records first and foremost, not just any run that is tool-assisted. In the future, I would recommend posting things like this in the general forums instead of submitting them to the site, as submitting them to the site means they will be judged as all other submissions are judged.
