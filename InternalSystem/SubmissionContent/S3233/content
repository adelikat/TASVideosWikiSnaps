	"Super Mario Bros. Parallel Air (SMB1 Hack) differs from SMB Air 1 & 2 hacks. This hack is extremely hard, and I had fun creating a run for it. This hack is based on the SMB Air 1 hack. Find the quickest way to complete this puzzle. The trick which saved the most time was the coin block trick. It can be done while doin' the sneak a block trick and grabbing the coin at the same time and pressing left.

	"The most annoying part was in Air 1-1. The fireball part was a pain to do. What more is there to say? Oh yes, jumping through blocks with or without autofire.
