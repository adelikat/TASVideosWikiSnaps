	""Flipull" is a simple puzzle game. The game objective is erase a pile of blocks. You always have a block and can throw it. When a thrown block collides with the same kind blocks, they will be erased. Afterwards, when a thrown blocks collides with the different kind block, they are swapped. This game was never released outside of Japan.
