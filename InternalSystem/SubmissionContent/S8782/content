		" Dive Bomb by pressing D while in air, if you stay Dive Bombing for a few seconds Alfred will turn into a rocket and be able to break multiple blocks. Dive Bombing is the only way to kill enemies, when you kill an enemy it will bounce you a set height, higher than a normal jump, while in that bounce you are invulnerable. The Dive Bomb can be cancelled by pressing A/B

[ul

		" On Level 1 I lose 1 frame entering the first door and 3 frames collecting the last balloon, and on Level 2 I lose 1 frame on the short 2nd room. These frames are lost to manipulate the snail with a gun near the exit door on Level 2 room 4 to stop and shoot so it doesn't block the door
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" On Level 4 I lose 1 frame entering the first door, this is to manipulate the exploding enemy so I can fall more to the left without its shrapnel touching me
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" On Level 6 I lose 1 frame entering the door after the vertical room with the ball spike so I get a better star effect collecting the first balloon in the following room, otherwise I'd lose 3 frames to lag instead of 1
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" On Level 5 I lose 1 frame on room 5 entering the door, on Level 8 I lose 2 frames exiting the clock room, on Level 9 6 frames could be squeezed with better movement and on Level 10 3 frames are lost entering the water room. These frames are lost to get good cycles on both the bouncing spike balls on Level 9 and Level 10
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" On Level ? (11) I lose 2 frames entering the first door, this is done to get a better position of the orbit power-up so it can kill one of the fish enemies when diving into the water

	"There's also the posibility that you can jump off the last moving platform on Level 6 earlier, since it's barely not possible by one pixel, maybe there's a way I missed

	" . The WR holder does a great job with the game, but he misses key jumps and other critical strategies that put him behind. Plus, you plow through the risks that asilon seems to avoid for safety reasons. I enjoyed watching this and it was a good game choice.
