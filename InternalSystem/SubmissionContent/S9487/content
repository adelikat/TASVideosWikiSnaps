	"I wanted to work on this game ever since I finished my first Arkanoid movie. However, the main limiting factor is that the mapper wasn't supported by QuickNES (the emulator core I used for botting). So I decided to update QuickNES to its latest version in libretro (one with many more mappers supported). In the meantime I also improved its performance and added support for the Arkanoid inputs. This work resulted in the new

	", once again...excellent job. You did the right thing here...using your existing BOT, to blow away another game. Even though I have tried the same thing with a similar situation, mine didn't pan out to be the same at all. :( So...I'm glad to see that you were able to chalk up another one of these amazing TASes. Congratulations again!
