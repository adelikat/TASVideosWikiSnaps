However, there are a few very small windows on the control stick where pressing down while holding shield on a platform will actually allow the player to fall through immediately. This is one of the more popular ways to be able to immediately act with an aerial move when standing on a platform, as it is faster even than jumping.

]h4
[div class=p 
	"Another one of the most well known of Melee's techniques, L-canceling consists of pressing L, R, or Z just before landing with an aerial move (within a 7 frame window before landing). If done correctly, this will cut the landing animation from the aerial in half, allowing the character to perform their next action sooner.

]h4
[div class=p 
	"If a character lands on the ground while doing an aerial attack, they usually will have a landing animation that's specific to the attack. However, depending on the aerial, the landing animation will not trigger if the character is early enough or late enough into the aerial's move animation while landing. In those cases, the normal 4-frame landing animation will play instead.

[h4 id=EdgeCancelling 
	" Edge-cancelling

[div class=p

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"When landing with an aerial while having some horizontal momentum, the character can still slide a slight bit during the landing. If during this time they slide off a ledge, it will cancel the landing animation entirely - if the player is facing in the direction they are sliding, it will cancel into their teeter animation (which can itself be cancelled by any ground move); if the player is facing the opposite direction, they will slide off the edge and immedately be able to act in the air.

[div class=p 
	"During the startup animation of entering shield, Yoshi is fully invincible. If a move hits Yoshi during this timeframe (the timing window for this can be between 2-4 frames, depending on a few factors), it will bounce off and not affect Yoshi at all. Yoshi can also jump out of this state, enabling a quick counter-attack. Using this window to block attacks is what is known as parrying.

In Yoshi's case, he doesn't really get shield stun, but he will be pushed back ridiculously quickly, typically quickly sliding him off the edge of whatever platform he is on.

[div class=p 
	"One particular property of these characters' double jumps is that if they are cancelled by an aerial, it cancels their trajectory.
