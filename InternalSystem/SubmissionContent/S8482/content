	"Super Monkey Ball Adventure is the final Gamecube release in the series. It expands on the prior games in a number of ways, most notably through its open-world story mode, mission system, and increased lore. To achieve a 100% completion we must successfully reunite and spread all the joy we can between the kingdoms.

Unfortunately there are no emulators capable of TASing the PSP version currently, so we are stuck with the Gamecube version.

	"Running this game at lower clock speeds allows the monkey to roll faster in challenge mode, and on the PSP version, you can progressively lower the clock speed until stages don't even load in anymore. Unfortunately we can't do this on hardware for Gamecube, so the lowest we have available is 50Hz.

More specifically, we need 100 joy points in all 4 worlds of the game, which are obtained in various amounts from the missions and Naysayer enemies. One of the missions requires us to collect 700 bananas throughout this run to make a banana donation to a monkey named Makmak. Due to this one mission being such a major part of the routing, total banana count is listed separately in the mission route table.

	"Most simply, holding up is the fastest form of movement in Story Mode. Continuing to hold Up on the control stick and rotating the camera is faster than changing the direction of the control stick. It's always better to hold anywhere in the range of Up-Left to Up-Right relative to the camera, so this is done whenever possible. The camera rotates on its own sometimes, and it moves at a faster speed than we can manually control it. Sometimes its more optimal to let the camera rotate itself so that we can start using Up inputs sooner than if we had rotated the camera ourselves.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"In the Challenge Mode, or Puzzle Realm Stages the optimal form of movement differs from Story Mode quite a bit. Instead of holding straight Up, we opt for a more traditional play style familiar to competitive SMB players, specifically in the technique of Frame Boosting. Holding Up-Left or Up-Right at the start of each stage gives the monkey more speed compared to just holding Up. However, unlike the first 2 games in the series, we can now also perform back and forth Snaking to continually increase our speed both in the air and on the ground.

	"As such, chanting takes on a much larger role than the prior TAS. It was discovered in the middle of that old TAS, but techniques were fleshed out after its creation.

Using this we can do a few fun things, and in turn this is the most glitchy menu we utilize in this run.

[div class=p 
	"Examples of this can be seen during Monkey Island Lighthouse 1, we use flowers multiple times to store speed so high that it sends us to a specific spot on the map. We also use it on its own in Air and Fire automotons to a lesser extent to accomplish faster missions.

The forced textbox comes up first as normal, then the initiated one comes up without any option to clear it. This initiated text box is now stored, so any future textbox will automatically accept the text when closing it.

Another is to make sure the input order is correct, such that you initate the textbox before the forced one comes up. In a simple sense, the game gets confused on the order and beings up a text box incorrectly, that text box then gets stored for later stuff.

At this point we still need to finish Ru'fus's mission in Moonhaven Entrance since it is the Final Mission in the world, all of these must be completed to allow the game to end.
