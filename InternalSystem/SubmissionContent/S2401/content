	"5th floor: Saved the equivalent of 2 jumps. Being hold by the enemy costs the same total of frames as jumping. The reason I've done so is because the same enemy goes back and thus doing an extra jump. Also, Deviance did an extra jump to manipulate the boss which wasn't needed for me. Also improved the boss fight by a little. Attacking him then he counterattacks makes the boss go some pixels farther, which doesn't block me as much as in old runs. Also, it looks better. Gained 1 timeunit. In-game timer 1550.

[div class=p 
	"Jumping at end of a floor(level) doesn't cost 2 frames. What matter is that the player hits the left or right side of the level. No matter if you jump or not. Ending the movie earlier doesn't cost 2 frames. In other words, ending the movie earlier that way  doesn't make the AVI longer nor shorter. Only the fm2. Also as mentionned, that movie doesn't aim for fastest time but only timeunits. It is possible to finish the game faster by sacrificing some timeunits due to different strategy that involves taking damage and thus, reducing the time of end of level bonus.
