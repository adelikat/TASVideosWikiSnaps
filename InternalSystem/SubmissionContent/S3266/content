		"Luck Manipulation
	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Luck is manipulated in the run by abusing the game’s path drawing algorithm. When there are multiple ways to reach the same location (eg/ by pressing a diagonal input), the game’s random number generator determines which path to take.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"It should come as no surprise that the most efficient way to burn RNs is to draw a diagonal path as far as a character can move, then “wobble” the cursor back and forth between 2 spots, forcing the RNG to make as many decisions about the path drawn as possible.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Just to give a quick idea how efficiently RNs can be burned, a 7-move unit can use about 4.3 RNs/frame on average, assuming there are no obstructions in their path such as enemies, walls or special terrain. When performing calculations I generally assume 5 RNs per frame can be burned.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There are two ways I track what I like to call the game’s RNG state. From a cleared SRAM, the initial 3 values of the RNG are 8, 56 and 21, and every subsequent RN is determined by applying some formula to the previous 3 RNs. Thus, I would say the RNG’s state is 53/21/12 if those are the last 3 RNs the game used.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Thanks to Nitrodon, I am able to use an RNG table as an invaluable tool for planning RN manipulations. Not only can I track the game’s RNs for any RNG state I want, I can also run simple tests to determine the points at which complex conditions are satisfied.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"After amaurea made a lua script that shows on-screen a list of RNs and some battle stats, i modified it to do more stuff:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Filter Mode: The Battle Data dissapears and it allows you to Turn On the Input Mode.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Input Mode: It allows you to introduce conditions into the script, so the script will tell wich nunmbers satisfy said conditions, for instance, you want to look for a critical, 75% Hit and 3% Critical.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"You just need to introduce 75 in frame advance using the number keys in the middle of the keyboard, after you introduce the 2 numbers, a "<" will appear, you can press left and right to change between 6 different operators, so i choosed "<" and later stablish if the number you introduced is to calculate Hit (Hit are calculated different from all other) by pressing H, afterwards i press Enter. Then introduce 03 and choosed "<", afterwards i press Enter and then "O" to deactivate Input Mode, this will go back to Filter Mode, and it will show wich numbers satisfy the stablished conditions, in adittion, it will tell the distance of the 3 nearest numbers that satisfy the conditions between 500 numbers.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Another method is to use an Excel spreadsheet that has the algorithm and can be used to look for multiple conditions at the same time.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"For Enemy Phase manipulation, DarkKobold made a script that creates a savestate when it starts running (must start running at the start of Enemy Phase), then when the whole Enemy Phase finish, it loads the savestate and now burn 1 RN before the Enemy Phase starts and it keeps doing this, this allows the TASer to look multiple Enemy Phases to choose a desired one, since the script also tells how many RNs have been burned, it let's the TASer knows how much RNs are needed to manipulate.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I also modified this script, it now shows the RNG Table in amaurea's original script and also battle stats, in adittion, if you press the key "Q" it skips one whole Enemy Phase.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"And something more, if im looking for an specific condition (like one of my units to get 2 level ups on Magic) i search for a memory adress that has the value desired, then at the end of each Enemy Phase, it will record the RNs needed on a list, so the TASer can go out or get to sleep while the script tells 10 usefull Enemy Phases, though this can only be usefull for TASers that can program in lua, since the condition must be built from inside the script.

		"Moving 2 Units In The Same Square
	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Basically, when you draw a path for one unit that’s 1 space away from another unit, you can move the cursor towards the impeding unit for one frame, then move the cursor away from said unit while pressing A. This results in both units occupying the same square.

		"Mine Glitch
	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This is an easy glitch to do, basically, i make someone drop a Mine in a spot, when the enemy moves to that place, you must restart when the animation of the mine starts and before it ends, when you resume the game, you will be able to control enemies as how you like, you can make them drop items, move to specific spot, make them rescue themselves, etc.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Another way to trigger this glitch is using PWASE (Panels Wich Affect Something Else), as far as i know, the only panel that have this are the fire tiles in Chapter 28, wich has the same animation of the mine glitch. So when an enemey lands on a PWASE, you can reset to do the mine glitch and control enemy units (this must be with frame precision).

		"Avoiding Tutorial Steps
	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Lyn Normal Mode is sort like a Tutorial, and it forces you to do some actions by forcing you to select specific units and by disabling the B Button. I was able to use the B button by holding A, L and R, so if you hold/press B it will be usable, also if you press those 4 buttons the game would restart, so any other button would be need to be holded, so i used Start aswell.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"So, when i select the unit the game want me to choose, i de-select him with the above input, and the game thinks you already used him, moving you to the next step of the tutorial if there is, if there isn't, im able to choose whoever i want and moving it, though, sometimes it crashes the game, so im also a bit limited.

This saves a whole turn and a great ammount of time. Later i used Florina to get the Warp Staff, and the rest to kill the rest of enemies.
