	"I'm calling this branch "Downhill" because there is also a "Slalom" course which has a completely different layout and I think would be eligible for its own branch. For each course, you may select a slope number from 1 to 15. The higher the slope number, the steeper the grade, meaning slope 15 (as selected in the TAS) is the fastest and therefore the hardest.

	"Frankly, I'm not sure if this submission would be considered complete after Heat 1 or Heat 3. The main purpose of the TAS is fulfilled with just the first heat alone but site rules consider a submission complete when you get to the final screen, and you must play the trivial Heats 2 and 3 to do that here. In that case, I considered ending input early a secondary goal of the TAS, which is cool because all three heats can be played differently. If only Heat 1 is needed for this submission to be complete, please truncate the movie to frame 1960 (0:32.71).

		" The skier can be pointed in 24 discrete directions (15-degree intervals), which can be rotated through via holding the left or right side of the disc. As you might expect, facing perfectly forward goes down the slope the fastest. Facing even one angular interval off that has some velocity component directed sideways, so we need to navigate down the slopes and through the gates with the tightest lines possible.

	"To get the fastest in-game time, you must ski between all the gates or else a 5-second penalty is incurred for each. Running into a gate does not incur a penalty but it slows you down slightly. To take the fastest lines, the edge of a given gate is treated as a pivot point for the next set which must be pivoted for (so just like regular skiing!). Now, remember the limitation that the skier can only rotate in increments of 15 degrees? The most optimal lines are often between these increments so in these instances, a more sideways angle than needed is used for the minimum time possible to maximize downhill speed.

Even with taking the tightest lines, this TAS is only 0.2 seconds (the smallest unit of in-game time) faster so big shoutouts to Intellivision Master on his achievement!
