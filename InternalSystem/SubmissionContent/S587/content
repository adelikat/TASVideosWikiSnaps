	"This movie includes the fights with Jinx and Culex. Although the movie may have shorter without them, it is more interesting to be able to observe them and take advantage of their rewards later in the game. The Lucky Jewel is used in most of the boss fights, most notably in the Culex fight for a colossal 488 experience and double level-ups for almost everyone. The Lucky Hammer was bought to use against the Shoguns to save the Lucky Jewel for use in more effective instances (i.e. the Culex fight).

	"Timing for freebies was the most tedious aspect. I would have liked to have used less Rock Candies and Fire/Ice Bombs, but at least I was able to alternate a lot between them instead of constantly using the same thing over and over, and I often managed without them.

	"The rerecord count is not accurately conceivable. It should be much larger since a lot of the controller data was hexed from the test version (which had a rerecord count of 26462). The hexed data is only from out of battle in places where there were no problems to begin with.
