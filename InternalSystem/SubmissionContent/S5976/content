	"Bugs Bunny & Taz: Time Busters is a Looney Tunes platform game, with some similarities with Spyro games. A notable feature of the game is the 2 players mode, one of them controlling Bugs Bunny and the other one Taz.

	"Pushing a box against an immovable Bugs may result in the box standing in the air, and if Bugs then teleported on this box, he will pass through the ground. Now it's important to know that when you are falling OOB, you will get teleported in a default position once you reach the bottom of the level (usually where you started the level), except if you are gliding as Bugs, in which case the game will just teleport you on top of the level.

	"The count is manipulated to appear next to Bugs at the beginning. Only the first gargoyle can be "pushed" by Bugs, since the other ones will crush him. There is a huge difference for this fight in the PSX NTSC version compared with all the other ones (including PSX PAL) : you can't push the second and fourth gargoyles without hitting the count first. So was it better to use the NTSC or the PAL version of this game ? That's a good question.

	"Another thing that makes this movie slower is the fact that the final battle presents a difference only featured in the PSX NTSC version, as also mentioned by the author. However, the PSX NTSC version of this game is still preferred aganist the PSX PAL one since the difference would not be major. Also, if we take in account the difference in framerate, the movie time could even end up longer.
