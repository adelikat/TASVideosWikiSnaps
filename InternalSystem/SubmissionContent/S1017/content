	"This is a 42.5 seconds improvement over my previous submission. Many things were improved and this version was made with what i consider nearly perfect precision for this game, but the biggest improvements come from pizza battles and wack-a-mole stages.

	"This run aims for fastest completion without killing a single enemy or dangerous devices. It's a 100% pacifist run (except for the bosses who starve to death!). Why this? because the game is too easy for a normal play through, anybody who have played the game will see that this is no easy thing to pull out. Personally, i think it's humanly impossible to beat the game this way, especially because of the acquired momentum jump required over the green worm box outside the factory stage. There was only 1 possible way to pass through it, 1 frame or pixel wrong meant certain death.

	"The warps proved useless, except for when they were used to skip pizza contests. It was, surprisingly, faster to just finish the level, if it had no pizza contest at it's end. So, the run uses 2 warps only, the one at the circus and the one at the haunted mansion.

	"The bug i exploit is to keep the extra horizontal speed of either the invincibility or the black outfit powerups after they wear off. This is acomplished by not standing on the ground for longer than 1 frame (keep jumping, rabbit!).
