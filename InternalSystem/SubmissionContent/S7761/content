	"Here is my first public TAS of a video game. I chose Mini-Putt as my first submission to tasvideos. The version of Mini-Putt that is showcased is the version in BlueMaxima's Flashpoint flash game archive listed as the default newer version, which is why I put the game version as "unknown v1.1" as I am unsure if there are more than two versions released. Mini-Putt was the first of a trilogy, with the first game being created in 2005 by PsychoGoldfish and was published to addictinggames.com (which is also listed as the source on BlueMaxima's archive). The game contains a mini-golf course of 18 holes that are completed by putting to the hole. The fastest method of completing most of the holes, from what I have tested, is skimming the golf ball directly over the hole then bouncing it off a wall back into the hole. Once your ball is a slow enough speed, the ball always goes in as long as it's touching the hole. Skimming the hole significantly lowers the ball's speed and momentum, allowing you to hit the ball extra hard and still make it in (given you can bounce off a wall after). This method is trickier to perform on some holes efficiently, which means you will not see it in every hole. Each strategy I used for every hole will be explained below in the stage by stage comments.

You might ask: "Why didn't you bounce off the angled stones through the narrow path?". Well, the hitboxes of the angled stones are very inconsistent with a faster putt, making that route very tricky to make at a fast speed. It would likely require you to putt at a slower speed, which means skimming may not work here. I figured it's more likely that skimming with the angle of the wider path would be faster (and probably easier). Bouncing off the narrow path walls like the wider path with a different angle may be faster here (if it can also be skimmed).
