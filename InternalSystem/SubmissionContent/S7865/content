	"When I was a child, a friend of mine owned this game and it looked interesting since the movie was awesome.  He let me borrow it (a real friend would have spared me from this).  It didn't take long for me to hate this game.  But I was a nerd, and I insisted on a beating the game.  For a few weeks there, I would play this, and get angry and make steady progress only to find there is no fun factor at any point in this frustrating and repetitive game.  One day I finally did it, I beat the last stage.  I pulled the game out of my NES and I threw it across the room, said some not nice words and I never played the game again.  I don't know if I gave the game back to my friend, it's not like he was asking for it back.  If I hadn't of had the misfortune of renting Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde, this would have been the worst game I ever played.

	"You may notice some crazy glitching, that's from presing L+R or U+D.  I made it an artificial goal in these stages to get all clocks and kill no bees. It isn't because I want to save bees or anything, just that they are hardest enemy in the game (you know, like the movie) so it is an attempt to artificially make these levels interesting.  Note that Supper hit on the same strategy in his movie.

	"These may look familiar, and why is that music still playing?? Yeah, the only speed strat is to not get hit.  I get all the clocks and kill no bees.  Also, I found a frame you can get hit at the end of the level and it makes the "getting hit" sound effect but continues to the next level (doesn't cost or save time), so that's something I guess.

	"You need to hit 50 enemies (seriously, 50! Try this in real time, it's hard, you get no retries, and there is no fun factor).  The game doesn't tell you that you won, you just lose after 50 and it shows that you went to the next level.  Great game.

	"This is the only level in the game where there is something interesting to do speed-wise.  I found a pattern where I can get the top enemy to be the one that "gets you".  Aside from that it is to make sure to plan the enemy to not be the last one, you want to be hitting enemies while one is walking to you.  Also, only 3 enemies can be on the screen at once, so that requires you to be fast, sometimes.  Also, hit the waitress as soon as possible, she counts towards the total enemies count.  All she does is deliver you a milk shake...But you are behind the bar that has them..and you clearly don't need it, you are flinging them all over the place. Great game.

You have to get 99 hearts (score of 50, each one counts as half).  Again the game doesn't tell you, you have to lose.  By now you can guess 50 at least.  Again no fun factor.  Worse yet, nothing interesting in terms of speed strats.  You can get Lorraine to do different patterns but it doesn't affect speed.  The rate of hearts is always the game, and the amount of time she spend walking after you miss one is the same regardless of her position.
