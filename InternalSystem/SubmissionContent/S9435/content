It's used for Gravity Man's stage and Gyro Man's stage to get through enemies either by taking them out when they're in the way or blocking shots.

Rush Jet does allow for a slightly quicker ascent than Rush Coil and is also used in the situations in the fortress stages where buster shots are required to progress.

It's used for some parts of Wave Man's stage for invincibility through some obstacles and is then shelved until it's needed for Wave Man.

	"Gyro Attack was used at the start to manipulate 3 large weapon energy refills from enemies. The third one was used for Crystal Eye which is taken into the final boss fight. Damage was taken on the last enemy of the game to get past it quicker. The remaining Crystal Eye is first used on Wily Machine 5 until no shots remain. Napalm Bomb is used to take out the rest of the first phase. Bad boss RNG from the vacuum attack meant that there was a delay in some bomb shots to avoid death. The full Gyro Attack ammo was used for the Wily Capsule fight. The first hit is done just before Wily disappears for the first time. From there it's a matter of getting two hits per capsule appearance. The last hit could then be done with an early ended input.
