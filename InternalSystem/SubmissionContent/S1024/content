	"Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow, played using Julius mode (unlocked via SRAM generated by the currently published TAS).
	$LF

[p 
	"One of the first things you may notice about this TAS is that I choose the normal mode over hard mode. In this game, hard mode doesn't add anything to the viewer entertainment side of things, and simply serves to make enemies/bosses take more hits to kill, which I dont think would be overly enjoyable to watch (a hard mode run killing an extra boss would still have a graham fight as long as the one present in this TAS).
	$LF

[p 
	"The overall goal of Julius mode is pretty much to kill Graham, and you can actually achieve this without even killing a single boss. However, doing so means you do a grand total of 1 damage per hit against him, which means it would take one hell of a long time to kill him.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Each boss you kill (and orb you grab) as Julius adds to your overall power, and the more you kill the stronger you get. In this TAS I kill 2 bosses, Creaking Skull and Headhunter, for a grand total of 2 powerups.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In this run, as opposed to the previous 2 submissions, I dont use any major glitches (just a weird one I found relating to the super jump, I have no idea how it actually works though), but it turns out faster to kill headhunter despite it having 3 forms. Personally, I thought sneak attacking Manticore looked cooler though. 
	$LF

[p 
	"After Headhunter, its pretty much direct to Graham, as deviating for a third boss, while decreasing the Graham fight time itself, adds up to be considerably longer (this is roughly 2 minutes  6 seconds faster than a test I did where I also fought Death, and 26 seconds faster than the previous attempt).

	"This is the final one I swear.  Hope you enjoy :)

	"Thanks go out to Zurreco for pointing out that glitch a while back, those on IRC who commented on it, and Bisqwit for allowing me to use SRAM in this case.
