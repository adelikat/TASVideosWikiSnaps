	"I've been working on a couple of longer runs for complicated games and needed to find a smaller project I could do to recharge. At the same time, developments happened to help speedrunners of the game, and through watching attempts, I got some ideas. Thank you to takojaki for doing runs of this game. I decided to improve my old run as a quick breather, and it did turn out to be a quick project. After I actually sat down and worked on it, that is.

	"The previous run walks a bit in order to get proper positioning for the chandeliers while the new run starts jumping immediately. It was here I found out that the platforms in this level are on a global timer.

		"If you just allow these runs to play without pausing the new one to let the old run catch up, when you get to Flugelheim, you'll see the platforms are moving exactly the same.
	]a
	" The platform to the right of the first floor has to be in a very specific spot in order for you to be able to move on. Also the cycle was long enough that I wasn't able to catch the cycle before. I went from being moderately ahead to even there. This means that any time gained in the first two levels didn't actually contribute to the time gained in the full run. That's also why the new run in the comparison video looks like it's behind for a large portion of the stage.

	"The helicopter at the end of the stage will try to adjust its position in order to hit the batplane with its missiles. If you are in position to hit it with your gun that means it'll adjust by moving up. It also likes going off the top of the screen out of bullet range. I also need to make sure that both missiles hit on every shot. It's possible (actually pretty likely) even at point blank range for you to fire missile and have one of them just pass right through. I bring the helicopter down to center screen and move upward at a time where I can make sure no missiles miss.
