	"Finally done with v2 of this game. I noticed that I missed 2 
	$LF
	"club swings at one boss in my previous version and I was 
	$LF
	"gonna fix that to make it look better. I also managed to 
	$LF
	"improve it by 17 seconds. This is because of some minor 
	$LF
	"stuffs, some jump made better, but also better manipulating 
	$LF
	"at bosses so I could kill them faster. I also "invented" 
	$LF
	"some new shortcuts. Like not waiting for the stone in the 
	$LF
	"volcano to fall down into to the lava so I could step on it.

	"Hmm. It´s Flintstones 2, it´s very similiar to the first 
	$LF
	"game but this is somewhat faster. Fred climbs faster and the 
	$LF
	"feeling I get is that it overall flows (good choice of word?

	"The major difference between the games is that now you can 
	$LF
	"switch character between Fred and Barney. Barney sucks but 
	$LF
	"he has the ability to climb ropes which is totally necessary 
	$LF
	"to complete the game.

	"And yes, I know that this might not be the best game in the 
	$LF
	"world but since I did the first one I thought this would be 
	$LF
	"as good ;P And it´s kinda funny to watch after all.

	": Since this submission has received limited interest and somewhat poor reviews, and the game is quite uninspiring (and has none of the interesting points of the first game), I'm rejecting this submission. Sorry.
