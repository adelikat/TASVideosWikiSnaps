Fortunately, our work performs better in 32 levels as is listed in the following table, while there is a draw in the other 6 levels. Thanks to MESHUGGAH’s former Submission #3893, which gives us much enlightment.

]h4
[div class=p 
	"This technique has occurred in former submissions, but not been systematically researched and utilized.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"When the character is located at the edge of a platform and is ready to jump, it leads to different results whether or not pressing Left or Right button at the first frame where Jump button (“A”) is pressed. Of course, the horizontal direction should be away from the platform. If so, a one-pixel-downward-movement is applied to the character, which enables the character to collect a star that is lower than it by one grid without jumping off the step. Meanwhile, the whole trace of the jump would be lower by one pixel.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The following are some applications of this technique.

[div class=p 
	"(1) As is mentioned above, to collect a star that is lower than it by one grid without jumping off the step;

	$LF
]div

	"(3) On the contrary, when you need to jump up to another platform at the edge, avoid pressing Left or Right button at first, and you may jump higher and reach the upper platform faster.

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"When you press Jump button for several continuous frames, the jump trace is like a parabolic curve. Compared to continuously pressing Jump button, pressing discontinuously for the same number of frames might make the character get a lower jump height but also fall slower, which is quite useful to save frames when jumping over enemies and obstacles.
