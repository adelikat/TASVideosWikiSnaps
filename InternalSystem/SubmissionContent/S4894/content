		"Xexyz
	]em
	" is a hybrid scrolling platform/scrolling shooter/tube shooter game created by Atlus and published by Hudson Soft for the Nintendo Entertainment System.  It was originally released in Japan in 1988 under the title 
	[em 
		"Kame no Ongaeshi: Urashima Densetsu
	]em
	".  
	[em 
		"Kame no Ongaeshi: Urashima Densetsu
	]em
	" is loosely based upon the Japanese legend of Urashima Tar≈ç, and features more cutscenes and endings than the North American localization, though gameplay is the same between the two versions.  Fascinating as turtles and dancing princesses are, they require a great deal of additional Frames, and so the North American localization has been chosen for this TAS.  Xexyz is a lesser-known title for the NES, being hindered by cultural differences, a lack of a European release, and an awkward title.  Despite (or in thanks to) all this, the game has maintained some degree of cult notoriety outside of Japan.  The game itself is quite fun, and features some great music.

	" Tricks and Glitches
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Levitation:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This technique requires Foot Wing.  Tapping the A button after Apollo has made a jump or High Jump further slows his descent.  While the screen is not scrolling, pressing the A button for 1 Frame on every other Frame allows Apollo to maintain his current altitude.  While Apollo's movement is scrolling the screen, pressing the A button for 1 Frame once per each 3 Frames allows Apollo to maintain his current altitude.  If Apollo approaches within 2 pixels of ground level while he is Levitating, he will Snap To ground level and Levitation is cancelled.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Double Tap:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Press Down and the B button for 1 Frame, release the B button but hold Down for 1 more Frame, and then press the B button again.  Apollo will fire 2 projectiles in just 3 Frames.  Note that Crouching causes Apollo's weapon recycle timer to stop decrementing.  When Apollo fires a crouching shot, he is forced to remain in the crouching posture for 8 Frames.  As such, it is futile to repeat the Double Tap sequentially by waiting for Apollo to stand up again; as the weapon recycle timer will still have 7 Frames remaining before the weapon can be fired again.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Press Down for 1 Frame, press the B button for 1 Frame, press the A button for 1 Frame, delay for 1 Frame, and then press the B button again.  Apollo will fire 2 projectiles in just 4 Frames.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Triple Tap:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The simplest method to follow a Double Tap is to continue with crouching shots, as they have a faster recycle time.  This allows Apollo to fire 3 shots in 10 Frames, but he must remain at his current X position.  However, the forced crouching posture caused by a crouching shot can be canceled with a Jump or High Jump.  Depending on circumstances, it may be best to Jump or High Jump after using Double Tap in order to force the weapon recycle timer to resume decrementing.  Using the Jump method allows Apollo to fire 3 shots in 12 Frames, and allows Apollo to move, but the target must be large, and it takes time to land from a Jump.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Rapidly Attack Elevated Enemy:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Vertical shots are slow to recycle because only 1 projectile is allowed on the screen at a time.  If an enemy is at a higher elevation, it can be difficult to land sufficient shots on the enemy without losing momentum.  Start by using a jump or High Jump on the earliest possible Frame that allows Apollo to hit the target 2 times before landing.  After landing, fire vertically when the enemy is overhead.  Finally, jump or High Jump on the earliest possible Frame that allows Apollo to fire the final shots vertically and destroy the enemy while Apollo is ascending toward it.  By jumping while the enemy is overhead, the travel time of the vertical projectiles is minimized, allowing more shots to be fired within a limited time.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Mini Surface Zip:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"At Speed Level 2 or above, it is possible for Mobile Armor or Cyborg Rider to enter within a surface by 1 or 2 pixels by pushing against a surface.  Depending on the specific location that the surface was entered, Apollo may be "zipped" forward or backward several pixels instantaneously.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Faster Hangar Navigation:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When Apollo is entering a Hangar while he is using a Mobile Armor or Cyborg Rider, press Left for 1 Frame on the first Frame after entering the Hangar, rather than simply holding Right.  Pressing Left for 1 Frame forces Apollo to be instantaneously pushed to the right by 8 pixels, thereby saving 7 Frames.  After pressing Left for 1 Frame, hold Right for 12 Frames until Apollo is clear of the ledge.  On the first Frame that Apollo is clear of the ledge, press Down for 1 Frame, press Down and Left for 1 Frame, and then resume hold Down and Right until Apollo lands.  Pressing Left for 1 Frame after clearing the ledge and moving down 1 pixel forces Apollo to be instantaneously pushed to the right by 2 pixels, thereby saving 2 Frames.  Using these 2 techniques saves 9 Frames overall in each Hangar.  This technique also applies to exiting a Hangar into a Shooting Mode Area, and to exiting one Shooting Mode Area into another Shooting Mode Area, though these are of course less Frame-critical.  When this technique is used upon entering a Shooting Mode Area, it also allows Apollo to begin moving up or down 1 Frame earlier.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Cancel "Damage Taken" Posture:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When Apollo takes damage, he is forced into the "damage taken" posture.  Apollo will remain in this posture, unable to take any action, until the top or bottom of his collision box collides with a surface.  Furthermore, the weapon recycle timer does not decrement while Apollo is in this posture.  Normally this means that Apollo will be bumped upward and back a bit, and the "damage taken" posture is canceled when he lands.  However, if Apollo is near enough to the ceiling or other surface above him, such that the push is sufficient to cause the top of his head to collide with the ceiling, the "damage taken" posture is canceled.  Note that Apollo's sprite will not indicate when the "damage taken" posture is canceled, but input can again be entered.  This technique is used during each time Apollo takes damage.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Snap To Surface:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If Apollo approaches within 1 pixel of a vertical surface, he will be instantaneously be moved toward the surface, skipping over the remaining 1 pixel.  If Apollo approaches within 2 pixels of ground level while he is Levitating, he will Snap To ground level and Levitation is cancelled.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Corner Snap To:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When Apollo is using Mobile Armor or Cyborg Rider to exit a Hangar, it is possible to Snap To the corner near the Door on the way out, without losing momentum.  Snapping To this corner causes Apollo to move 2 pixels for 1 Frame, instead of just 1 pixel, thereby saving 1 Frame.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Preemptive Jump:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If Apollo jumps or High Jumps just prior to entering a Door, he will immediately jump or High Jump after the transition to the next Area.  This is used in several Hangars in order to board a Mobile Armor or Cyborg Rider on the earliest possible Frame.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The "Foot Wing Wiggle":
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Apollo must be using Foot Wing while the screen is not scrolling in order for this to work.  Press Left and the A button for 1 Frame to start a jump.  Press Right for 1 Frame to begin moving to the right.  Hold Left until the jump lands.  Holding Left after pressing Right for 1 Frame will actually cause Apollo to continue moving to the right, while facing left.  While Apollo is in the air, alternately pressing Left and Right on each Frame will cause him to "wiggle" back and forth while continuing to move in the original direction of the jump, without losing momentum.  This can also be done while using Levitation by pressing the A button for 1 Frame every other Frame each time the original direction of the jump is pressed.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Backward Jump:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"After landing in a Hangar, immediately release Right.  Apollo will jump to the right while facing left.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Jump into a wall:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Apollo can jump up into the wall in an area that has an exit in the lower left.  Stand under the wall near the exit.  Face left at X 19 for a non-scrolling "room" area, or face right at X 35 for a Mechanic Castle area.  Jump straight up.  Apollo will land partly within the wall.  Jump again and Apollo will land even higher.  Continue jumping to "climb" the wall to the ceiling.  This technique is not used in this TAS.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Walk through walls:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Jump into a wall by using the "Jump into a wall" technique.  Once Apollo is within a wall, press the A button for 1 Frame, and then press the joypad in the direction of the wall for 1 Frame on the Frame prior to Apollo landing.  This allows Apollo to turn and face the wall without being pushed out by it.  Once Apollo is facing the wall, press the A button for 1 Frame, press the joypad in the direction of the wall for 1 Frame, delay for 2 Frames, and repeat.  This can also be achieved at a slower rate by pressing the A button for 1 Frame, delaying for 1 Frame, pressing the joypad in the direction of the wall for 1 Frame, delaying for 1 Frame, and then repeating.  This technique does not work if Apollo is using Foot Wing.  Unfortunately, there is no situation in the game where use of this technique is beneficial, though it is gratifying to have found a way to do so on both of the platform games I have TASed.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Midair Moon Ball Whip:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Press the B button 1 Frame before Apollo takes damage, and the Moon Ball whip will extend as he is knocked backward.  Note that this technique will not work if Apollo takes damage on the same Frame that he lands on a surface.  This technique is not used in this TAS.

[p 
	"To complete the game, Apollo must complete 12 Areas and defeat Goruza's Mechanic Fortress.  Areas alternate between Action Mode (scrolling platform) and Shooting Mode (scrolling shooter).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Energy Balls are the currency of Xeyxz.  They can be used to purchase information, Items, and Weapons, for gambling, and for boarding a Mobile Armor or Cyborg Rider.  Apollo begins the game with 50 Energy Balls.  An Energy Ball (small "E") is worth 1 Energy Ball, and is left by certain enemies when they are destroyed.  An Energy Box (large "E") is worth 5 Energy Balls, and is left by certain enemies when they are destroyed, and also found in various preset locations in Action Mode Areas.  Apollo begins the game with 50 Energy Balls.  Apollo must spend a minimum of 200 Energy Balls in order to advance through the game to the final Area.  Part 3 of Area 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 is a Shooting Mode Area which requires Apollo to spend 20 Energy Balls to enter.  Part 2 and part 3 of Area 12 are Shooting Mode Areas which require Apollo to spend 50 Energy Balls to enter.  The only thing worth purchasing that saves Frames is the Laser in Area 12.  This requires 90 Energy Balls.  Logistics is tightly managed throughout the game, such that Apollo acquires the last necessary Energy Balls moments before entering the Item Shop, with minimal deviation from the ideal route.  Only 4 of the Energy Boxes collected required deviation from the ideal route, and the maximum deviation (to collect Energy Box 1 in Area 11-1) required only 5 Frames.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If Apollo has full horizontal momentum on the first Frame of a Jump, he will be able to resume that momentum after he collides with a vertical surface by pressing Right or Left after he has cleared the surface vertically.  As such, if Apollo must jump over an obstacle to which he is standing directly adjacent, it is best to press the joystick away from the obstacle for 1 Frame before to build momentum before pressing the A button.  After the A button has been pressed, the joystick can again be held toward the obstacle, and as soon as Apollo has reached a sufficient height, he will begin to move over and past the obstacle, with full momentum.  Otherwise, Apollo will only move at 1 pixel per Frame after clearing the obstacle until the Jump has landed.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If Apollo moves into collision range on an even-numbered Frame, the effect of the collision will occur 1 Frame later than if he moves into collision range on an odd-numbered Frame.  This applies to a collision with an enemy, an Item, or a surface.  An excellent example of this effect can be observed in Area 1-1, where a row of Moai drop projectiles as Apollo walks past them.  If Apollo begins walking past the Moai on the correct Frame, each projectile will collide with Apollo on an even-numbered Frame, causing them to miss due to the additional Frame of delay, and allowing Apollo to move past the entire row of Moai unharmed.  If Apollo begins walking past the Moai on the wrong Frame, the first projectile will collide with Apollo on an odd-numbered Frame, and Apollo will be hit by it.  This effect is exploited during every Devil battle, and once in Area 5-1.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Boarding Cyborg Rider from a location farther to the right causes Cyborg Rider to spawn farther to the right after Apollo has boarded it.  This is particularly useful considering the slow speed of Cyborg Rider within a Hangar.  Note that this does not apply to Cyborg Rider or Mobile Armor in an Action Mode Area.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When Apollo's Hit Points are reduced to 0 in a Shooting Mode Area, he falls slowly downward and is destroyed when he leaves the screen.  While Apollo is falling thus, it is possible for him to enter a Door.  If Apollo enters a Door in this manner, the next Area will load.  Apollo does not lose a Life, and he can again be controlled, though his Hit Points remain at 0.  However, because his status indicates being dead, he cannot enter a Door in an Action Mode Area.  Thus, when he enters the Hangar at the end of the Shooting Mode Area, he will become permanently stuck.

	"Apollo must be standing on a surface in order for a Devil to deliver him Force Star.  Force Star itself emerges from the head of a Devil and floats toward Apollo.  Until Force Star reaches Apollo, no action can be taken.  As such, it is imperative that Apollo be as near as possible to Force Star as it emerges, in order to minimize the transit time of Force Star.  Apollo must be located between X 211 and X 213 in order to acquire Force Star on the earliest possible Frame.

Using Mobile Armor Gardex at X 234, Apollo can attack an enemy on the earliest possible Frame without being too close to an enemy to hit it.  Note that at X 234, projectiles fired straight forward will not be visible because they leave the screen too quickly, but they will still damage an enemy.  The specific X location from which to attack is dependent on the specific Mobile Armor or Cyborg Rider being used.

	"If Apollo takes damage while he is standing on a flat surface, he is pushed upward by 22 pixels and backward by 9 pixels.  The push has a maximum vertical speed of 4 pixels per Frame and a constant horizontal speed of .5 pixels per Frame (1-0 pattern) and requires a total of 17 Frames before input can be entered again.  Apollo will always be pushed away from the point of collision, regardless of which direction he is facing when he takes damage.  If Apollo moves into collision range on an even-numbered Frame, he will take damage 1 Frame later than if he moves into collision range on an odd-numbered Frame.  When Apollo takes damage, he is forced into the "damage taken" posture.  Apollo will remain in this posture, unable to take any action, until the top or bottom of his collision box collides with a surface.  Normally this means that Apollo will be bumped upward and back a bit and the "damage taken" posture is canceled when he lands.  However, if Apollo is near enough to the ceiling or other surface above him, such that the push is sufficient to cause the top of his head to collide with the ceiling, the "damage taken" posture is canceled.  Note that Apollo's sprite will not indicate when the "damage taken" posture is canceled, but input can again be entered.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When a Boss is destroyed at the end of an Action Mode Area, Apollo is moved to X 128  Y 208, and the transition to the next Area is then continued.  The nearer Apollo is to X 128  Y 208 when such a Boss is destroyed, the faster the transition will be completed.  The same principle applies to a Boss of a Shooting Mode Area, except that Apollo is instead moved to X 32  Y 128 before the transition is continued.  As such, it is more important that the last shot fired at a Boss be fired on the earliest possible Frame than to destroy a Boss on the earliest possible Frame, because firing the last shot earlier allows Apollo to begin moving toward the transition location earlier.  To this end, the first shot fired at an Action Mode Area Boss is fired from the maximum distance that will damage a Boss on the earliest possible Frame, while still allowing Apollo must be able to maintain optimum firing rate throughout the remainder of the battle.  Using the Hand Beam, the first shot must be fired from X 190, 6 Frames before the Boss spawns.  This ensures that the first shot is fired on the earliest possible Frame, allowing each subsequent shot to be fired on an earlier Frame.  Finally, the last shot fired at a Boss is fired from the maximum distance that will still allow Apollo to maintain optimum firing rate, and thus the last shot is fired on the earliest possible Frame.  This in turn allows Apollo to begin moving toward the transition location on the earliest possible Frame, and have the maximum number of Frames to move toward the transition location before the final projectile hits a Boss.  This is less of an issue with a Boss of a Shooting Mode Area, because a Cyborg Rider's weapons are less limited than Apollo's, and its speed is far greater than a Flying Saucer.

	"Lag:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If 4 or more objects are present on the screen, the game may generate "internal" Lag Frames as needed to compensate.  The emulator does not register these "internal" Lag Frames, they are all managed by the game itself; this makes them eminently more difficult to identify and remove.  In addition to slowing progress, this can cause an Item or enemy to fail to spawn, and can cause projectiles to pass through enemies.  A Lag Frame can also cause various Memory Addresses to misreport their status.  In Lag-prone conditions, it is generally best to destroy enemies on the last possible Frame in order to minimize the number of Frames that a projectile is on the screen.  Under certain circumstances in an Action Mode Area, a Lag frame which has prevented the screen from scrolling for 1 Frame will be compensated for on a later Frame by scrolling the screen by 3 pixels for 1 Frame.  Under certain circumstances in a Shooting Mode Area, a Lag frame which has prevented the screen from scrolling for 1 Frame will be compensated for on a later Frame by scrolling the screen by 2 pixels for 1 Frame.  Moving to an X location shared by another object, either by jumping or by moving up or down in a Shooting Mode Area, may also cause Lag.  Controller input may also cause Lag, even if the input does not affect Apollo.  Pushing against an obstacle may also cause Lag.  Firing a projectile several Frames prior to a Lag Frame can prevent the Lag Frame in certain circumstances.

This queue is based upon the value at Memory Address 05A2, which indicates the current position in the queue.  The range of the value is 161-203.  Each time an Item is dropped by an enemy, the value is increased by 2.  When the value advances beyond 203, it is reset to 161, and the cycle is repeated.  The value is also reset to 161 if the Kill Counter advances beyond 39 in the first part of an Area, when a Mechanic Castle is first entered, when a new main Area begins, or if Apollo is destroyed.  This means that the Item to be dropped cannot be manipulated, but any enemy will drop the Item, provided the queue has scheduled an Item to drop.  The queue itself cannot be manipulated; the schedule of Item drops is always identical.

At Weapon Level 2, holding the B button will fire a rapid burst of 6 projectiles.  Additionally, Laser has the strange effect of removing the weapon recycle timer from Apollo's vertical shot while Apollo is moving, and also provides rapid fire functionality when Up and B are held.  This means that while Apollo is moving, a vertical shot can be fired as soon as the previous vertical projectile has been destroyed, without the normal minimum 7 Frame delay between shots.  Wonderfully, Laser's rate of fire can be enhanced further by pressing the B button every other Frame.  Furthermore, rapidly pressing the B button, rather than holding the B button, allows up to 8 projectiles to be fired in a burst.  It also allows Apollo to fire continuously at optimum rate: provided there are not 8 Laser projectiles on the screen, the game will always allow the Laser to fire a projectile.  This technique negates the need for Laser Level 2, and even supersedes its capability!  It is the ultimate power in the universe.

	"Foot Wing increases the height of Jump and High Jump by approximately 50%, and decreases the rate at which Apollo begins to descend after making a Jump or High Jump.  Tapping the A button while Apollo is in midair further slows Apollo's rate of descent.  Tapping the A button rapidly enough allows Apollo to Levitate at a constant altitude.  If Apollo is Levitating, and he approaches within 2 pixels of, but not below, the level of a surface beneath him, Apollo will be drawn down to the level of the surface and Levitation is canceled.  If Apollo collides with a surface above him while using Foot Wing, horizontal momentum is canceled for 1 Frame.  If Apollo has Foot Wing, and walks off of a ledge, rather than jumping off, the game considers him to still be standing on a surface.  This allows Apollo to jump while he is falling.  Apollo can also jump while he is falling down from an Air Well or from an elevated door.  This does not apply if Apollo is not using Foot Wing.  If Apollo is using Foot Wing to Levitate at the correct Y location, he can pass through solid a platform.

The Guard just beyond the Item Shop Door is destroyed first, as it is necessary to visit the Item Shop to acquire Laser before destroying the Guards, and this prevents backtracking.  The Guard on the center level is destroyed next, and then finally the Guard on the upper level is destroyed.  Destroying the Guard on the upper level before destroying the Guard on the center level requires 6 more Frames due to the resultant configuration of jumps needed to reach the Guard on the center level.  Furthermore, moving down through Air Well 3 causes Apollo to spawn at X 184.  If Apollo moves to the right from here, he will remain at X 184.  Apollo's normal center screen location is X 144.  The result of this is that Apollo must be much farther right in order to cause the center level Guard to spawn, and thus much farther from Air Well 4, the next destination.
