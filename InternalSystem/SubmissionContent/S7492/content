	"Since as a TAS we're able to spam click faster than any human in existence, we can complete the game in the minimum amount of real and game time, only 5 out of 10 cursors were harmed in the making of this video. Since the early cursors have to open and hold open the path(s) for later cursors (or click a box for eternity) they have some spare time afterwards to entertain, so you'll often see the cursors jumping around, gaining score, spelling out secret encoded messages, and generally just messing about.

	": I was a little concerned about the rerecord count at first, but it seems like most of the optimization here is just from planning. Using Tab + Space in the original Flash Player was faster but that's not currently supported in Ruffle. The route looks about as good as it can be, and the gameplay and playaround segments are definitely superhuman looking. Accepting!
