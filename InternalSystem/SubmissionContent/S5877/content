	$LF

	"Basically you run forward while avoiding enemies, pillars, and gaps in the ground.  At the end of each world is a boss battle.  Stars can also be collected for bonus points.

	"There are eight worlds each with three to four subdivisions.  These divisions are continuous with each other.

[ul

		"Unlike a true autoscroller, the rate (and thus timing) of level progress is variable.  This allows for optimization potential.

			[li 
				"Even without button presses, the character will run forward and progress through the level.  However, 'Up' and 'Down' on the D-pad will alter the speed at which the character runs.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				"Impacting posts that don't kill you (non-fire posts) knocks the character backwards and sometimes contain power-ups.  These knock-backs will delay reaching the end of the level.

				" The primary difference between normal and hard mode is the speed of the enemies movement.  No new content is otherwise added (from what we can tell).

			]li
			[li 
				"Interestingly, the same hard-mode code is 
				[em 
					"again

				" given to the player after completing hard mode itself.  This perhaps suggests that Square either overlooked (or just didn't care about) making a different credits sequence for hard-mode, or they didn't think anyone would ever beat the game in the hard-mode and didn't bother to mess around with making a different credits sequence.

				$LF
			]li

		" It's possible to hit the death zone of a gap and a spring character at the same time. This triggers the death music and causes the rest of the level to have no music, up until you reach the boss.  This is the only time you get to be free from the otherwise VERY repetitive music.

	": First of all, it's been suggested that it's an autoscroller game. As already mentioned by the author(s), it's not. Pressing Up and Down changes your running speed, also some things can bounce you backwards. Yet I asked myself, is this game still trivial given that you hold Up and avoid touching anything? To answer that, I checked out the current 
	[a class=extlink href=https://www.speedrun.com/3-D_WorldRunner rel=nofollow 
		"RTA world record
	]a
	". Its first level from level start up until boss fight is slower than this run's, and the boss fight is slower as well. If even the people that have enough skill to get a speedrun world record can't beat this game's easiest level as fast as this TAS, then it's obviously not trivial.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Even if it was an autoscroller, it's never been a problem, even our Movie rules don't mention anything about autoscrollers that could disqualify them. Even things like 
	(__wikiLink|/2141M|2141M)
	" are fine, as long as there's at least something to optimize. So in that regard everything is good.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Second, difficulty. Movie Rules say that 
	[em 
		"you can use a code to unlock the hardest difficulty
	]em
	". And this difficulty is objectively hard in this game, as it makes all the dodging harder, RTA or TAS, not simply changes every enemie's hitpoints. So it's acceptable.

[p 
	"Third, tier. No matter how hard you try to entertain, the game itself is incredibly annoying to watch unless your tastes are strange enough to like the same short music loop (consisting of basically the same melody) being played for 20 minutes straight, identical levels consisting of the checkerboard scrolling for 20 minutes, and gameplay where all you need to do it run left and right and jump on the pillars for 20 minutes.

	"Fourth, what do we do with "fuller" kinds of completion for this game? Extra stages have been agreed to be fine, as we do indeed consider "all levels" full completion in some cases. But regarding stars, it is known that you can't collect them all, and also that they don't do anything useful, don't even generate any reward other than score. The manual says: "Catch as many of these as you can. They're worth extra points". Interestingly, stars are the cheapest item in the game, it grants you the least amount of points! http://files.tasvideos.org/2095/pics/WorldRunnerManualScore.png So they are officially and objectively useless, for normal play as well as for a TAS.
