	"This Bossrush mode is an addition which is playable after clear this game "Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance" .
	$LF
	"Player defeats many many bosses (in "Hard" mode, number of bosses is 18)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"You can play this as Simon Belmont if you input "Konami Code" (↑↑↓↓←→←→ＢＡ） while showing Konami's logo.

]h3
[p 
	"This run used the SRAM which has Hardmode Bossrush.
	$LF
	"To play Hardmode, you must clear "Easy" and "Normal" mode.
	$LF
	"The movie that generates SRAM of this run is

[h4 
	" Multiple Hitting Glitch (called Shuriken Glitch)
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"In this run, Simon performs this glitch in the following way.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"1.Attack by "Subweapon:Cross(ID:0x09)" and "Midair whipping(ID:0x02)".
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"2.Attack by "Land whipping(ID:0x03)" while two invulnerabilities are remained.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Total damage is here.
	$LF
	"138 (by midair whipping) + 103*M (by the cross) + 138*n(by a glitch)
	$LF
	"M is the number of times of hit by cross.
	$LF
	"n is times of multiple hits.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"1 is substituted for M normally, but in case of using "Powerful" method as stated below and enemy's hitbox is already enabled when Simon entered the room (like Living Armor), 2 is substituted for M.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In 2nd step, Simon uses 2 different hitbox.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The first case is that if the enemy has a little of HP like Dracula Wraith (1st).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In this case, Simon uses a behind hitbox to perform the glitch quickly.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"However, since the hitbox moves from behind to front in 12th frames from starting whip attack,
	$LF
	"the multiple hitting time length in this case is only 11 frames.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"So, enemy's damage that is caused by this "quickly" method is 138*11+138+103=1759 (no critical hits).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The second case is that if the enemy has a lot of HP like Living Armor.
	$LF
	"In this case, Simon uses a front hitbox to perform the glitch maximally.
	$LF
	"Max length of Simon's multiple hit is 20 frames (invulnerability of cross).
	$LF
	"If Simon doesn't draw any critical hit, max damage is 138*20+138+103=3001 or 138*20+138+103*2=3104.
	$LF
	"Although this "Powerful" method can inflict great damage upon the enemy,
	$LF
	""Quickly" method can defeat the enemy 11 frames faster than it if enemy doesn't have a lot of HP.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"But when you fight with Living Armor or Talos, you must be careful to avoid excessive multiple damage.
	$LF
	"Because death effect of them are started when them hitbox stopped reacting to attacks.
	$LF
	"And Legion Saint's shells doesn't take damage by this glitch because of them special invulnerability.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" High speed running steps
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"In Simon mode, going up/down the stair is different from Juste/Maxim.
	$LF
	"If you released left/right button while moving on the stair, 
	$LF
	"the coordinates of Simon will be modified to next/behind the step.
	$LF
	"To go up/down the stair quickly, release the button on where Simon's position will be modified to next step. 
	$LF
	"The speed of running method is 1.6 pixels/frames
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Luck Manipulation
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Simon can't perform the multiple hitting glitch quickly continuously because he has no way to cancel his any 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"motions.
	$LF
	"So, in either case of using "quickly" or "powerful" method, drawing critical hit is very important.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In Simon's Bossrush, you have to do these action to consume the Random Number.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"1.Jumping
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"2.Breaking candles
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"3.Appearing Magic Crystal after defeating enemies
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"3 consumes Random Number very fast. But it consume some frames too.
	$LF
	"Since of this, 1 and 2 is used for luck manipulation basically.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Critical hit detection depends on lower 2 bytes of Random Number (0x02000008:4 bytes).
	$LF
	"While performing multiple hit glitch after luck manipulation, Simon can draw 2～3 critical hits normally.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In this run, I used high-density critical hits area to the enemy whose HP is over 3001 or 1759 preferentially.
