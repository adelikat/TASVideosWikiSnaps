	"So this tas improves the previous run by like 2 seconds by virtue of bustin the game wide open to get the shortest questions possible. Question Manipulation is possible on the first two controllers during a brief window while Marc Summers is blabbing about how fuckin right you were when you answered the question. There are only a few sets of questions each round so I manipulate the best ones. Sometimes the shortest questions take a while to load so I manipulate a question that's slightly slower but has less lag/wait time during the fade in
