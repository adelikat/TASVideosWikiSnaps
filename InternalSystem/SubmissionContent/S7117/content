[div class=p 
	"Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen features two RNGs: one value which is used to determine almost every luck-based event in the game, and a second RNG (sometimes called “encounter RNG” or “RNG2”) which is used only to determine when wild encounters will happen. Unlike many other Pokémon games, neither of these RNGs can be influenced by performing additional button inputs during gameplay. They are entirely mathematically derived: each value is calculated directly from the previous one.

	"Encounter RNG (RNG2)
	$LF
]h3
[div class=p 
	"This RNG only advances when taking steps through areas where Pokémon can be encountered, such as grass and caves. Since I cannot use extra inputs to influence this RNG during gameplay, the only opportunity to have a say in when encounters happen in the early game is by manipulating a specific seed for this RNG2 value. This encounter RNG is seeded at the very start of the TAS, when clearing the title screen with Venusaur on it. Unlike the in-game RNG2 advancement, this initial seeding can be influenced by button presses at specific times, although not in a transparent way.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Needing to avoid encounters on the first trips up and down Route 1, I ran a brute-force solver to check each of the 65536 possible RNG2 seeds to see which would go encounterless for those first 20 or so advances of the RNG2. My search yielded 512 possibilities. I then identified a couple of points in the title screens where I could provide button inputs or delays to influence what the seed value would be. Not trusting my botting skills for this, I started a manual brute-force search to find inputs which would set this RNG2 seed to one of these 512 values. After about 3000 rerecords, I was able to find a combination of inputs which achieved one of these values with only two frames of delay versus optimal button pressing. Fortunately, this RNG2 seed yielded acceptable early encounter densities: one encounter on Route 1, and four in Viridian Forest.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Later on, I discovered a trick which would enable me to have some ongoing degree of influence over the encounter RNG: bike-spinning. Starting from a stationary position on the bicycle, I provide a single-frame D-pad input in a direction other than the one in which I am facing. I then continue to provide single-frame directional inputs, changing directions each time. This causes the encounter RNG to very rapidly advance, and causes the player to look like they are spinning in place. Also, this notably does not cause the step counter to advance while a Repel is active. This trick is used throughout the run, both to advance the RNG2 quickly to an encounter, and to advance it freely while a Repel is active, in order to set up later events.

This RNG is seeded when the player selects their name, and is identical to the Trainer ID. Like the Encounter RNG seed, this RNG seed can be manipulated in not-very-transparent ways by providing inputs and delays at a couple of key points during the name selection.

	"In order to see which seeds were acceptable, I first determined that I needed to find a good Clefairy around RNG frame 93000-101000. Next, I ran a brute-force solver to determine which of the 65536 possible seeds yielded an acceptable Clefairy around the time when I could be in place to get it. Then I identified two places in the name selection process where I could introduce delays in order to make large changes to the Trainer ID/initial seed. From any of these input rolls, I could finally perform extra inputs to fine-tune the initial seeds approximately 16-32 values in either direction. After identifying which acceptable Clefairy seeds were gettable, I checked each of those seeds to see which yielded an acceptable Squirtle in a reasonable amount of time. The seed that I eventually decided on takes 34 frames of delay to manipulate, and gets a completely optimal Squirtle (a rare feat, as I will explain later) with 70 frames of delay. These optimal Pokémon more than make up for these delays over the course of the run.

[div class=p 
	"During gameplay, the only way to manipulate RNG to influence events is by introducing delays prior to inputs. This is why the run will sometimes seem to wait at certain times: I am manipulating events which are about to happen. During battle, the TAS will sometimes move the cursor between moves. This is to perform finer-grained RNG manipulation. Normally, during battle, RNG advances three times per frame (after the first entry into a Pokémon Center, which MKDasher’s 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Any% writeup|href=/4143S)
	" explains quite well). However, when switching between move slots, RNG advances only twice per frame. By moving back and forth between move slots, I can manipulate RNG with another level of precision.

	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"The TAS will also sometimes visit the help menu. The help menu is a valuable tool for RNG manipulation, as while in this menu, the RNG advances even though the game events do not. For example, suppose a fight requires a max-roll critical hit. Normally, each of these two occurrences is 1 in 16, so both of them occurring is 1 in 256. The game checks for a critical hit by looking at the RNG value ten cycles after it finishes printing “C used MOVE NAME!” If the RNG value at that time has a 0 in the fourth digit from the left (e.g. 0x17A
	[b 
		"0
	]b
	"9668), the move will be a critical hit. After this check, the game looks at the RNG value another ten cycles later to determine the damage roll, again checking the fourth digit. Without help menu manipulation, getting a max-roll crit to occur would involve waiting until a stretch where there are two RNG values ten frames apart which both have that 0 in the fourth digit. However, with this tool, the TAS can manipulate the crit check with more traditional delays, then visit the help menu during the brief window before the damage roll check. By leaving the help menu at a specific time, I can get the damage roll check to land wherever in the RNG I want it to. The downside to this manipulation is that it takes a minimum of 20 frames to perform, so it will be used only when a faster option is not available.

There is a little bit of room for routing differences in a couple of fights depending on how the RNG plays out. For example, both Sabrina’s Venomoth and Takashi’s Machoke can be killed with either a Mega Kick or a crit Mega Punch, so the move choice is dictated by how hard it is to find the crit in those fights.

	"After a lot of fights which were not especially interesting to discuss, I have come to the Elite Four, and one of the more notorious parts of Clefable TASing: Metronome manipulation. Metronome uses the primary RNG to randomly select one of 339 moves. The good news is that it allows me to find kills on things that I otherwise cannot one-shot. The bad news is that it is SSSLLLLOOOOWWW. In addition to the time required to manipulate crits and damage ranges, which must frequently be done with help menu manips, Metronome waits for 94 frames on the “C used Metronome!” text box. Therefore, like Water Pulse before it, Metronome is only used when absolutely necessary.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"But oh boy, against Lorelei, Metronome sure is necessary. Since Cloyster’s Shell Armor ability prevents it from being crit, it can only be defeated by one of three electric moves or one of four OHKO moves (which I prefer not to use here since they produce an extra text box, and because their accuracy check doesn’t seem to be manipulable). Slowbro requires a crit from the same three electric moves. Lapras, because it is so bulky, requires exactly one move: a crit, high-roll Low Kick. The odds of this happening naturally are .014%, which is why there is such a lengthy delay and help menu manip on Lapras.

	"Bruno is very straightforward. His Hitmonchan can be killed by a max-roll crit Mega Punch. If for some reason I couldn’t manip this quickly enough, I would have switched to crit Mega Punching Lorelei’s Jynx, and used a crit Mega Kick on Hitmonchan instead. Fortunately, I find the Mega Punch Plan A without too much delay.

	"Agatha requires more Metronome manipulation, although the options are a little bit more forgiving. I have nine outs for the first Gengar. Of these, Sheer Cold, crit Water Spout and crit Eruption are preferred because they don’t yield the extremely slow Super Effective text box.  The options are similar for the second Gengar, and then much more friendly for the Haunter.

Here, Mega Punch serves the purpose that Pound once served: clearing out all of the low-level, weaker opposition.

Although it has been a helpful coverage move thus far, Water Pulse is too weak to continue being effective, and so its usefulness is at an end.  On the other hand, Blizzard will be necessary to avoid multiple Metronomes against Round 2 of the Elite Four.

	"Manipulation-wise, the trickiest part of the postgame is the spinner passing. This manipulation is done, like so many other NPC manips, by introducing delays prior to movement. In Rocket Warehouse, there are two spinners who can be particularly annoying because they each have to be passed twice. Conservatively, I would estimate 1500 rerecords were spent on this thirty seconds of Warehouse movement alone.

I am able to find very quick Metronome kills on Cloyster, Piloswine and Lapras, with Piloswine even eating a YOLO Fissure for maximum swag.

Notably, Tyranitar’s Sand Stream winds up being slow but helpful, because it damages the Champion’s final three Pokémon, making the ranges for each of them much more forgiving.

As always with long RPGs, there are minor alternate routing options that may or may not pan out, but everything here seems deliberate and well thought-out. The RNG was abused to its absolute fullest extent with IV manipulation, constant one-shots, absurd encounter luck, and of course the Metronome showcase around the end. Well done.
