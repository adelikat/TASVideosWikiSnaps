	"The premise:  Soon after the conflict between Kuros and Malkil in Ironsword, Malkil gets right back up and the two fight again for a bit.  In the quarrel, Kuros is knocked out and the Ironsword is lost.  Malkil, in order to recuperate, heads to the city of Piedup and overthrows the king.  Kuros, in his subsequent wanderings, also comes across Piedup, so once again the two are engaged in conflict.

	"This game is much, much different from its more famous predecessors.  The game plays out less like Mario Brothers with swords and more like Metroid in a medieval city.  Combat has also changed a little bit: instead of swinging your sword in the generally direction you press, you stop and will stick your weapon in the specified direction.  Some weapons have projectiles, although I only need one.

		"Twice you will see me back track on a building's roof.  This is to get a beehive to disappear, making it so that I don't need to get the fire staff early on.  You can catch a glimpse of it after I save Julia.

		"When you get hit, you will slow down if you press the direction you are being tossed.  This was used in some boss battles and to get through the flashing man.
		$LF

	[li 
		"During the dragon battle, if you get hit, you're supposed to pass through the moving platforms if you try to land on them.  This was supposed to make it so that you had to beat him without getting hit, but if you hold down B, you will land just fine.  I pass through a platform and land on the bottom one to deliver a quick attack at one point.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"If you try to duck on a moving platform, you will fail.  However, you can still crawl (somewhat), and it has the same use as ordinary crawling (see tricks).  I wish I had discovered this sooner than when I needed it, because it looks really funny since Kuros looks like he's tripping over his feet.  Unfortunately, it's barely seeable when I do use it at the end of the dragon battle.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"When you get hit, you will take damage as soon as you hit solid ground.  Moving platforms don't qualify as solid ground, so that's why I take no damage against the dragon, even though I get hit twice.
		$LF

	[li 
		"If you are running and you press down and B on the same frame, you will keep your momentum if you let go of those two buttons on the same frame.  I use this to position myself at the end of some bosses.

		"Ducking will cancel out your momentum.  I use this while grabbing the first money bag.

		"Getting hit gives you a period of invulnerability, but I already discussed where I used it.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Some trial bosses can be made to dodge an attack.  This may sound like a hindrance, but it often cancels out their attacks allowing me to hit them more before they strike back.  The thieves lean back and the knights just stop attacking.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Sometimes I weave in and out while jumping.  Usually that's to give me needed momentum to make my next jump.  Also, when jumping up some places, I time it so I won't run into the wall, thus allowing me to keep my momentum.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"It's best to try to get close to a trial boss when you destroy them so the walking animation won't be as long.  I try to use that whenever possible.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"I take a small jump when approaching the worm.  This is to force the screen to scroll faster at that point.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"This game is loaded with subpixel movement, and sometimes that leads to different results for something that doesn't look any different.  Because of this, I sometimes let go of the directions so I can get the best results without slowing down.

		"If you let the game go beyond the legal jargon, the soft reset will take you to the title screen.  However, I chose to begin my movie at the legal jargon because it simulates the "From power on" criteria the best.  This lasts about seventeen seconds.  Don't worry about when to start the movie, though, since it will always start there.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"I pause for a few frames in the first room of the secret passage at the end of the game.  This is to give me the short running start I need in order to make that jump.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Jumping will slow your horizontal movement down a bit.  Because of this, not only must all my jumps be precise, but the "jump down a pit" trick doesn't work.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"I don't attack the thief statue guards as soon as I could so that they have an opportunity to get out of the corner.  Otherwise, they would jump to the other side of the room and I would lose time because their invincibility runs out in the air.

		"My method of attack against the gold wizard isn't any faster than my previously used tactic.  It's purely aesthetic.
		$LF

	[li 
		"The entrance point to the secret tunnels in the underworld is skewed to the right of the graphic.  That's why I sometimes enter them while barely touching them and other times I have to be practically on top of it.
		$LF

	[li 
		"It may look like I could have started attacking the wizards much sooner with a higher jump, but the platform is solid until a particular frame.

	[li 
		"Gold and silver trial bosses have a much shorter invulnerability period than bronze bosses.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"I don't destroy the bronze wizard as fast as possible.  That's because I back off a bit to close the gap between him and me when I deliver the fatal blow.  I didn't do that against the gold wizard because his shorter invulnerability makes it useless.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"It is necessary that I get kicked out of the third wizard once guild once.  Only the thief can unlock the door, but I have to be a wizard to join.  Because guilds are mostly automated, getting kicked out of that guild is simply part of the game.

		"I destroy Malkil fast enough that he doesn't change tactics.  This was fortunate, because he's much harder to manipulate when he does.

	[li 
		"This games has a wierd input stream.  Most of the game's graphics run at 60 FPS, but the input stream runs at 30, meaning there's a dead frame every other frame, with the excpetion being conversations and menus where it's just fine.  Sometimes entering a door or talking to someone will offset the stream, so sometimes I can only do things on even frames and other times odd frames.  Also, usually in a game when you give an input command, it will do that command the next frame.  In here, though, I've had the screen go black the same frame I enter a door.
