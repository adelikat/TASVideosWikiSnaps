	"2 Player Co-op Quest is a ROM Hack of Super Mario World were the 2nd controller controls the enemies. This TAS Completes all the normal levels, and not the bonus ones. The bonus levels are not needed.

	"I first found out about this ROM Hack when a 
	[a class=extlink href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W--YxzK9K6U rel=nofollow 
		"Youtuber
	]a
	" uploaded a video on it. I was interested in this game, so I played it with my brother. After that, I decided it would be cool to TAS this game because of how the 2nd controller can control the enemies, thus making for an interesting TAS. This is also my first submission to the site, so I thought that since this game is short and sweet, it would make for a good first TAS.

	"This level wasn't very interesting. "Mario" (or the first controller) tries to beat the levels as fast as possible while the "mind controller" (2nd controller) moves the enemies out of the way for him.
