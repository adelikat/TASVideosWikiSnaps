	"Okay, so I decided to make a TAS of Gyromite, an (as far as I can tell) mostly unknown game.  It was 2-player, but used ROB, the robotic operating buddy, to allow one player to play by themselves.  The first player's controller moves the professor and picks up radishes, and the second one raises and lowers the coloured pillars.  If you don't really know the game, I suggest playing it; it is quite fun, and it will make the movie make more sense.

	"Gyromite, while being not well known, is also very odd.  The main idea of the game is that a professor in a lab coat has to move around the stage, while using blue and red platforms to help them, and collect all the dynamite before time runs out.  In addition to this, strange green birds (Called Smicks) wander around the level as well, and kill you on contact.  However, they can be distracted by feeding them radishes, or they can be squished by the pillars. (The professor can be squished too, but it results in the loss of a life and is therefore not shown.)

[div class=p 
	"To go through a ceiling, you need a vine and a pillar, right beside each other.  I later learned that you do not need a vine, just a pit below the pillar so that you character falls.  How you do it is by making the pillar come down just as you move sideways into it.  Done correctly, you will end up inside the pillar.  From here, two different things can happen depending on the type of pillar.  I haven't found a way to identify the two different kinds other than this glitch.  The first possibility, and the better one, is that continuing to lower the pillar puts you on top of it.  The second possibility is not quite as good, because you will still be inside the pillar after it is fully lowered.  You then need to raise it, and lower it again to get out.  The first possibility is demonstrated first in phase 9, while the second is first shown in phase 15.  Both of these can also be done to Smicks if they get off they vine at the right time.  Thanks to nitsuja for pointing out this glitch.

]h3
[div class=p 
	"The vines seem to be divided into sections (at least that's how I think of it) that are of equal height.  Getting off the vine to either side while in a section will put you in the middle of that section.  This can speed up climbing because all you have to do is go far enough into the section, then get off and grab right back on to get boosted up to the center of the section.  You can also climb down like this, and in the strange way this game works, climbing down is faster than climbing up, slightly.  Also, climbing is faster than falling so staying on vines is important.  This glitch is used on basically every vine in the game, the only ones I don't do it for are ones where I would have to wait anyways.
