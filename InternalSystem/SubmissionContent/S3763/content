You can choose to play up to 32 sounds from the game. I play Sound Number 2, which is an 8-bit version of the "Star Spangled Banner". Then I start entering the settings.

I jump over him, trying to get to the end of the train, cleverly dodging his attacks. But, just as I am about to hijack the train, he jumps over me to try and block me, but I do the same.

The streak didn't last, however, and the next few swords that were thrown almost hit me! He quickly ran out of swords, and luckily, his punch was weak for a soldier. *laughs* Pretty soon, I captured the fort, and all in one piece, too.
