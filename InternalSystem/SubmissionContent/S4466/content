	"This is an interesting run! It is very visible how much you cared about making it entertaining, and the viewer support proves it. But it doesn't look like you were trying to optimize it for time to its maximum. Simple menu navigation can be done ~50 frames faster. Also, you have to stop the movie right after the last button press you need to beat the game. That way, the real time this game takes is shown in the file and in the submission.
