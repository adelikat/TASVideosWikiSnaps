	"for entertainment I enjoyed myself so much with the elements of sets (ex:frame 10081), the ability to walk on two different routes (ex:frame 27320 and 81120), followed by frame enemy fire, as well as a nice little glitch that allows you to cross enemy and elements of the scenery (ex:frame 22120), in fact the missile that struck a path element it lacks hitbox for a short time !!

	"This is an interesting run! It is very visible how much you cared about making it entertaining, and the viewer support proves it. But it doesn't look like you were trying to optimize it for time to its maximum. Simple menu navigation can be done ~50 frames faster. Also, you have to stop the movie right after the last button press you need to beat the game. That way, the real time this game takes is shown in the file and in the submission.

	"So I'm rejecting this run for being very improvable by time, but I'm stating that it's a really strong start, and that we all hope to see your full potential applied.
