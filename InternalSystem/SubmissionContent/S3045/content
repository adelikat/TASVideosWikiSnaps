	"Mole Mania, known as Moguranya (モグラ～ニャ) in Japan, is an action puzzle game. The main character is a mole named Muddy Mole, whose wife and children have been kidnapped by the farmer, Jinbe. Muddy has to go to Jinbe Land and save his family. In the game, the player will solve puzzles by moving a black ball to a gate. However, there are many obstacles and enemies in the way. Therefore the player will dig into ground to find ways around them.

After resetting, level 1 will be corrupted and take you to a broken map. Then, returning to the level select screen from there will show you a broken score results screen and unlock the final stage.

	"This time, the run has 3 new tricks. One is canceling movement of coming up from underground, another is new way of entering circles which appear in level 8, the other is to make Funton start jumping quickly by staying underground. When Muddy comes up from ground which is not dug a hole yet, diving into ground and coming up again allows to omit his movement. The second trick is that Muddy starts moving 3 or 4 frames faster after warping, if he enters a circle from square below.

	"With the former new trick I mentioned above, I saved a lot of frames in 1-2, 1-3, 1-9, and 1-11. Different strategy is used in 1-9 besides the new trick, though. 1 frame was saved in 1-5 and 2 frames were saved by lag reduction, but 2 frames slower in 1-7 and 6 frames slower in 1-10 because of increasing lag. Strategies that saved 130 frames in 1-12 are obviously different and notable. Firstly, Muddy threw the black ball to behind him and went to the square where the black ball had been there. He dove into hard ground to make a dinosaur turn back and leap over a hole. This saved two lives and allowed to make use of forced strategy in different place. I lost 101 frames in 1-13 because I picked up an item, surrender. I used it in 1-14 and saved 619 frames. It also saved 6 frames in score result screen because of lower score.

As I used surrender in 1-14, the room was still to be cleared. That brought Muddy to 1-13 when restarting level 1 and saved 226 frames. Using surrender also saved 6 frames in broken result screen due to lower score. 32 frames were saved by using the new trick when Muddy got out of underground path. And 54 frames were saved due to better timing to reset.

I saved 2 frames in 8-1 and saved 48 frames in 8-6 by just reducing lag. I saved 266 frames in 8-5 and saved 144 frames in 8-7 with better luck manipulation. I saved 85 frames in 8-2 because I beat Sundes with 2 hits that are less than the previous run. I saved 558 frames in 8-3 by staying underground to make Funton start jumping quickly. I saved 873 frames in 8-4 because I succeeded in hitting Mad Wrencher twice in the second wave. And I saved 52 frames with different strategies.
