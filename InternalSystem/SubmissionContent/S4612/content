	"This is a rather complicated level for optimization. I go through the chains in my grip for a frame . Any optimization is reflected in the number of frame " jump down key" because it depends on the height to go and there is no set formula .

However, the 1-player and 2-player modes of this game actually have different sets of levels, so they are not directly comparable to each other, and thus can be published as separate game modes.
