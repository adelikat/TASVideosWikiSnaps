	"Ghostbusters is a game in which you have to go to buildings, which you do so by moving around on an overview map of the city, and catch ghosts (you need to buy the proton beam and ghost trap to catch the ghosts). The more ghosts you catch the more money you make which is used to buy things to help you get up the stairwell in the Zuul Building. You also need the money (at least $15,000) to get into the Zuul Building. In the Japanese version of this game, there is a glitch where the player can go to the shop and buy the Ghost Alarm for $2,000 and trade it back in for $3,000. Every time you do this, you can make a profit of $1,000 which makes it easy to enter the Zuul Building early in the game.

	"For the driving scenes, I moved the car around so that the stopping time is not so delayed. The most challenging part of this was the stairwell scene. The strategy I used for this stage was opening the doors on some of the floors which luck manipulates the ghosts so that they are easier to dodge. The final boss, Gozer, was also difficult because there were so many shots on the screen. The Ghostbusters can only take up to so many hits at a time and there is no recovery time which makes the boss even harder. Thankfully, Gozer doesn't take that many hits to kill, so I just avoided all the projectiles while shooting at the boss and it was over before I knew it.

	" A game completed a lot faster than intended, and a well executed TAS. Nice in a technical aspect, but the actual gameplay is rather uninteresting and only the short length of the movie keeps it from getting (too) boring. There is enough support for this TAS to warrant publication. Accepting.
