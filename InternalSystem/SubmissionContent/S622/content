	"+ Everything about this game is hard. Give the game a shot. I am a big fan of the series, and this is by far the most difficult one. The game also moves faster than any other NES game I've ever played.

[div class=p 
	"+ This game was released in Japan only, and it's not hard to see why. The game is one of the most bizaare I've ever played, as it's more a parody of the original than anything. The game moves insanely fast; so I thought that watching a movie of it's completion would be really cool to see. The game itself is massively entertaining in it's weirdness. Fans of the Splatterhouse series need to check this one out. I try to have some fun with the game at times, which is hard; since the thing is so difficult. There are 2 times in the movie that damage is taken, both to complete a quick jump.
