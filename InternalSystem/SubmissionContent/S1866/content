	"This run is an improvement of 5,103 frames (85 seconds) over the published Super Metroid run. Once again I aim for real time, as opposed to in-game time. In-game clock’s final time is 24:16. Cpadolf’s recently submitted run is 30 seconds faster on the in-game clock, but is 90 seconds slower in real time. The real time oriented route I designed for this run eliminates backtracking and excessive item collecting. The only noticeably slower parts compared to the in-game run are the Ridley and Mother Brain battles, due to skipping the plasma beam.
