	"Basicly after watching something called 'Let's Play Zelda' on YouTube and how disturbingly done it was I got motivated to try to do one of my own.  Thus I decided to make 'Teach me Zelda' for a step by step trip around the Original 'Legend of Zelda' for the NES.  The purpose here is to open up to all new players to this game where to find things, how to obtain every item, and get to Zelda without having a single death mark on record.  Zelda is a very nicely well done game that has captivated the gaming world for about as many years as Mega Man, making it a very well known and loved classic.
