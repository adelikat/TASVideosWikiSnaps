	": This line pretty much sums up why I'm rejecting this: "I played at 49% speed, so perfection wasn't sought after." We strive to produce movies that would be impossible to replicate in real time, with focuses on both entertainment and technical prowess. Recording a movie at such a speed decreases your control, and produces a sloppy result. Better luck next time.
