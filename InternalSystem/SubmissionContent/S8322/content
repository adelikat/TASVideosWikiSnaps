	": Ok...I'm not happy to report this again, but this TAS was very poorly made. This TAS may have beaten the WR by a number of seconds, but there is another problem. In the first parts of the TAS, I was easily able to improve on this run without trying.  Another part I noticed, is that you missed a very important exit strategy that JoePulito performed, which put the WR ahead for a long time. Later, he blunders an area and allows your TAS to catch up. From what I'm seeing, these are the pivotal areas to capitalize on and should have been cleaned up.
