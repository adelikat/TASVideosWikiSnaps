	"This submission is for Win Lose or Draw, an NES game show game in the style of Pictionary (not NES Pictionary. Actual Pictionary) wherein you can manually draw the clues or have the much more artistic CPU do the drawing for you much more detailed and more quickly.

	"Like most "guess the thing" games on the NES, you don't need to spell out the entire words. Usually you can omit vowels (especially double vowels) but not all the time. The game follows the Family Feud premise of "if all the needed letters are in order, even if the words are out of order, it will be acceptable. The most egregious example in this TAS is the Hot Head clue, which I can solve with HDT or HTD. Foot the Bill is FTBL, you typically don't need the "and/the/etc" words.

	"The game has a 1 or 2 player mode. We play one player on Difficult because there is no CPU opponent to go against and the 2 player mode is turn based and would make this take twice as long.

	"You'll also notice the bonus points in the lower right corner. Solving a puzzle without mistakes gives you 100 bonus points. Each incorrect/empty B press takes 10 from this total (to a minimum of 5) and this counts down slower than burning the points costs, so it's faster to drop the bonus to 10 before solving. Ideally we do this while moving to the first letter and then dumping the rest there. If we guess incorrectly with letters already entered, it erases those. This is why I sit on the first letter until we're ready to go. 10 is the ideal landing point, burning a guess to go from 10 to 5 is a net loss.
