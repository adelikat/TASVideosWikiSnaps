Wrong warps are not common in the Genocide route due to lacking the Punch Card Exploit used in Neutral/True Pacifist, which is often used to facilitate the glitch. The only way to reliably trigger a wrong warp in Genocide is to already have text storage, and to close the stored textbox once the screen transition occurs, as the act of closing a textbox grants control to the player. In RTA play, performing a wrong warp incorrectly results in a softlock as control becomes impossible to return to the player.

This includes things such as enemy attack patterns, types of encounter, and most importantly, the number of “random” steps you must walk before generating an encounter. Enemies are manipulated into using attacks with shorter animations, or animations that can be cancelled via various player actions such as colliding with their attacks. Every text character that displays onscreen (including all text in battles) advances RNG by 2 per frame (including space), so delaying text advancement for a certain number of frames will alter the RNG pattern following it. Room transitions advance RNG by 1, and fade-in/fade-out effects advance RNG by 1 per frame. Some areas may advance RNG in the open world, such as the snow that covers a mini-map in Dogi’s room or several rooms in Waterfall with a bubble animation effect.

There is a commonly known strat where you move into the top-left corner in the Flowey tutorial in order to take intentional damage as soon as possible. Avoiding this damage adds 2 more attack cycles from Flowey. It turned out that there are a number of ways to manipulate the attack pattern to force one of the bullets into moving faster and/or on a straighter path towards the soul by being in a specific position before the attack begins. It saved ~8 frames over the old method.

	"The kill requirement for the Ruins is 20. However, the first actual enemy encounter is unique and works differently to the later ones. It is always a Froggit in the same spot, with lowered health (20 instead of 30) and a higher EXP reward (10 instead of 3) than other Froggits . It allows you to get LV 2 and increase your ATK/HP stats, but there is an issue. The game doesn't consider this a kill for the purpose of the kill counter, which means that you can choose to flee instead. It's common to take that kill in RTA runs to make later fights slightly easier, but it costs about 45 extra frames over fleeing. More frames are saved later (around 15) from having a higher LV earlier, but it still winds up being slower in a TAS (or even RTA, assuming that you'll get the same types of encounters in the Ruins).

There are five possible encounters that can be generated in the second grind room: 1/2/3 Moldsmals, 2 Froggits, or Froggit and Whimsun. The last option is the fastest because Whimsun is instantly killed on the first turn, and Froggit’s turns are then skipped by manipulating a specific attack and damage-boosting on it to cancel the animation. This is the only attack in Ruins which can be cancelled in this manner.

Doing this allows the player to skip some text and retain movement during the cutscene after killing Ice Cap. An invisible wall blocks you from getting close to Sans and Papyrus, whilst going back to the previous room resets the cutscene, so the best strategy is to progress the step counter to get more kills, even though grinding in this manner without switching rooms is usually sub-optimal.

It’s faster to use the Stick on the first turn (The Stick automatically enters the inventory after equipping the Tough Glove) in order to decrease their defense.

Afterwards, manually making any text appear onscreen (such as reading info about the Stick from the inventory) before a new cutscene’s text appears allows you to retain movement for the rest of the cutscene.

Normally he is avoided because he has very high defense and HP, which requires 8 turns (9 in RTA because a perfect damage roll is required every hit to 8-shot him). As a result, Jerry is Spared whenever possible.

I also dropped the stick during the wrong warp to improve menuing later in the run due to having an emptier inventory, and it costs no frames to do this during a room transition.

After the scripted encounters I kept manipulating RNG to only get Moldbygg/Woshua. Woshua has the fastest attack pattern, so it’s preferable to kill Moldbygg first.

After some math, it turned out that there is no possible method to save a turn over a perfect RTA fight at LV 10; even with the best possible damage rolls on every turn, you will still be short by 68 damage after the 13th turn. There are no items that can raise your ATK stat at this point, and getting an extra LV for the sake of skipping one turn on Undyne is absolutely not worth it.

Frisk appears to continue to stand still, however this is because the game makes your actual sprite invisible and the one onscreen does not correspond to your physical location. Using the text from the cutscene, you can overflow the Instant Noodles choice from the fridge with Mettaton's text and access the Burnt Pan choice, allowing you to collect it without walking to the intended location.

The Pan and Gun allow you to OHKO every enemy, but it turned out that the Ballet Shoes can also OHKO most encounters except for Knight Knight and Madjick. Astigmatism is the most dangerous enemy to use the Ballet Shoes against because he has 120 HP, but you can normally only deal up to 118 damage at LV 13. However, the highest damage roll will deal precisely 120 damage, which is very risky to perform in an RTA run (The success rate for high damage rolls would be 25%, and you still need to get a perfect hit, which is triple-frame-perfect).

After much testing, it turned out that it’s not worth it to skip enemies that require extra turns to kill (Knight Knight and Madjick) like Aaron in Waterfall; I just equipped the Burnt Pan to one-shot them.

Either of them lead to the game’s end, but the left choice is faster by TAS timing since inputs end 101 frames earlier. Switching between choices does not cost time, since the game doesn’t let you pick an option in the first ten frames.
