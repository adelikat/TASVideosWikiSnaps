On the other hand, a 45 degree angle slope can even allow for triple or quadruple jumps in this fashion, but since the slope is at such a high angle anyway this doesn't actually gain any relative height, but it still can be used to avoid the slow walking speed which would otherwise be forced upon such inclines.

	"During the judgment of the previous TAS, research began into the nature of the levels to assist with understanding how to optimise them, which has culminated into the Lua scripts made by r57shell/Feos, which had to have a quick update during the creation of this TAS to enable them to work properly on the relative emulator versions.  These revealed that the game works off a main series of instructions, with a periodic timeout variable showing when to execute the next chunk of code, with the occasional call to a randomised subroutine.  Each chunk of instructions will be with concluded with an 'End' command, which waits for all other activities to cease before moving on.  Please see the

	"This helped identify which puppies will not save any time if sacrificed, as it's only the final ones in each wave which are effectively slowing us down.  However, each bounce that a puppy does on the trampoline will give an RNG shift, which means that even if we're planning on killing certain puppies in a wave, it may still prove useful to bounce them one or two times before accidentally forgetting about them purely for the purpose of RNG manipulation.  Even if killing a puppy won't cause the next wave to be started sooner, not having to bounce it across may mean a more favourable RNG call for the next sections, and so quite a few possibilities need to be tested across all 12 random calls.

	"Puppy Love 2 in particular took the most amount of time to TAS, as the preceding level does not end with the usual see-saw animation.  Thus, it gives Jim free reign to shoot all he wants to cycle through RNG as much as possible, giving dozens of initial seeds to try for the main level, each of which requires hundreds of permutations to check for who to sacrifice and when.  Definitely a devilish job which would not be possible without the understanding provided by the prior work done, and so an extra special thanks to Feos and r57shell for their hardwork.
