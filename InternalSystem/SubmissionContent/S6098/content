		"In the Stitch levels, shooting then releasing a directional control for one frame while on the ground prevents Stitch from firing all four guns, saving special ammo.

		"An exploit with the slug-like bubble shooting enemies' AI in Lilo's levels can be used to run behind them without sneaking. The enemies only "hear" Lilo behind them if they're asleep. If Lilo isn't sneaking within a certain radius of the enemy they wake up and face Lilo, but if Lilo isn't in sight they don't shoot. Sneaking until Lilo is at the center of the enemy then running confuses the AI keeping Lilo safe. I can provide a visual example later if needed as it's hard to put into words.

		"The monowheel vehicle used in the final two stages can reverse its gravity by double tapping A. If the A presses are within 6 frames of eachother the vehicle will clip through whatever floor it was on. I use this glitch to clip through the ceiling in level 9 to reach the level end trigger that is being stored out of bounds, saving roughly 2 minutes of an autoscrolling level. I also use it again after the final boss fight just for fun.

	"I try to avoid taking hits to avoid dying, but sometimes it's impossible to dodge damage without sacrificing speed. I don't die in the run at all. I do not restart the game at any point. I technically control 2 characters throughout the run but there is no choice provided by the game. It is entirely linear.

	"Lilo & Stitch was a game released in 2002 as a tie in to the movie. It's a shoot 'em up style game when playing as Stitch and a stealth and avoidance puzzle game when playing as Lilo. The game takes place at some point after the events of the movie.

	"For my first submitted movie I wanted to do a game from my childhood that wasn't already entirely optimized by a die hard community. I wanted to be on the front line of discovering tricks, routes and exploits that no casual player would find, and even things that runners of the game didn't know about. The skill of the execution is deeply satisfying to me and I hope others can be inspired by this movie, learn something, and make their own runs finding new things with their large and expanding pools of knowledge.

	"While creating this movie I followed the route done by the runner Wally ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c27vtjIYTEE ) which was a giant help in the maze-like levels in Lilo's sections so go give him some love.

	"This TAS is a nice first attempt, as I couldn't find any obvious mistake or sloppy execution. While the run may look simple, I have to note that finding and implementing improvements wouldn't be too much easy.

	"As for the entertaining side, I have to note that the movie is visually slow-paced and lacking enough action diversity. Also, the votes of the audience were mixed.
