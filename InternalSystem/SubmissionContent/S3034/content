	"It is impossible to get the Warthog past that blockade, without spending the time to destroy the tank. Thus, I let the truck kill the warthog, in the best place to keep me moving forward. Also, the first time the bar comes up for the train boss, damage does nothing. It has to move up, and then back down for damage to count.

	": This was a tough one. Great run, and great audience response. But there is the question of how this stacks up against the Genesis run. Are they different enough? Or is one run better than the other?

	"I watched each run several times, and I felt each had its own uniqueness to it. While the games are quite similar, the playing fields are not completely identical. Each also seems to have different timing for different events. In terms of true competition, I would not compare the records of one against the other. In terms of entertainment, each had its own flavor to offer. The one player versus three also greatly helped to differentiate the runs. Some may feel that this game is too easy with three players, and easier to follow the action with just one, while others would prefer to see the game dominated, and enjoy the coordination.

	"Therefore, I'm accepted this run on its own, and not as an improvement on the Genesis version.
