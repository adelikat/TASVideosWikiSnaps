	"Older game version is technically not a big deal even though the community has to host it on its own (since it's free anyway), while itch.io version gets regularly updated and doesn't host older builds (and the Steam version which may have older builds available is Windows only). It's not uncommon for us to ask game developers to add older versions to downloads though, so it might be a good idea in this case.
