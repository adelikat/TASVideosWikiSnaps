	"Kaeru no tame ni kane wa naru is an adventure game, but it looks like a mixture of adventure, action, and RPG. It is a funny, cool, and unique game. The title of the game means "For the Frog the Bell Tolls". It was released only in Japan. The major characters are a pair of princes called Sabure and Richard. You will play with the prince Sabure in his quest to save the Mille-Feuille Kingdom from Delaling. Prince Richard is known as one of the characters who make an appearance in The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening.

	"As the story advances, the Prince Sabure will become able to transform into a frog by entering water. As a frog, he can jump twice as high as his human form, as well as eat insects. He will also be able to transform into a snake by using an egg. In snake form, he can go through narrow passages, and if he is stronger than the enemy, he will be able to turn them into blocks.

One day a messenger informed the Princes that the Geronian army had captured the Mille-Feuille Kingdom. The Princes had heard tales of the beauty of Princess Tiramisu of the Mille-Feuille Kingdom and decided to act.
