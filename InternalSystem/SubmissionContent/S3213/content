	": So, this really isn't a Tool-Assisted Superplay - it is more like Tool-Assisted Password Entry.  This site is about TASes. We do not currently accept TAPE. Additionally, this password entry only occurs During User Contol Time. Thus, I am rejecting this run until we restructure the site to allow for DUCT TAPE. Sorry, better luck next time.
