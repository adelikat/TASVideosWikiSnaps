	" (and also on Steam for $4.99 with slightly more fancy graphics) which has a few nice surprising twists. As it's fairly short (especially when aiming for the bad ending) there's very little reason not to play it.

	"As it's a fairly straightforward platformer, there's very little that needs to be done except "run right for justice". However, a glitch is used in this movie to float over large gaps, saving some time in world 2 and 3. The glitch is done by jumping against the left-bottom corner of a block that's right above you. Then you can float (either left or right) as long as you keep holding the jump button. Apart from that, the continuous everting in world three is annoying.

	": Fairly poor response, given that it is somewhat of a generic platformer given the bad ending. However, my understanding of the game is that it is mostly about discovery. Since everything is known going into the TAS, even the any% good ending and 100% endings may also be rather bland. However, that really doesn't affect this decision. Rejecting due to poor feedback on goal choice.
