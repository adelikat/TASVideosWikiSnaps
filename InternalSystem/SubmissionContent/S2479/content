	"Here, I present a TAS which I finished four years ago, but never submitted, fearing it would be rejected due to bad game choice. Recently, klmz linked me to a hacked VBA that let me re-create the movie from a save state, since I had lost it. Watching it again, I see that it's not all that boring, and contains many creative and unexpected shortcuts. That, and the game itself is visually impressive. So, I'll give submitting a shot. Hope you enjoy.

	"Rayman started as the flagship character for the now-renowned company Ubi Soft as a character to compete with Mario. He is mainly known for his unique design, lacking arms or legs, and having detachable body parts such as his fist which he can throw at enemies, or his hair which can spin like a helicopter. His first game was a strikingly beautiful platformer with brutal difficulty, which was ported to several systems, including PC, PS1, and GBA. After several spinoffs and only two more entries in the series, Rayman has recently faded into obscurity (Apparently screaming bunnies are more interesting).
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"This game is one of those spinoffs. It's a simple platformer for the GBC which loosely takes story and gameplay mechanics vaguely resembling Rayman 1, and combining them with midi renditions of Rayman 2's music. Sadly, it's not nearly as difficult or interesting as Rayman's debut game, but for being a GBC game, it has strikingly good graphics. The environments are very lush and detailed, and it's surprising what the game does with only 16 colors. The music is also okay, getting catchy at times but other times becoming aggravating. My favorite track is the credits theme.

	"In the story, Rayman wakes up to find out that Mr. Dark has kidnapped a bunch of Electoons, little pink circular fairies, and trapped them in cages. So he sets out to rescue them and then to defeat Mr. Dark. In this movie, I completely ignore all the cages because I don't care about 100% completion, and just go for Mr. Dark.
