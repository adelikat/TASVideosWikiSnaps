	": Hello, Zekann, and welcome to TASVideos! Unfortunately, your submission does not meet site standards. It must be optimized and beat all known records. In addition to that, the co-creator of this ROM hack has made it known that he does not recommend TASing this game in this stage as it is still being actively worked on which will fix many of the bugs and glitches present in this current build.
