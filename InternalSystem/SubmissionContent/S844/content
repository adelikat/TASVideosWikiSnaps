	"This game has a "frame rule" of 11 frames; as such most of the improvement came from the first level which is 7 frames faster (I don't know where they came from :/), apparently enough to push it under the eleven frame mark.  Also because of this rule, the improvement to level 3 didn't have an effect, so up until the last level, I was 11 frames faster the whole movie.  The improvement of seven frames in level four came mainly from a slightly altered strategy.  I woldn't be surprised if it could be improved ever so slightly, though. ;X
