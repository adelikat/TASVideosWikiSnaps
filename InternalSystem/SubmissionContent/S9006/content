	"This movie aims to reach the best ending in Jill's story, where both Barry and Chris are saved, as fast as possible. Saving Chris requires collecting 3 MO Disks throughout the game and using them toward the end, while saving Barry involves making correct choices during certain scenes, with the main (and only) difference from any% (
	(__wikiLink|href=/8957S|implicitdisplaytext=8957S)
	") being choosing YES-NO at the start of the tunnel section. Additionally, saving Barry results in a second fight against Tyrant as the true final boss fight at the end of the game, and this is the main difference from any% in terms of combating.

	" and 
	(__wikiLink|href=/8957S|implicitdisplaytext=8957S)
	" is the ladder OoB glitch used to access the second MO Disk reader. This involves spinning around while aiming, similar to what's done for the Chemical skip, before stepping up a ladder. While it doesn't seem possible to get "into" a box and skip pushing the ladder downward on the PS version as demonstrated in the footage below on the PC version, this still allows us to skip a few pushes of the ladder upward, the release of the poisonous gas and the subsequent damage taken, and numerous camera changes. This saves mere seconds, but it looks cool doesn't it. :D

	"As mentioned earlier, having to fight Tyrant again as the true final boss is the main difference between "best ending" and any% for combating in this game. For Jill, this means an additional stack of Bazooka Rounds is needed. Additionally, the fact that 3 more items (MO Disks) need to be picked up during the second half of the game adds stress to item management. While the Jill any% movies deposit only 1 item during the sole banking session, more items from early game will need to be deposited here to make space for others.

[div class=p 
	"If a banking session is done before the second Yawn (snake) fight, at most 3 items can be deposed: Knife, Pistol, and Armor Key (which is what RTA runs do), and in this case, there wouldn't be enough space to carry Rounds from before entering the lab and we would need to pick up Flame Rounds in the storage room there (which, again, is what RTA runs do), resulting in 2 additional door animations. Door animations cost a lot of time and we generally want to avoid them as much as possible, obviously.

[div class=p 
	"For these reasons, this movie fights Yawn the same way as in any% movies (by deleting the Flame Rounds on it and then using Pistol) and does banking afterwards in the east storage room instead, picking up the Acid Rounds in the room in the process for use in the final battle. This allows us to deposit Helmet Key in addition as its last use is to open the room where the Yawn fight takes place, resulting in an additional slot where the Acid Rounds can be kept until after the first Tyrant battle. For this to work, the Explosive Rounds next to Battery need to be loaded into Bazooka immediately after they are picked up so that there is space for the first MO Disk before we can do banking and the acquisition of the red Doom Book is delayed until after the banking while the door of the room is still unlocked with Helmet Key earlier. Overall, this saves seconds over picking up Flame Rounds in the lab.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"On a related note, because different types of rounds cannot be loaded into Bazooka until the currently loaded ones are depleted, all 4 remaining Explosive Round are fired during the first Tyrant battle even though 3 are enough to defeat it so that Acid Rounds can be loaded during one of the following menu sessions to prepare for the final battle without having an extra menu session to load rounds during that battle.
