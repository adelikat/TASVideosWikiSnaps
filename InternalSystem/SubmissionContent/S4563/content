	"As far as Super Mario World's rich feature-set is concerned, the game tries hard to exclude much of it, as its focus is to recreate an earlier Super Mario game which doesn't have the features added to later games within the franchise. This mostly leaves the game as showing off what would it be like to play Super Mario Bros. with some mechanics of later games, without any of the notable features they have, not something I think anyone was really dying to know. I'm also not convinced there isn't a way to unlock some of those features (using various glitches/flaws) to actually complete this somewhat faster.
