		"Luck Manipulation: the its core most of time are result combine with timer. The result is depend what thing I'm doing, it's not alway same but most time is same. For do, I was try change and gain timer, if still don't have good then I try change result and repeat timer. That's why sometimes you'll see me must wait a little, it's just slower for faster. The hardest problem when I must make enemy draw low defense card and still can draw good card (change timer, change result)
