	"Low G Man is a platformer with many interesting boss fights. The primary way to deal damage is with a whip like weapon, but you also have a freeze gun that adds lot of possibilities for optimization. Most of the improvement here comes from better boss fights, but there is also a clip that saves several seconds (already used in RTA runs.)

This issue is not unique to this game, Bad Dudes and Paperboy also encounter it, but it remains something of a mystery.
