	"Poor Bobby needs to get home, but there are so many obstacles in his path. Guide Bobby through seven screens of diving hawks, dashing chickens, tricky pits, thorny rosebushes, and deadly sinkholes to get him home safely. Little Bobby must walk through 7 scenes before he arrives his home. Once he makes it, the journey begins all over again. Since the game repeats infinitely, I did only the first 8 screens.
