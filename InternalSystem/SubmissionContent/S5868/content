	"The controls have a delay input for each and every actions per frame. This delay is used to measure how long the input button is pressed down, and then evaluated to execute certain special moves, called Skills, in the game. For instance, when you required to start your punch, you must be in your Idle animation state. This Idle animation state then waits how long your input button is pressed down, until you release the button. If you wait a bit longer, it will go into Idle state 2, and then Idle state 3. Idle state 2 is preparing a punch with a higher damage, and Idle state 3 is where it launches the maximum punch damage.

	"I go through the main game as if I'm playing the game normally. The first thing I did was I tweaked the Options at the start. This allows me to set the Game Difficulty to Wussy, and the Text Speed to Very Fast. After applying the new Options, we go though the game intro, and then have control of our protagonist in the game. By then I quickly go to the Pause Menu, and change the 2nd Options menu where you are able to change your character's default attributes, such as Movement Speed, Weapon Throw, Damage, and so forth.

	"I didn't do a lot of research here to check and see if there are hidden stats that would affect the gameplay. There are several notable ones, of which is the hidden attribute, Reputation. It increases when you die, when you ram into walls, and you get hit while you're down on the ground, and when you recruit new characters. Another one is Foul Play, which increases whenever you hit someone while they are talking, you hit your ally (allies), when you hit someone who is lying down on the ground without waiting for them to get back up. It's really hard to research because most of the calculations of the values are calculated on the fly in the RAM, so it's difficult to pinpoint what affects what in the game.

	"All in all, I do believe there is a large room for improvements in this run. But that requires me needing to figure out what the RAM values are and what they point to in the game.
