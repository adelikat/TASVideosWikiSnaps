	"Tails' Sky Patrol is an obscure Game Gear game that stars Sonic the Hedgehog's sidekick, Miles "Tails" Prower. In it, Tails must fly through five levels at high speeds while avoiding pretty much everything. Instead of collecting Rings to protect himself, Tails has a special Ring that he can throw like a boomerang or grab things with. Although this game is very unpopular, it is one of my favorites and I had a lot of fun TASing it, and I hope you enjoy watching it!

[p 
	"Furious with the dearth of respect towards her, Witchcart turned all of the islands inhabitants into crytals and glued them to yellow anti-gravity ceramic tiles. "I don't need you!" she yelled. "I already have my loyal army to do my bidding! Eeheeheeheehee!"

[p 
	"Unfortunately for the islanders, Tails was too distraught by the thought of living in a world filled with rails to bother saving them, and they existed wistfully ever after as crystals glued to floating tiles.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Buttons 1 and 2 have the same function in this game, so I will just say "Button 2" because it is the one I used. (In fact, you can switch between both buttons in the middle of spinning the Ring and you will not throw it.)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Tails's hitbox is very small, but enemies and items have large hitboxes. This is why Tails can fly close to walls but not enemies, and why items (except for crystals) can be collected without actually touching them with the Ring.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Tails's normal maximum horizontal speed is 3 pixels per frame, and his normal minimum speed is 0.5 pixels per frame. The memory adresses are 0xD54D for pixel speed and 0xD54C for subpixel speed.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Tails's normal maximum vertical speed is 1.25 pixels per frame (in either direction). The memory adresses are 0xC799 for pixel speed and 0xC798 for subpixel speed.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Tails begins each area with 24 stamina, out of a maximum of 32. Two out of every three frames, the number at 0xD78D goes down by 3. When it reaches 0, Tails's stamina, which is stored at 0xD78E, goes down by 1. If both of them are at 0, Tails will begin falling and eventually crash into something, costing him one life. (0xD78F seems to serve the same function as 0xD78D.)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If Tails is hit by an enemy, he will lose 1 stamina and begin falling. If he has any stamina at all left, he can recover if you press Button 1 or 2 several times. The fastest way to recover is to press 2/1/2 starting about 13 frames after he is hit. (Constantly pressing either button before then will take longer.)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Boss health is assigned to the next enemy health adress in line. In this run, Fockewulf and Carrotia's health are located at 0xC89F; Bearenger and Witchcart's health are located at 0xC91F.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"At the end of a boss fight, you want Tails to be as close to the center of the screen as possible and the boss as close to the top of the screen as possible. That farther they are from those positions, the longer it will take for Tails to fly off.

[p 
	"Tails's Ring has three different states: following, spinning, and thrown.
	$LF
]p
[ul

		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"If Button 2 is held, the Ring will spin around Tails at a rate of about one revolution every 32 frames. While it is spinning, it cannot interact with anything, and Tails will let go of anything he was already holding. Grabbing and throwing a boss into something does 4 damage.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"When Button 2 is released after being pressed, the Ring will be thrown forward. It can be angled up or down. The amount of damage it does depends on how long it was spun -- less than one revolution will do 1 damage, one or two revolutions will do 3 damage, and three or more revolutions will do 5 damage. It reappears in front of Tails after it returns to him, which can be used to grab things about 9 frames sooner than would otherwise be possible.
