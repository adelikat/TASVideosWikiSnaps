There are two exceptions to this, however: The first is near the very start, where we jump from one slope to another and the second is one an intersting quirk I'll get to soon.

	"For this glitch to work, we need to land on the cobbled wall as early as possible and then jump on the 2nd frame possible. This gives us double the height and as a result, we are in the air for longer. This is usually a bad thing, but since it's near the end of the course, this is actually used to end input earlier.
