[div class=p 
	"2-1: -339[-5.560s]: The strategy was pretty much the same as Guanobowl. At the beginning I didn't slow down like he did, and I overhauled on the sand area. I think most of the time I saved was from using enemies better. When I got to the Super Star I paused only one time.

[div class=p 
	"2-2: -90[-1.500s]: I once again saved a lot of time in the sand area.  I also tried defeating Birdo from under the platform, but seems impossible. This game is very good about keeping solid blocks solid. I optimized the super jump, Guanobowl wasted a few frames jumping too high and too far.

	"3-1: -497[-8.283s]: I used Toad instead of Luigi. I was very happy when I discovered that I could do that. Almost all of the time was saved just simply because Toad is faster then Luigi.

[div class=p 
	"3-2: -50[-0.830s]: Then came the disappointment. Toadstool is soooooo slow, but she is the only character that can get through the shrtcut here. I saved my time from Birdo, I got an egg instead of a fireball and used that instead to pick her off.

[div class=p 
	"3-3: -618[10.300s]: This one was a huge time saver. The biggest one was using the ladder right before the door holding the key, shooting up about 3 screens instead of jumping on each platform. I also saved time on Mouser. I had a lot of trouble with this one. When I finally figured out what I was doing wrong I ended up saving 30 frames over Guanobowls run.

	"5-3: -622[10.366s]: This was my biggest time saver in the game. I delayed my foreward movement for about a half second so that when bombing the blocks to get into the door, I didn't have to go back to get another bomb and wait for that bomb. This strategy worked by only one frame. Took me so many tries to get it. I saved more time by picking up bombs. Even though they explode, it was worth picking them up. I didn't have to power jump when the two bombs come flying at you about midway up the underground area. Finally, after all of the I was able to hit Birdo all three times with the shyguy using one of her eggs.
