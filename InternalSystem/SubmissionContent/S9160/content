	"Falling square in the camp of kusoge, DH:V is an absolute turd of a licensed stinker, released in November 2002 to the chagrin of Die Hard and FPS fans. Consisting of 11 horribly designed stages with the worst of the worst early 2000s licensed game hallmarks, DH:V has rightfully been lost to the trashbin of history. However, I revived it on a whim, because I'm a masochist.

	"The game is only ran RTA on Die Hard (easy), enemies have 100% HP (die in 2 hits) and you take 100% damage, bosses also have a visible healthbar. Die Harder puts them at 150% and Die Hardest (the difficulty the TAS plays at) puts them all at 200%. This also has the effect of extending boss health to double their normal length and also removing a visible boss HP bar from the HUD. Aside from this, there are no other difficulty differences I can find.

[ul 
	[li 
		"Movement is implemented somewhat like Goldeneye, all your momentum moves in the cardinal directions, the game takes time to sway the camera left/right, and you can only jump if moving directly forward (or if autojump bounces you to prevent collision issues). It was also implemented with bugs. When crouched, we can forego the camera tilt and can strafe left/right 
		[em 
			"FASTER
		]em
		" than by walking forwards while crouched, moving at the same speed as walking forward normally while standing. There is also a prone mode, which puts the camera and the players hitbox all the way to the floor, allowing you to clip around certain geometry for skips, or, rarely given how situational it is, get a speedboost by launching yourself forward out of prone into standing by clipping into overhead geometry. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"All the ingame geometry has hitboxes modeled directly to them rather than having brushes of invisible walls. The effect of this is that we will be abusing our crouch and prone state throughout the run to squeeze through fencing and doors so we can bypass huge sections of levels.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"All weapons (besides the shotgun and rocket launcher) do the same exact amount of damage. McClain's .38SPC boot revolver hits just as hard as a .308 AR loaded with explosive rounds. The only major differences for DPS is the fire rate, so we use the AR/dual-SMGs as much as possible. Bullets also are physical objects, not hitscans, which take time to reach the enemy and McClain, so we can dodge bullets when necessary. Since this is hard (Die Hardest) mode, this means we have to pump 4 shots into each badguy to kill them, or get a headshot (which we don't need to do often, unless they are in our direct path or we need to kill them to trigger an event). Headshots also do not appear to do any extra damage to boss characters. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Objectives are just a suggestion. So long as we can get to the necessary triggers, we can bypass huge sections of levels without following what the game wants us to do normally (save hostages, collect items, talk to certain NPCs, etc.)
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"You start each map in "holster mode". You are stuck in this state for a few seconds until you can fire a shot and unholster, letting you move at normal speed. When holstered, your jumps are shorter (less momentum) and enemies suddenly cannot see or hear McClain because of unfinished, bugged out stealth mechanics. We will abuse this in later stages in the run to avoid activating certain triggers when being in the area should lead to a game over.
		$LF

Your ability to manage each round is far beyond any normal RNG, as you have to manipulated the AI to group up or lure people to the right place for better optimization. I might sound like a broken record, but this reminds me a lot of the manipulation that is done with Super Metroid TASes, where certain tasks require the repositioning of enemies in order to escape a room faster. Overall, this was an impressive run that has a super strength over humans...as it is roughly 17 minutes faster than the WR. Now, I realize that some strategies were missed, but honestly...this is not enough to strike this down. Heck, I even missed an important trick in my F-Zero submission. I think this run can hold its own without that being in there, as I doubt any future RTA run could even come close to this time without a significant find.
