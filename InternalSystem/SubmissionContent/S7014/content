	"After a member of the community realized that you don't need to get the roof door key I was inspired to take ajfirecracker's TAS and modify it to show the new strategy.  Not wanting to grind against any rng before Heinrich, I started with aj's inputs and then branched out from there to pickup Heinrich's submachine gun and complete the run, updating the last ~40% of the input file.  It feels like plagerizing to restate everything about the run that aj did in his comments regarding his submission, and the only update to this run is that you don't need to get the roof key, as you can shoot it instead to open it.

	"The roof door has 64 hp and both the machine gun and pistol do two damage to it. Punching and hitting it with the axe both do no damage, and c4 also registers zero damage on it (despite the fact that using c4 on it blows up the entire floor...quite a feat!). This means you optimally want to get to the roof door with exactly 33 ammo (15 pistol and 18 machine gun) so you can shoot the door to 0 hp and then have one round left to shoot it open as this lets you skip the cut scene about how many rounds are left in your pistol when going to the roof (you can accomplish roughly the same with 49 ammo, which leaves 1 round in the submachine gun when heading to the roof which also skips the cutscene). I didn't investigate why it has 64hp and bullets do 2 dmg to it vs 32hp and bullets do one but thought it was interesting.

	"As mentioned before the rng is this game is very difficult to keep up with, and most of my testing was done with the try-and-see-what-happens method.  I'm able to get to nearly every floor sooner than as shown in this run, but total overall time is lowest in this version due to issues with enemy rng on the roof.

	"For anyone speed running this game I'd recommend skipping the med kit for both difficulty settings.  Picking up the med kit is worthwhile for the TAS b/c of the door clip but for RTA attempts it was faster in all my iterations to skip the med kit.
