	"Boost Damaging 3 times instead of only once.  Dagron found an unusual property of how your double jump will sometimes go through ninjas that are also double jumping.  I do not specifically use that, but instead I manipulate the enemies to get an even higher boost. Also found that double jumping right before getting hit boosts you a couple pixels higher.  One thing I also realized was that this game actually has invulnerability frames a little after being hit although the game gives no indication whatsoever.  There is also a very strange scripted(?) ninja that comes flying in from off screen.  He seems invincible until he is standing. I don't think there is any other such "special" enemy units in the game besides this one.  Almost like an idea they never fully realized.

Used an odd down input twice with no down in between, found that was the best way to do it.  It resets the x speed, but then I can jump. This removes the previous wait from before.

	"What a gigantic pain in the ass. He can hold one of two weapons. A car or an engine block. We need the engine block because it is smaller.  However he has blocks of frames where he will hold one or the other.  So what happens is if you want any frame improvements to be realized you need to then find additional frame improvements for him.  Also he is the single largest frame save in the TAS.  By positioning carefully I am able to to a double jump and spray kunai.  I have to get over the boss since once you spray once, you run out of kunai "slots", and each additional one needs time to "recharge".  But when they recharge they start filling in the one that shoots downward.  The idea is to hit him as rapidly as possible so they recharge as fast right before I collide with him.

And it takes more frames to get into that position.  Even though I shaved off some frames from the boss this submission it nets negative.  I prefer to kill the last boss as fast as possible.
