	"I'll just call them stages from now on. Stage 0, 10, 20 and 30 can be labelled as basically the same "walk to the end, you win" kind of stages. They don't really need much explanation, because, well, you just walk to the end and win. Stage 1 has 1 obstacle that you just kind of jump over, which is fair as it is just the first stage (besides stage 0) Stage 6 and 9 is also the same. Stage 2 has four blue obstacles that you have to jump between, which is a little bit harder, but not too much harder because stages 0-10 are all on the game's easiest difficulty. Stage 3 has these trampoline things that it's just faster to jump enough on to them and jump onto the next one. Stage 4 is basically the same as stage 2 but with 1 more of the blue things. On stage 5 it's faster to jump onto the first rope and jump of the lilly pad than it is to use both ropes. Stage 7 you jump on some platforms. It is a platformer after all. Stage 8 has this annoying bee thing that you can just run under. The devs didn't even think that through. The rest of the stages are just these but harder.
	$LF
	"On stage 26, I waited for the bee to fly over because it was unavoidable when I jumped, I tested that a lot (took up 450 RR's).
