Authentic carinval music and gallery sounds set the mood as you build up your score with good aim and a careful choice of targets. But watch out for the bullet eating ducks! Once you clear the gallery you get a chance at hitting a special bear target for extra points.

	": A quircky little galaga-style shooter that takes setting in, of all places, a Carnival. This movie quickly completes five whole rounds (normal + bonus stage), after which the game has nothing else to offer. The run is greatly optimized, so I reckon only some heavy duty botting could make noticeable improvements, if any.
