	"This movie got a very good feedback, only Yes votes and support in forum posts. It is still not perfect, the author was not aware of some most effective strats, but the glitch he introduces in the last level approximately makes up for all the losses from sub-optimality, saving a good amount of time over them. My reasoning to accept this submission because of that was not disproved, and so, I'm accepting it now.

	[a class=intlink href=/Forum/T/21 
		"existing one
	]a
	") and investigate all the existing movies of it, as well as all the suggestions posted in this submission discussion. Compare the strats and co-operate with others, I hope the improved version will follow.
