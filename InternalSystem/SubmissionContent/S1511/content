	"This new movie is 54 seconds faster than the currently published movie, and uses a different strategy as well. As it turns out, it is possible to gain 100,000 dollars within two turns of craps at the limit table. The only way to do this is to roll a double 6 twice in a row, a double 1 twice in a row, or a combination of the two. You will notice a pretty big delay when I am picking the craps game on the selection list, it is done to manipulate the following two rolls. The animation time for the craps game is significanctly shorter than the roulette game. The second round of betting must be spread out because the limit on the table is 1,000 dollars.

	"I intentionally delay the input length by 2 seconds (136 frames) in order to enter a message at the end of the movie. If people don't like it, I will upload the alternate movie (2 seconds shorter).
