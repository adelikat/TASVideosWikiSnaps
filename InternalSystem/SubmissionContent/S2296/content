	"Finally, after many months of working on this game, I've finally created a TAS of it.  Let me start off on the plot and the gameplay.  The story is simply about a sheriff named Tin Star, he also has a sidekick named Mo, (funny name) anyways, they go into town to find out that the villian Black Bart is causing a ruckus, so Tin Star and Mo have to defeat Black Bart and his oil gang in order to save the town.

	"The gameplay is short, sweet, and simple.  For those of you who do not know what Tin Star is, you control the aimer of the gun, not the character, keep that in mind when you watch the movie.  I also have to say that when your playing and the Tin Star is in view (such as the first level), when you shoot, it takes a little bit to shoot again.  The scroll-on levels do that too, but the gun takes a little bit faster to shoot once again.

	"Now to explain reasons for things regarding the movie.  At the very beginning of the game, the one part with the bottle, I tried to aim for maximum score, so I had to wait for ten seconds before I had to shoot the bottle, doing so will make the bottle go higher up until you get to the target, the target gains you more score than you could ever imagine.

	"The second level of the game got kind of glitchy somehow.  The health packs that were being thrown to the air, I missed all of them.  Something happened in the emulation but I don't know what.  Normally you would go back and redo the level, but then a little bonus came at the end of the level, the one where you had to shoot the stars without hitting the girl.  When that showed up I thought, "why not put that in there?"  So I decided to leave the level the way it is.

	"This might've been bad, but some of the bonus points took a pretty long time to get, this is especially true in all of the town levels.

	"At the end of all levels, your score gets summed up to a total score depending on how many enemies you killed and how many bullets you wasted.  You will notice that my score decreases on bullets wasted, this is not a glitch in the TAS, the game's scoring system is screwed up.

	"All in all, this was way better than my last TAS I did.  I should also tell you that I didn't make this movie frame by frame.  I actually put it in slow-motion for about 13%.  It actually helps me optimize it even more, which is pretty rare on this site I'm guessing.

	": Having done a couple of games like this, I know how hard it can be to make an entertaining movie with such a limited move-set. I think you did your best, but unfortunately this game just does not lend itself to a good TAS. The length is one of the biggest problems I see with this run, along with the lack of a second player, and fairly repetitive gameplay which makes things drag. Finally, the viewer response has been lackluster. I'm rejecting this, but I hope you continue with your TASing projects.
