	" "Where's 3つの絵の部屋からの脱出2?" Obtaining this .swf is tricky at the moment. Using the Wayback machine I can find it and it works no problem. The real problem is that it forces a January build of ruffle which disables my ruffle browser extension to download it. Also, going into the console and getting the .swf doesn't give me the correct file. It gives me a completely different and somewhat newer YominoKagura room which I've already TASed. I'm going to guess what happens is that because the files might be the same and it chooses the "newer room file" over the file that I actually want.
