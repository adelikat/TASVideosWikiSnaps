]h3
[ul

		"As always, critical hits are faster than super effective moves. However, due to the difficulty of manipulating luck in this game, it might turn out to be faster to just use the super effective moves sometimes. Super effective moves are also used over critical hits in certain cases for PP conservation.
		$LF

	[li 
		"You can only manipulate wild encounter within an area when there are moving objects. Repels are necessary to avoid unwanted encounters in large dungeons.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Kazza has disobedience issues almost immediately after trade until getting Forest Badge and after a certain fight on Route 210 until getting Mine Badge. This makes luck manipulation significantly harder during a big portion of the run. Due to this very reason, this strat is not practical for RTA. BTW, Byron's Bronzor is the single hardest enemy to manipulate for because you need a max range critical hit while Kazza has a high chance to disobey.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Quick claw is not as useful as it was in Gen 2&3. I haven't found any documentation about how to manipulate it. There are a few opponents through out the run that outspeed Chimchar and Abra/Kadabra. There are even a few ones that have 4 attacking moves with 100% accuracy. Luckily, Kazza is able to take a few hit without fainting.

		"There is a message about the fog when Psyduck is encounter on northern Route 210. It might be a little faster to catch a Bibarel on Route 209 after leaving Lost Tower if your luck is good at the moment. TBH, I think it's pretty funny to have Psyduck in your team though so maybe it can be counted as a minor speed-entertainment tradeoff. :P
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"It might be a good idea to catch a wild Abra on Route 203 with Twisted Spoon after the first gym so that you can save a few crits and let Kazza forget Teleport for new moves. Abra has an encounter rate of 15% on Route 203 with a 5% chance of carrying a Twisted Spoon so it's not easy to manipulate this encounter. Alternatively, you might want to grab the Odd Incense at Solaceon Ruins. It's a less of a potential time saver, but it might allow Kazza to OHKO a few more enemies. You should buy a Escape Rope at Floaroma Town in this case.

		[a href=/userfiles/info/42817382838721960

		" with a very different route. Piplup is picked at the beginning, Machop is used until getting the bike, and a Chansey with Lukcy egg should be caught at Route 209 or 210(I failed to do this in the testrun since it has a 5%x5% chance). In this case, you don't have to fight the two trainers at the trainer school and the Lucky Egg gives Kazza more exp late in the run. You do need to make suer Machop is exactly at Lv23 so that Kazza can learn Psybeam at Lv24 after using a Rare Candy. The down side is that Machop can be outspeeded very often and Kazza would start with lower Exp and zero EVs at a much later point in the run. You also need to reteach Rock Smash to Chasey since Machop has been traded away at that point.
