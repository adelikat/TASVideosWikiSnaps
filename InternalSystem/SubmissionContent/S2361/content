In x-4 levels it is possible to save over a pixel.  Unfortunately the frame rule nullified this savings in nearly every level.  However, it did help contribute to busting a frame rule in 3-4.

Meaning, the x subpixel value mario has when he hits the flag will be used in calculating his acceleration after the flag!  The term "magic subpixel" was coined because the value of 48 seems to be the magic number on most every level; resulting a 103 frame walk to the castle rather than a 104 or 105 frame walk.  Unfortunately this glitch doesn't technically "save" time due to the 21 frame rule.

We tried everything, including manipulating the level, the previous level, and even cheating to get to the level 21 frames faster to see if it would solve our woes.  Getting there 21 frames faster changed the randomness but ultimately not enough to save time.  But this hints to the fact that the fire wheels are determined by a universal timer.  As such there is nothing we can do about it.  If I thought otherwise, this wouldn't have been submitted, trust me.
