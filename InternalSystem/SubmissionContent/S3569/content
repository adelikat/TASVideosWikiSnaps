	"If you are blinking from being damaged you can't scroll the screen up. This means even when you can damage boost up, you still have to wait until you stop blinking.

	"On the other side, there's a moving platform in clock tower level that starts moving down and left once you spawn it with screen scrolling. Fisker lost a bunch of frames waiting for it to go up again to be able to reach the platform above. I instead take damage to prevent scrolling too fast anf spawn this platform at the very moment when I'm over it already, so I jump & reach the upper platform easily.

[p 
	"Though this caused the last in-level elevators to start movig later. I mean, I make the screen scroll up til the end later, and it scrolled right then later too. The result is some lost frames because I had to wait while the last elevator goes up enough. I tried to scroll the screen so fast that I would be able to jump on that last elevator BEFORE it goes down. but a silly couple of pixels didn't allow me to reach the last platform that early D:

	"Much time was saved thanks to picking less R/R icons. Each icon costs 4 frames on he countdown.

	"Also, I reduced random lag by random jumps and taking damage, as well as by route changes.

	"Somewhere you could pick boxes to go further faster, where these boxes are on your way. But it almost always causes lag, and while you don't lose frames picking them, the throw animation is quite long.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"But the greatest improvement was the Ghost Witch fight and the Crocodile battle. The former was killed before she disappears after throwing the second stone. And the croc just used another pattern in my run, that was much faster. Other bosses are improved as well, but no that much.

				"There's a glitched red ball in the first boss room. If you fall along the left corner of the central platform and press Right and B, you would pick it. But you need something to boost you yout of the gap, use the rabbit boss or his water drops for that. The strategy of using thes ball along with boxes wasn't tested because the glitch was found after I already finished a half of the run, with manipalated bosses.
