	"This level was sort of hit and miss as I believe how you kill enemies throughout the level determine how the penguins spawn at the end.

	"I redid this a few times just because I kept losing time.

	"Based on user input, enemies will decide whether or not to attack you or they will change their attack sequence.
	$LF
	"More time gained comes from collecting more acid bottles from the previous levels, these deal quite a lot of damage so I used them wisely and saved them from the final boss fight as they allow me to destroy Penguin in an even faster matter.

Throughout his entire journey, he had always just wanted to be called Jumpman, but learned early on that the name was copyright a plumber in Italy... And he wasn't even using it! Someday, Batman would have his vengeance. He pulled out a small list, a Batlist if you will, with an even smaller Batpen to write on it. The economy had really gone to hell.

	"Sorry, what was I talking about? Oh, right. This is a very smooth run, if a bit jumpy at times, and the lack of pacifism makes it look a lot better overall. Having spoken to the author about both this run and the pacifist run, I've concluded that quite a bit of effort was put into the making of this run to make sure it was actually faster: There were some RNG issues involved with killing enemies at first, but it definitely seems like those were overcome.
