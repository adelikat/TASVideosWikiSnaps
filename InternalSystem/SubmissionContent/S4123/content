	"This run was created to fill a request from a friend. Eye of the Beholder, or Reeve as he likes to be called, suggested me to take a crack at this game a few weeks ago. At that time I was looking for a new project to work on, but I was having some trouble to find the right one. So why not, I said. The new project started with practically zero chances of success; 36 frames behind right at the start, and every time a new stage was loaded I was falling more and more behind. I found some new tricks, but most of them useless to save time, but Reeve was there to support me and give me encouragement every time I had to restart the run to include new things into it. I then found some small mistakes in the boss battles of the currently published run and it ended up being the biggest time saver of the new run. So, I’d like to thank Reeve for his suggestion, and most importantly, his support during the creation of this TAS, but also you that will spend a little bit of your time to watch my run, thank you very much.

	"Everyone knows that it’s possible to jump when you are hanging on the hook, but the height of your jump makes it almost useless to reach higher platforms. But you have a one frame window of opportunity to crouch after jumping from the hook, and that’s what makes it a useful trick. If you can crouch that means you’re on the ground, or at least that’s what the game thinks, and since the ground flag is set you can now jump as high from the hook as you normally would on flat ground.

	"This trick is already present in the published run; throw a stunned enemy into a wall, it will bump on the wall and hit you in its way back, the result; a wonderful gain of speed. What’s new is that you can still take advantage of this trick even without walls around; grab a stunned enemy, jump forward and when you’re about to land throw the enemy in the opposite direction, keep pressing that direction until you bump into the enemy for the same effect as before.

	"My spare time is very limited and I can’t afford to test every strategy that seems possible on this game. So I’m basically following Cardboard and Recca’s strategies, big thanks to them by the way, including the new tricks and fixing some small mistakes, like the damage on 6-2. Also, since I’m using a different emulator it’s kind of difficult to tell you where I’m faster or slower than them. Well, think about it as a possible improvement if you want to beat my run.
