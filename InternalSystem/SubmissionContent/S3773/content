	"After finishing Battletoads and Double Dragon, I was looking for a good game that I'm familiar with and that can produce an interesting TAS (to make). James Bond Jr. matches it all - it has nice graphics and music, suggests variable gameplay and insane item management, and I played it in my childhood (solving color puzzles on black and white TV-set).
	$LF

	[a href=http://vgmaps.com/Atlas/NES/index.htm#JamesBondJr rel=noopener external nofollow 
		"complete maps
	]a
	" of the game with all enemies and items. It allowed to plan the basic route. But the game still required tons of tests, that scared me when I realized the amount of necessary work. As always, this wouldn't ever be possible without TASEditor, as I'd have to run different parts of levels over and over from scratch, not having the ground to edit the previous attempt percisely.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"This run was made several times over. The first was just a test, the second was already submittable, but we needed to time this submission to new FCEUX release, and I had time to fix some flaws (that looked minor before I dived into them, as always). So, I started the third edition and had more success than was expected. I saved about 600 frames up to the moment of entrance the third hostage room of Level 4.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Then I got some OS glitches right at the time of TASing. I saved the project, rebooted the computer and CheckDisc automatically ran, confirming that something went wrong. I opened my project to resume work and found it filled with nils. He-he-he-he-he. No backup copy was done due to bad luck.

	"This is a 'metroidvania' with some additional gameplay features and various finite items. Enemies use global timer to behave, so you can improve one part, but lose time in another, that makes this game almost impossible to make absolutely perfect (at least now), because you can't test all possibilities accounting all enemies, obstacles and lag frames. But the game provides almost no glitches, and is not popular, so it doesn't motivate many people to TAS it, as Mario, Metroid or Castlevania do. And here I come to try my best!

		"Level 1

At first I thought they would be easy to bruteforce, but was wrong (ask Bobo the King), so now no bruteforce is used. X2poet appeared to be kind of a champion in solving the Rubik's Cube and he came up with good solutions, thanks bro.

Each safe has a code lock, and though the method is quite simple (all numbers are encoded by anothers accordingly, 0-6 1-0 2-9 3-1 4-5 5-8(or 0) 6-7 7-2 8-4 9-3), entering the safe at different frames may affect the pattern.
