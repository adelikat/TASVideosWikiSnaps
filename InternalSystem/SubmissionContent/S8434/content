	"After starting the game on frame 969, we immediately head forward. In this level, we have to wait 4 times to jump off of a ledge and make it to the next platform. Each wait is 3 frames long, so that means we have to wait for 12 frames. We also have no choice but to take damage twice, and we even roll through an enemy at one point. Level 2 only starts if we roll on a specific platform.

Well, I found those addresses and I could get past a specific point, which tells me that the game has no more to show. Great going Action 52....leave us all scratching our heads and having to figure this mess out.
