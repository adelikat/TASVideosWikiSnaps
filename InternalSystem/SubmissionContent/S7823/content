	[a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ittle_Dew_2 rel=noopener external nofollow 
		"Ittle Dew series

	" in which the legendary warrior, Jenny Tiger (who eventually meets here demise in the Turnip Wars via a toothbrush incident according to Ittle Dew lore) must adventure through the forest and battle the Lichious Turnip. Unfortunately, the game is not fully complete and likely never will so this epic battle never happens. Nonetheless, this TAS exploits the programming flaws and reaches the the Lichious Turnip in record time.

	"The jumping was quite a pain to deal with. Annoyingly, you can't change direction or stop after jumping or start moving after jumping neutrally, not to mention the fact that you can't choose how high or low you get to jump. This leads to some somewhat painful-to-watch moments where Jenny keeps moving forwards into a wall and is still miles from the ground while climbing up hills. Despite this, jumping is useful in moving as quickly as possible after going through loads or turning around. This can't be used everywhere but is as much as possible.

	"Less of an exploit and more of a standard trick: by jumping on an enemy facing the opposite direction by attacking in the opposite direction, the knockback will send us in the desired direction. This is used to cross certain gaps, gain height and just skip over frustratingly placed enemies. We do have to watch our health and it does become a problem towards the end when we need to boost off the flying rotnips which do a huge 1 1/2 hearts of damage so only one boost can be utilised in this chain of rooms.

This allows us to enter the next stage the second we enter the room with the locked door in it.

	"For the most part, I'm happy with how this turned out, despite the frustrating jumping mechanics. Though it's highly unlikely, it'd be nice to have the devs pick this project back up again and complete it; I'd love to play/TAS what was originally planned, even if some of the major oversights are ironed out. The only thing I'm not happy with is how close to the
