	"The Arm Wrestling Classic is an NES homebrew based on the titular sport. You play as Barry Biceps, an aspiring arm wrestler who wants to crush the arms of all 17 of his secondary school bullies who also happen to dabble in arm wrestling, with Moe Hawk being the local champion. You also have to complete 4 arm training sessions and 16 rounds of collecting moneybags.

	"This is an improvement of 1.74 seconds over MarioAtWork's publication thanks to a discovery from Samsara where you can start button mashing 1 frame before the lag frame instead of 1 frame after. She originally estimated this would save 3 frames per fight, but due to different cycles it actually saves 105 frames - slightly over double her estimate of 51. Due to me starting from a new input file, I haven't included MarioAtWork as a co-author. I also manipulated all the button mashing to be A by pressing random buttons a frame before each match starts and made the moneybag collecting a little more precise and entertaining.
