	"I had lots of fun doing this, I'm an ex real-time speed runner so having controls over thing are almost impossible when running in real-time. With the tools provided with the emulator I did what I could with very little that I know about them, I wish I could have use the RAM tools, I tried to understand them and failed miserably, although if someone would like to show me how to use them I'll probably remake this TAS, I could probably save 3-4 seconds in it, mostly if I could find a way to bypass that Elevator zombie.
