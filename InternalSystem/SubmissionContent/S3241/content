	"My 1st submission and I can tell you that I am already working on something else!
	$LF

[p 
	"I decided to run this game because it's a childhood favorite and I always wanted to see how fast you can beat it.
	$LF
	"I picked Jill cause she is my favorite character, I might do Chris TAS soon.

	"You can slash a zombie, pause and unpause, then the zombie will be stuck in an animation frame where it can't attack you, your 3d model therefore gets a reset, so you can run by it and avoid getting hit.
	$LF
	"Same goes for when I shoot a grenade round and pause/unpause.

	"New tricks found:

	"Skipping the zombie guarding the Tiger Statue. (Can also be done real-time)

	"Pushing the zombie in the basement and run pass it.

[p 
	"Disposing of Black Tiger webs Ã¼ber-fast without getting hit. (Can't be done real-time)
	$LF

[p 
	"For now it's all I can think of. This game got runned a lot throughout the years so finding new tricks for it was sort of hard.
	$LF

[p 
	"Most of the time I saved came from proper gameplay (obvious) and triggering doors ASAP.

	"Description: Resident Evil is a Playstation game that span the Survival-Horror genre of gaming, it didn't invent it though, Alone in the Dark did. They just took the ideas and added zombies and so it grabbed the heart of many gamers in the 90's.
	$LF
	"You play as Either Chris or Jill, Chris being harder because of the handicap of having less inventory spaces, and you are sent in to investigate on bizarre crimes that happened recently in the Arkley Mountains. But what they'll see that night will changes the event of the world...soon.

	"The making of the movie:
	$LF
	"I had lots of fun doing this, I'm an ex real-time speed runner so having controls over thing are almost impossible when running in real-time. With the tools provided with the emulator I did what I could with very little that I know about them, I wish I could have use the RAM tools, I tried to understand them and failed miserably, although if someone would like to show me how to use them I'll probably remake this TAS, I could probably save 3-4 seconds in it, mostly if I could find a way to bypass that Elevator zombie.
	$LF
	"Even though I didn't use the RAM tool, I still made use of Luck Manipulation with the first Snake encounter (Yawn), which I'm proud of :)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I'm pretty sure that Resident Evil fan will appreciate this run, and mostly people who runs this game in real-time, it combines the best actions of a lots of run into one big TAS, all tricks known are used.
	$LF

	"There is a TAS hosted here on Nintendo DS, the difference between the two games are ENORMOUS;
