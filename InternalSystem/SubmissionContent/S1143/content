	"Some guy who wears a green vest and has metal fists punches his way to victory.  He can also purchase a snazzy brown vest.  Obviously, this brown vest doubles his punching power.

	"The main life bar is large enough to allow plenty of damage taking opportunities; however, the brown vest will be lost if more than two hits are taken after getting it.  This means it's necessary to figure out whether to use the punching power on enemies and bosses, or skip the power and cruise through the level by taking a lot of damage.  Usually, the vest wins.

	"The introductory level.  Time gained here was mostly from deciding to take the vest.  This sped up punching through barriers and the boss, but a couple places were slowed down slightly to avoid getting hit.  13 seconds faster.

	"Selected next because the vest left over from Area A helps out the beginning.  The helper robot is used on the boss because it allows the damage to begin earlier, although I didn't thoroughly test the fight without the bot.  8 seconds faster.

	"Hits to be taken were selected very carefully in this level, because Shatterhand water physics don't allow for a jump less than seven stories high.  The vest speeds up the boss considerably since he spends all his time flying above.  23 seconds faster.

	"Chosen last because the Old Navy fleece powerup is at the very end of the level, allowing it to be carried into the final level.  Extra health is also taken to allow more hits later, and there is a lot of fun with ceiling gravity.  6 seconds faster.

	"Revisiting a few bosses, keeping the powerup for them, and wacky gravity make this a pretty fun level to watch.  The final boss's vulnerability is pretty odd, so it sometimes looks like time is wasted not punching, when in actuality, the boss will not receive damage.  26 seconds faster.

	"In total, the run is 108 seconds faster.  You'll notice that the individual improvements add up to 101 seconds.  This is why it's good to have an accurate comparison.
