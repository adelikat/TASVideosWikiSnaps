	"The main life bar is large enough to allow plenty of damage taking opportunities; however, the brown vest will be lost if more than two hits are taken after getting it.  This means it's necessary to figure out whether to use the punching power on enemies and bosses, or skip the power and cruise through the level by taking a lot of damage.  Usually, the vest wins.
