	": Great TAS. The whole run is packed with action and close calls, continuously providing superhuman gameplay. Making use of the secret input sequence for activating the hardest difficulty was a good choice, since it adds challenge to the play. The player did also fill the dead times with funny playarounds, which helped in keeping the pace. The audience response was universally positive.
