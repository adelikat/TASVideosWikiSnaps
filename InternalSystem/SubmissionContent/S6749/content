	"Strategy:
	$LF
]h3
[div class=p 
	"When the last heart is collected, the ball flies upwards until it reaches the top of the screen. Only after that you can transition to the next level. So, when going for fastest completion in real time, the strategy is not necessarily to collect all hearts as fast as possible, but to transition the fastest. What this essentially means, is that the ball should have as much upwards momentum as possible, when collecting the last heart.
	$LF
	"Since the bouncing is automatic, optimization usually involves minimizing bounce cycles. On some levels it’s clear that you’re close to the heart but have to wait the bounce.

	"Tricks and glitches:
	$LF
]h3
[ul 
	[li 
		"Bumping against a wall reverses the x speed of the ball. The default x speed to the right is 8 while it’s 9 to the left. So, when bumping off a wall to the left the 9 speed mirrors and you can hold it indefinitely. This was used to move faster in some levels.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"When it comes to moving platforms, the ball is actually able to bounce off of their bottom part as well, which is a few frames faster than a regular bounce (usually 1~2).
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Corner bounce: When doing a corner bounce, the ball kind of falls one pixel further before it then suddenly clips up onto the block again. Therefore, the corner bounce is usually 2 frames slower than a regular bounce (two frames, because of the one more frame of free fall and the one frame needed to clip up). A corner bounce reverses the x speed just like a bump against a wall, since the game interprets it as a wall and a floor at the same time. The corner bounce have different outcomes depending on the block you’re touching:
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				"Breakable blocks: Instead of destroying the block itself, it turns whatever is underneath the block into a breakable block and destroys it instead.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				"Arrow blocks:
				$LF
				[ul 
					[li 
						"Up-arrow: Can destroy the arrow block (not always the case);
						$LF
					]li
					[li 
						"Sideway-arrow: Corner bounce doesn’t work on sideway-arrow-blocks (which makes sense, since the ball simply can’t bounce off those);
						$LF
					]li
				]ul
			]li
			[li 
				"Solid blocks and moving platforms: Nothing special. It’s just slower than a usual bounce (which sometimes actually comes in handy).
				$LF
			]li
		]ul
	]li
	[li 
		"Clipping through walls: 
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				"The ball must be moving with high x speed (such as the normal max horizontal speed of 0x08), then in the very last frame before touching the block you hold the opposite direction for at least 7 frames. The game “forgets” to handle collision since you’re holding the opposite direction, so the ball can end up inside the block.

		"Out of Bounds: by clipping the wall on the level/screen boundary, the ball can end up out of bounds, which is fully navigable. When checking the VRAM in the GPU Viewer, you can see that the main game region is the Background, and the secondary region is the Window. We don’t know exactly the details here, but when the ball is moving OOB it can reach the Window as well, right below the Background. While in the Window, the ball interacts with blocks from both the Background and the Window, with exception of the moving platforms and the level hearts. This is useful for 2 instances:
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				"Skipping portions of the level, by using it as a shortcut to get hearts faster, which was used a lot in the run and the research;
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				"Getting the OOB Heart: the pause menu is loaded in the Window, and it has a heart as cursor to select between “Resume” or “Quit”. This heart actually works the same way as the normal ones in the level, so if you get OOB and reach it you can end the level, as long you pause to load the heart there. Also it must be the last heart to take (the remaining heart counter at $00D6 must be 1), otherwise the level still waits for you to get the remaining ones, and down there you can’t get back to the level — unless you fall down and wait the overflow in the y position. This strat takes around 650 frames, depending on where the ball starts in the level, so levels that are slower than that were candidates for this trick. Unfortunately, it was only faster in level 23.
