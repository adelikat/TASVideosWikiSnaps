	"By timing this glitch perfectly, you can make Abe stop and turn. To set it up, Abe needs to be standing near a ledge (pressing up whilst turning away from a ledge), you’ll be able to make Abe do a backwards jump. Notice that when you press the opposite direction to where Abe is standing at the incorrect frame, Abe will just jump up and stand. But if you time it perfectly, Abe will jump backwards and possibly jump to another screen. This will allow you to jump backwards to areas and skip certain areas. Sligfantry's video can show you how this glitch works:

The PC port of Exoddus will have the most interesting runs to watch as the any and 100% includes an Advanced Relocation Glitch (ARG) and 100% has some hidden wells that teleports Abe to quicker locations like a wrong warp in the Mario games resulting speedruns that can be done in under 2 hours, and there is to no lag on the PC version so further strats can be implemented! Also, Maximum Casualties on the PC can be finished with 310 Mudokons killed!

I remember seeing it for the first time and thinking how it caught my attention. Well, I applaud your efforts to maintaining the latest technique and keeping the TAS as fast as possible. Everything looks great and congratulations on a 1 minute and 9 second improvement!
