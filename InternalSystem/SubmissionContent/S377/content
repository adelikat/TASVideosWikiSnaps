	"Forget about that Final-thing back there :P I made a improved run of this wonderful Beat em Up game.

[p 
	"Lots of improvements, about everything on bosses. They are defeated much faster than before. Few mistakes here and there in the stages but they don't really affect the time itself.

[p 
	"I kill every enemy and take bonus pizzas in Bonus Stages. And I tried to make em more fun to watch too. Also I kill enemies in stages differently than before.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The problem with this game is to get the enemies in best possible positions to dispose em effectively.(I tried to improve after this but enemies spawned more weirdly than in this run) It's a real pain in the ****. I use more specials in stages too. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In Stage one I take a pizza at the end to avoid getting bonuspoints from without taking damage in the stage.
	$LF

[p 
	"Stage two was pretty straightforward. I kill Roadkill rodneys with Specials because it takes less time than waiting to throw a footclan at em. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Stage three I do a perfect-run outta it. Nothing else to say about that.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Stage four the improvement is killing mousers first to make the stage scroll forward - also Shredder is killed faster. The elevator action has the best music in the business ^^ 
	$LF

[p 
	"In stage five I have a better tactics with Slash.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Stage six I also defeat the Big Bad Boss Duo (not) faster than in previous run. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Stage seven has few weird things in it. like the one Stone Soldier that I leave behind but the persistent bastard still came back to haunt me.. few seconds there. I personally hate the bossfight here because you can only hit him three times and only once/Special :/
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Stage eight I do another perfect run. I also defeat Krang without him having a chance to do that weird explosive balls-attack.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Stage nine was a pretty straightforward again. Krang is beaten more faster
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Stage ten I defeat Super Shredder faster than before too.
