	"This submission is for Cyberball, an NES robot football game with 6 periods instead of 4, more downs, only one "first down" per drive in the manner of defusing an ever increasingly hot football, which blows up at "critical" if you don't defuse it or score. It sounds good in concept but it's not a great game.

[div class=p 
	"So Cyberball has 2 overarching "difficulty" modes, Rookie and Advanced. Rookie is barebones. You don't pick your team, you can burn less time pre-snap (22s) and you get very little in the way of play choice.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Advanced lets you pick one of 4 teams and one of 4 difficulties. We choose the most difficult opponent for this run. Also, you can burn WAY more time pre-snap (up to 1:30 in some situations) so maintaining possession is key.

	"This game is pretty long usually (around 15-16 minutes) but through the magic of early input ending, we finish input in under 50 seconds, letting the rest of the game play out and watch the AI do nothing to beat us.

[div class=p 
	"We score a TD on the opening kickoff, and run for the 2pt conversion which is the final input. Even though we hold the AI to 2 points (one safety) scoring the 2 pointer is imperative for RNG purposes, and to keep our QB alive which pays dividends later on in the run in terms of getting an extra time wasting menu and staying alive long enough to get safetied instead of blown up (which is an instant turnover.) If the QB dies on the 2pt conversion he's replaced with a crappier version who isn't durable enough to take the hits we need him to take for the run to work.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"When on offense, not doing anything burns the clock down by 30s, twice. Once for play type and once for play. Occasionally 3 times (the aforementioned time wasting menu) and if the period ends while we have possession it burns another cycle. Luckily we don't need to hit buttons to advance any menus, and we end input in absurdly fast time.
