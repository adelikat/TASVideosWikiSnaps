	"Contra - The Hard Corps is a game about a wolf that is supposed to save the world from evil robots. Half way through he gets bored of running around and decides to time travel and marry a monkey.

	"Seriously though, this is an improvement to the existing, and quite old, Contra 4 run. I made a bunch of changes, and all were for the better I think.

	"First, I changed the ROM to the Japan version because in this version you get hit points (weird) which allows me to take damage to save time.

	"Second, I used the wolf. My main reason for this should become quite obvious halfway through the first level. Hint -- pay careful attention to the spider mid boss in level 1, he is the only boss who gets a chance to attack me. The rest of the bosses are killed before they can do anything useful.

	"Third, I chose to get the secret ending. This game has 6 endings I think. Four are normal, one is really a game over, and this one. I went for this one because you can get it the quickest, and I think the rest of the levels are boring. Going the path I went, one of the later levels has a long auto scrolling part with some kind of swinging thing that attacks you. While it looks funny, I think it's boring.

	"This is my third attempt at doing this game, and I hope you like it. By the way I like Contra games.

	"Then there is the problem of obsoletion and categories. People does not seem to want to obsolete the current movie because they have very different endings.
	$LF
	"We can not have one movie per ending, 5 movies for one game is too much.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"My suggestion is to have one movie for the secret ending (this one), and one movie for any of the 4 "real" endings. Whether that should be the shortest path (current published movie) or the "best" ending (with the rocket in the final stage) is left open at this point.
