	[a class=extlink href=http://seanriddle.com/jwaves.html rel=nofollow 
		"44 waves
	]a
	" of Joust, because that's when it stops getting harder. It has 90 waves in total, after which it simply loops to wave 1,and after 40-ish wave its waves start looping content-wise.

	"I tried to never use similar strats (except when the only strat is to stand around and KILL), and also to end input ASAP.
