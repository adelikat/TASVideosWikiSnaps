	"Mutant League Hockey is a very violent sports game. It is just like ice hockey, but there are traps on the arena, and the players are skeletons, trolls or even robots â€“ with weapons. If too many players are killed from a team, the team must forfeit. It is the fastest method for ending the game. This TAS attempts to reach the forfeit screen as quickly as possible.

	": Much like fighting games, sports games should generally not just aim for fastest completion, but instead show multiple oddities and glitches from the engine. Examples include 
	(__wikiLink|/1039M|1039M)
	", 
	(__wikiLink|/1118M|1118M)
	", and 
	(__wikiLink|/1438M|1438M)
	". While this movie demonstrates an oddity, i.e. that you can beat the other team to death, that is actually a part of the gameplay itself. Thus, this TAS really doesn't live up to the standards set by other sports TASes on the site. Rejecting.
