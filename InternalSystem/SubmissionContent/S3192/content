	"Mutant League Hockey is a very violent sports game. It is just like ice hockey, but there are traps on the arena, and the players are skeletons, trolls or even robots â€“ with weapons. If too many players are killed from a team, the team must forfeit. It is the fastest method for ending the game. This TAS attempts to reach the forfeit screen as quickly as possible.

Also we don't have a separate goal in Standard for aiming for shortest input, it's just the author's creative decision. And in Alternative, the run has to be entertaining, which is also questionable for several minutes of AI doing the same thing.
