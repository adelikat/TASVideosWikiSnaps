	"Yet another improvement to my NES marble madness movie.  This is the 5th version (3rd submitted).  This one is a 64 frame improvement over the current published run.

	"The improvements come from staying off screen more.  I was able to optimize this using memory watch to monitor the position & speed of the marble.

	"This game has a 16 frame rule.  I improved levels 2 and 3 by 16 frames by overcoming this frame rule.  In reality they were improved by less (3 in lv2, 9 in lv3).  Also, I improved level 5 by 32 frames (overcoming the frame rule twice).

[p 
	"I believe this run to be un-improvable due to this frame rule.  While there might be a possibility that you could squeeze a frame or two in a level, not enough to overcome the next frame rule.
