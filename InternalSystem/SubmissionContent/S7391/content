	"Play with the teletubbies is a young children interative video game where you can play with the teletubbies, doing many different activities with them, such as playing hide and seek, learning about guitars, playing with clouds for 2 minutes, playing with each teletubby's favorite thing, play on a magic drum, ride on a train for 2 minutes, play with buttons in the Teletubbies home for 2 minutes, spill tubby custard on the floor and force noo-noo to clean it up, have Noo-Noo eat Tinky Winky's Tubby Toast and chase him around the house in a very disturbing looking image NAUGHTY NOO-NOO, eat tubby toast, and finally watching videos of random kids doing activities.
