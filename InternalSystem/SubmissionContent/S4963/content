	"Spider-Man 2000 revolves around Spidey trying to hunt down an impostor who stole an invention of Doc Ock, framing him and setting off a whole chain of events that shrouds the city in mist and turns Spidey into Public Enemy #1.

	"Two main versions of the game can be TASed, the N64 and PSX versions. While the PSX version is quite a bit more polished, I went with the N64 version for the better load times. Elsewise, every trick done in this run can be done on the PSX.

	" Web Swinging
	$LF
]h3
[hr 
]hr
[p 
	"Web swinging is quite a bit more complicated then you would be led to believe. This was before the movie version of Spider-Man 2 revolutionized web swinging and then got promptly thrown out. In this game, web swinging is determined by Spidey's distance from a swingable object. For example, aiming for a far building makes Spidey swing long, but not fast. This is quite difficult to optimize as a result. If you see me ending a web swing early, it's usually to angle Spidey to focus on a new, faster, web-swinging target.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Another aspect of web swinging is a 'web zip', which is where Spidey shoots a line forwards and launches to that point. It's pretty fast, but wildly inconsistent to do outside of indoor areas.

[p 
	"Spidey has 5 different web abilities. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The first is just plain old webbing, which can be used to hit faraway switches and stun enemies. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The second is web gloves, which gives Spidey a boost in strength for 2.6 combos (it runs out on the final hit of the second combo). 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The third is Impact Webs, which lets Spidey shoot a ball of web at an enemy. It's quite similar to normal webbing, except it deals damage and also takes time to reach its target, which is useful for the random trick. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The fourth is the Web Dome, which protects Spidey in a dome of webbing that explodes after a certain amount of time or when a button is pressed. Used a whole once on some lizards.

	$LF
]h3
[hr 
]hr
[p 
	"Now this is where stuff starts to get interesting. For some reason, holding UP and A at a specific point in the intro cutscene lets Spidey grab onto an invisible ceiling. From there, it is then possible to get out of bounds. Thanks to web-swinging, this can then be used to travel through the level in an unloaded state, which means everything except props and NPCs are unloaded. This makes it extremely easy to skip everything and rescue the hostages without any hassle.

	$LF
]h3
[hr

[p 
	"This fight is very interesting. I hit Scorpion right as he strikes JJJ for two reasons. The first is that it keeps JJJ stunned for a second or two longer, and the second is it gives me enough time to put on web gloves. This culminates in Scorpion running straight into JJJ, which locks both of them in place and prevents Scorpion from counterattacking me. After that it's child's play.

[p
