[div class=p 
	"Web swinging is quite a bit more complicated then you would be led to believe. This was before the movie version of Spider-Man 2 revolutionized web swinging and then got promptly thrown out. In this game, web swinging is determined by Spidey's distance from a swingable object. For example, aiming for a far building makes Spidey swing long, but not fast. This is quite difficult to optimize as a result. If you see me ending a web swing early, it's usually to angle Spidey to focus on a new, faster, web-swinging target.
