[p 
	"There are actually several ways to perform this glitch, but the name comes from the most common way to do it.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"To do it, just have both characters hit the same two or more enemies at the same time. This will cause constant damage to them as long at there are at least two enemies being hit at the same time. This even destroyed a boss at one point.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The downside to this trick is that the enemies can also do it. This is why it's bad to be pinned against walls.
	$LF

[p 
	[b 
		"The Double Grab
	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"By having one player attack a grabbed enemy that is being attacked by the other player, both players can grab the same enemy at the same time! This is incredibly useful against bosses with high health as I can constantly Atomic Drop them to death.
