	"Xevious Arrangement is a remake of Xevious which introduces new power-ups, enemies, bosses, and simultaneous co-op. The main goal is to rack up score as you shoot enemies in the air and destroy anything on the ground as you go through each area, there's 16 in total and 3 extras if certain conditions are met.

	"There's a harder mode called Mania which adds more ground enemies and throws harder enemy variants such as the Galboss from Galaxian seen in the extra areas that will show up in area 2 if Mania is active. This TAS goes through the game on it's default difficulty. In order to play on Mania the player needs to get the first message

		"("This game is dedicated to the original XEVIOUS staff")

	" by bombing a specific spot on the right side of the screen upon starting the game after that, find the two SOL towers in Area 1 and lastly, the player has to bomb the left side of the screen during the transition to Area 2 and if done right there will be another message

	" points for Normal. The 1st Extra Area is unlocked by not dying in the main 16 Areas and takes place after the credits roll. Extra 2 has the same condition but only applies for Extra 1. For Extra 3, all 60 of the hidden SOL towers must be found done by using a bomb. Death is intentionally used in Extra 3 to push the score further as you respawn at the start no matter what due to the lack of checkpoints. In the constant juggling between shooting enemies and finding the hidden towers, you'll notice there's moments where some enemies don't get killed. That's because it's near impossible to kill them without risking any points earned from the ground or they're just too far away to reach before they either fly away or disappear so TAS priorities anything that will give out higher points.
