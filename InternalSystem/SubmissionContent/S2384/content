	"I'm Chinese, I couldn't speak English well, so someone please give those tricks better names, thank you. And one more thing I'd like to say, the "Vine glitch" in 
	[a class=intlink href=/1331M 
		"movie #1331
	]a
	" wasn't found by us, someone had already found it for a lone time, I found it, too. I didn't used it because I know there're ways a lot faster than using the "Vine glitch", and I didn't finish this movie as soon as I can, because I'd like to make it better, and I am not going to talk on the TASVideos discussion board until now. So, I guess this is not a frame war anymore, it's about hard-working guys who made progress.
