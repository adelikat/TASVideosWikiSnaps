	"Dragons of Flame is the sequel that was promised in the credits of the infamous "AD&D: Heroes of the Lance". While the game was better received than its predecessor, it was still limited to a Famicom release on Nintendo systems. The game follows the party from HotL after they recovered the discs of Mishakal, until they slay the 'Dragon Highlord of the North', Lord Verminaard. The gameplay can best be described as a (very) poor man's version of Zelda II for the NES.

When it lowers its head, a high sword attack will damage the dragon. The second time, the sword attack was timed to inflict a double-hit, which was just enough to kill it. The time gain of mixing sword attacks and magic missilies over simply using three magic missiles is just a handful of frames though.

	"I believe the biggest time save left on the table is the route through the overworld sections. There are too many combinations to try by hand, so a script would have to be written to more systematically calculate or test if stop frames can be avoided and if random lag can be reduced. I doubt we're talking about more than a handful of frames though. The problem with writing such a script is that empirical testing would take a long time, while calculating the RNG for upcoming input isn't possible with today's knowledge. Since the global counter in $79, which provides entropy to the RNG-calculation, continues to run during lag frames, getting knowledge of what determines the number of lag frames during a movement would be required first.
