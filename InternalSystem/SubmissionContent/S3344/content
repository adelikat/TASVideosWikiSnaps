	"Due to a popular request, here's the full run of this game, but optimized. I saved a bit under 5 seconds from the last full run by revisiting 1-1, 1-3, 1-6, 1-7, 2-1, 2-2, 2-3, 2-5, 3-6 and 3-7, fixing the most glaring examples of unoptimized jumping, finding new tactics for three parts and re-using the last levels from the password run. After hexing it all together I still had to redo the last boss, and managed to slip in one last surprise in there. Hope it was worth it...

	"This game was first published on GBA and only later on DS. I picked up the DS version for this run because of a few factors: first, I wanted to make a DS TAS. Second, the DS version of this game has one unique level (1-7) and new fire obstacles here and there that you have to blow out. It's basically a fuller, more difficult version of the game. Third, DS has a stylus menu for switching between your skills, which is very convenient - on GBA you only have one button for it. The stylus menu also allows some light glitches during the run. Fourth, DS has a far better music quality, which is nice because the game has quite good music.

	"It's a difficult game in the sense that you'll likely die some times playing through it if you're not careful. Genevieve's hitbox is big and enemies are either fast or numerous.

	"Jumping is some sub-pixels faster per frame than normal walking, so I jump all the time. While running it is equally fast to run and jump, although it is slower to run up stairs than jump over them.

[div class=p 
	"Jumping with lesser power in places with low ceilings makes your jumps longer, and thus you are able to visit ground less often. I think this trick is not utilized everywhere it could've been.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"There's some surface to the edges of platforms that take more jump power to land on, as if that area was slightly higher. Counter-intuitively, it's faster to land on these edges regardless if you continue moving sideways afterwards. Genevieve moves so slowly that it's worth it to land a few frames slower than to move more horizontally...
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Sometimes you can also land quicker if you press jump one frame longer than the minimum it takes to land on a platform (depends on the height).
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"By dropping towards stilts-surface and equipping the stilts at the last possible moment, Genevieve falls two frames longer than normal. At best this saves subpixels and lets you visit ground less times during a level, although it mostly doesn't help. Just done for the sake of doing it, and it becomes obsolete once you can run.

	"It usually saves 2 frames to walk into a cutscene rather than jump into it.

[div class=p 
	"If you hit with the butterfly net right as you walk off a ledge, you fall down extra quick and can also jump again mid-air. This is used for a TAS-only tactic in 3-7 for example.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"It's best to activate string locations from as far away as possible to have Genevieve instantly move closer to the location - saves a little bit of time each time. This can sometimes also displace the string collision. You can see it happen during the library world for example - because the collision is more to the right than it should, I can jump to the upper level a bit earlier than normal.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"While you can control the power of the croquet mallet using the stylus, you can't control the angle of the shot. Targeting takes time, so I usually get to a position from which I can do the shot without having to target at all. Also, shooting with the mallet has the power to manipulate A.I.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"You can switch dress through the stylus menu while you are using your skills. This allows some DS-only glitches like running with any dress active. Also, if you switch to the yellow dress (butterfly net) while placing books or lifting strings, the object you are placing actually gains offensive properties and kills enemies it touches(done for fun at least once during this run).

	"You can pass through retractable walls/floors by taking the camera to a far away location using L, then letting it return. If Genevieve is touching the surface before moving the camera, the trick won't work. This trick also respawns most enemies to their initial location (but not Brutus, the monkey).

[div class=p 
	"I know a few ways to go OOB in this game, and two of them are used for entertainment in the run. However, it's unclear if OOB could be used for something useful in this game. There is some room to move there, and even ways to get damaged. However, without a camhack it's not possible to see anything and thus testing is not easy at all.

[div class=p 
	"Getting hit by an enemy in air has two advantages. For one, your falling momentum resets, allowing you to do a slightly longer jump (not useful in this run). Second, in some places getting hit by an enemy when under a platform allows you to do a jump as if you were standing on that platform already. This is done once, in the fourth world, but there may still be other undiscovered locations where this trick could save time.

	"1-7: the most interesting level in a long while. This is the DS-only special level and has a sudden increase in difficulty and complexity in comparison to the other levels before and after. Due to my route I don't actually have to blow any fires out (although Genevieve stops to warn the player at the start of the level), and this is the first time I can use "chasm zipping", especially nice since I'm still stuck at walking speed. I take one hit less during this level because I realized I can simply walk under one of the spiders. Then there are lots of gates to slip past.
