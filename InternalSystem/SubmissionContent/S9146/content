	"Most people know Mega Man X3 for the SNES, which plays as any other X game, as you go intro into 8 mavericks then Doppler stages. However, for the PS1/MMXC version, you can skip straight to Doppler stages by executing a glitch in stage select by highlighting the Doppler icon and pressing X or Start button on the same frame, even if it doesn't appear on screen. Hetfield90 and nrg_zam already done an awesome

	"Before working on the run, I was debating whether I go get the saber and hoping that it makes up for the time lost trying to beat Vile as soon as possible, or simply go straight to Doppler stages and just buster everything down. Honestly, I was really hoping that going for the saber ends up being faster as it is more fun to make and watch, but after testing both routes, Buster Only route ended being significantly faster than Saber route by over a minute and forty seconds.

[div class=p 
	"In Mega Man X games, charging buster takes a number of frames that is a tiny bit higher than bosses i-frames (with the exception of Doppler that his i-frames are higher than buster charging time). This gives the idea of using a regular shot from a far distance in order to make the charged shot be ready immediately after the i-frames wear off. This technique is called CF-0 in MMX RTA community because it is mostly used against MMX2 intro boss CF-0, and so it got that name.

	"A great example can be seen in 
	[a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_YU1AnzlTI&t=550s rel=noopener external nofollow

	". This is the main technique to use for every boss fight in this run which are Maoh the Giant, Bitbyte, Vile (second phase), all 8 mavericks, Sigma. However, it is pretty suboptimal against Vile (first phase), Doppler and Kaiser Sigma, which will be explained later.

	"I just got through the stage in a fast way. Notable parts are the boss fights. Mini boss needs 1 regular shot and 3 charged shots. I tried to organize them in an optimal way. As for BitByte fight, it was intimidating, but it was far enough to perform CF-0 consistently. RNG patterns were not that annoying, however it did require specific patterns sometimes. Taking damage at some point helped a lot smoothing the fight more.

	"First, off we don't have water physics so some not good kicks were required. As for the famous elevator skip, well, I wasn't able to start the climb from a first kick, because the way buster is used does not allow to shoot the snail and kick at the same time, so I had to take damage, fall down then initiate the climb. Not having Triad Thunder also makes it difficult to optimally initiate the climb. Not sure if there is a secret way to do it without falling down though.
	$LF
	"Vile fight is interesting. I'm glad that Vile (first phase) is soft weak to buster (charged shot does 3 damage while green shot does 2), this made the fight a lot more manageable. Vile (second phase) was straight forward.

When that happens, I run to the left side (while there still i-frames) in order to have an optimal CF-0. Allowing him to jump to the left side is significantly worse and not wanted.

Second, he has a rainbow pattern that should not happen because it costs a lot of time. It was absolutely difficult to optimize this fight, but I believe I did a good show there!
