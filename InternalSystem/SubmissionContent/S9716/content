		"RNG in European version is very hard to manipulate. I'm not sure how it changes, but I think I got lucky with some health drops, as they are now very necessary to manage where to use the falling trick, as Jason only has 8 HP, with 2 HP lost in Area 1, and we need at least 7 HP to optimally use that trick.
