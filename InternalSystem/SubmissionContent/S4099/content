	(__wikiLink|/2149S|2149S)
	" by 925 frames thanks to extensive use of avoiding spawn of different objects (enemies, bullets, checkpoints), movement optimizations and lag frame removing and more boosts / better health management and other tricks. Starting with 128 HP and finishing the game with 3 HP.
