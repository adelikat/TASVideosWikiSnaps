	"Super E.D.F is an early, nice looking and sounding SNES shooter.  It allows the selection of weapons (I decided to use a laser on every level,) which power up to level 5 upon beating enemies, and can have Gradius-style options to spread shots.  It also gives only one life (besides continues,) with three shield bars; I take no damage in this run (strangely, some small bullets cause no damage at certain angles.)  I also play pacifist except for bosses and minibosses, still finishing with about a 7 million score due to how the final boss is worth 5 million.  I try to make it fun by creatively weaving around shots.

	"Basically every shot that needed to connect did so; some bosses were hard, but others were straightforward.

	": Unlike what you claimed, this run misses plenty of shots in obvious places. People (the few who bothered to check it) didn't seem to find it very entertaining, and I agree. Rejecting.
