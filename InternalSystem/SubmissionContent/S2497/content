	"Black Hole plans to launch an attack on Macro Land, and almost all of the territories are under enemy control. Your mission is to stop them by moving your troops in order to complete your objective in certain missions. In the earlier missions that objective is usually to either rout the enemy or to capture their HQ, but occasionally you have to destroy Black Cannons.

I'm going for minimal days in each mission for consistency with my original goals. As someone who watches the run will probably see, the enemy turns take up most of the time in the later missions.

[p 
	"Each CO in the game has a power meter, which are the stars under their portrait in the corner of the screen. Those stars fill according to damage taken and dealt. It fills based on unit cost, so if, for example, an Infantry is destroyed from full health (cost 1000), the defending CO will get 1000 more for its power bar, and the attacking CO will get a fraction of that. For that reason, in some missions (such as Great Sea Battle and Navy vs. Air), it's usually better to avoid confrontation in order to stop this power meter from rising.

A unit that has its damage calculated at 63%, for example, has a 30% chance of inflicting 7 damage rather than 6.
