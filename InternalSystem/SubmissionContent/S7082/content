	"I know, many people have made fastest crash TASes over the years. However, this one's more interesting for me. Crashing because of a simple button combo like left+right is just crazy. April Fools wins again! In any case, I made sure to optimize the crash as much as possible, cycle-perfect. CGB in GBA mode was used here because why not? Oh, I'm being told to write a bit more. Jokes are the best... Is this good? No? Well, I hope everyone has a great rest of April, May, June, July, the rest of the year, and the rest of the century! Nobody is going to eat TASVideos. I repeat, nobody can do such a terrible thing to such an amazing, awesome, terrific website. April Fools wins again! April Fools wins again! April Fools wins again! Jokes are the best, and April Fools wins again! April Fools wins again! April Fools wins again! April Fools wins again! April Fools wins again! April Fools wins again! April Fools wins again, yeah!

	": In the time it's taking me to think of a good joke to reject this submission with, I could've watched this run and the published run of this game about 10 times each, and then I'd still have 2 minutes left on the microwave for my Hot Pocket (tm). There just really isn't a lot to say about Shiren GB1, unfortunately... I really like the menus, I guess? They're good menus! Between this and the published run, I'm not sure if there's actually even a game or if it's just menus!
