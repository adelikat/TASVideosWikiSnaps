	"This is one of those games where you have to time a shot, against cycling placement routine. There are a only 3 frame window for each ball placement. This may be difficult for human, but certainly a trivia matter for a TAS. So, hardly any re-records.

	"Notice my name in the game? You might think I wasted 4 frames in typing that out. Well, not really. The commodore has an architecture where keystrokes are buffered. So, whether it was 1 letter, or 4...the game started on the same frame. The only caveat is, the keystrokes have to be made during a part of the game that is loading up the next part of the user interface...which can be a chunk of frames. Usually, enough to do some small typing.
