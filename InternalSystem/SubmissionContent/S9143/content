	"I believe a speedcode TAS is also acceptable, and would be around 6 minutes or less. Should we find a way to stabilize glitch characters they could become the ultimate strategy someday, as their properties can be killing the enemy when getting hit for example. The speedcode might make another character viable, as the charge times for moves seem to be bugged( game goes faster, but the charge time remains the same apparently which would make some combos unavailable)

	"Riptor has great combo loops to beat most enemies around 89 91 seconds total. I believe this can be improved with better RNG or Arcade ladders more favorable but I decided to submit after talking with KI speedrunners in the Discord. The improvements would be around 1 second for each fight if perfect. I avoid full combos so damage doesn't scale so much. Some stages drop the enemy down a cliff, so I changed the end of the fights to avoid knocking them out of the arena.

	": This tas has good feedback and interesting to see that Riptor was chosen as the fastest character.  Enjoyed seeing Killer Instinct being beaten quickly like this.  There are no major issues with optimization.

	"However there are some spots for improvements.  Some inputs just use alternating input instead of specifically finding and inputting the needed input on the exact frame. Also at the end of most fights where a more careful frame precision for inputs would result in faster defeat of the opponents.

	": Replacing current file with a new file with inputs that allow the credits to roll. This increases the length from the previous input file, but properly scrolls the credits as needed. This updated file has two Start inputs that bypass a congratulations screen and a screen telling the player the code to unlock Eyedol.
