	(__wikiLink|displaytext=current publication|href=/1140M)
	". Still, it turned out overall longer due of the fact that the author used 1 player, as it results in longer score screens after defeating each boss. Making the duration of the score screens as short as possibile does require some routing and optimization, so it can't be overlooked when making comparisons between TASes.

As ThunderAxe31 noted this looks optimized and even has improvements compared to the 2 player movie.  Looks like a fine movie and I see no reason for rejection anymore.
