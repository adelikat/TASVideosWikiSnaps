	"This is 1 player mode! Played for Cormano Wild, because his weapon has a larger radius of action than the Billy Cool pistols!

	"The game is completed faster than 2 player mode, but it took longer because of the screen with bosses damage percentages, where in 2 player mode 50% is 50%, while 1 player mode is 100%. 100% longer timed than 50%!
