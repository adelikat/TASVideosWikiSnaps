		" You push the button to start the game much later than is necessary. You already lose roughly 5 seconds at the start because of this alone.

		" You miss shots everywhere, which generally just looks very sloppy. Additionally, you clearly try to reach an energy pod in the first stage but fail to reach it because you're too late - this looks incredibly sloppy. You have rerecords to go back and fix these sort of mistakes - this is what you have to use them for.

	[li 
		" Spikestuff's comparison run also shows that you go to the next stage by raising your score by destroying enemy ships. You miss many ships, which means you lose a lot of time and enter the next stages much later. Look at Spikestuff's run and how he clinically nails almost every ship he comes across.
