[div class=p 
	"While the SNES release continues to World A-1 upon completion of 9-4 and makes enemies in the letter worlds similar to the second quest of SMB1, the re-release patches out the "Devil's Spell" exploit by making the bottom two files of the upside-down pipe not enter-able, making some levels like 5-2, 8-1 and C-1, longer than the FDS release. It also handles the timer countdown differently, as it waits for Mario to enter the castle, rather than for Mario to touch a standard block while the star flag object is loaded in memory like the original FDS release. This means if you attempted to perform a "Full Flagpole Glitch" (FFPG) in a level such as 9-1 on the SNES release, you would either softlock the game, such as seen in this clip from

		"5-2:
	]b
	" The first of three wrong-warps, normally you are meant to enter the sideways pipe and wait for the small cutscene of Mario entering the pipe, but using the "Devil's Spell" exploit on the upside-down pipe right near the end of the level allows for you to skip said cutscene.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"6-1:
	]b
	" One of two FFPG's which rely on the wind to push Mario into the ground, normally the wind would de-load at a certain position but by clipping into the ground before the final staircase and gaining at least an extra 102 pixels from standing in the ground, you are able to use the wind at the staircase to clip into the ground at for the FFPG.

[div class=p

[div class=p

		"6-4:

[div class=p 
	[b 
		"7-1:

]div
[div class=p

		"8-1:
	]b
	" This wrong-warp works because the memory address which stores the destination area number (0x750) is cleared, the destination page number (0x751) is not cleared between World 7-2 and World 8-1, allowing for a decent chunk of the level to be skipped.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"8-4:

	" Because of a podoboo pattern which was unable to be dodged without slowing down to manipulate the pattern, 7 frames were wasted in the first room of 8-4, resulting in this level having 0 frames to spare.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	[b 
		"9-4:
	]b
	" Normally upon completion of this level the game loops back to 9-1, the only way to return to the title screen is either by resetting or by losing a life. We opted to soft-reset the frame memory address 0x75C (Level Number) is set to 0 (because it is the most reasonable means of considered the level cleared) rather than take the game over as taking damage and waiting on the "You are a super player" screen as taking damage, dying and waiting on that screen is 24 seconds longer than soft-resetting, it also results in enemy different patterns due to the frame counter and framerules being offset.

Throughout the entire run, I saw all that I need...where known tricks and glitches were performed. This kept it neck and neck, all the way up to 9-1...where changes start to show dramatically.
