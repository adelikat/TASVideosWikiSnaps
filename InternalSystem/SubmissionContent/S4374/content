[p 
	"I am only submitting this because lots of people keep asking me to do so. While the run is unique over other categories in glitches and such used, others argued in the previous pacifist submission that it doesn't add enough over other categories for this game, or that pacifist is a dull category for this game. I'm not going to make such a judgment call for myself, but I understand if the general reaction is still the same as last time.

	"This run beats the game with 0 experience and the only kill being the final boss, so it could also accurately be labeled low level.
	$LF

[p 
	"Worth noting is that a glitch can be used to kill some enemies without getting a kill or experience added; routing was done to avoid this as much as possible. I still believe that this is the fastest route regardless of if that restriction is followed - but making this as much of an "actual" no kill run as possible was a high priority for me.

I thought it wasn't worth making a real submission for at first but a number of people believe otherwise apparently, so I don't see the harm in at least trying, I guess.
