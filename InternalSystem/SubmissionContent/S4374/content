While the run is unique over other categories in glitches and such used, others argued in the previous pacifist submission that it doesn't add enough over other categories for this game, or that pacifist is a dull category for this game. I'm not going to make such a judgment call for myself, but I understand if the general reaction is still the same as last time.

I still believe that this is the fastest route regardless of if that restriction is followed - but making this as much of an "actual" no kill run as possible was a high priority for me.
