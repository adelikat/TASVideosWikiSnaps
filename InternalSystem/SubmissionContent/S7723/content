	"In "Bugs Bunny: Lost in Time" (100% category), Bugs Bunny didnt take the right turn to Albuquerque, and accidentally activates a time machine right after, resulting in him getting stuck in the space-time continuum. Luckily for him Merlin of Monroe is in Nowhere to help him out understand what he needs to do to get back to the present day. The goal of the category is collecting each Clock and Golden Carrot scattered in each era and its levels.
	$LF
	"What differentiates the 100% category from the Any% one, is the complete collection of 124 clocks and 333 golden carrots (whereas any% just requires 120 clocks to escape back to the present day, not reaching 100% completion in the game statistics and not having the credits screen take place in Pismo Beach).

	"In order to take the best trajectories, this TAS makes use (at times) of the script Noxxa and Warepire developed for autowalking. Since this project started in 2020, it was re-adjusted a couple of times in order to make it work with nymashock from Noxxa (Thanks for making PSX tasing desync free, CPP, i mean it), and i've replaced some hacks/workarounds which were making use of static addresses to triangulate the waypoint, now using pointer offsets of the actual addresses the code was originally intended to make use of (Thanks to Lapogne36 who in 2021 has taught me how to find those in PSX games). 
	$LF
	"This helped alleviate some inaccuracies in trajectories (not always) since the game makes use of passive camera, and would often drift off the optimal trajectory using the autowalk script; therefore each movement had to be manually adjusted.
	$LF
	"I also wrote a couple of scripts in order to make the whole process more straightforward, one to keep track on the emulator screen the current game collectables, and the other to input the "roll" action in TAStudio whenever it was allowed by the game, which worked great with the autowalk script, as the latter would just erase all other inputs in recording mode, and the trajectories would change and be not optimal if i were to re-add the input for the in-game rolling action in tastudio input roll afterwards. It also allowed me to avoid using the autofire feature in tastudio, which more than often has lead me to stumble some weird bugs going on in bizhawk.

	$LF
	"It was a wonderful journey, and i consider it to be the absolute best part of it all; coming up with the jumps and skips displayed in the final product. 
	$LF
	"I would have NEVER imagined the platform zips and the infamous wall/door clipping in "What's Cooking, Doc?" and "Follow The Red Pirate Road" to even be remotely possible back when i started looking into this game.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"There are a number of zips that sometimes exploit bugs with camera flips, which are way more common (and annoying!) on the PC version than its PSX counterpart. 
	$LF
	"One of these is the platform zip taking place in the pirate era. Some other zips don't necessarily abuse camera flips, like the tree log in the "Nowhere" tutorial stage, which is achieved by forcing Bugs to move at a very specific angle towards an unmovable object, thanks to a small box carefully placed in the right position. 
	$LF
	"All of this makes some trivial minigames even faster.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The wall/door clipping is a result of extremely precise use of the in-game objects (weights, small boxes, pearls) given to the player in different levels, by either positioning or throwing of such objects, allowing Bugs to move to the nearest XY coordinates allowed for movement, which for a few frames happens to be just the other side of these walls, compared to the temporary artificially-obstructed other sides thanks to the objects hitboxes. This exploit allows to skip 3 full levels revisits, resulting in less repetitive routing, and most importantly cutting several minutes off the final time.

[div class=p 
	"Noone of this would have been possible without DHA SPEEDRUNS, the current main runner and WR holder of the 100% category, which closely followed the developing of this project back from 2020, along with Noxxa and Yuuki, who also took some of their time to often review some levels TAS testruns, helping me figuring out when something might not have been optimal and had to be redone. The whole speedrun community of this game, in all honesty, is the best i've ever come across with.
	$LF
	"This TAS was (un)fortunately restarted at least 4 times, initially being developed on Octoshock, therefore overloaded from desyncs, and later on from mistakes in routing and/or findings of small new skips and glitches, which would prove it was better to redo big chunks of the TAS, at the cost of the project taking an even longer time.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"DHA SPEEDRUNS also wrote down the route in a much more easily to grasp way than what i was intending to, having not one, but most of the routes in comparison in a spreadsheet. The 100% category requires the player to also collect all the 5 golden carrots in each hub/era, and each one of these is avaliable to be collected when Bugs is holding 99 normal carrots on each of the respective platforms featured in the 5 eras. This obviously makes the whole routing process VERY intensive, as everything had to be planned from the very first frame till the last one, before any serious TASing could even take place.
	$LF
	"Adding that to the awful amount of RNG in the whole game, and this gets complex real easy, real fast. 
	$LF
	"This eventually lead to redoing big chunks of the TAS Testruns in different ways, a few times forcing to wait a couple frames upon joining level-warps, with the purpose of manipulating RNG the optimally.

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Clock Grab Animation Skip:
	$LF
	"The clock animation skip is mostly used at the end of levels, as Bugs still moves for a few frames (if movement has already started before pausing the game) after manually quitting stages from the pause menu. This removes the need for both the cutscene and eventually the exit-level warp, hence is heavily used whenever it is possible in the TAS.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Cancelled Jump:
	$LF
	"When rolling and walking, whenever the Bugs reaches the edges of platforms, he will automatically attempt to jump. This is slower and in a few instances can lost time;  depending on the amount of movement left to perform, it can be worth to completely stop momentum for 1 frame during a roll with the help of the first person view input, in order to then perform a kick drop to cross platforms faster. 
	$LF
	"This is achieved by rolling first, jumping next (arbitrary amount of frames as long as Bugs is still in the rolling state), followed by a first person camera input the very next frame. This technique has drawbacks in overall speed and is used just in some niche scenarios; it also just cannot be done in some levels (because it's just hardcoded to not be allowed to use first camera in certain sections).

[div class=p 
	"Extra Kick Height:
	$LF
	"It is possible to increase Z Axis height of a kick action while in movement: it's done by pressing the Jump button first, then holding it the very next frame for a maximum of 28 frames. It's a VERY minor optimization to spot visually, and useless in RTA Speedruns, but it surprisingly allowed this TAS to perform a big number of kick-jumps off some platforms to the other, which would not have been possible otherwise.

[div class=p 
	"Hover/Helic Action Spam:
	$LF
	"It allows to increase the distance covered on the XY axis, while falling down from a previous jump. The repeated inputs combination that allows the most amount of distance to be covered is: 3 inputs on, 2 off. Some jumps are exclusive to this exact timing for inputs, like the SeaShell Jump over the bridge near the beginning of the "What's Up, Dock?" stage.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Roll Action:
	$LF
	"Probably the most used in the whole run, is the timed spam of the roll input, as it almost doubles moving speed compared to normal walking.
	$LF
	"It has the drawback of not being able to perform the kick action while doing it, therefore the niche use of the cancelled jump tech (mentioned before) in some scenarios.
	$LF
	"Each platform has to be timed, because there are instances where even an autojump off a platform reached with a previous roll, will still be the fastest outcome overall.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"First Person View: 
	$LF
	"Not really a glitch, but at the cost of all Bugs movement, this action allows to increase the draw distance and render earlier on screen some Golden Carrots (these have to be on screen for several frames before they can be collected) or to activate some platform cycles earlier than usual, saving several seconds when correctly used.

Later on, the pterodactyl grab allows the TAS to skip a clock animation, and immediately after that, a zip on the wall is performed to not alarm the caveman below and still follow an optimal line, flattening him immediately after in order to collect the Golden Carrot he's holding.

This allows sort of temporary movement in the air, the TAS uses the glitch to perform a double jump without the need to move and use the small box to reach the Acme near the last seashell.

	"By clipping inside the gates in the Bird section of this level, Royal Square (using the same concept previously saw on the magic door in the "Follow The Read Pirate Road" stage), this gate clipping allows to skip a full revisit of the level, making it possible for the TAS to obtain some clocks earlier than intended, and as a snowball effect this then makes the whole route access other levels sooner, skipping revisits and warping less with the time machine from one era to the other.
