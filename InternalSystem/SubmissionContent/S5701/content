	"This TAS does not use the recently discovered Demo% Route. 
	$LF
	"Instead the goal in the taken route is to go through all of Porky's dreams and ultimately defeat Daffy Duck.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Demo% is when you let the game cycle through the demos it shows you after you wait on the start screen, then hold start while the 3rd one loads.
	$LF
	"This allows you to control Porky in the 3rd demo and complete the game.
	$LF

[p 
	"This TAS was originally for personal use. I was using it to see how to improve my own run. 
	$LF
	"Since it contains a few things the only other TAS of this game does not, I decided to submit it.

	"Tricks:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Moonwalk
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Holding Left and Right at the same time forces Porky to walk left while in the animation for walking right.
	$LF
	"This minimal animation reduces lag frames in certain parts of the game.
	$LF
	"It can be made more visually interesting by alternating Left + Right with just Left, every other frame.
	$LF
	"This causes Porky to spin, or something like it.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Slope Jumping
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Porky keeps 4 units of speed when jumping off a slope for a few frames if you don't hold a direction.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The Camera Trick
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"You can move the camera while Porky is stationary. 
	$LF
	"This allows you to load in sprites a bit earlier and get them to more beneficial positions.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Sprite Glitch
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If you alternate left and right ever other frame bosses will not advance to the next sprite they would use. They do advance as soon as you stop alternating left and right.
	$LF
	"This leads to either complete garbage being on the screen (see 2nd boss), or is used to save a few frames by forcing the boss to not be animated.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Zip/Enter Ceiling
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The old TAS enters ceilings by holding the X button while on an ascending platform. 
	$LF
	"This has been improved by holding down + x, then releasing x while in the ceiling.
	$LF
	"This zips Porky backwards. It saves many seconds over that old TAS.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Improvements over old TAS:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Frames saved thanks to Sprite Glitch on 4th boss.
	$LF
	"Added early hit on Tweety before he falls at the start of the fight.
	$LF
	"Zip added in Atlantis.
	$LF
	"Improved weather manipulation. (Some weather takes longer to load than others)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Input ends before final hit on last boss.
	$LF
