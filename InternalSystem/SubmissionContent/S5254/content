There can only be 1 thrown berry/acorn on the screen and up to 5 partial berries/acorns from when they explode after hitting the enemy. You play as Bullwinkle for the first 5 levels and then Rocky in the final 2 levels. If you do a full jump while moving at top speed, then you save 4 frames every time as compared to just walking forward. You save fewer frames the slower you're going when you jump or the smaller the jump is. You have to wait for 12 frames after Bullwinkle lands in order to get back to optimal jumping speed, but Rocky only needs 2 frames to get back to top speed. If you are standing still or on top of a moving object when jumping, then you will be unable to move (or turn) left or right for 6 frames.

If you slow down before going off the edge, then you won't pop up as high so that you can jump out sooner. If you jump out too soon, then you will be falling for too long and the game will cause you to lose a life. Normally when you get into a cart it takes a while for it to get up to speed, but if you apply the brakes for one frame it quickly gets back up to top speed.

	"Each alien boss takes 5 berries to destroy. If you get hit, then you can get far enough into their hitbox so that the berries in your hand will be destroyed while you still have invincibility frames. This trick lets you throw berries nearly every other frame and is used in the final level. Since you never complete the throwing animation the game doesn't register that you've used a berry.

	"I hate this level with the fiery passion of a thousand burning suns. Some obstacles are on a global timer; some obstacles are on a local timer from when you begin the level; some obstacles are only triggered when you approach them; some obstacles fail to load; the rats are partially RNG-based; and finally this level is excessively long which makes route planning truly difficult. I'm pretty content with how it turned out, though. When entering the boss area, if you jump into the ceiling right away, the camera will fail to become fixed for the boss sequence. The boss will still appear, but you can walk right past him and to the door without even needing to collect the stolen treasure.

	"Fairly straightforward level. I die so that I can get full health in the next area. In the boss area you see that Bullwinkle is locked in a haltingly descending cage. You have to hit the lock 5 times on the right side in order to break it open and free him. Unfortunately, the programmers did not prepare for the possibility of this being done before the cage reached the lower area. As soon as you break open the lock the camera stops all vertical movement and the Derby hat descends into the middle of the wall where you can't reach it, so you have to wait until the camera gets low enough before breaking the lock so that the hat descends to a point where you can reach it.

	"The camera position dictates the timing of a substantial number of things throughout the game. It might be possible to have better camera manipulation for certain parts of the game. In the minecart level, during the first time I switch to a different cart, it turns out I didn't pull the brake for a frame before jumping. This would save about 30 frames, but all that time and more gets lost when trying to re-do the ghost ship level since the timings for everything changes. There is probably a better path through stage 6. There are flowers all over to heal yourself, so you can probably find a way to not slow down to avoid damage and just heal yourself later.
