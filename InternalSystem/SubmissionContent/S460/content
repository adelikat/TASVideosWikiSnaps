	"Desyncing was not as bad this time around. I know it happened more in later levels such as the Complex of the Savage Land and the later Alien Lab levels.

	"I use Nightcrawler more because he is faster (and has a lot of neat little moves aside from teleportation to exploit). Wolverine is used primarily in places for Boss battles and on the last level because he is insanely strong by comparison.

[p 
	"the movie is faster aside from that because some boss battles are insanely shorter. i cant explain a deal of it, but im sure someone can draw conclusions as well.

	"and me taking damage on the APOCALYPSE battle (for anyone who missed it): I TAKE DAMAGE TO SAVE TIME. otherwise, those bombs circle three times and i think it would look boring to watch me chase them and avoid them. aside from it adding more than a minute of unnecessary crap. i do try and make it look like im trying to "hurt" them in place of it however.
