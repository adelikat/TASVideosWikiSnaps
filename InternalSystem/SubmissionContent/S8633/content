	"The gameplay of NT is fairly self explanatory. You spawn in a randomly generated stage, upon killing all the enemies a portal appears which takes you to the next stage. There's 4 main areas consisting of 3 stages each, and 3 in-between areas which are 1 stage long. The final stage of each main areas features a boss fight. Each stage features a weapon chest, ammo chest and a rad canister, in addition to that enemies can randomly drop weapons, ammo or health packs. Rads are the game's experience points, you collect them from dead enemies or the aforementioned canisters. Each level up grants a choice of 1 of 4 mutations, which are perks that help in the run.
