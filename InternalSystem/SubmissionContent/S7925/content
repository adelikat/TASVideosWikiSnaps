	"Mickey's Safari in Letterland is an educational platformer released in March 1993 by Hi Tech Expressions. The clumsy Mickey Mouse has lost 6 letter moulds on his paid safari drive. He now must go back into the safari without permission, find the moulds and return them to Mickey's Magnificent Mould Museum. He has 4 minutes to return to his jeep before he gets arre- Okay, I must admit, the real story's probably a bit less dramatic then that. Anyways, here's some comments about the TAS.
