	"This is my first ever try on a Time Attack, I chose Castle of Illusion for 2 reasons
	":
	" first, I found it pretty simple for a start-up, simple physics, not many complex points and so on; second, it was my first Genesis game I played, so I found it really nostalgic to begin with.

	"Nothing to say to much in here, it's a full walktrough of all levels, from the start till the last knock at Mizrabel's head. No warps / glitches (don't know any), no hits (my first goal was pure speed run, but after the first level I changed my mind and added this restriction), every each move is only the essential to flow the game with no time loses (I think I did a good job at this quesit). I forgot to choose Hard difficult, but I think there's little difference. I tried my best, I'm sure it can be improved, don't know if someone will be addicted to try, since there's a lot of more interesting game choices around. Well, have fun!
