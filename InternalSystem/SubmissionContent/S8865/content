[div class=p

	$LF
	"In the T. Rex encounter, for example, when the T. Rex would appear and when the door would open extactly could be influenced by changing around the inputs, when to menu, when to move the cursor, etc. But in the case of the dinosaur you shoot right after opening the locker, at around frame 36319, the pattern of that dino depends on the frame you enter that location.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"In any case, in some cases I had to delay a bit, or not push for more, for RNG reasons, for example, after the T.Rex encounter, it's very important to not get attacked while the sewers gate is opening, since it will close. I also had to delay after the locker to get the right dinosaur pattern on the next location, waiting for 4 or 8 frames less could also give you the correct pattern, but that messes up the RNG on the velociraptor area, which is important since the AFK strategy is the only reason no more tranq ammo is picked up in the visitor's center, and it also saves time from menuing.
	$LF
	"There is one RNG element I didn't get perfect, the locker code, since there's other codes from the table which should be slightly faster to input, I tried influencing the code by delaying on a few sections, or changing around the input, but it didn't change, so it's probably set by when you start the game.
