	"In Kirby Super Star, there's a glitch freezing the game, this happens when the Wheelie helper is ditched at the same time you get on it. That's because you are not actually controlling Kirby, you're controlling the Wheelie helper. The Wheelie Rider is actually an ability! Therefore there's seem to be a glitch where Kirby is unable to be controlled forever. That's due to the helper not existing and the game code corrupted. Unfortunately, it only softlocks Kirby, and the enemies still move, and you're able to pause the game. If done in Revenge of Meta Knight, you're able to continue by waiting until the timer runs out. If done in other subgames, you'll have to reset your SNES.
