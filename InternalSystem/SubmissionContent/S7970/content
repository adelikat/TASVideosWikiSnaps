	" I made 2 years ago, where I said in the discussion thread that "I would've picked the harder difficulty if the computer wasn't so damn slow!" In that thread, I mention a test game where I played on Skill Level 6 and made every move recommended by Stockfish 12 at 35 depth to see how long a "perfect" game would be. During the game, the Intellivision AI thought for a total 7 hours, 12 minutes, and 54 grueling seconds. Since Bizhawk tops out at ~600% speed unthrottled on my laptop, this game still took about 1 hour, 10 minutes to play in full, so putting in the effort to craft a faster game through trial and error would be an

	"The goal is not necessarily to checkmate in the least number of moves but to deliver the checkmate that makes the computer "think" the least. Shorter "thinking" times are achieved by keeping the position simple. Giving the computer few reasonable options and not attacking with a lot of pieces simultaneously is a good way to minimize thinking times. But the BEST way to reduce think times appears to be trading or just straight up blundering pieces. If the computer sees a piece where capturing will grant a material advantage, it'll take without much thought. This is evidenced in the game summary where the shortest think times besides those in the opening and before imminent checkmate are ones where Black captures pieces. Evidently, the Intellivision is a very materially-focused chess engine with not as much focus on tempo or positional outcomes, and are flaws which can be exploited.

It also coaxes black to play h6... but not yet. Black ignores this for now and goes for an admittedly nice tactic with Bxf2+.

	"15-20. Because of black's last rook move, the King is now able to escape checkmate... unless we trick it by somehow getting the king to move towards the corner. When I move the Queen to h6 on move 16, for some ungodly reason the king moves to g8 instead of e7, instantly losing the game! I guess black didn't want to blunder the g5 pawn by moving to e7, but dude... would you rather blunder a pawn or your king? Lol. The trickery and checkmate process takes a bit of piece shuffling—a total of six moves—but black has limited move options and therefore quick think times, so it is absolutely worth it. And finally, on move 20, the black king has fallen. And so too has my sanity.

	"In addition to all the focus on think time minimization, there are also some speed strats going on with how we move pieces. A piece or square can be selected even if the cursor is on an infinitesimal portion of the square's right or bottom edge, or the bottom-right corner. This allows us to set all our pieces down quite early, and gives an advantage to picking up pieces if they're moving down or to the right.

	"The year is 1982. Chess engines are in their infancy. There is no Stockfish, AlphaZero, or Deep Blue. If you want to play chess against a computer in the comfort of your own home, one of your options is USCF Chess for the Intellivision. With only 2147 bytes of RAM, prepare to wait hours or even DAYS for the computer to make a move on the highest skill level. And even then, the move the computer decides on could be a bit questionable.

	" This particular chess submission, was the one that I really wanted to dig into and find improvements....but I couldn't. These older 8-bit machines were venturing into the beginnings of chess AI, where code was small, memory was limited, and they didn't have complicated calculations as modern games do. So...the fastest way to beat this game, is to know the CPU's weakness and exploit it. This TAS does exactly that. I have personally experienced the weakness of early computer programs and consoles, thus recognizing it with this movie. With as slow as this game ran, I applaud you for sticking with it.
