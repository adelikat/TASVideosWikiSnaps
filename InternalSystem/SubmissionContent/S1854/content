	"Released as part of the mostly Game Boy Mickey Mouse series, Mickey Mouse III: Dream Balloon was released in September 1992 by Kemco in Japan for the Famicom. Due to copyright issues it was changed into Kid Clown in Night Mayor World for its US NES 1993 release. It was released in the final days of the NES and it is a short but good platform game.

	"In this run I don't avoid bonus levels by collecting strawberries. This change allowed me to make a much more entertaining movie than the previous one, because I jump a lot less than Dark Fulgore, and jumping is what makes Mickey go really slow for a few seconds. Those frequent speed changes were very annoying in the previous movie, so I decided to lose a few seconds by going into bonus levels, in exchange for better platform stages.

	"Dark Fulgore for his great first movie. Most of my routes were borrowed from his run, and most of the time it was really hard to even achieve his same times, so it had me really challenged and that was a big motivation for me.
