	" is a Neo Geo Pocket Color port/compilation of the two Mega Man arcade games, Mega Man: The Power Battle and Mega Man: The Power Fighters. It was developed and published by Capcom and released in 2000 in Japan. While video and audio are brought down significantly to go down from the CPS arcade systems to the dinky Neo Geo Pocket handheld, the gameplay is largely converted pretty faithfully, and the character sprites even in their 8-bit-esque glory retain pretty fluid animation.

	"As in the arcade games, there are no stages in this game - Mega Man (and Proto Man, and Bass) decided those are a waste of time, so they'll just face the Robot Masters directly instead. Each episode contains 6 Robot Masters, a penultimate boss stage, and a final boss stage where the player faces off against Dr. Wily as usual. Both games have three episodes each - this TAS plays through all three episodes of the first game, Mega Man: The Power Battle.

	[li 
		" Number of buster shots allowed on screen (2 for Proto Man, 3 for Mega Man and Bass)
		$LF
	]li

		$LF
	]li
]ul
[div class=p 
	"Since all special weapon properties are the same, and the dash functionality is not very important, the character choices are based primarily on their buster properties. Normally, Proto Man's fast shot speed would help him out, but it turns out to be largely insignificant because it actually just makes double-hitting harder to pull off, and triple-hitting is impossible outright because he can only have two shots on screen. Because of this, Proto Man is not used.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Mega Man and Bass are very similar to each other, besides the slide vs. air dash, but still their different buster hitbox properties provide different uses. Bass' larger shots make it easier to setup triple hits against enemies that jump or move a lot - on the other hand, Mega Man's smaller shots allow him to follow up faster with an uncharged shot after firing a semi-charged shot, saving time on stationary bosses.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Because of these properties, briefly put, Bass' buster is better against mobile enemies that jump and move around a lot, while Mega Man's buster is better against enemies who stand still more. Because of this, Bass turned out faster in the MM1-2 and MM7 episodes (using the buster against Cut Man and Slash Man respectively), while Mega Man turned out faster in the MM3-6 episode (using the buster against Dust Man). After the initial buster fights, their differences become pretty much irrelevant.

[div class=p 
	"In this game, when a boss is hit by multiple projectiles or hitboxes on the same frame, he takes damage from all of them before triggering mercy invincibility (which is 10 frames for most bosses, or significantly more if they're stunned). This is important for saving hits and in general just increasing damage output.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"How many hits it is possible to do at once depends on the weapon the player is using. Mega Man's and Bass' busters allow up to 3 projectiles at once, so if all of them hit an enemy on the same frame they can do 3 damage (or 6 if one of the shots was partially charged). Then for example with a weapon like Cut Man's, you can have 3 projectiles that can do 3 damage each for 9 damage at once, which becomes 18 damage at once if they're weak to the weapon.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p

	" Dust Crusher quadruple hit
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"A trick exclusive to Dust Man's Dust Crusher in MM3-6 is being able to perform a quadruple hit. This is done by hitting an enemy with the Dust Crusher while they're invulnerable, 2-3 frames before their invulnerability ends. What happens is that the main Dust Crusher shot will hit them while invincible, the Dust Crusher will explode into 4 pieces of shrapnel, and those 4 pieces then all hit the enemy on the same frame. This does 12 damage in total and allows the Dust Crusher to be readily used again, so it can be performed repeatedly in quick succession if the positioning is right. This technique is strong enough that for quite a few bosses it's faster to beat them with this rather than with their weakness weapon, and bosses that are weak to Dust Crusher are annihilated even quicker.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"A sort of similar trick can be done with Cloud Man's Thunder Strike in MM7 - by hitting the enemy 3-4 frames before invulnerability ends with a Thunder Strike, the two side spheres may hit the boss instead for 12 damage in total. However, the spheres won't disappear, and it generally takes a long time before they disappear and hence allow the player to change weapons or fire again, so it's much less effective. It is used a few times, but only to finish off boss battles.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"It should be noted in both these cases that because of the requirement to hit an invulnerable enemy for optimal damage, sometimes different weapons have to be used just to fulfill the invulnerability requirement. The Mega Buster can't do this because it's not possible to change weapons fast enough, but some special weapons work better for this purpose, like Gyro Attack in MM3-6 or Slash Claw in MM7.

In theory, it sounds like a Dust Crusher variant for this episode, but in practice, it's gimped by the fact that even if they hit, the followup spheres never disappear, and you cannot fire another shot or change weapons until the spheres have scrolled off screen. In the end, this makes it a decent finisher for bosses weak to it (Junk Man, Dr. Wily's Halloween Pumpkin) or other situational circumstances (Wily Machine phase 2, where Slash Claw ammo has run out), but that aside its uses are limited.

I use Gyro Attack for the airborne main Yellow Devil phases (where Dust Crusher quad-hits cannot be consistently set up fast enough), and Dust Crusher for the primarily grounded mini-devils.

The main issue is that I'm required to take damage to get deep enough into the Wily Machine to do repeated hits. However, once all of that is arranged, it goes down very quickly. The next phase and Wily Capsule go down without the need for that, but very quickly nonetheless.

To conserve ammo I first do a few hits with Burning Wheel (it was that or Crash Noise, but Burning Wheel happens to sit right between starting position and Slash Claw in the menu), then Slash Claw to finish the rest of phase 1 off. Phase 2 eats another 4 Slash Claw hits before ammo runs out, leaving it with 16 HP - enough to finish it off with two Thunder Strikes. Then, Wily Capsule is defeated with four charged Crash Noise hits.

	" seems to be a decent game, and even though the simplistic nature of the sprites is a bit disappointing after the Arcade originals, it still provides some classical gameplay that is interesting to plan out and watch. Not a lot of feedback, but it was positive, and the nature of the game earns it a Moon. Accepting.
