	"The main objective of the run is to collect the required ability items and get back to the Lab in order to access the final two levels of the game. However, one of the ability items, the Dynamo, which is required to open the door to the Lab (and is also used against the final boss), requires 2000 Gems in order to be obtained. As a result, gems are collected throughout the run. The gem route mainly collects Purple, Yellow and Cyan gems (worth 5, 10 and 25 respectively), with reds and greens being collected less frequently.
