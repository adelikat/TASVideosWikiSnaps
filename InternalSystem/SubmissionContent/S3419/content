	"Inside the gun shop there are several bullets that you can buy for 1 coin each. If you have one of these bullets in your inventory, you can click on leave on any of these bullets and leave it in the same place as it is in. This might seem like it has no effect - you just pick up it and put it down again - but when you put it down, the game calls the "remove item from inventory" subroutine. The game gets confused since you're leaving an item you don't actually have (although you have a bullet it's not that exact bullet) so what happens is that the game removes an item anyway. The item that is removed is the first item on the inventory list above the one you're on. The order of the item pages is this:

	"Two noticable things has happened. Note2 has been placed on the addresses page, and key1 has been moved to the container page. As soon as you opened a new container, this page will refresh, so basically key1 is lost. More importantly, Note2 is now on the address page. This brings us to the next part of the bug - any "unknown" value on the address list is treated as Auburn road when you tell the cabby to go there. This means that any other item would work too. By having note2 in the address list, I basically have the Auburn road address, without having to rescue miss Sternwood from the car trunk (lucky for me who needs to save time, unlucky for her).
