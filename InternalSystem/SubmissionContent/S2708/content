	": This is a copy of the currently published TAS minus the input frames at the end which make the field scroll up manually to get the fastest game time. This movie does not beat the currently published TAS because the game time is higher. It's also not allowed at TASVideos to submit someone elses work while pretending it is your own, this can result in a ban.
