	"Most of the improvement came from keeping the blocks as high as possible before each tetris, often high enough that no more can fit ... which was also harder to do, because I had to manipulate luck a lot more for this, as shown by the heavily boosted amount of straight bars. Since I also found a way to manipulate luck by holding Down in certain ways, that minimized the pausing needed.

	"You might notice that I hit 999998 from the last tetris, then get the last point while getting Game Over ... this wasn't purely by coincidence. I actually ended up with 999891 and had to go back and hex edit more Down button presses in to gain the missing points, and then thought about doing just enough for this interesting effect.
