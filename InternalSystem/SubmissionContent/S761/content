	"At least half the credit for this movie should go to Walker Boh. Although I made made this movie on my own, the time shaved off in this movie was mostly due to improved menu manipulation. Walker Boh was the one who spent many, many hours planning out the route and most of the cursor movements, this run just improved his a little.
	$LF
	"It just happened that I was able to improve this movie by around 32 seconds by having more powerful tools at my disposal (and due to some changes in the cursor-route). Other that that, this movie plays practically the same route and I pick up almost the same items.
	$LF
	"Was it wrong of me to make this run? It probably was. Anyway, what's done is done, I was somewhat ignorant and didn't think about all the hard work that Walker Boh put into making his movie when I made mine. If Walker Boh had the same tools (in particular frame advance) that I had when making his movie I think that it would be at least as good as this.
