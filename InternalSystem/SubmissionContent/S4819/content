	"Overall, this version is an improvement of 4363 frames (72.72 seconds). I saved 66.43 seconds on stage 3-4 with a different route and a door glitch that allows the player to bypass the boss. Alyosha made a few extra zips in stages 1-3 and 2-4 to save another 6 seconds. We examined the strength upgrade options and determined that it is still optimal to get two strength upgrades.

	"After the player does the door glitch, the game thinks that Pit is entering from the left side of the door instead of the right. Thus, it sends him to the next room to the right. I believe that if going right would take Pit out of the map boundary, then the game ejects Pit to the end of the stage. On stage 3-4, it activates the three treasures cutscene instead of going to the score hall. I tested the glitch on stage 1-4, but it doesn't work. Pit gets stuck in the score hall forever.

	": Hi, Arc and Alyosha.  Impressive finds on the new zips (especially 3-4!), which added additional entertainment value to this run.  It's also good to know that you both went back through to check whether foregoing the upgrades saved additional time (which, unfortunately, they didn't).  All in all, outstanding teamwork on implementing these new optimizations!
