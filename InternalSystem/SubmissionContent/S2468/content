	"Speedrun description: The hardest part in this run was to make a failure free run through the first level as well as making the enemies disappear. One other hard part was to jump through the Terminator at a good time. The fastest time I've seen of a speedrun of this game was made in 5.57 so I figured I would try to make a faster run. This run is 25 seconds faster! I have done previous speed runs, but this one is by far faster, my last speedrun were just a few milliseconds faster than the speedrun in 5:57.
