	"It is 20 seconds improvment than my last speedrun,main in way.Double Dragon III is not continuous.There is one empty frame between two frames.It means you play one frame then stop one frame.So it adds more change.I think “Double Dragon III” is the game which has the biggest randomness.I improve datails,especially in BOSS, In the stage4,and I take advantage of two Bug on the floor.In the stage5-2,I go to die on purpose.
