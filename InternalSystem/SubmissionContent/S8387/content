	"This level has several frame perfect tricks in order to play optimally. The only slowdowns are the three staircases, two of which slow us down by one or two frames, and the other by about 10 due to a platform right after the staircase. Another thing to note here is that we reach the end checkpoint the frame before we would've lost a life.

	"By far the hardest level in the game. There's some extreme precision here with jumping and shooting. In total, we have to wait nine times for a total of 29 frames. In fact, this level was so precise it actually caused a desync around the middle during playback, but thankfully I could fix that in about a minute or so. Input ends when we reach the end checkpoint - once again, the frame before we would've lost a life - on frame 13480.
