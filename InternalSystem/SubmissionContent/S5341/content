	"The route can be better than the used here, but thanks to magic locators, this would be the best way to complete the game in 100%, as each goonie has it's locator, and this last disappear if the goonie that it is related to is rescued, and so the game forces to collect magic locators first then save the goonies.

	"The use of glasses doesn't mean that I can skip them because they are part of the full completion. Speaking of full completion, this run clears the game with more than 100% since there is a new hidden Konamiman in the Volcano, but this KM warps directly to the original one, as a result, now there is 2 Konamimen in Volcano, 6 Konamimen overall.
