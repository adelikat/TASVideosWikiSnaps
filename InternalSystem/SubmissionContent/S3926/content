	"Finding Nemo is a common platformer game based on the movie of same name, released in 2003(wow, that's already 10 years ago). The movie features a clownfish named Marlin, who lost his wife and thus being too over-protective on his only son, Nemo. Feeling awkward by his dad's excessive nagging, Nemo decides to deviate from his dad, but captured by a diver merely after 30 seconds. Marlin, along with Dory who has short-term memory, embarks on a adventure to search for his son.
