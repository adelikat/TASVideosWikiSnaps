	"My english is bad. Decap Attack is a great platform game only for Genesis.  It's similar to Magical Hat no Buttobi (Genesis, Japan), Psycho Fox (SMS) and Kid Kool (NES).The hero of this game is a mummy named Chuck, who has two heads: one is in the stomach.

	"The skull-head of Chuck is great for attack distant enemies and to create endless funny possibilities. Glide in frame by frame is almost a fligt.
