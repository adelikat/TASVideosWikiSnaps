	", I use my route owing to Fortranm's run was not faster than mine. Only less improvement in the open air which almost did by long jump. Most of it made in mansions. In the first masion, I killed less enemies because holy water glitch let me to collect more hearts before. Second masion, optimized warp and use continuous floor sinking. Third mansion, continuous floor sinking again. Fourth mansion, no improvement. Fifth mansion, I use another way to break fake wall that reduce some lag. Last castle, the hero continuously through 4 floors!
