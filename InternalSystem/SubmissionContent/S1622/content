	"Anyway, I'm not satisfied with xipo's run. Cheap tricks aside, it improves only 35-40 frames of my old work.

[div class=p 
	"So I revised my old TAS and found several new tricks.

[div class=p 
	"The most interesting fact is that this game doesn't reset most of semi-important timers, so by finishing previous boss bettle sooner or later you can influence how fast Robot power will achieve necessary point on next boss battle. This forced me to plan route precisely, thus current level order isn't random.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"This planning helped mostly in final battle. Also I managed to create situation when finishing boss battle with eagle strike doesn't affect final result (with eagle strike you lose 9 frames but in final battle weapon power rises 9 frames faster).

	"Watching Memory helped to polish everything up. Unlike obvious lag in last area, there was couple of hard-to-notice lag frames in previous levels.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"I noticed that sometimes it's useful to switch the order of increasing X coordinate. Let's say, when it increases like this - 1-2-1-2-1-2... - you may bump into enemy at 5th frame, but when it increases like 2-1-2-1-2-1, you'll miss it.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Of course I also had to use cheap ways (taking damage and choosing red ranger). If I wasn't, final time could be something like 9:27.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"So I played whole run with red ranger, because even at the last level you can run quickly without shooting anything. Although you lose at least 7 frames with red ranger, you still save 17 frames in menu screen.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"In terms of in-game timer it's ineffective (time consumed in menus wouldn't be taken into account), but acording to Adelikat's individual decision the game TAS should aim on FCEU timer. Well, I'm not arguing, although it seems the run degraded into 1-character playthrough.
