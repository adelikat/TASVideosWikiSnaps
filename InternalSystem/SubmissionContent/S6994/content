		" Talking to the Priest again after his long dialogue sets the trigger for fighting Agahnim, which should normally only be accessible after collecting the three pendants. Amusingly if the player fights Agahnim straight away they'll get forced into the dark world as bunny and be softlocked, this actually happened to me on my first playthrough.

		" Superspeed part 1: due to the mechanics of dungeons/overworlds, dashing into a dungeon, saving and resetting the console will have Link going dash speed when he exits the dungeon.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Superspeed part 2: if Link starts this dash from a slow tile, he will go double dash speed when he exits the dungeon.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Superspeed part 3: If Link walks onto a slow tile, then walks sideways, then onto a tile that would be normal speed, his speed will double again. This stacks but unfortunately is not useful beyond one use due to game mechanics.

	[li 
		" HP underflow: On the overworld, if your HP would drop below one, you die. In dungeons, it is if your HP would drop below zero. If you get to zero in a dungeon, then exit and take a hit of damage, you will underflow your HP to 255, note Link's normal max HP is 48.

		" Infinite keys: At the beginning of Tower of Hera, a key can be found between switchable blocks. This key is somehow made from miraculous stuff as you can pick up an extra one every frame you hold A. We do this for 40 odd frames to charge our dash and give us more than double the amount of keys we'll need for the run.

	"Acmlm made a TAS of this game way back when we didn't know most of these tricks or even how to get the sword upgrade from the blacksmith! Acmlm has done so much routing for this game over the years that has really helped get this game to where it is today. Thanks JF.
	$LF
	"We reenact Acmlm's boss fight strategy for the Armos Knights from his old TAS and the beginning of the Arrghus fight. He also provided a useful suggestion he had been thinking to collect the fourth sword upgrade after Agahnim, this hugely changed the routing for the better and greatly reduced backtracking.

	"Initially in the development of this run, I got a lot of assistance from ThunderAxe31 showing me small things I wasn't noticing while TASing, tightening up my movements and sending movies back to me. I think that his assistance was a big help and originally offered him joint authorship which he declined to give me all the credit. ThunderAxe31 found out how the RNG worked in the game, these savings cannot be understated, almost every screen I manipulate enemies to give me a better pattern, thanks a bunch friend.

	"Runs like these end up being some of my favorites on the site, innocuous games that come out of nowhere and defy your expectations with unexpected major glitches, and naturally this run is no exception. It's quite fast! It's incredibly fast! Even in the early part of the game before the dash glitch is activated, it still keeps a good overall pace, but naturally the dash glitches blow the whole thing wide open. Watching the commentated run proves that a lot of work and planning went into making this as fast as possible, even down to some hilariously unexpected things like manipulating the least laggy music tracks to play at any given time, lending further comedy to a run that was already making me laugh out loud quite a bit.

	"I do feel the need to re-address the Moldorm fight here just for an official, public statement on it: The game crashes on console whenever Moldorm is hit by anything other than a dash attack, however this behavior is not replicated on any emulator. In any situation like this, where the game behaves differently between console and emulator, it is always preferred to use the console behavior for submissions, assuming that both behaviors are known prior to submission and the choice can actually be made. The idea here is that, while something like console verification is not and will never be required for publication, runs should still be aiming for console accuracy at all times in order to prove that games are being beaten legitimately under the same constraints that a console runner would be held to. This is a founding principle of the site: It's about complete mastery of the game itself and not the emulation environment it's running in. The console behavior was used for this TAS, so... Hooray! Rule following!
