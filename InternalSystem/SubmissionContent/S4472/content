[p 
	"The game itself initially places you into the role of Elwin (descendant of Garret/Redin from Warsong), a wandering Swordsman who stops at a small village to rest from his journey.  He soon finds himself, however, involved in a sudden conflict between an elite detachment of the Rayguard Empire and a peculiar young woman (Riana) whom they are attempting to abduct.  In desperation, her childhood friend Hein urgently pleads Elwin to help fight off and thwart the Empire's plans.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"While I didn't discover any glitches, I did take advantage of a couple of exploits in this game.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"edit: I did actually use a small bug, which I'll list here at the top:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"PRE-PROMOTION EQUIPMENT CARRYOVER 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"As in most RPGs, different equipment is restricted to different classes.  Heavy Plate Armor, for example, is limited to Fighter and Knight classes, while certain accessories (e.g. Cross) are exclusive to Healers.  
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"You can work around this to an extent due to how Langrisser 2 handles its class changes (Commanders promote up at level 10).  Basically, any equipment you had on a Commander before promotion 
	[b 
		"will remain on him/her
	]b
	" until it is manually swapped off.  A great example you'll see in the game early on is the use of the Speed Boots accessory (+2 Movement Range).  Knight classes cannot legitimately equip this item, due to already having a sizable movement range advantage.  So you can imagine the fun to be had using Speed Boots on a Horseman!
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"TROOP SUPPORT SPELL EXPLOIT
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Stat buff spells work by targeting either a Commander or one of his/her hirelings.  Once cast, every troop under a Commander's control receives the effects of the spell--provided each troop is within the Commander's area-of-effect radius.  The exploit here is, even if you're on the other side of the battle map, you can buff a single out-of-range soldier and still benefit the rest of a Commander's troops while away on the front line.  
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I take advantage of this quite often throughout the run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"PASSIVE AI MANIPULATION
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Compared to the prequel Warsong, enemy A.I. is a 
	[em 
		"bit
	]em
	" more timid this time around.  Meaning, if you and your troop's stats are around equal to or greater than an approaching enemy, that enemy will simply surround your units and end their turn!  This is advantageous in situations where, say, an enemy flier is heading towards a group of A.I. civilians. Here, you would simply move a stronger Commander in front of them to effectively stop that enemy from attacking that round.  
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"OPTIMAL INITIAL TROOP PLACEMENT
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Depending on how many mercenaries are hired (up to 6, max), a Commander's troop formation changes slightly on the battlefield.  For instance, 3 hirelings creates the following formation:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"X1X
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"2C3
	$LF
]p

[p 
	"2C3
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"54X
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"What's desirable about a 6 hireling formation is you can take advantage of the map placement the #5 and #6 spots give you.  It essential gives you a +1 movement advantage where you normally wouldn't with just 1-4 troops.  In terms of rounds, this can be the difference between saving an entire turn on a stage, or even beating it early!

		"About the Branch Name
	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The branch name "all stages" refers to completing all of the 
	[b 
		"accessible
	]b
	" 'Secret Scenarios' in a normal playthrough (?1, ?2, & ?3).  These stages are triggered by the main Commander, Elwin, landing on specific tiles during stages 12, 19, and 22.  I chose this branch in order to showcase more of the game.  Also, the extra EXP and rare equipment offered in these stages' shops makes the run quite faster, as well.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"So much, I believe, that an any% run might not be much faster than this one (probably no more than 3-5 minutes)...
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Here's the technicality: there also exists a 4th Secret Stage within the game's code called "Death Tower".  This stage is similar to a boss rush, where your party faces supped-up versions of the game's main villains in handicapped conditions (only 2 of your Commanders are initially controllable; you must "free" the rest of your allies).  Unfortunately, there appears to be no known way to legitimately access this stage without using a stage select code.  This is most comparable to the SNES game 
	[em 
		"Ogre Battle
	]em
	", where the special stage 'Dragon's Haven' is only accessible via code (naming your main character FIRESEAL).
	$LF

There are two cases, however, where I decided to turn the battle animations ON for the sake of entertainment.  These occur during stages 22 and 27.  I felt they were plot significant enough, and contained a right amount of intriguing foreshadowing, to include.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Estimated, both these speed/entertainment tradeoffs cost about 17 seconds of time.  This is more than reasonable, in my view, for a near 2 hour TAS.

		"However

	", if you ask me, that would be the MOST anti-climatic way the end the game's final battle that I can think of.  Plus, it wouldn't jive with the plot as Elwin has been brought up as the 'chosen one' to take on and take out Bernhardt & Alhazard with Langrisser.  In my humble opinion, the way I choose to input the final battle is

	"Here's my version:  After Hein softens up Bernhardt with a Meteor Spell, Lana teleports Elwin and his troops next to Bernhardt.  From here, his H. Horsemen remove the Dark Guards and soften Bernhardt down to 8 HP (which is the minimum that he can be beaten on his throne, with Elwin).  Once that's finished, I turn the battle animations on again and move Elwin in for the finishing strike.  I was FORTUNATE to get this manipulation as I have not been able to recreate it, under different conditions (even after over 500 attempts).

	"You are placed into the role of Elwin (descendent of Garrett/Redin), a wandering Swordsman who stops to rest from his journey at a small, obscure village.  He soon finds himself, however, in a sudden conflict between an elite detachment of the Rayguard Empire and a peculiar young woman whom they are attempting to abduct.  In desperation, her childhood friend Hein rushes toward Elwin and urgently pleads him to help fight off and thwart the Empire's plans.  So much for rest...
