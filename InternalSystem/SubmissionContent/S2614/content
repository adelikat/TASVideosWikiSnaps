	"The effects of having 0 SHIELD divides all incoming damage by 32 and sets your base attack power to 64. Normally, the maximum SHIELD you should get is 7, which divides incoming damage by 7 and doesn't actually affect your attack power. By the way, with 4 ATTACK, your base attack power is 5, but 0 SHIELD ignores ATTACK and substitutes the number 64. Damage to bosses cap at 5 per hit, so this 64 power hardly matters.

The auto-hold can't guide the Guardian, so all hope rests soley on the sub-weapon doing its job! So the question is, will the sub-weapon defeat the final boss, or will I run out of CHIPS first?

[p 
	"Technically, the input no longer changes after the movie ends. There is an indefinitely held button, but this fact does not ever change when I release control. Did I break a rule doing this?
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Practically, the player does nothing after I release input, other than keeping the dancing orbs going. But other than that, there is no insanely accurate shots or precise movements taking place. Sure, these colorful orbs zip around, but that's the weapon itself. Did I break the spirit of a TAS by not acting in a super-human manner?

[p 
	(__wikiLink|user:FractalFusion)
	": Though a novel concept, it doesn't make a strong case for itself. The choice of autoholding A after the movie is arbitrary and undermines the idea that the input ends after 3 seconds, when, in fact, input really goes on for 5-6 minutes.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"As for the movie itself, it's mostly boring and the "twist ending" is not obvious to a casual viewer (though the score may be a tip-off but you still need to know why). It is not known whether giving it actual input during the levels would be interesting. In any case, I'm rejecting this submission.
