	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"'Astérix and the Great Rescue' is part of a series of games based on the Astérix comics created by Albert René.  This also has to be one the most poorly programmed and difficult games in the universe.  That’s also part of its appeal, of course.  I alternate between Astérix and Obélix during the game, depending on the number of enemies etc., but I almost always use Astérix in the later levels.  The only real alternation occurs in Gaulish Village.
	$LF

	"The story: It is the year 50 BC.  Dogmatix and Getafix have gotten themselves captured by the Romans.  Astérix and Obélix have to rescue them.
