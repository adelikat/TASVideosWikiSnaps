	"I improved this tas by a new way to trigger glitch which was found on speedrun.com. Let the character reach the far right side of the screen through a rope or ladder, then pass the stage by the next rope or ladder. Before using this technique, you need to let the character get a weapon at the moment of death. If not, when the character reaches the far right of the screen, the game will disable character movement, and drag the screen to the right.
