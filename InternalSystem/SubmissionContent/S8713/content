	"Unlike the "Normal Game", the AI in the "Hard Game" will block any win in 1. It will also block the player from pulling off the infamous horizontal "3-checker trap"... but not unless we're clever in how we go about it. You see, the AI will block any 3-checker trap from forming on the bottom row just fine. It's when you try to set up the trap on anything higher than the first row where something—I'm not exactly sure what—begins to break down in the AI's decision-making. If you proceed to set up the trap on the second row by 
	[em 
		"placing the two checkers on the edge of the trap first
	]em
	", the AI will not notice a threat and may proceed to not block the key middle space, which will result in the AI's immediate loss.
