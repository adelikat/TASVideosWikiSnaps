	"Kirby no Kirakira Kids, sometimes referred to as Kirby Super Star Stacker is a Japan-only remake of Kirby Star Stacker (GB). One of the primary enhancements is story mode, in which Kirby faces several opponents. The player will remove star blocks by placing matching friends at either end. Blocks which are no longer supported will fall down, and that allows the player to make chain-reactions.

	"The run aims to see credits in story mode. As USA version of Kirby Star Stacker for GB doesn’t have the mode, I used Japanese version for SNES. No matter how I attack the opponent, it will mount a comeback quickly unless I give a finishing blow. So I prepared for chain-reactions and waited for the opponent to accumulate blocks. Also I used pauses to manipulate luck.

I find myself in the 'seen one, seen them all' camp,  but the cute graphics push me above complete ambivalence and so viewer response tips the scales here. Accepted.
