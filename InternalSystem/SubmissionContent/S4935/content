	"Snake Rattle 'n' Roll is a unique isometric platformer for the NES. Your goal is to guide the snakes up a tower to defeat a giant foot at the top. Most levels require you to eat a certain amount of food (called nibbly pibblies) in order to gain enough weight to open the door. The current two player run is a 35 second improvement over Nitsuja's run from 2006, using better lag management, platforming, and routing.

	"This run has been under development since MESHUGGAH started it in 2012. He stopped after doing level 2. I subsequently picked it up early in 2015 and promptly shelved it for most of the year, as it looked too complicated to me at the time. But like most projects I found that the most difficult part was just getting started. Once I started working on it and got a handle on the controls it came together pretty quickly. The overall platforming route uses the path from Aglar's one player run. My original contributions are the food route in level 3 and 8. This run also uses the correct ROM, as Nitsuja's run used a bad dump that desyncs in level 8.

	"This is where the biggest savings come from. Aglar had mentioned in the thread that you can gain an extra segment to take over to the next pool if you eat it right at the end of the current pool. This opens up many possibilities. There are a huge number of possible combinations of nibbly fish to get. I found one that looked smooth and saved a good chunk of time, but it can probably be improved.

	"Well I am very happy at both having this run done and in crossing it off my list. At first I was a bit intimidated by this game, but once I got going it wasn't so bad. While there is still room for improvement particularly in levels 8 and 10, I'm happy with the results and in having a more optimized two player run. But I do wonder how much more level 8 can be improved with truly amazing luck and routing, however I leave this to someone who REALLY likes luck manipulation.

The Level 5 and (especially) Level 8 savings you found significantly improved the pace of the run, in addition to the shortcuts and further optimizations made, overall.  Another well done effort here in obsoleting another older site record :)
