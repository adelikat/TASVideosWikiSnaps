	"C-1's speed instantly goes to 400 in 1 frame, and then increases by 300 each frame until it caps at 2500. However, when the scythe is thrown and stops moving, her speed cap increases to 3900. This speed cap is lowered again when the scythe returns to C-1. This is a 56% speed increase, so she tries to keep the scythe out for as long as possible.

[div class=p 
	"The main glitch this run uses is the "early scythe stop". Normally, the scythe will only stop when it hits a wall or spikes. But she can stop it earlier by facing the opposite direction on a certain frame. This way she can get the speed boost without waiting for it to reach a wall. It's also useful to get the scythe's collision directly under her.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The bug that prevents the scythe from being thrown is avoided entirely by recalling it the frame that she enter a door transition. This 1-2 frame loss is better than the 36 extra frames needed to sysreset. It's better to do it this way than run into a door with it still on the wall. The game recalls it automatically, however there is extra wait time this way (and you might have to sysreset after entering the next room anyway).

	"Not all time save comes from better movement; certain rooms have RNG which can change which switch you need to hit to open the next door. In my previous submission, room 9's switch was on the far right, where here it's the closer computer. Room 4 gets the switch to the right, and room 6 gets the upper switch, which I'm pretty sure are the fastest choices.
