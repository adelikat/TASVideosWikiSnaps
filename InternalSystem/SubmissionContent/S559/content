	"-This movie shows a Super Battle walkthrough on 8 Star difficulty, beating every opponent on "Perfect" and in less than 20 seconds for every fight and got a unbelievable total score of 1.762.600! I used up to 5 Hard-Hit Combos for saving time but also tried to vary the moves as much as the time allows.
