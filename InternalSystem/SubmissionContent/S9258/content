	"Sometimes enemies do not appear if previous enemy is killed at correct time, or by some other unknown condition. Even better, sometimes a forced screen halt is skipped without any reason even when there are many enemies still left unkilled. The screen lock override feels very random, maybe it is lag or some other mechanism that unfreezes the screen. Sometimes the screen unfreezes by walking for some time towards right or by just waiting for it to unfreeze, but it is usually slower than just beating the enemies as intended. Even without the mysterious glitchy screen this game is by far the hardest game I have tased. Lag reduction is not easy and fights can be complex when multiple enemies are doing their own thing and you try to line them up for fast killing. It is often very difficult to find perfect solution due to the possibility of glitchy screen scrolling. Every input in this TAS is as precise as possible, but the overall strategy can be improved if you dissect the game mechanics and invest 100,000 rerecords.

	"If you see the player stop suddenly for no reason it is because of screen scrolling or lag or enemy manipulation. It looks bad occasionally if you don't know what is going on, but on the other hand the game showcases some great fast fights by Bruce Lee. Anyone can appreciate those good moments in the TAS.

Using the screen scrolling glitch to skip the fights is slow and ugly, but it saves about 400 frames compared to doing the fights normally.

A speedrunner's nightmare is the final boss who looks like Shredder and teleports randomly and has a very long invulnerability pose that can be countered with frame perfect input.

	": I found how the various groups of enemies were dealt with quickly well done. Despite the game having a rather limited moveset what is there is used to complete the game as fast as possible.  Optimization looks good and the stage routing has no issues I could see.  Blocks and pits are used as much as possible to complete fights and the high jumps are at a minimum.  Found no improvements poking around.
