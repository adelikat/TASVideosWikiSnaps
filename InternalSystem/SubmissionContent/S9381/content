	"Chain combos from EX groove delay stun so they're used to avoid stunning earlier, yuo cannot stun twice in the same combo, so i save it for later so i can use 33hits super more often.

	"For speed, the best super is Misogi, the heavens palm strike. Weaker chars get stunned earlier and the health points are also varied between chars  which contributes to the different combo choice in each match.

	"surprinsingly, because of the different bodies characters have, more combos were used so we could control stun gauge and damage for longer, so it wasn't taht repetitive, we could also combo a little bit less if we planned better the point acquisition but it would look uglier as well.

	": Unfortunately this submission does not deal with point routing carefully enough which results in unnecessary farming.  The max score needed is 9999, but the game starts with 100, and there are 48 fighters.  This means that roughly 206 points per fight were needed.  In the author's response to when I asked about the excess farming, the author mentioned they had no idea what would be needed to stop earlier.  However in the previously cancelled submission

	" eien86 laid out an overview of what would be a conservative estimate for points per battle. This means that the author chose not to follow the suggestion of the previous judge and this resulted in a submission that did not make good use of routing for points.  This extra farming results in the max points being reached minutes before the end of the tas causing large time losses since many point farming fighting before deliberately would wait several seconds to charge the meter to use a lengthy finisher. For these reasons this tas is being rejected.
