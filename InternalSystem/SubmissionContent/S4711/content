	"Often abbreviated as DDG once Abe jumps or rolls into an explosive, it makes Abe invisible and can corrupt his sprite. This glitch will allow Abe to get past things that would kill him. Abe's sprite will show up after entering a door and wells will cancel this glitch. Abe will die if he falls of a ledge or gets zapped. A video made by Sligfantry can show you how this glitch works:

	"By timing this glitch perfectly you can make Abe stop and turn. Combing it with the auto turn glitch above a ledge you will be able to make Abe do a backwards jump. This will allow you to jump backwards to areas and skip Zulags. In a 100% run it will allow you to get to secret areas quicker and it skips a section of StockYards Escape after finishing the secret area. Sligfantry's video can show you how this glitch works: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIo1TJUBGlo
