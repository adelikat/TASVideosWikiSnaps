	"In this game, we have to reach down and collect a box and then again reach at the top and then go into the monster*. I tried but didn't found it possible to land on the bridge directly through the hole. After getting to the monster, we go into the black screen in which we have to reach the red spots. After each level, the height of those red pillars increases and the monster is defeated after completing the 6th (last) level. We can avoid enemies by jumping over them. The enemies on stairs can't be avoided, but could be fastly overcome-ed by climbing from sides. There is a timer which initiates our ability to climb up or down the stairs (like a framerule). The character can't jump on the top floor.

Afterwards, I noticed that the next round had a different screen layout...which means that the unique content was not fully demonstrated. So I offered to help with the rest. I have updated this submission with 11 more loops that show the remaining layouts that exist. In total, there are 12 different layouts.
