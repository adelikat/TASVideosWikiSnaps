Therefore, both games need to trade between each other in order to complete the Hoenn Pokedex. Pokemon Emerald cannot be used for this as the combination of Emerald and Ruby cannot get Lunatone while Emerald and Sapphire cannot get Zangoose.

Some of the major things to consider when routing include:

	"Trading is slower than catching pokemon so there needs to be a good reason to trade in order for a poke to be traded. There are a number of pokes that are traded that don't absolutely need to be and those have different reasons to be traded. One being that they simply take too long to get so one player getting them and trading it over to the other is faster than both getting them. Another being for boosted exp. In the other two diploma TASes, it often wasn't worth trading pokemon purely for boosted exp; however, it's much more common here because exp is 
	[em 
		"very
	]em
	" tight in the Hoenn games. Compared to the Johto games, there are far less mandatory battles (only 50) and far more exp required, as many of the Hoenn pokemon (i.e Ralts and Slakoth) have horrible exp curves and high levels required for their evolutions. Therefore, the time saved from less fighting to get these pokes exp or Rare Candies far outweighs the time lost in trading them. Speaking of, how do we get those Rare Candies?

	"Arceus makes itself unobtainable in all games it exists in because it lives in fear of the real Gods: Zigzagoon and Linoone. These two are the single most important pokemon in the entire TAS due to their ability: Pickup. After winning a battle, this ability gives them a 10% chance to pickup a random item, one of which being a Rare Candy. Therefore, we manip them to pickup a Rare Candy after every fight won, saving minutes, if not hours of grinding. This is so valuable, both players even catch multiple Zigzagoon, a rariety in the Diploma TAS series.

The former task is given to Sapphire while the latter is given to Ruby.

[div class=p 
	"The reason why a National Dex Diploma TAS is not doable as of now is that there's no combination of GBA games that gets the National Dex for all of them. You need all 5 of Ruby, Sapphire, FireRed, LeafGreen and Emerald to get all of the pokes required and even then, Ruby and Sapphire will not be able to complete it. They both require Ho-oh and Lugia, which are only obtainable with the GameCube games. Funnily enough, the other games do not require these two, likely because GameFreak already decided on making them essentially mythical pokemon when making those games (and they likely did not have this conclusion when making Ruby/Sapphire).

	"With the GameCube games, it becomes possible (and way more bearable since Emerald will not need to complete the Hoenn dex 
	[em 
		"three times
	]em
	" for the Johto starters). However, although multiplayer for GameCube and GBA games is tasable, it cannot be encoded properly due to there being no way to dump the GBA part. This isn't helped by this needing multiple instances of GBAs, which likely will never have support added for it due to there not really being an application (that I know of) other than this very specific TAS idea. Also, the optimal combination of games use

	[em 
		"three times
	]em
	" for the Kanto starters (it can't trade with any non Kanto game beforehand) and Emerald needing to complete the game twice for the Lati twins. As can be observed, this would be a monster of a TAS, requiring far more work than even the gen 2 diploma TAS. Replacing Colosseum with FireRed would also work but then, Emerald would need to complete the game three times for the same reason as Leaf Green from earlier and the combo would be far worse since three games would need to complete the dex (the GameCube games would just be 100%ed by purifying all of the Shadow Pokemon).
