	"Ok.. quick rundown of the game. Here is a hard to find, Japanese game that plays similarly to those Castlevania games that so many others love.  It even uses the whole medieval motif, though magic spells are far more prominent. There are 6 hard stages, but i could not find a Glitch at all :(. Still, it is entertaining to watch.
