	"Super Adventure Rockman is the best Mega Man game ever. Keiji Inafune, the creator of Mega Man, also called it the best Mega Man game ever. It features an expansive story, as well as stages with action-packed shooting, with 16 robot masters to top it off. The Robot Masters are all from Mega Man 2 and Mega Man 3, leading to some healthy fanservice, since Mega Man 2 and 3 are generally considered some of the better games of the series. They're also tougher than ever, even Metal Man takes more than a couple shots to defeat. Other Robot Master highlights include Flash Man teleport spamming repeatedly, including after every hit, Shadow Man forming up to 4 illusions to attack from all directions, Gemini Man splitting up repeatedly to attack with a barrage of lasers, Hard Man having the durability to take damage from more than 200 Mega Buster shots, and it all goes on. Following the Robot Masters, you enter the underground fortress of Dr. Wily, where you fight Ra Thor, Dr. Wily's most powerful humanoid robot ever, with barrages of projectiles and force fields. And after that you fight the most powerful incarnation of the Yellow Devil ever. What kind of a Yellow Devil has weaknesses anyway? The game also features the other Robot Masters from Mega Man 1, actively assisting Mega Man. Did you know that Guts Man defeats Heat Man all by himself?
