	"Astro Boy: Omega Factor is part of a long list of acclaimed Treasure titles, and like its brethren, it is a 2D side-scrolling beat-em-up. The game is structured in three main "legs": A first playthrough titled "Birth", a second Newgame+ playthrough titled "Rebirth", and a postgame cleanup event that unlocks the true ending of the game.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The aim of this movie is to finish the "Birth" playthrough as fast as possible and reach the first credits sequence; this is the most popular category in RTA at the time of writing, and is commonly accepted as the game's "Any%" category. Using the same movie file to progress onto a True Ending TAS is possible, but the upgrade route used in this movie may prove sub-optimal once gameplay restarts in the Rebirth segment.

	"As the game is a beat-em-up, the player has a variety of tools at their disposal to use in combat. Astro's various abilities are as follows:
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Movement: Performed with Up/Down/Left/Right, as standard. Running speed is fixed in this game, and is very often the sub-optimal way to progress through the game.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Boost: Performed with either a double input on a given direction, a double-A input whilst grounded, or a singular A input in conjunction with a direction whilst airborne. This is the primary form of movement used in the movie, as boost speed is much higher than running speed, and has a couple of unique properties, including temporary intangibility allowing Astro to ignore projectiles and enemy hitboxes. Boosts can only be used consecutively whilst grounded, unless this stat is upgraded; whilst airborne, Astro will be unable to boost consecutively until becoming grounded, which is the condition for refreshing his boost.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Punch: The basic combat option, performed with B. Up to four B inputs can be used in succession to perform a punch combo, the fourth hit of which is performed as a kick.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Kick: The ending hit of a four-punch combo, can alternatively be used by pressing B whilst holding Down. The main utility of this attack is to extend combos by forcing enemies to enter a "Tumbling" animation; when regular enemies are hit by a kick, they enter a vulnerable state during which they travel across the screen and act as projectiles that can be used to damage other enemies in their path.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Finger Laser: Performed by pressing B whilst holding Up. This attack crosses the entire width of the screen, making it a valuable option when enemies are located on both sides of the screen. It is also the only form of regular attack the player has access to in any autoscroller segment, as hand-to-hand options cannot be used in these segments.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Super Meter: Used as ammunition for Astro's Super attacks. The number available is displayed in the center-top of the screen, and the meter is built by inflicting damage to enemies. It is important to note that triggering the Super attacks listed below incurs a 2~ second timeloss each time due to the startup animation they play. This timeloss is compounded if the game is experiencing slowdown whilst the startup animation plays, and so Super attacks are only used when they save more time than they would otherwise cost to use.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Machine Gun: The first of Astro's Super attacks, performed with L. This attack inflicts negligible damage, but covers the entire screen, deletes many projectiles and stuns all enemies that are hit. Stun time is increased the more this stat is leveled up. This attack is used very often in RTA runs to mitigate the presence of RNG, but is not used at all in this movie.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Arm Cannon: The second of Astro's Super attacks, performed with R. An augmented finger laser that lasts much longer and hits a wider area, this is the primary form of attack to dispatch Bosses and other enemies with very high health pools, as the damage-per-second is much higher than any other option the player has access to.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"EX Dash: The third of Astro's Super attacks, performed with a simultaneous A+B input on the same frame. This attack acts as an additional boost which also damages all enemies in Astro's path and forces them into the Tumbling animation. A valuable option in some cases during RTA runs when the player does not have enough boosts to reach an enemy or platform, but is not used in this movie.

	"ASTRO'S STATS
	$LF
]h3
[div class=p 
	"The stat progression system plays a large part in how quickly the player is able to progress, and how powerful their toolkit is. Astro gains upgrade points by meeting characters and understanding their emotions, which is logged in the Omega Factor. Every time a character is fully understood in the Omega Factor, designated by that character having a coloured portrait, Astro gains one upgrade point to allocate. Astro's stats are as follows:
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"LIFE: Increases Astro's Max HP by 10,000 per point. Starting value is 30,000, maximum value is 100,000. This stat is only boosted at the end of the movie file as it is the fastest stat to allocate points to by that time, and no other stats are relevant at that time. Otherwise, not enough damage is taken to warrant boosting this stat.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"PUNCH: Increases the power of Astro's hand-to-hand attacks, this also includes the kick. This stat is boosted in the second half of the movie after maximising the primary attack stat as it costs very few frames to allocate points to, and a large number of points eventually alters the number of hits required to defeat regular enemies, as well as making a marginal difference on some boss fights.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"LASER: Increases the power of Astro's Finger Laser and Arm Cannon, this is the primary stat for the movie, and for RTA runs. The amount of damage inflicted by the Arm Cannon is far beyond any other option in the game, and the various autoscroller segments force the player to use the Finger Laser, making this the only logical option as the player would otherwise have very low firepower during these segments.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"SHOT: Increases the power of Astro's Machine Gun, as well as the stun duration. This stat is boosted in the second half of RTA runs, but is not used in the movie. The utility of this ability in RTA to mitigate RNG by forcing bosses into a stunlock is invaluable, but no bosses require this in a TAS.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"JETS: Increases the number of boosts that Astro can use without landing by one, per point. Not used in the movie as repeatedly boosting whilst airborne only has niche utility which is further mitigated by each boost having a several-frame startup animation, and boosts can be used infinitely whilst grounded without investing points into this stat.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"SENSOR: Improves Astro's ability to perceive his surroundings, such as night-vision, de-fog vision, and ability to sense when an undiscovered character is nearby. This stat is necessary to achieve the true ending of the game as it is required for a storyline event, but is not taken in the movie as it does not assist in completing the objective of reaching the first credits sequence.

	"The game has three difficulties to choose from upon file creation: Easy, Normal and Hard. This movie plays the game on Easy difficulty, as this is the current standard in RTA runs, and the differences between difficulties are not as substantial as commentors have claimed in the past, at least not in a qualitative sense. The biggest difference between difficulty levels is the number of Super attacks the player can hold in reserve; 99 on Easy, 5 on Normal, 3 on Hard. As Super attacks are in short supply on the harder difficulties, boss fights become a protracted, tedious affair as risk of dying isn't present, and the movie becomes much slower as a result. The player is also incentivized to collect as many upgrade points as possible on these harder difficulties to mitigate the relative loss in power, slowing the game down further. Whilst generally true and requiring creative solutions in many titles, I do not agree with the notion that a harder-difficulty run makes for a better movie in the case of this game.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Without exception, progressing through each stage is contingent on defeating enemy waves as fast as possible. At its core, this game is a series of enemy waves at various points of each stage, and progressing to the next wave is not possible until the current wave is defeated. The current wave being defeated is defined by all current enemy sprites leaving the screen entirely. This is the condition for the screen to unlock and continue scrolling through the stage until the next wave is reached, or for the next enemy wave within the same screen lock region to begin spawning.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"When enemies are killed, they typically bounce across the screen before exiting the bottom of the screen. Punch/Kick/Finger Laser generally cause different enemy trajectories, and the same attack can cause different trajectories depending on frame data. For this reason, many enemy waves are not killed on the first possible frame, as the trajectory is not necessarily lower, and thus can result in a net timeloss.

In total, three optional upgrade points are collected: Alejo in Stage 1, Magma in Stage 2 and Fumoon in Stage 3. These points are collected both due to a combination of the time taken to obtain them being negligible, boosting the Laser stat as quickly as possible to kill bosses faster, and avoiding needing to collect slower optional upgrade points in order to maintain the same rate of stat upgrading. The route has changed in RTA runs over the years, and details of how much time each collected point saves will be given in the stage notes.

	$LF
]h3
[div class=p 
	"Input buffering: All of Astro's regular abilities can be buffered so that if they are performed early, they will automatically occur on the first actionable frame. This allows the player to string together perfect combos and boosts even in RTA play, and is used to move perfectly throughout the movie.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Input delay: Conversely, the player has the option to perform a combination "imperfectly" by waiting after the input buffer period has elapsed, causing actions to be spaced further apart than normal. This can be utilised to manipulate RNG, such as enemy placements where a perfect hit would cause an unfavourable enemy spawn, or to set up a further combo by moving onto a different enemy on the "first possible frame", where a perfectly-buffered combo would make the player reach their next objective too soon and lose time. Furthermore, an in-progress punch combo can be delayed for so long that the current attack animation fully ends, causing the combo to end. This can be utilised to perform an "infinite" punch combo as enemies will remain in hitstun indefinitely and the punch combo will never resolve with a kick, preventing the enemies from entering the tumbling animation or being launched across the screen.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Combo-reset boost: An alternative method of extending a punch combo; a boost can be buffered after the third punch of a combo, after which a new punch combination can be buffered. As long as Astro is grounded and therefore getting his boost refreshed as soon as the boost animation ends, this can be performed indefinitely.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Boost cancel: When Astro performs a boost, he will travel in a straight path until the boost naturally runs its course. The player can cause a boost to end early by executing any of Astro's other abilities, or alternatively without using any abilities by pressing A. This is used extensively through the run for positioning, to set up combos, to avoid damage, etc.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Slope boosting: When moving up a slope, it is faster to boost horizontally into the slope that it is to boost diagonally and move parallel to the sloped surface. The game will simply push Astro upwards as needed, and more pixels per frame are covered with a horizonal boost than a diagonal boost.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Object clipping: Whilst boosting, Astro is not considered a solid object and is invulnerable to harm. This can be used to pass through enemies directly, and is very often used to displace enemies or be clipped short distances; when Astro finishes the boost animation and becomes solid again, he cannot occupy the same space as another solid object such as an enemy. In these cases, the game will force Astro to the nearest open space, on the side of the enemy which is closest. If Astro is against the side of the screen, the game will force the enemy to move inwards instead. This is exploited often to set up screen-wide attacks.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Camera scrolling: Related to game progression mechanics. Since the nature of the game involves getting enemies offscreen as soon as possible to progress, this can be further achieved by jumping in order to scroll the camera upwards, as most enemies exit the bottom of the screen. In many cases, this causes the screen to unlock after a wave at least several frames sooner, and is used on the majority of enemy waves in the game.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Lag reduction: This game is unfortunately prone to slowdown when too many sprites are onscreen at once. As such, certain actions are not performed on the first possible frame, as the resulting number of lag frames can result in a net timeloss. Lag can also be caused by specific boss actions/animations, so these are avoided where possible.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"RNG manipulation: I am not certain about all of the variables that alter RNG in this game, but one element which is easily controlled is the frames which particle effects are generated on; these do advance the RNG, and so delaying attacks by a variable number of frames can control everything from enemy spawn positions to other RNG calls such as the car placements in 1-2 and general boss behaviour.

This metric is not used in RTA runs as it does not progress during Super attack startup animations, and so IGT optimisation would abuse Super attacks at every opportunity for maximum damage-per-second, at the cost of realtime. Nonetheless, it is a valuable metric when Super attacks are being used minimally as is the case in this movie, and a comparison shall be listed for each level segment between the time achieved in the TAS VS the time achieved in my RTA PB, which at the time of submission is the world record.

	"The first upgrade point is collected here, and the first instance of maintaining an RNG value from an earlier point in the run; the traffic light enemy only has time to spawn one car, but this car can randomly travel across the middle or bottom of the screen. If it moves along the bottom of the screen, there is no way to avoid either taking damage, or wasting time to move in order to avoid taking damage. Thus, RNG is manipulated here to have the car take the higher path. This is basically a 50/50 coin flip in RTA play. The first upgrade is put into the Laser stat, which will be boosted with every subsequent upgrade point until the stat is maxed, as this results in the largest net timesave over the game due to the amount of time spent in autoscroller sections, and the DPS that can be achieved against bosses with the Arm Cannon, even with the 2~ second timeloss per use from the startup animation.

Rather, I start at the left side and move into range to kill enemies from the other spawn locations as soon as possible. Rooms such as this one are one of the reasons that the old RTA upgrade route was to put the first upgrade point from Alejo into Jets, as it makes this room easier to manage and would absolutely result in this isolated room being faster, but would result in a net timeloss across the entire run.

A couple of the waves in this segment were surprisingly difficult to kill as soon as possible; the wave at 4:08/frame 14800~ in particular was very troublesome to find enough frames to be able to reach the bottom-most enemy in time to kill it in order to start the following wave sooner.

Pook will always begin the fight by cycling through his four different animal forms: fish, monkey, lion and bird. Each transformation is triggered by dealing a certain amount of damage to him. After each animal form has been seen once, he will randomly choose any of the three forms he is not currently in for the next transformation. Lion is by far the worst transformation as it incurs forced timeloss due to the green force-field that surrounds it upon spawning, so the mandatory appearance at the start of the fight is the only time it appears. The force-field also remains active for a random number of frames, which can be mitigated by standing behind the boss in order to force him to turn around. Bird is the next-worst form, as it begins its movement by rising into the air; this actually delays the next transformation sequence until Pook becomes grounded again. Thus, once the random transformations start, I manipulate getting only monkey/fish transformations for the duration of the fight by delaying my attacks slightly.

I was convinced that there was no value in using the Machine Gun in a TAS and that it would actually be slower to do so, and so I chose to upgrade Laser instead as it is both faster to allocate points to, and results in more immediate timesave due to higher overall DPS. The vertical silo section was a big problem area to work on as enemies can spawn both at the top and bottom borders of the screen, rapidly becoming unmanageable. Thankfully, an RTA strat discovered by Sonikkustar has great utility here; by remaining at the bottom of the silo for several seconds, enemies are forced to spawn in approximately the same place, making it easy to gather them up and kill them simultaneously.

This upgrade point also causes additional timesave that isn't obvious, and facilitated the change in upgrade point routing mentioned in Stage 2-3 when I discovered this in RTA play; if the player progresses without collecting Fumoon's upgrade point, the following enemy waves are incredibly laggy and the game plays at virtually 50% speed. If Fumoon's upgrade point is collected, this lag does not occur. I have no idea why this happens, but it does, and I didn't discover this until attempting a 100% run since I wasn't collecting Fumoon's upgrade point prior to that. Swapping Rainbow Parakeet's upgrade point in 2-3 for Fumoon's in 3-3 is a net timesave just from the shorter path needed to collect the respective points, but the fact that it also results in so much lag reduction saves a VERY considerable amount of time, even in RTA terms.

If another action such as a Punch is inputted before this animation finishes and Astro becomes airborne, he instead remains grounded whilst punching. Therefore, it is impossible to perform a jumping punch which has an active hitbox as soon as you leave the ground, it must necessarily become active several frames after you leave the ground. Thankfully I was able to find a single frame where I could jump from a specific part of the slope, and be both close enough and low enough to hit the three bottom enemies, dragging them upwards with me.

	"Atlas is a relatively simple boss fight, though the attack order is changed from the RTA method; the first action performed is a Finger Laser, until Atlas has little enough remaining HP for a full Arm Cannon to end the first phase of the fight. Whilst Astro is in the Arm Cannon animation, he has a strange form of intangibility that prevents him from taking damage from certain types of attacks, but not others. Atlas' plasma cannon is one of those attacks that simply doesn't hit Astro during the Arm Cannon animation.

Zero frames are lost after the fight due to this. I am not convinced that there is a faster method for clearing this fight, nor that it is relevant that Astro gets hit during Atlas' charge, as Atlas is completely invulnerable during his charge in the same way that Astro is during boosts.

	"The first of a couple of stage segments which actually features a slower IGT in the TAS than in my RTA PB. This is due to the increased usage of Super attacks in RTA as a simple way to deal with screen-wide enemies, but it's not necessary or indeed faster to use these in a TAS. The method used to kill the third enemy wave just before Nuka looks really silly and counter-intuitive, and it is in fact 1 frame faster than just using an Arm Cannon. Thanks, game.

	"This segment was particularly troublesome until I realised that the flying platforms follow the same rule as every other enemy wave in the game; they must go offscreen before new platforms will spawn to take their place. With this knowledge, I ensure that the first four platforms, which always spawn on the left side of the screen, spawn as low as possible so that they exit the screen sooner. After this point, the remaining platforms can randomly spawn at any height, and on either side of the screen. Thankfully, as long as platforms spawn on the right-hand side, it is irrelevant how high up they appear as they will exit the right border before they exit the bottom border. Thus, I use input delaying and damage-boosting to manipulate platform placements so that I am able to exclusively aim towards the right. In RTA, this screen is typically seen as a "free screen" where there isn't any realistic timesave available as it will largely progress at the same pace each time. In this TAS, I managed to save 9 seconds, as shown in the table at the end of these notes.

The enemies here are strong enough that repeated Finger Lasers will not kill them quickly, and using a kick to cluster the mobs is not practical as the two strongest "colours" of mobs, Red and Purple, do not suffer hitstun when you damage them. Doing anything other than an Arm Cannon whilst being faced down by the red mob simply results in Astro getting punched in the face and sent tumbling.

New enemies appear to replace enemies that get killed, and they can spawn on either side of the screen. With this being a very wide screen, this can waste a lot of time. I delay inputs enough to ensure that enemies spawn exclusively on the right, until the end of the wave when the giant enemies appear. At this point it's not relevant whether they're on the left or right, as they're strong enough for an Arm Cannon to be the fastest way to kill them, and boosting to the right of the right-most enemy to push it towards the center works just as well as continuing to manipulate the spawns, which would cost extra frames to achieve.

Standard RNG manipulation for these waves, where I want to get them to spawn exclusively on the right.

	"I'm very grateful that I was able to find a fast method for this fight. Sharaku used to be the biggest run-killer in RTA runs due to having three special attacks he can use: Aztlan (Red), Mictlan (Blue) and Atonatiuh (Green). In the event that he uses his green attack, he becomes completely invulnerable for an extended period. I discovered some time ago that it's possible to consistently manipulate Sharaku's red attack as the fight begins by being underneath him, and whilst a special attack is in progress, he cannot use another. Thus, it prevented his green attack from showing up whatsoever and fights were much faster on average. However, the tradeoff from this is that Sharaku's red attack is one which forces the game to lag considerably. This was unacceptable to me, so I decided to try and find a method of fighting Sharaku normally without having his green attack occur. It did consistently occur at various points in the fight until I altered the rate at which I dealt early damage; after the first Arm Cannon, I switch to using the Finger Laser for approximately 10% of his HP, before switching back to Arm Cannon. This, combined with the movement pattern, prevented the green attack from appearing, and as each Arm Cannon deals 30% damage, the Finger Laser usage is required anyway. Very satisfied with the way this fight came out.

The player must begin this fight by baiting out a block from North by attempting to punch him, after which an Arm Cannon can be used as normal. This inflicts enough damage to begin the second phase of the fight, during which North will move around and act according to your position. Whilst to the right of North, he will regularly counter-attack you with an energy beam. This attack seems to be of the same type as Atlas' plasma cannon, as it can be ignored whilst Astro is in the Arm Cannon animation. A minor amount of time needed to be spent in this fight in order to get a favourable RNG value to carry into the next boss fight; it's fastest to begin phase 2 by using the Arm Cannon on the same frame as punching North, but this prevented me from getting the RNG I needed and it was necessary to change the attack order.

	"Denkou is the second boss and has the honour of being the shortest segment, and fight, of the game, clocking in at 5 seconds. This is intended to be a long and protracted fight due to Denkou's pattern of becoming invisible after exiting hitstun. The solution to this is to simply not allow him to exit hitstun. Denkou will always begin this fight by running away to the right, and will then either jump up to the next level, or continue running to the right. This jump is the RNG value that I needed to carry from North, as there isn't a fast way to kill Denkou without this jump occurring. There is a single frame, with perfect movement, during which you can catch Denkou with a punch as he is jumping up to the next level, whilst forcing him to get stuck against the wall as you use an Arm Cannon. Getting stuck against the wall like this is what makes this method work, as without this occurring, Denkou will get pushed offscreen and exit hitstun. Some additional time is spent using two extra punches on Denkou before finishing him off, to get another favourable RNG value for the next fight.

His weak spot opens quickly and I am able to position myself to use repeated Arm Cannons from across the room. The angle of the energy blasts is dependent on the frame data, thankfully as long as I get high enough I'm able to avoid all of the energy blasts without needing to spend frames manipulating their angles. Being at a large distance from Brontus forces him to follow up with a second energy blast attack, after which I can boost behind him and finish him off as normal.

This fight is trivial in RTA, but only because of Machine Gun abuse that stunlocks him like every other boss. It is borderline mandatory to do this due to the variety of attacks he can use which range from wasting varying amounts of time to just killing you very quickly. You would need to be extremely lucky to get a favourable fight that can be finished quickly with just Arm Cannons without stunning him. Thankfully, this run manipulates RNG. Epsilon chooses his dolphin-summoning attack to begin the fight, which is the most favourable attack to see; it's the only attack that the player has a chance of attacking through without being interrupted. The angles that the dolphins swim at are random, and after testing several variants I was thankfully able to find a series of positions with which I could narrowly avoid every dolphin. This attack DOES unfortunately cause some slowdown, but there is simply no better alternative for this fight.

There are many different attacks that Pluto can use in this fight, some of which generate a lot of additional lag. Thankfully, I was able to avoid these attacks altogether. Pluto began this fight by jumping across the room and spinning; there is enough time to land a punch + Arm Cannon before he becomes invulnerable, after which I remain on the right-hand side of the screen. From this point I managed to get genuinely really good luck; the rest of the fight is nothing but his most favourable attack, a missile volley that causes next to no lag, but I didn't even need to manipulate this for the most part. He just... Happened to keep launching these as I continued to wail on him with first-frame Arm Cannons, and the fight is a done deal. It is difficult to overstate just how much time is saved on this final stage from not using the Machine Gun after every second Arm Cannon in favour of getting perfect RNG instead, but it makes the bosses look like nothing. I invite anybody to try this out in RTA and see if it really is that easy, though.
