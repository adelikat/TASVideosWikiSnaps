	"The gist of the game is, Wario has to move through 18 insanely long levels to unlock the paths to some glorious treasures. Each stage contains a "Keyzer" which unlocks the path to the next stage, as well as four sections of a door tile (from now on known as Jewel Pieces) which must be collected to access the boss. There's also a CD to collect in each stage, but that is optional. In order to leave the stage, Wario has to hit a switch that sets off a destruction sequence, and he must make it out before the time is over. That about sums it up. Oh, there's also a princess. Wario finally gets to rescue a princess, though he doesn't actually care; he just wants the treasure.

		"Mystic Lake:

	" Swimming in a TAS is never easy, and it's really hard to figure Wario out. I worked out the best pattern to swim fast using his swimming animation as a guide, but there seems to be a way to swim diagonally really fast, and I'll be damned if I could find a consistent way to pull it off. At any rate, I did my best! The path to the second Jewel Piece requires a running charge, and it's one of the tougher Jewel Pieces to find.

		"Monsoon Jungle:

	" This stage is cool; I love fast platform jumping... It's something that just couldn't be done outside of a TAS. Sadly, the stage also introduces the biggest bring-down form of Wario: Fat Wario. Fat Wario is slow, and only by walking a certain distance can he return to normal. Every time he must be used, the speed of the run comes to a grind, but at least in this stage I pulled off his transformation in a fancy way. The first Jewel Piece took a bit of time to get as well, but I like how I had Wario lined up for the shot execution style.

		"40 Below Fridge:

	" Not the fastest level, but interesting! Again, Hard Mode is so much nicer, I think, since Wario actually has to DO things to get the Jewels in this stage. Incidentally, it's always a bummer when a moving platform decides to be in the wrong position, completely stopping the action, isn't it?

		"Pinball Zone:
	]b
	" They call it "Pinball" even though it's clearly Pachinko. The most awesome and difficult stage to TAS, and you can probably guess why. One thing worth noting is that the Pachinko goals must be in view as the ball goes in them -- as do the goal counters once they reach zero -- before they'll disappear. I was so pleased with myself as I juggled multiple balls in the latter parts of the stage to get them where they needed to be.

		"The Big Board:

	" Again, HOORAY FOR HARD MODE. There's no need to even play the damn board game in Normal Mode, removing the whole point of the stage! Due to the time-consuming animation after hitting the slots, it's best to only hit as many as needed, but I went ahead and hit one extra one, as at that point I would have had to wait for the the slot to loop around to the number I wanted, plus it put me in a position to hit the rest of the spaces on the board really quickly. It's hard to explain, but it was the right decision; trust me.

		"Doodle Woods:

You have to crush some blocks at the VERY BEGINNING of the stage in order to open up access to a Jewel Piece at the VERY END. As often as I've played WL4, I just did not remember this, for some reason. It was fuuuun indeed!

		"Domino Row:

	" In this stage you must beat the stacks of Dominos to open the door to the next area more quickly, as well as open up special paths. In a TAS this is nothing to worry about, needless to say. Curiously, this is the only stage aside from the Hall of Glyphs here the Jewel Piece locations don't change from Normal to Hard.

		"Aerodent:

	" God damn this boss. It's the hardest boss to beat quickly, and yet watching it you'd never know it! Basically, once the mouse is out, it's ideal to damage him without causing him to crawl back in the bear, and the only way to do it is to strike him exactly 100% pixel-perfectly. It's really hard, it took a lot of rerecords, and the result is a fight that's actually quite boring to watch. I hate you, Aerodent.

		"Crescent Moon Village:

	" The most aggrivating Jewel Piece in the game is located here. You have to roll to get to it, but there's a hard rock AND a CD case blocking the way! This essentially make this the only stage where collecting the CD is mandatory, and I do so. If that wasn't enough, I had to contend with the Ghost Pirate while getting the Jewel, who can steal the Keyser away from Wario. If you watch JuanValdez's movie, you'll see him do just that, but he moved into a position where Juan could get it back right away.  He wouldn't do that for me! >:( It's hard to tell at full speed, but he was such a pain.

		"Fiery Cavern:

	" This is a cool stage. The first half has the difficulty of figuring out which pillars of fire to take damage at to save time. While my route is a bit more optimal than Juan's I still question whether I really needed to stop at the first one. Because of this, there's a possibility I may go back and edit the movie at this point if this submission sits in the queue for a while. But it will be a long while before I try that. Bigfoots are a pain as they have many ways to put a dead stop Wario's dash.
