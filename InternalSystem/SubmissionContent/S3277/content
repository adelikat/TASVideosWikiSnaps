[div class=p 
	"One outstanding issue is whether this should obsolete the current dual run of MMX and MMX2. This is a difficult call as we have no precedent regarding the ways in which a multi-game run may be obsoleted. Common sense would dictate that a faster run of the same games would triumph, this goes without saying, but this is not the case here. The judge guidelines clearly state that 
	[a class=intlink href=/JudgeGuidelines 
		"the number of branches of a particular game should be kept to a minimum
	]a
	", consistency dictates that this should also apply to having multi-game runs of the same series For example, we could have the NES Mega Man quad-run, plus a run of MM4 + MM5, then perhaps a run of MM6 + MM3, then perhaps a run of MM3,4 and 6. This is, of course, an exaggeration, the point is that these runs are a demonstration of a concept, there is no point in publishing numerous multi-game runs within a series when they are merely variations of the same concept. Instead the multi-game run that best demonstrates this concept should be published.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The common concept between these runs is that they both demonstrate that multiple games from the Mega Man X series can be completed by a single sequence of input. I find that this run is superior in demonstrating this concept for a number of reasons. Firstly, a multi-game run must be impressive in the sense that it creates a clear divide between that which is possible for a human and that which requires tool-assistance. These runs mock the game by being able to play several games concurrently. As the difficulty increases with the more games one adds it can be said that the submission that beats three games is more impressive. Of course, this must be balanced with entertainment as the product becomes less impressive the more difficult it is to follow. Personally I find that quad-runs can get rather cluttered, three games seems to be just right. I found this run more entertaining and no more difficult to follow (probably because there was often some downtime in one of the games and so only two were being watched). Furthermore, the fact that this run also includes input animation adds to how impressive it is; the hypothetical player is not content with beating three games 100% at once, but also generates patterns with the controllers scattered around him/her.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Secondly, I find the goals in this submission to make for a more satisfying movie. Both runs collected all items in MMX2, but

		"DeHackEd expressed regret that 100% could not also be achieved in MMX1

	" which this run now achieves in conjuction with 100% in MMX3. This persuades me that this run is a fitting continuation of what DeHackEd hoped to achieve with this concept.
