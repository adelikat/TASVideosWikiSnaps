	"This game called columns, like a tetris only used jewelry. In flashing columns "which was where I decided to go but I went to double instead of 1 Players who have improved by better there. In this game you have to remove or destroy a flashing gem, located on the inside of the game. There is also a counter to the left that tells you the time. Well, to make the game harder I went to level 9 where the columns were highest
