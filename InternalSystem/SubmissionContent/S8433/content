	"But the traffic is heavy today. On arrival at the Lincoln International Spaceport, you were asked to go into a holding pattern. Finally, after three hours of flying in circles, you've been cleared for landing. You accelerate toward the landing bay and suddenly realize that every ship in the sector must be here, and they're all blocking your path. You bear an angry voice on the radio, "Hey, noodle-brain, where'd you learn to fly? Get out of the way." So you turn off the radio...

	"I remember getting this magazine and opening it to find that there was only one game in it. This disappointed me, but when I saw the word "Space" in the game's title, I was pepped up just a bit. Well, this ended up being a fairly descent game. As usual, this one had a bit of a challenge to it and was very hard to play. Having only tried it on Level 1, it was a bit frustrating at times and would force me to quit often. So, you can imagine playing this on the highest difficulty...wasn't able to! Well, time for a TAS to show that it can be done!

There was a small amount of RNG, but it was not worth manipulating...since it depended on your screen location. So...I did what I could to minimize the frame loss during docking.
