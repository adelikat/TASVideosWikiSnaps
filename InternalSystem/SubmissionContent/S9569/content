	"Action Man: Operation Extreme features two different gameplay modes that you switch back and forth from during the course of play. The first is a top-down vehicular portion, where the perspective and controls are quite similar to the Grand Theft Auto series. 
	$LF
	"You'll need to chase down the enemy vehicles with your own trusty assortment of cars, motorbikes, and the like, blasting them until they slow down for good. After this, it's on to the third-person action levels, where you control Action Man from behind the back as he makes his way through enemy territory, and must occasionally solve puzzles to get out of whatever predicament he's found himself in this time.
	$LF
	"The game's levels feature a myriad of locales, from evil villains' bases to the burning sands of the desert to the arctic chill of the North Pole. 
	$LF
	"You'll face many of Action Man's most notorious fiends during the adventure. You have a host of weapons, from your trusty hand-gun to automatic weapons and even a sniping rifle.

[div class=p 
	"So Action Man... this game turned out to be much harder to tas than expected. Back in 2022 i started making WIPs of City Streets, the first level of the game. This level needed some major luck manipulation and routing which i initally was able to deal with.
	$LF
	"But then after making a new route which would save a few seconds i just dropped it immediately, because of lag appearing in the middle of the level. I know it's weird to drop a tas for that reason and that was just the 1st level, but who knows if lag may appear in the later 2 levels like City Skies and Iceflow? (which it did).

[div class=p 
	"In the middle of 2024 i picked the game back up and decided to just ignore the lag, no way around it. The new route saved 3-4s on City Streets and i was quite happy, but enough of the game for now. The reason i actually wanted to make a tas for this game was to challenge myself.
	$LF
	"This game has a bunch of levels where Action Man just goes from point a to point b, uses an item, and then jumps into the next screen.
