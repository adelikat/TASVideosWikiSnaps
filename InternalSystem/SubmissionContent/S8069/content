Holding the opposite side of the D-pad does not seem to affect the deceleration much, but by crouching for even a single frame, all momentum is stopped, making it particularly useful to instantly stop at specific points which may stop Osomatsu from progressing faster, such as a high HP enemy or some bosses.

If Up is held simultaneously, he can propel himself upwards even further, at 84. I gathered all the information using a RAM watch on the D014 address of the 68K RAM. Holding Up does not increase his Y velocity whatsoever, assuming he jumps to the same height with Up held compared to when it is not held.

	": When pressing B, Osomatsu immediately borrows his slingshot and takes a short moment before launching his projectile, so the timing has to be correct to hit enemies, especially while jumping. If used on the floor, all momentum is instantly stopped just like when he ducks. If used in mid-air, no speed is lost at all, but if done too late before Osomatsu lands on the floor, the attack will be cancelled. These two positions have their own pros and cons; firing on the floor gives more vertical accuracy to hit some enemies and allows to shoot lower while ducking, while in the air, the slingshot reloads faster, in 16 frames compared to 19 on the floor. Osomatsu cannot turn during his attack, but can still move backwards while maintaining his direction in the air.

This is also the last time I buy items in this run, and I will use the bomb later for the final boss.
