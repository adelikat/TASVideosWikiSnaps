	"This game has some real nice lag manipulation.  It only lags during the loading screens between area name, wanted poster and game level.  Even if the screen has lots of enemies, there's no lag.  But it does flicker crazily.

	(__wikiLink|user:feos)
	": This run picks a "pacifist" goal, which can't be published in the Vault, and it got a quite bad feedback and votes, with prevent mooning it either. If a full run is done someday, 
	[a href=/forum/p/344687#344687 
		"this post
	]a
	" must be taken into account while optimizing it, and 
	(__wikiLink|36S|this submission)
	" must be also noticed. I remind that there are only 2 branches possible in Vault: fastest completion (any%) and full completion (100%), both without any time tradeoffs. Rejecting this one meanwhile.
