		" Jumping is known to be slightly faster than just running, but where you have an area small enough that you can't make a minimum size jump, I'm fairly sure that straight running is faster than using Dixie's glide to slow down. This is implemented inconsistently throughout the run, so I'm not sure.

		" When I did a test run of this myself many years ago, I reached Kleaver's Kiln before I did a test on whether Diddy or Dixie was faster. I found that Diddy was able to, with a perfect roll off a crocodile and jump, skip landing on one crocodile and land on the next one, whereas if Dixie tried it she would fall to her death. I'm not sure if the test was strictly scientific (there could be subpixel things getting in the way for example), but the conclusion I drew is that Diddy is either slightly faster or has a slightly higher jump. Anyone who wants to improve this would do well to look into this closely.
