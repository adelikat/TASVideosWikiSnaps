	"This one was a unique problem. As Romhacking.net doesn't have public access to older versions of hacks I had to do a bit of leg work to find a version that syncs with the submission. However, I ran into a snag: the IPS patch that synced was labelled as an early final build. There are reviews on the hack page that are within a a week or two after the given date of the IPS patch (the final build apparently dated at 22 Aprim 2024) it's possible to assume that this release candidate version of the patch that syncs with the submission may in fact also just be the 1.0 version of the hack. The other problem was that I have no evidence if this is truly the case as I couldn't find a version of the hack that is directly listed as version 1.0 anywhere to confirm or deny that. The current version 1.1 of the hack also adds balance changes which will cause a desync.
