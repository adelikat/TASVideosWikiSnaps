	"The purpose of 100% as defined by the is to beat the game having drank all potions and killed all guards. This movie abides by the

		" This movie includes the copyright level, which is not considered in the RTA category. This level contains many potions with only one being the 'correct' one that opens the exit door to continue with the game.  One can drink at most one incorrect potion without dying and failing the copy protection. This means, it is impossible to drink all potions in this level. After discussing with the community, we decided to simply ignore this level for this category and just leave it as fast as possible. For this I used the same system clock manipulation as in the any% movie to ensure an initial RNG that assigns the closest potion as the correct one.

		" Also in level 3, it is possible to restart the level at a checkpoint (only level where this is possible). After the checkpoint the new maximum HP is stored, which means it is possible to double-drink the big potion. This movie does not restart since it suffices for this category to leave the level 'clean' of potions. This applies also for RTA.

I re-enable it to play the guard kill and potion drink jingles, which is necessary to confirm kills, especially when the kill happens outside the screen (level 2 first guard, level 9 last guard).
