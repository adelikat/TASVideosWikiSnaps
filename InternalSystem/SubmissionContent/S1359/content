	"Wario Land II is the second game in the Wario Land series, although it's the first in without the "Mario Land" title attached. In it, you control Wario, who can get attacked by enemies to get powers by changing form - for example, you turn into a fireball when attacked by a fire enemy. Gameplay is fairly lighthearted, as Wario cannot die.

		" The delay at the group of two spiky enemies where I use the aforementioned glitch is because an attempt to move through them while they attack would result in Wario being knocked back.

	": This movie does not seem bad, but I think the game is not very suitable for TASing. The waiting in the beginning is the most obvious thing, but most of the game seems too straightforward. Very few possibilities to do something interesting, or something faster than just running forward.
