	"This is a game in which you control a spinning stick called the Helirin and must clear mazes without touching the walls. If you've never played the game, you may know the Helirin as a stick of an assist figure which appears on Super Smash Bros. Brawl. You can record the fastest time of each stage, but if you touch the wall, 3 seconds will be added in your timer. The main character is a blue bird named Kururin. Kururin's brothers and sisters got lost in out of their country and Kururin has to save them. There are ten countries and each of them has 3 stages.

	"I chose a long stick and brute-forcing strategies. It makes us a little bit bored if I wait until the Helirin come to go through a narrow path without taking damage. Also the brute-forcing strategies allow using some shortcuts. After bumping the wall, the Helirin will be invincible, and will be allowed to bump the wall without taking damage for a short time. As for the hard thing when I was making this movie, since the Helirin's reaction after the bump was unpredictable, I had to test the way to bump the walls everywhere.

	": What a very interesting puzzle game, and strangely hypnotic to watch. I enjoyed it quite a bit, and it seems other people did to, so this is an easy accept. For what it's worth, I also think that this category (takes damage to save real time) is the best category for the game, as both in-game and no damage runs would produce longer waiting periods. Anyway, congratulations Ryuto!
