	"Your run's execution is very good, but it seems there is an issue with how similar this game is to the NES version. We usually allow ports to different platforms, but not when they are direct copies of one other (like those modern games for currently "competing" consoles). Slight differences would justify publishing 
	[em 
		"versions
	]em
	" of a game, but when there's (little to) no difference, people simply feel the original version is the only one they want TASed, because the runs would look identical, presenting very little unique content (if any). The case for this game is that it's actually the NES ROM being emulated, with some additions that don't affect TASing (at least those official tweaks that we know of). The NES version is the one that was TASed to death throughout all these years, so it's hardly possible to compete with the existing records in it.

	"This game is so similar to the NES version that I consider runs of it branches of the latter. If there were more unique content presented here (by playing different modes maybe), it might have gotten better feedback, but for this run, I'm rejecting it.
