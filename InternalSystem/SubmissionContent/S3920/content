[p 
	"Low gravity? Try flying, bitch. Star Man dies quicker than the passengers on the

[h4 
	" Gravity Man
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Poor, poor, Gravity Man. He loses his one niche in the boss battle, which is being able to avoid Mega Man. Now Mega Man is all up in Gravity Man's asshole and Gravity Man can't do anything about it. Woot
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Gyro Man
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Gyro Man doesn't really have an advantage over Mega Man anyway because Gravity Hold hits everywhere. Gyro Man is a pussbucket.

[h4 
	" Crystal Man
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Crystal Man's level has dropping crystals. Mega Man flies over every one of them. Crystal is a girl's name. Crystal Man makes no sense.
	$LF

[h4 
	" Napalm Man
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The Crystal Eye is a really crappy weapon so fighting Napalm Man is annoying. Not because of Napalm Man, he's a wimp. 
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Stone Man
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Stone Man must really be Stoned, Man because he's jumping around like Barney the Dinosaur. Mega Man doesn't have the time for stupid children's programming so he stuffs some Napalm Bombs in Stone Man's vagina. Bam.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Charge Man
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Like Napalm Man, Charge Man's weakness is crappy so fighting him's a bit difficult. But we still defeat him without damage. BITCH.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Wave Man
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Since sliding is banned, so is the Charge Kick. We mow down Wave Man with our good old Mega Buster.

	" Wily 1
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Wily is up to his old tricks. Because the boss doesn't open his eyes because he doesn't like a face full of Crystal Eye unless you hit his platforms, he's not as slick as we would've hoped.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Wily 2
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"I switch the Gyro Attack to restore some energy for the loser boss. Mega Man doesn't have time to play shenanigans.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Wily 3
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Same as before, except we can't get instantly close to the boss, so that loses time, and we defeat Star Man with some Water Wave. I use the Mega Buster on Wave Man still, and Gravity Man now gets a buttload of charged shots to save Star Crash for the Wily Press. Bitch.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Oh yeah, the Wily Press dies too.
