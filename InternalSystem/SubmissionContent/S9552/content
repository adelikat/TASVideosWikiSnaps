	"Super Mario Bros. Star Scramble 2: Ghost Island (wow, that's a mouthful) is the third game (or second, honestly I'm not sure) of the Super Mario Bros. Star Scramble series of flash games. Just like the previous games, it follows the famous Mario, on his way to make "Ghost Island" completely devoid of ghost (which makes me question why it's called Ghost Island to begin with, but frankly, this description is starting to have way too many parentheses sections).
