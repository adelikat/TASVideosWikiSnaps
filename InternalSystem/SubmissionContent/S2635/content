	"Angry Fire Chozo is a hack of Super Metroid which is created by Deep_Space_Observer, released on May 05, 2009. It's really a nice hack, I have done an any% run of this so I decided to do a run with all items collecting!
	$LF
	"I found a very nice trick with Boost Ball and Bomb, this trick allow Samus to get through 1 solid block, and because of that, I can skip Phantoom and the escape in a different way.
