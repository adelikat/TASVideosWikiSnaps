	"This run completes the All Exits run of the Invictus ROM hack, which is the most competitive category on the leaderboards.  The hack itself is extremely well polished, and although a lot of the game is waiting for cycles or well disguised auto-scrollers where you wait for platforms it is possible to optimise triggering these platforms and so the run is over 3 minutes 10 seconds faster than the human record.  This is also my first ever TAS!  It was produced entirely via piano roll.

I can remove these inputs if prefered, it was just to give a smoother conclusion to the video for the audience as there is no exit from the credits sequence and I thought I should leave them in and it felt better to start-select out than just abruptly ending the movie.

In the section straight after I then manipulate the spawn time of the 3 fireballs and move right to trigger the double fireball wall.  However, because of how many sprites I still have loaded, the red shell prevents the bottom fireball from being spawned and I'm able to just ignore this obstacle.  In my draft IL video I just walk under the top fireball whilst staying on the snake as that's not intended to be possible but I've tried to make the section more interesting looking to a general audience who might not be familiar with the hack and what went on there.  At any rate, I then get to ignore the spring which sits on the lava as it was never activated and I do the section with a shell jump instead of a spring jump.

	"At the end of this level is my favourite troll in the hack.  The message box says it's a scrub test, daring the player to double yump.  If you succeed nothing looks wrong, but the floor actually turns to coins, killing anyone who fails.  I wanted to subvert this for the players so the goal was to find a way to double yump up through the floor after it becomes coins.  This also meant the platform you're meant to use becomes an extra obstacle, and to maintain 49 speed I could only drop the P-Switch - I couldn't throw it.  This was one of the harder jumps to get in the run, but I considered it player vengeance and taking the scrub test to a new level was fun.

There's no way to use it to bounce right sadly, and then shortly after that there's a section with a double bounce through.  This is very much not the intended method, you're supposed to keep bouncing on them as moving trampoline platforms.  Finding a set up that got me past the ceiling munchers, let me bounce once through to the second penguin and also have the second penguin spawn such that it's height and position actually allowed me to get over the final muncher was the single biggest time sink in this TAS.  I genuinely came to believe it might be impossible until I actually got it.  It's so smooth it actually looks easy in the final run, intended even, but this was hard.
