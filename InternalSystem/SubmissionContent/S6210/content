	": Looks like the same case as Coleco DK. The speed of barrels and enemies doesn't change, the speed they appear at is unclear due to incredible amounts of lag. The game counts loops ($033B), and freezing that counter doesn't lead to predictable changes. With information I was able to collect, the only difference this game TAS can give you is randomness (and lag). The rest seems to remain the same. Accepting to Vault.
