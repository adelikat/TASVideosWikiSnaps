	"-Game was pretty exhausting to record while playing the side-scrolling races frame-by-frame trying to find as fast as possible ways (to change the gear or not and when to let the engine cool down by slowing down a bit, this was required to take as less damage as possible). 0% damage seems to impossible on the side-view races, on hill climb you can't seem to finish without taking damage to the tyres. The rerecord count is low but don't judge this by that, watch it first :)

	"All kinds of feedback would be nice. After all I'm a beginner at these and I know that there are some flaws. So tell me (on the forums) that is this anything like it should be, is there any idea at making a re-run. Those qualifying rounds are just pretty hard to control because it scrolls pretty weirdly.
