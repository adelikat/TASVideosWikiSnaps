	"Too many good quotes that have to be skipped D: This whole level is pretty short just going to Cafde and leaving. No time wasted, no luck manipulation. That first jump over the big hand is just as annoying to TAS as it is real-time.

	"Kickass music. This level was really able to test my creativity. don't ever watch hentai. The arrows were a pain to navigate well, it's tough to visualize which way to go, but I couldn't find a better route. Pheenoh was an easy fight, no luck involved. I spent 4 frames to get the mzxrules betaquest text on the screen, speed/entertainment trade-off.

	"I was really disappointed that I couldn't get the triforce, but it would waste several seconds, so I decided not to. So many parts of this I'm sad that they went through so fast. Like the nontrivial trivia. But that's just how RingRush is.

	"Only one part of enemy manipulation, didn't have to waste time for it either. Had to enter the password to get to Keeta, instead of that cybering whore Katee. (It's the only way to get there, so don't complain about using passwords to skip shit, I didn't skip shit). Holy shit that Keeta fight. Watching it in that video is crazy, as it usually lags like crazy. Full speed it looks pretty legit too.
