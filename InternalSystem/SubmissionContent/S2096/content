	"Kid Niki 3 (aka. Kaiketsu Yanchamaru 3 - Taiketsu! Zouringen) is the sequel to "Kid Niki", "Kid Niki 2". But it looks quite different from previous productions. You are a ninja who is a master of Bo-jutsu (stick art), and, you defeat enemies and get over obstacles with your staff.

	"I discovered a technique (glitch?) named "forward somersault", and I achieved significant improvement with this technique. The ninja usually can do a somersault only backward, but you can let him do a forward somersault by quick turning before doing a somersault. Furthermore, you can climb a vertical wall using forward somersault one after another.

	"The enemy drops an item which is determined randomly when you beat 5 enemies. A scroll makes the ninja invincible for a while, and it is very useful for TASing. I manipulated luck to obtain scrolls by watching internal random number. But it is not easy to predict the random number for a long period, because the random number is affected by the timing which enemies appear.
