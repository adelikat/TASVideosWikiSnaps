	"In this historically accurate game, you have to answer 15 questions in order to get a million dollars. Legend has it that Lord Philbin was the mastermind behind this infernal scheme, which was used to drain several million person-hours from dozens of countries by furnishing false hopes unto their citizens. It was also the basis for a film, Slumdog Millionaire, which didn't actually have anyone win money, because it was fiction. Lame.

	"The menus in this game are unusually slow. You can't move the cursor before it becomes visible, and there's a lag of two or three frames before you can press it again.
