	"In this historically accurate game, you have to answer 15 questions in order to get a million dollars. Legend has it that Lord Philbin was the mastermind behind this infernal scheme, which was used to drain several million person-hours from dozens of countries by furnishing false hopes unto their citizens. It was also the basis for a film, Slumdog Millionaire, which didn't actually have anyone win money, because it was fiction. Lame.
