	"For once again, a new run of Kung Fu that ends 55 frames faster than my last submission. A very small update, in fact the smallest update ever for this game. Knowing how to proceed ended up saving a few frames, and the time saved was mostly due to a change in precision. Even running through this game again didn't take very long this time around and the differences are hardly noticeable, but perfection is above anything else and that is why I have decided to submit this run; faster is better. :)
