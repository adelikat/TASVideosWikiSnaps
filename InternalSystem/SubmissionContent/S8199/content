	"This TAS finishes arcade mode with liu kang as he's the fastest character, he has above 50% dmg combos and he has a glitched special move to kill the game's boss, the only other character with that is JAX the exclusive of mk unchained, the PSP Port.

	"IMPROVEMENTS: better stages unlocked maybe, better rng for better stages and fights that have transitions and breakers on them, CPU GOES NUTS WITH THE BREAKER ON HIGHER DIFFICULTY.

	"i dont believe there are better characters in this game exceptif you account for jax in the PSP VERSION which isn't here and his combos seems to be worse tha liu kang, the only good thing about jax is the glitched speciual move he also has, normally you need the items to stun onaga and cause ok damage but liu kang and jax dont need the item to do it
