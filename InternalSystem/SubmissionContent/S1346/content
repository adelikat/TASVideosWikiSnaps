	"This is my TAS of Joe & Mac, which also happens to be my first attempt at recording a TAS (so please be constructive with any and all criticisms). I finished the game on the hardest level in 31:18, while taking no damage. While it certainly doesn't have an exceptionally polished look, it is fun to watch for the most part and was a great game to learn on for a beginner, since there are a total of 4 moves that can be done (2 attacks and 2 jumps). I chose this game before realizing that it was on the "games yet to be TASed" list, so I was happy I had some company in it's selection. I will complete a level by level info section a little later. I will also be trying to cut my time down to below 31 minutes, hopefully from some more exact level runs and slightly better boss optimization (and using any glitches, if any become known to me).
