This is used to leave the room and skip the cutscene. After getting the crest in the gas chamber, I lose time on purpose to let Richard die; with this technique, it is no longer necessary to get the serum.

	"In arukado's and Uroboros' original run, they used the box next to the serum to drop the knife and the first-aid kit. Since I don't need to go get the serum, I don't pass near a box. To free an inventory slot, I use the first-aid kit after being hit by the small plant. To free the other inventory slot, I drop the knife in the box in the garden house, as it appears to be the quickest to go to.
