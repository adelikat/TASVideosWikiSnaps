	"Clue is a fairly known board game. But I decide to take all of the detective work out of it. This submission is a 9 frame improvment over the last one. Also it includes the person who did it being my player itself. The hard part about this was finding the right combination because I think there's about 324 different options. This is my first submission to this site, and it won't be the last ;)
