		"The game sometimes lags: In 1 or 2 levels, this is due to the emulator (= The console) which drops a ton of frames, but on some other levels, this is because the game is very badly optimized.

Admittedly at first glance, it comes off as confusing but I believe it's just a matter of the game itself rather than the run. The routing and movement shows the care you took into it and audience likes it. Therefore...
