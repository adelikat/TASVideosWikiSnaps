	"Really not much to say about this one. We choose Bret because he is fast enough to do what we need done and he's the first wrestler you can choose so we don't waste frames menuing. Razor Ramon is the fastest character in the game for some reason, but Bret is adequate.

	"The AI is not very good in this game. When you're entering or exiting the ring they just sorta stand there and freeze. This lets us lure them outside and more or less stun lock them to a degree while waiting for their 10 count to happen.

	"Like Steel Cage Challenge, interacting with strikes or grapples costs frames, so we just kite them around and manip the counts so they can't do a thing against us.

	"Time is close to RTA by virtue of there only being so much time available to save. The main time saves other than frame perfect menuing involve running right for the first few fights (so the slower AI has shorter distance to move once we exit to start the count) and running left instead of walking left once the AI speeds up a few matches in.
