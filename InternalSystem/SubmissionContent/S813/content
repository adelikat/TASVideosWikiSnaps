	"This game has many pros and cons. The graphics and monster designs are excellent, but some of the level designs are some of the laziest I've seen. Also, the gameplay is somewhat screwy due to conflicts with the ground. Earnest has to jump a lot in order to avoid losing his momentum.

	"Earnest uses a whip to attack enemies and for hooking onto things jutting out from the ceiling in order to swing from them. Other one-level weapons are rocks, a ball+chain, and a hammer.

	"Unfortunately, this game suffers from some lag. I did my best to minimize it, but the whip is a very weak weapon, so attempts to kill larger things to reduce lag only worsens the situation.
