	"Turn on WIP1 Timing, Fake Mute workaround, and Sync to Sound CPU, and turn off Volume Envelope Height Reading and Left+Right/Up+Down. Alternatively, you can use Snes9x 1.43 WIP 1 dev version, but because this has no "Fake Mute" option, you will have to mute the sound for real by setting the sound playback rate to "No Sound".

		" Jumping through walls: Run left and quickly start jumping to the right, and you'll pass through doors and walls. This bug is very limited because it only works going to the right, and only in the same level that you get the gun. This bug is used to skip the long wait for your buddy to open a door, and is also used to glitch out the elevator to get it to the bottom floor faster.

		" Evading guards: Most guards are programmed to be impossible to get by without killing, but I evade them anyway, which in some places causes other guards who would be in my way to not spawn at all. One of the guards I go by is meant to be impossible to defeat or go past without doing a bunch of other stuff first to drop a green ball on his head, so that lets me skip a small part of the game to save time.
