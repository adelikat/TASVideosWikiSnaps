	"The US civil war was between the north and south, over the issue of slavery. The north wanted slavery abolished, and the south wanted to keep it. It was the bloodiest conflict on US soil ever, lasting 4 years and with over 600,000 deaths. North & South, meanwhile, is a NES game based on the war.

	"The North's armies are combined in the first move so they don't have to move as far. There are other battlefields than the bridge-and-river seen here, but it just so happens that the battlefields which can be reached quickly follow this design.

	"Battlefields can't be luck-manipulated, but an equally fast path that shows other types of battlefields would be interesting.
