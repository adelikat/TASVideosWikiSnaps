	"Also, notably being in Red Bar removes lag from a different jingle that plays when a move is super effective or not very effective. At face value, using a move with a shake animation is ~55 frames faster than a move with a flash animation. This drops to 27 frames for super effective shakes vs normal flashes and 10 frames faster for not very effective shakes vs normal flashes. However, the lag reduction from red bar makes a red bar NVE shake 26 frames faster than a normal flash animation, and a red bar super effective shake 34 frames faster. On top of this, the act of changing moves typically loses 7 frames, making shake animation moves of any kind at least 12 frames faster than flash animation moves for the purpose of this TAS (19 frames if you don't have to swap back to using the flash move). You also have to account for the length of a move name for exact timings, but that is not relevant to the decision making process.

Because we manipulate random number generation, we can manipulate these damage ranges to our liking.

After completing the Bill section, we then travel back to Cerulean City, Heal up at the center, and then proceed to beat Misty. The other timesave in this section was completing Misty after the Bill section. This is due to having no benefit from the Bubblebeam TM except for inventory filling.

	"In the original TAS and submission, this was not discussed but is a vital part of the TAS itself. The manipulation of the game corner was very specific to the TAS in order to obtain Hyper Beam, the most powerful Normal-type move in the original games. Butterfree is able to learn it, but at the cost of 5,500 coins. While you could sell items in order to achieve this number of coins and not go through the Slot Machine manipulation, you are only able to buy the coins in batches of 50 coins for 1,000 Pokedollars. There is a total of 280 you can obtain from NPC’s and pickup, but you would still need to buy 5,220 coins. This would require in total 104,400 Pokedollars just to buy the coins. This would be a significant amount of time wasted, and there are not enough items on the ground or able to be acquired at this point in the run in order to obtain that amount of money. Thus, manipulation of the Game Corner Slot Machines was required for the TAS.

Each slot machine in the game corner has an identifier, which is a number between 0 and 35. The slot machine with the ID matching the lucky number - 1 is the “lucky slot machine”. When you play at a slot machine, you have 3 different modes that you can be in when you play. The first is mode bad, which is losing yourself no matter how hard you try. The second is mode good, which is when you can win any of the mple prizes, aka any amount between 8-15 coins.

For consistency, I recorded my frame as I left the fly house, which was immediately following the slot machines section.

	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"Due to the changes to the early game, including the cut of Rare Candies, a drastic reroute of the entire run was required. This resulted in a slightly different route than the original, such as completing the Cerulean Rival before Misty as mentioned earlier. While this has a major impact in the early game, it has smaller but slightly more important impacts in the middle and end game menus and fights. For example, the timesave in the early game was a lot, but this was due to cutting out significant movement for rare candies and an optional trainer. This resulted in less power point items for the mid game, and thus required more planning of fights than the original TAS. Many of the split sections will, at times, save a couple hundred frames, then immediately lose those frames on the next section of the splits. This is because the timing of the menus was important to the run itself in order to optimize movement and the bag limit. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Another impact of this, as mentioned above briefly, was PP items collected in the run. In the run, we now collect 1 less Elixir that was blocked by a hiker, simply because we do not need it in the run. Psybeam benefits the run significantly to where the TAS can cut out an entire section costing roughly a minute, if not more of timesave. Throughout the rest of the run, PP items are more sporadically used until the final few gyms, where using them is extremely vital to finishing the penultimate section of the run.

	"Overall, these timesaves helped improve the TAS itself by 9,145 frames, bringing the time from 1:58:45 to 1:56:31 TAS Timing. In the future, there could be a fourth version of this TAS where Hyper Beam is not acquired, and healing and HP management would have to be routed out extensively prior to the beginning of the TAS. However, despite this extensive routing, it is believed that there could still be a net positive timesave from not obtaining Hyper Beam due to 9 minutes of the TAS itself being the Game Corner.
