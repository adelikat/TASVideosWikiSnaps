	"I am able to do stutter step if I press the opposite direction every 6 frames, usually only works on a cycle.  There is two types of stutter steppings, one which makes the spam noise and one that's quiet.  These don't really change Jumpman's movement speed at all, however it's very useful in RNG manipulation.  Whenever I have to manipulate enemy behavior, I can just stop doing the stutter, or even do stutter, to change RNG.
