	"Well, I completed a TAS of this game a while ago, and was reluctant to submit it due to the fact most TAS's of this nature reaches the next level of difficulty, while this one doesn't - I'll explain below.

	"The number of ships to kill before the black hole opens is determined by 0x0050. That value increases by 1 every 10,000 points, which can be interpreted as an increase in difficulty. Now the reason why I don't just stop the movie at fastest 5,000 points is because that would be destroying 2 death stars + destroy 3 green ships (worth 3,000 points). IMO that adds nothing new to the overall movie, so I don't do that.

	"That green dot has a timer at 0x004F which at zero causes it to become aggressive and fire at you. I found out that it's faster to shoot at the Death Star at the sides from an angle than up front. The orange dot only needs to be shot once for the stage to be over.
