	"The number of ships to kill before the black hole opens is determined by 0x0050. That value increases by 1 every 10,000 points, which can be interpreted as an increase in difficulty. Now the reason why I don't just stop the movie at fastest 5,000 points is because that would be destroying 2 death stars + destroy 3 green ships (worth 3,000 points). IMO that adds nothing new to the overall movie, so I don't do that.
