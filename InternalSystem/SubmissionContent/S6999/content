	"Saiyuuki world was my first publication on this site. It was mainly produced by fcxiaopengyou, I provided the route. Later, as I learned more about TAS, I started to rethink and remake it. For some reasons, fcxiaopengyou didn't have much time for production. This time we assigned part of the production process to NMP, a newcomer on this site. This TAS is not hard to produce. I also thanks for Memory classified it as Moons, that gave me the motivation to remake it.
