	"Shining Force II is a tactical RPG for the Mega Drive/Genesis, developed by Camelot Software Planning in 1994 and published by Sega.  Gameplay consists of two elements:  exploration and battles.  Exploration is essentially open world during the late game, allowing you to return back to previous maps to pick up missed treasure, recruit extra characters, and re-fight some battles. Battles take place on a square grid, and each unit occupies a single square. They consist of up to 12 player-controlled characters going against a group of CPU controlled monsters. The characters gain their own experience and levels. A battle ends when your leader is defeated or all enemies/boss enemy is dead.

	"A benevolent thief named Slade steals two jewels from an ancient shrine, unbeknownst to him that doing so will result in the resurrection of a powerful Devil King: Zeon. The game opens in a kingdom called Granseal where the main protagonist, Bowie, wakes up in the morning after a stormy night to attend school. During his attendance his teacher, Sir Astral, is summoned to King Granseal's bedside after he has fallen ill. Bowie and his friends sneak into the castle to follow their teacher where they learn a door to an ancient tower has been mysteriously opened. Astral invites Bowie and his force to investigate with him where the party is then ambushed by evil spirits (Gizmos). After disposing all but one Gizmo, it slips by and rushes towards King Granseal in an attempt to possess him but Sir Astral is able to thwart the attempt in the nick of time. The Gizmo escapes to the neighbouring Kingdom of Galam and successfully possesses their king.  Under the influence of the devil Zeon, King Galam declares war on Granseal. During Galam's invasion of Granseal, the princess is kidnapped.  Bowie and his Shining Force embark on a journey to stop Zeon's devil army, reclaim the jewels, save the princess, and obtain the legendary Holy Sword in order to defeat and reseal Zeon.

It was surprisingly faster to have the Galam Soldier hit Bowie with a single heavy critical attack and let the Huge Bat finish him off, rather than manipulate the Galam Soldier to attack and kill him with a double.  This is because it would have required a fairly high double attack roll and the only one capable of killing Bowie was several hundred frames away.

More powerful weapons could be bought here from the weapon shop, but they are incredibly expensive at this point in the game and you can't equip them with your unpromoted characters anyways.

I also had to manipulate Kazin's stat gains so he wouldn't receive +2 AGI when he leveled up because he'd have to do this same maneuver again in the next battle.  Kazin is used to simply nuke down those 3 enemies and the rest is left to Bowie to maximize his XP gain.  Everyone else is killed off to save time.  Unfortunately, I had to lure the last enemy to a 15% Land Effect tile so Bowie could finish it off and gain another +2 ATT level up which burnt some time.
