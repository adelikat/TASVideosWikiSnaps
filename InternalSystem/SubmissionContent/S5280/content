Moreover, it's so basic that it doesn't feel like a different category run when you avoid it, it's just a speed-entertainment trade off. Indeed, both runs look identical except for the parts where the glitch is avoided, which adds some couple of minutes of gameplay. But it's still basically the same contents, unlike in games that allow different characters or different amount of them, where each option has unique elements not present in counterpart runs. Then we publish two comparable runs alongside each other, instead of having one that's dramatically faster and one that offers more gameplay.
