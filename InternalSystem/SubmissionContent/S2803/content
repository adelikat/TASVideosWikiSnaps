	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This run cancels missions, with means it uses "warps" to get to the final stages since the beginning, this is the route used:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-Intro Stage (Golem)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-Disposal Center (Aztec Falcon)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-Find Shuttle (Escaped)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-Duel in Desert (Escaped)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-Defend the Base 2 (Hanumachine)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-Neo Arcadia Shrine (Herculious Anchortus)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-Neo Arcadia Tower (Rainbow Devil)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-Neo Arcadia Core (Copy-X)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Note: To do the "Warp" you must escape the Find Shuttle mission, wich then unlocks Dual in Desert mision, if you escape in said mission the base will get attacked, thus unlocking the Defend the Base 2 mission without any choice.

	$LF

[p 
	"Since this run is done using "Warps", the only weapons being used are the Z-Buster and the Z-Saber.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The Z-Saber was leveled up to get the Triple Slash and the Air Rolling Slash, the latter is a must in this run, because how quick it can do some bosses, to get such technique Zero needs to Air slash 100 enemies.

[p 
	"There are 2 improvements in the whole run, one of them is on the Neo Arcadia Shrine mission, I found that it's possible to skip one of the temples, the one that has invincible enemies by climbing the wall. Unfortunatelly, if you skip the other temples with the bosses, you can't beat the game at the end, since the first door of Neo Arcadia Core won't open.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The other improvement is, the Harpuia fight, I found a faster way to beat him, wich is getting hit in the air while he is falling.
