If you want to improve this TAS you would just have to do more outlandish stuff Probably in under 5 minutes still. and that is about it for the stuff you could do to improve the TAS. I would like to thank LightBlue (Ray) 2222 on YouTube for Doing The Sand Challenge on the Atari 5200 version of Digdug inspiring me to try doing it on the Famicom version and eventually to make this TAS. That is all I have.
