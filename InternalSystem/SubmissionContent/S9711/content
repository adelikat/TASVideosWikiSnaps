	"The Simple Series is a long running franchise by D3 publisher where the games have a basic name to convey the general idea of what they're about. They're usually original budget titles, though some are just rereleases or ports of existing games. The Simple 1500 Jitsuyou Series, which can be roughly translated as the Simple 1500 Practical Series, are less games and more multimedia experiences and life help software whose goal is to provide information with the power of the Playstation before the internet was more widely used.

	"Simple 1500 Jitsuyou Series Vol.04: Ryouri: Teiban Ryouri Recipe-shuu is essentially a recipe book and cooking tips application software for your Playstation. There's 30 recipes across 3 categories: Chinese, Japanese, and Western (US and European) dishes. Each recipe also has snippets of video showing some of the preparation and cooking process to show how to perform some of the techniques needed to cook some of the food. There's also information on the ingredients used and proper food handling and cooking techniques. Most relevant for this TAS is a quiz where you're tasked on picking the right ingredients needed for a given recipe, although you're free to retry and reference the disc's contents until you get it right. This TAS aims to complete the 10 given recipe ingredient requests in record time.

	" I should make my own entry for the event. Since it's not a competition and I've seen hosts of other types of jams enter their own, I didn't see why I shouldn't join it as well. Of course, I would choose something completely unexpected and choose something that definitely stretches the definition of "video game". It absolutely fits "multimedia experience" at least even if it's pretty barebones due to the budget compared to 90s interactive dictionaries and such.

However, I tested the frames after the first possible one and every time the time losses got a lot worse despite having faster recipes to input. I have no idea why that's the case but in any case this makes the first possible frame the fastest by virtue of less loading regardless of any RNG going on.
