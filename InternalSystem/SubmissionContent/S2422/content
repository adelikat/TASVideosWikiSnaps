	"Alright, another dear game to me has been TASed. I loved playing this game when I was younger but I never managed to finish it. But thats a different story today. At first I tried using two players but for some reason, my keyboard wouldnt co-operate with me. After error1 confirmed my thought that using two players causes the enemies to have more HP, I concluded that it would be faster and less lag involved by using one player. That being the case, I am quite satisfied with how this run ended. In my opinion, killing bosses certainly didnt take that awfully long to deal with as one player. Initially, I thought lag and eliminating enemies & bosses would take forever using one player but I am glad I was more or less wrong (I am sure there are some instances where using two players is faster).

	"An important information about the game is that it uses checkpoints in each area. These checkpoints are obviously the enemies. Therefore you might notice and wonder "why didn't he kill that enemy faster?" Its because I don't have to worry about that, because I've already dealt with the checkpoint and can meanwhile have a bit fun by shanking nazis :)

	"Maybe a less important information is about the weaponry. Shotgun and Super Grenade seem to be strongest weapons, though I don't know for sure which one of them is the strongest (doesnt really matter much as I never had the difficulty of chosing between them in a mission as they never bumped into each other).

	" I sacrified a few frames by getting fat. This mission is much longer and harder compared with mission 1 and 2.

		"Mission 4
	]b
	" Ironically, I anticipated that with each level, it would get tougher but mission 4 was quite possibly the easiest stage of them all. Got fat again though this time I barely lost frames.

		"Mission 5
	]b
	" The hardest mission of them all. Soooooooooooo many minibosses. Don't know what to say other than I really utilized every weapon I could collect.

		"Mission 6
	]b
	" Final mission! I sat almost half a day trying to manipulate the aliens to give me a Shotgun but they wouldnt :( They gave me everyhing (= a chicken, letter, pig, Dropshot, Heavy machine gun, Lasergun, Enemy Chaser, Rocket Launcher) besides Shotgun or Super Grenade.

	": There were a lot of responses that better goals could have been chosen for a TAS of this game, mainly suggesting that the TAS should be done on the hardest difficulty, and that it should be a 2-player TAS. The people suggesting this however added that they were really entertained by this TAS. There are two options: reject this TAS and wait for a new TAS which has different goals (this could take a very long time), or accept it and have a very enjoyable Metal Slug TAS on the site in the mean-time. The opinions in the discussion thread seem to agree on this; publish this movie. A new TAS of this game which plays on the hardest difficulty and uses 2 players will very likely obsolete this movie for having better goals, but for now we can all enjoy this highly entertaining TAS. Accepting.
