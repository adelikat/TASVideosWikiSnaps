	"It’s finally here people, the third and possibly final version of the Oddworld: Abe’s Oddysee 100% TAS created by me, Samtastic and Dooty! This run is 
	(frames|amount= 7723)
	" than the current published run due to new tricks and starts! This is also based on a failed TAS that Dooty almost finished last year, but he got stuck at the Boardroom due to a missing ring. Last week, I figured out a way to get the missing ring to show up. Instead of loading and saving, I just simply reset the screen. This resulted in the memory corruption fixing the memory and the missing ring that was missing in Zulag 1 finally appeared! So I took Dooty’s failed movie and matched it as accurately as I could.  I was originally trying to match this run on PSXHawk but it was very difficult manipulating some Slogs. Once I figured out the quickest way to fix the ring, it was easier for me to just simply go back to the failed 100% run and fix it. If anyone can get this movie synced on PSXHawk with a conversion, then feel free to replace this movie with a bk2. Every rescue has been improved over the published run, thanks to some new tricks and glitches which include the multiple backwards jump and the quick bird portal closure glitch. Also, Dooty has found most of the new ways that the Death Delay Glitch (DDG) can be used to save time.

	"I would like to thank everyone who has helped us finding new tricks and glitches to make our TASes improvable! Without Shunpuk and Yaritania, the improvements would never been done. I hope you’ll all look forward to a TAS of Abe’s Exoddus Maximum Casualties, which I will hopefully get done next year.
