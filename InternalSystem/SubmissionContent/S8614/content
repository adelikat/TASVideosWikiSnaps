		"DESCRIPTION:

	" I decided after finishing K.O.L.M. 2 that I wanted to do another jmtb02 game, seeing as how he's one of my favorite Flash developers and probably one of the best of all time; I was originally going to do Give Up 2, but I put that one on the backburner early in production after it turned out that recording it was really, REALLY boring, so I then picked TITOL2 as a relatively short but still entertaining subject.

	[em 
		"not

	" RTA, but rather using In-Game-Time, and use of pause abuse features heavily in reducing the IGT by as much as possible. However, doing this also absolutely BALLOONS the RTA time, and such a strategy is thus not suitable for TASVideos' Standard category; even 'RTA' runs (put off in a separate subcategory in speedrunning.com) don't use actual RTA but simply ban the use of pausing, thus still not counting the meta section where you control the elephant in the main menu. Since the pause glitch is largely unhelpful in decreasing framecount, I only used it in Stage 7 to regain early control of the elephant, thus allowing me to immediately jump back in the pipe; normally this Stage actually has a deliberately increased delay before control is gained to prevent exactly this, but pausing at the right time bypasses it. Besides this, gaining early control of the elephant only gives tiny speed benefits, as holding right carelessly will simply run you into the vertical spikes right next to the spawn pipe, and many routes dictated by the Stage gimmicks totally obviate the benefit anyways, which is already in "shaving individual frames" territory. As one final punchline, despite not using the pause abuse glitch to shave down the IGT, my IGT is 
	[em 
		"still
	]em
	" faster than the human WR on account of better execution.
