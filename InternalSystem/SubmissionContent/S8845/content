	"Since this is essentially a survival game, optimisation is trivial. We don't even have to be at the top of the screen to end the level faster, as they're all on a global timer. All we have to do is survive. One random footnote I can add is that spaceships can only spawn in a window of 16 frames between each other.

	"Level 5 is where it gets interesting. It's supposed to be impossible to beat due to the level glitching up and generating invisible walls that can't be cleared. But by holding right as soon as the level starts, we can "complete" it in the blink of an eye as the game warps back to Level 1. Input ends on frame 16628.
