	"Note: This TAS uses the Debug Version of Ocarina of Time, specifically, NOT the Master Quest debug version, commonly known as "ZELOOTD." Also, if anyone actually encodes this, you should end the encode on frame 6891 to ensure the full ending plays out for the appropriate amount of time.

	"This is my TAS of the Vanilla Debug Version of Ocarina of Time. I decided to make it after homerfunky posted his TAS of the MQ Debug rom, which will probably just get obsoleted by someone in the future because I used a faster strategy to load the credits using the 2nd controller to load the map select from the game's boot sequence.

	"How does this TAS work exactly? Well, I would first suggest reading about some of the basic features of Ocarina of Time Debugging roms from the TCRF MQ Debug Rom page:

	"The main thing used in this TAS is the map select feature, which allows you to load any map in the game with whatever scene value is desired. It can be access either by loading file 1 from the file select menu, or by inputting Z, L, & R from the first controller while the 2nd controller is plugged in. The sequence of inputs I made jumps to Temple of Time's map with L to avoid the timeloss from using the D-pad to navigate the menu, and then Z is used to transition to the 01 credits scene for Temple of Time, while B is used to make link adult for the sake of watching the credits in an unintended way. C-presses are also used to play around with the OPT value so that the TAS takes advantage of the input frames that Z isn't being pressed on.
