	"One goal that can be taken as a (sane) completion of this game is to get a "Perfect MAX". Each level has a "difficulty" from 1 to 13 (MAX), and if you get Perfect (get all rings) on a MAX level, you unlock a special completion scene which is the best scene you can get in this game. So the goal is simply to choose a MAX level, and complete it "Perfect" as fast as possible.

	"Note that, without passwords, this game is utterly boring. The first MAX level is 164, which requires playing at least 19 levels to get there (16 of which are perfect) and each of them alone takes far longer to complete than the level you see in this TAS. Whereas you can access all kinds of unique levels directly using passwords. Basically, I justify the use of passwords by:
