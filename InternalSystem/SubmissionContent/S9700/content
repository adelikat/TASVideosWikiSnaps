	"Another oldie but goodie from the Amiga/DOS collection. This one is an extremely hard game to master, with a diversity of weapons, movements, attacks and parries. Although the game offers many modes where you can train your 4 weapons, the point is to participate in, and win, the Budokan tournament. 
	$LF
	"The tournament consists of 12 battles of somewhat increasing difficulty.

	"The CPU is horribly treacherous and won't hesitate to react based on input reads, even before your character has even moved. Some characters use very deadly weapons (to which you have no access) that wouldn't be kosher in any legal combat competition.

	"In this movie I try to beat the opponents as fast as possible while not getting hit even once. It is very possible to beat this game faster is you go all out and get hit, but I thought that wouldn't look nice. This movie showcases a perfect domination of the opponents using as many movements as possible.
