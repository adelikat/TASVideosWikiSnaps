	"There isn't that much to say about the run. It turns out that controlling jump height and not bonking your head allows much more efficient travel through the narrow corridors, which is the primary imrpovement here. Otherwise AngerFist's route and boss strategies remain mostly unchanged, except for the last boss whose behaviour seemed more laggy and took a few extra frames to kill. Also the SMS pause trick is not applicable to this game.
