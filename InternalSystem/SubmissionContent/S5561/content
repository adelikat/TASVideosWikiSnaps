	"I improve AngerFist's Kung Fu Kid run by several seconds primarily due to imrpoved control over jumping. The game is a fairly simple platformer but does have some interesting bosses.

	"There isn't that much to say about the run. It turns out that controlling jump height and not bonking your head allows much more efficient travel through the narrow corridors, which is the primary imrpovement here. Otherwise AngerFist's route and boss strategies remain mostly unchanged, except for the last boss whose behaviour seemed more laggy and took a few extra frames to kill. Also the SMS pause trick is not applicable to this game.

	"My main motivation for doing this improvement is to try and update some of the older runs on outdated emulators, to make them more accessible.

	": This run has slight improvements over the previous publication even if the frame count is higher. The included BIOS makes this run 494 frames slower than it would be without BIOS. Great job updating the run to a newer emulator while also improving on it.
