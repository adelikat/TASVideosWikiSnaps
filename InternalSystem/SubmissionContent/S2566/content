		"IGN’s top 100 games of all time.
	]a
	" The game consists of up to 12 player-controlled characters going against a group of CPU controlled monsters.  The characters gain their own experience and levels. Each battle is fought, and ends when all enemies or a boss enemy is dead.  I will be discussing the game in ‘halves;’ as the tempo of the TAS changes dramatically after battle 25. During first half of the game, 14 of the 25 battles require that you kill all enemies to proceed. During the second half, all battles rely on ‘boss sniping,’ or going after the single enemy that will end the battle.

[p 
	"This run was my first run that I can say was completely reliant on Lua. After my most recent WIP, I realized it had been ages since I had actually even looked at the RAM Watch window sitting open, dusty, and abandoned next to my Gens window. The way the RNG had to be manipulated (see RNG manipulation) required a guess/check methodology. However, since going through each iteration by hand would be near impossible, I had Lua do the leg work. My work consisted of using 7 Lua scripts to do all of the grunt work and calculations, which I will describe below. The scripts made TASing the game entertaining and fun, as opposed to grunt work. Don't be thrown off by the rerecord count - Lua did the majority of rerecords.

	"The RNG of SF2 is a 16-bit sequential loop. It can only change for one of three conditions: A call for a random value, a text box pause, or sitting in a menu. For the two ones that can be manipulated, the RNG advances one step per frame. To cycle through all 65,536 values of the RNG would take 
	[b 
		"18 minutes!
	]b
	" Additionally, this also means I only get 1 chance to access the RNG per-character turn, which limits my ability to manipulate the enemy movements, attacks, and etc. While most worthwhile attacks/rounds are available within the first 60 frames, there are a few waits that are a few hundred frames long, unfortunately. I did my best to minimize wait time in menus.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The single most important factor to making this run is attack power. For the majority of characters, 1 attack is the most they can gain per level. The three characters used in the run all have the ability to gain more attack, +2 for Bowie and Slade, and +3 for Peter.  However, these values are rare for the early, unpromoted levels (~10-20% for Peter and Bowie). Unfortunately, this system also means that quite a few enemies must be killed that otherwise wouldn’t be obstacles to the boss sniping. Also, as a side note, this system is ridiculous for a TAS. If you figure that +2 for Bowie and Slade is essentially gaining 100% more attack, then every +2 you get is like gaining two levels. Luckily, the game does not change the probability based on your current attack. This makes for an absurd amount of attack for Peter at the end of the game.

[p 
	"This introduces the idea of 
	[b 
		"Priming

	". Since we only have 1 access to the RNG, it can be extremely difficult to manipulate both a double attack and an optimal level gain. So, most of the early game is spent attacking enemies twice. This primes the enemy to give one of the main characters the chance to do a maximum level gain. You will notice a ton of priming in the first half of the game.
