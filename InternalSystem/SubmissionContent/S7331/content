Interestingly, if we hold the wrench button during the final 3 frames of a wrench animation we can force the game to wrench again the first possible frame, which we call a buffered wrench. This is only possible when we start a grounded wrench swing (be it actually on the ground or by canceling a stomp or downwards recoil shot). While this allows us to get a slightly faster wrench frequency, it prevents us from shooting on the first frame of a wrench swing (since Robin is never in her idle animation and therefore is never in a state that allows her to shoot). Due to this, we cannot use buffered wrench swings for any kind of wrench shot.

	"There are three major variables that control the behavior of our gun, those being the fire rate limit, the heat meter, and the current charge level.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Heat meter increases when shooting a bomb, any charged shot, or a Usurper Shot. It starts with a value of 0 and those shots cause it to increase. Both bombs and charged shots set it directly to 1000, while a single Usurper Shot increases whatever its current value is by 293. If this value is greater or equal to 1000, the game sets the value back equal to 1000, our weapon status gets set to “overheat” and renders the red bar on top of Robin’s head. While overheated, no shot will be released or buffered if we press the shoot button. Once cooldown hits 0, the weapon is no longer overheated. If the heat value is less than 1000 but more than 0 and the gun is not overheated, the game draws a yellow bar instead and decreases the counter per frame based on a value called cooldown rate.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Interestingly, while the cooldown rate from a charged shot is always the same regardless of the weapon shot or the currently equipped one, cooldown for a non charged shot is determined by the currently equipped shot, and bombs have a much higher cooldown (15 per frame) than either Stun Gun or Usurper Shot (5 and 7 respectively). As such, quickly switching to bombs after shooting an Usuper Shot allows us to get a much faster cooldown rate, which in turn allows to shoot more Usurper Shots before reaching the overheat threshold.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Fire Rate Limit is set by both uncharged Stun Gun and uncharged Usurper shot when shot, to 8 and 16 respectively. If this value is greater than 0, it decreases every frame until it gets back to 0. When attempting to shoot either gun again, the game checks if this value is greater than 0. If it isn’t, the shot is instantly released. If it is, the shot is queued and instantly released in the first frame where said value is less or equal to 0. This effectively gives us a buffer system for both guns.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Notably, bombs completely bypass Fire Rate Limit: they don’t set it when shot (it would be redundant anyway since they also trigger overheat) and they can be shot even if it’s greater than 0.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Charge is set to 10 whenever the shoot button is pressed, increases by 1 every frame while it is held, and resets back to 0 when released. If this value hits 45 or greater and the button is released, Robin will shoot a charged shot for her currently equipped weapon. Also, a unique interaction with the cooldown system exists: while the weapon can be charged during gun cooldown, if charge is equal or greater to 35 when cooldown reaches 0, charge is set back to 0. This is the foundation of Quick Charge: by starting the hold during the 34 final frames of cooldown, we can keep our charge and release a new charged shot just 11 frames after cooldown from the previous one ended.

We’re introduced to her early and she is one of the characters helping Robin along the game. The game has several sections that allow us to play as Mina, but due to major skips, we can forgo most of them in a full game movie. As Boss Rush contains three bosses that must be fought as Mina, we will introduce her mechanics and what makes her different from Robin in terms of gameplay.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Most of Mina’s movement values are similar to Robin’s, but she has a different set of options for combat and movement. First, Mina can slide along a floor by pressing down+jump on any frame as long as she’s on solid ground. This gives a substantial speed boost, and the final frames as she gets up can be interrupted by jumping or any other action.

We can adjust the angle by pressing left or right, and she can start aiming at a specific direction if we’re holding said direction when pressing the shoot button for the first time. Her shotgun deals high damage, but has a particularly long endlag animation as she reloads the shotgun. Furthermore, she cannot shoot while in midair (but she can be made to if she falls off a ledge while aiming). Mina’s shotgun provides no movement options, unlike Robin’s gun.

[div class=p 
	"Kerthunk works in three different phases. Phase 1 involves waiting for its tail to attack and grabbing it via our wrench, holding it in place so Mina can shoot its weak point with her shotgun. Mina will always run away from Kerthunk once Robin has wrenched it in order to position herself for her shot, and since she also lazily follows Robin, we manip Mina to be as close as possible to her final position so she shoots faster. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"After each of those attacks, Kerthunk will release five Coptrollers to attack Robin. We manipulate RNG to spawn them all in a single cluster, allowing Robin to destroy them all with a single charged shot. This is faster as Kerthunk will not perform his next attack as long as at least 1 Coptroller is still around. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"After repeating this sequence three times and depleting his first life bar, Kerthunk enters Phase 2. During it, it tries to push the main platform upwards, requiring Robin and Mina to crouch in order to avoid the vines and their thorns at the top of the room. We release a bomb early to deal damage as soon as possible, then spam shots from Stun Gun. We cannot use Usurper Shots for this phase, as they collide with the floor and therefore don’t reach Kerthunk. Finally, we use our downtime to shoot a second bomb and enter Kerthunk’s final HP bar and final phase.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Final Phase reacts differently depending on whether or not we reach it while the platform is going downwards or not. We time it exactly to ensure Kerthunk will launch the platform once more, then set up for a quick kill using a bomb and a missile. We barely have enough vertical room to release the missile, and we must force Robin to recoil down, otherwise she gets hit by the thorns. While this strat is not as fast as killing Kerthunk using some regular charged shots from the Stun Gun, it is only possible in a Boss Rush setting and I decided to showcase it for that specific reason (in normal gameplay, you obtain bombs some time after defeating Kerthunk).

In order to tag between both, we can get to the door at the center of the room and tag between them. This action, interestingly, does not cancel the characters’ momentum when they start the tag. As such, we can yeet Robin or Mina away from the tag door simply by having any momentum in the direction opposite to the door. Amplifying this, we can jump the same frame we start the tag, both gaining vertical momentum and helping preserve our horizontal speed. With this oversight in hand and a healthy dose of RNG manipulation to ensure the hands don’t get in our way, we make quick work of Phase 1.

Once that section is fully destroyed, we jump in front of Gerrie and spam wrenches. Interestingly, wrench spins damage the sides just as much as the wrench swing itself does, making them faster than buffered wrench swings for this part. Additionally, Robin’s position is close enough to Gerrie to not get hit by his shot, while also not taking damage from touching his armor.

	"Phase 2, against the pulsating brain, requires us to shoot towards it. We therefore must stay in midair for as long as possible while avoiding whatever it throws on its way. Even the small flowers that fall from the sky deal damage, so we carefully move around all of them. We make use of the short time period in which the platform has not started moving up yet to position ourselves under the Beast and shoot more shots, and after the platform is moving we simply jump in and out of the platform, dealing damage as we move. We can then finish the battle with a missile.

	"Second to last boss, Starworm’s battle resembles the one seen in full game runs. We manipulate for an extremely favorable attack pattern, allowing us to trigger the eye cover in just two cycles. Abusing the multihit properties of Usurper shot we can cause heavy damage with few shots, and thanks to a good RNG seed, we can finish it off with a single missile.

	"Lucas Birbasaurus Rex, the final boss of the game. Birdman’s patterns are quite random and as such, we shoot and hit him at specific frames to obtain the most favorable patterns possible. While in the past, jump patterns were considered slow, he takes a lot of damage from Usurper shots while moving up, so this is a desirable pattern. We must also be aware of our position as some of his attacks have frames where no shot will naturally hit him, which would slow things down.

	". Prior to the development of this movie, no quick way of getting rid of the rocks was known, but this movie shows that it is possible to use a single bomb to break all the rocks at once, tying the speed of a charge shot for all silver rocks in a full game run. This might have further implications for the full game run as well, since it would allow runners to forgo hugging Polro while also dealing damage to Birdman faster. The rest of the battle is a matter of balancing optimal damage output and RNG manipulation for favorable attacks.
