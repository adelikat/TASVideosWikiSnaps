	"One thing I discovered recently is Vick Skip. In "Chase Through the Sewer", there is a cutscene where Shocker tells a thug "It's time to stop that freak! Vick, make it happen!" Vick breaks off the valve and causes water to flow through the pipe which Spider-Man needs to go through, so you have to take out the thug with the valve (Vick) first and shut off the water.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"I found a way to go through the pipe even while water blasts out, but doing so prevents the player from grabbing Advanced Web Gloves, which are extremely necessary for the run. So Vick Skip is mainly useful in Cheat%, where the player has all the upgrades from the get-go. It would save around 20 seconds.

[div class=p 
	"I use a partial Vick Skip to enter the pipe AS the water is shutting off, so it saves only 2 or 3 seconds here.
