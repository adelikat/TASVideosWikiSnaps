	": Hello RewordGrey and welcome to TASVideos. Here at TASVideos we aim for movies that aim for perfection and take advantage of all that is known about a game. Your movie does not use the well known flag pole glitch at the end of 1-1 and loses time to the 
	[a class=intlink href=/1715M 
		"currently published TAS
	]a
	" as a result. Not having time is not a valid excuse when making submissions to TASVideos, because we are TASing, we can spend as long as we want on our projects. Please read the 
	(__wikiLink|/SubmissionInstructions|Submission Instructions)
	" and 
	(__wikiLink|/MovieRules|Movie Rules)
