	"GG Aleste II, released as Power Strike II in Europe (not to be mistaken for the SMS game Power Strike II), is a 1993 Game Gear shoot 'em up game developed by Compile and published by Sega. One of Earth's armored defensive satellites, Algo, has an unknown object attached to it. Pilot Alice Pfeiffer Wizn is alerted to the threat and heads off in the prototype Aleste ship Lance Bird. The game plays like the earlier Aleste games though the length is a more manageable 20-25 minutes for a 1 credit clear rather than the other games having a Zanac length of completion time.

	"I got interested by this game when M2's Aleste Collection was announced with a new Game Gear game included, GG Aleste 3. While I haven't got my hands on the collection myself I did try out the older games that were part of the collection. GG Aleste II is probably my favorite of the older games since it's very fast paced and fun to play for the entire game's length. The fact that the Aleste Collection also has a speed run mode for the older games means that there are some videos out and replays out there that I can compare a TAS to in terms of how much the time can potentially be pushed. I will note that this submission goes with the Power Strike II name as the default region coding for BizHawk goes with the European region settings.

Thus I can only work with whatever 1 credit clear videos for Mania mode are out there done on the Aleste Collection version of GG Aleste II. I cannot guarantee that I do have a time that beats all known records as that would involve having to buy the same game three times to check their individual leaderboards. That being said for the

The first one is one where input polling is technically lost but is compensated by taking the input of the next frame and using it in place of the lost input.
