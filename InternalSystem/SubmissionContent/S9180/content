	"I have been looking at this game for a while and I finally decided to sit down and figure it out here recently. When I did, I was surprised how complicated the game mechanics are, over other bowling games of the 8-bit era. After doing two rounds, I discovered the way this game operated. All you need it two different plans of attack and you can replicate that throughout the entire game.

	"The movie completes the game with a perfect score (equivalent to goal: 100%) and does so as fast as possible. That is, all throws go full power, except for the last which releases the ball early. This still achieves a 300 score but with an earlier input. This last input leads to a query screen where you are asked whether you'd like to print the score sheet. If you say 'N', you are taken to a screen with bigger sheet. One would normally consider this screen the real end of the game and therefore any submission should, in principle, include the 'N' input. However, the authors (and others in staff) have manifested a preference towards allowing such input be passed as a post-movie input (for encode only) and preserve the entertaining value and ingenuity of the last slow throw. I agree with this.
