	"Memory: After the previous Rambo submission was made, I took a look and found a way to cancel damage knockback, proving quite a bit of time was possible to be saved through taking damage. Additionally I found other improvements not necessarily related, such as optimizing turning around at wall clip screen transitions, talking to a prisoner while in a wall, and other various small improvements. As a result, nearly 16 seconds were shaved off.

	"Dave_dfwm:  Most of the noticeable instances of take-damage-to-save-time come from a few select water scenes, one screen in the cave where Rambo didn't have to wait for a pit snake, and the screen in the warehouse where the key is found.  Note that Memory uses potions at the edge of the screen, again to prevent delays from item switching.  In the screen where Rambo talks to the POW for the second time (right before the end of the game), you can listen carefully for a high-pitched musical note that isn't supposed to be there.  This happens sometimes in gameplay.
