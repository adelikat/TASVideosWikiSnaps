	"This is a TAS of FDS Super Mario Bros. 2, specifically of the letter worlds. You can play the secret letter worlds after getting 8 stars on the title screen, and you can access them by pressing A+Start on the controller at the title screen--as such, getting 8 stars is required before being able to play the movie, which means this TAS starts with an unclean SRAM state. This means a verification movie is required, which can be found here:

	"During the creation of this TAS, I investigated the possibility of big Mario being faster than small, as big Mario can perform crouch clips in B-4 and D-4, and bullet bill glitch in D-3 to save a significant amount of the time lost getting the mushroom. However, the small Mario TAS ended up being 26 frames faster, so I went with that route instead.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"I also investigated timesave in D-4, as this TAS loses many frames throughout the level in order to get a good Bowser pattern in the last room. However, I couldn't manipulate Bowser's pattern, or go fast enough to get another good pattern, so unfortunately, unless a new framerule save is found, this D-4 is as good as I could get. However, this D-4 is still 4 frames faster than the D-4 in my old TAS, so it is still an improvement overall.

	[b 
		"Flagpole Glitch (FPG):
	]b
	" Used in B-1, B-2, B-3, D-2, and D-3. By clipping into the wall in a 0.5 pixel window, you can touch the flagpole lower than intended. This activates a normally completely unused bit of code that causes the flag-lowering routine to be skipped, allowing Mario to finish any levels with a flagpole 21 frames faster than is otherwise possible (in most cases--see the FFPG section or SMB1 8-3 for exceptions).
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Full Flagpole Glitch (FFPG):
	]b
	" Used in A-1 and D-1. By touching the flagpole even lower than is possible with FPG--either by clipping in the ground as seen in this TAS, or by using an enemy bounce like in 8-2 of SMB1--Mario is too low to snap on top of the flagpole block, causing him to be ejected out to the left instead. This causes the timer countdown to begin earlier than is otherwise possible, which can save a large amount of time.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Wall Clip:
	]b
	" Used in A-1, A-2, B-1, B-2, B-3, B-4, D-1, D-2, D-3, and D-4. By pressing left within a 1 pixel positioning window, Mario can be pulled into a block, rather than be pushed out of it as is normal. The amount of airtime Mario has before landing inside the wall will affect how far he goes inside, as the longer Mario is in the air, the farther to the right he will be pulled, which is important due to the fact that the moment Mario lands, if he isn't fully clipped into the wall, he will be pushed to the left. This effect is only used to get FPG in B-1, B-2, B-3, D-2, and D-3--however in A-1, A-2, B-4, D-1, and D-4 it is used to greater effect. In A-1 and A-2, Mario jumps barely too low to get on top of the block he clips into, which gives him just enough airtime to fully clip into the corner of the block with precise enough positioning. In B-4, D-1 (with help from the wind), and D-4, Mario doesn't have enough airtime to fully clip into the walls, however with a few extra jumps, is still able to fully clip inside.

[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Long Firebar Skip:
	]b
	" Used in D-4. Due to the fact that firebars always rotate a fixed amount every ~6 frames along their length, the tips of firebars travel more distance than the center. With a long enough firebar, and precise enough positioning and timing, Mario can be on one side of the firebar, barely not touching it. Then, on the next frame, the firebar rotates, and Mario moves just enough that he's on the other side of the firebar, without touching it at all.

	"In A-2, I use a corner clip to enter the warpzone faster than otherwise possible. Unlike 1-2, there are actually three ways of entering the warpzone, you can ride a rising platform, perform a walljump near the beginning to get up top early, and then you can use the corner clip seen in this TAS, which saves 3 framerules over the walljump. Bruhmoment helped save the 2 frames necessary to make the next framerule, which saves 21 frames over the previous TAS.
