		" The wall-blasting sections in levels 3 and 5 are probably the main part that a more experienced TASer might have been able to do better. But when I say better, I mean a handful of frames better, not drastically better. You can only have two bullets in the air at any given time, and there are some additional delays in when you can shoot. There is also some luck manipulation happening (mostly regarding what direction enemies move after spawning).

		" In level 6, luck manipulation was definitely in play to control the direction the heads move when they detach from the body.
