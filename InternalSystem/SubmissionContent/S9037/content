	"Optimization-wise all the typical stuff is done, words can be shortened up to 5 letters, some actions have shortcuts, like O to OPEN, or T to TAKE. There's IT and ALL keywords. IT can be used in place of the last noun used, and ALL does the command its attached to to whatever it applies to in a screen, ALL can also be used to take just one item, since using ALL is faster than using the shortened version of the noun, tho if the item will be used right after its better to don't use ALL and shorten the next command with IT.

	"There's also some weird inconsistencies, for example, you cannot use IT to replace HORSE, and SAY can be shortened to SA when saying to someone, but not when just saying something outloud.

	"Also, in the start I drop the staff and come back for it later is because the saddle is apparently too heavy to lift if you also have the staff. Dropping it there is also faster than not taking it on the first screen and coming back to it there, mainly because the drawing of the first sreen, and the extra screen transitions, takes longer than writing the two commands to take and drop the staff

	": I was caught off guard, thinking that this text adventure would pan out like Digital Fantasia. Nope! In analyzing this game, the items that I was curious about were addressed. As for any weird situations, that is not something that we are going to figure out here. IE: picking up an object that isn't suppose to be available or glitchy stuff like that. Also, the speed as which the images show are amazingly faster than other version, yet I was thinking there would be a way to by pass them. Again...nope. Thinking of Digital Fantasia again. :(
