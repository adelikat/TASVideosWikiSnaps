		"Stone Protectors is a video game based on the short-lived TV show, that got its own action figure line, which was also short-lived and overshadowed, by TMNT. The video game adaption wasn't half bad, where the premise is to defeat the main villain of the game 'Zok' whose goal is to take all of the crystals from Mythradir and use them for evil. The Stone Protectors is a group that was just a normal rock band, known as the Rock Detectors. They are transformed into strong troll-like people by the powers of the crystals and form a new group called the Stone Protectors. Each member has their differences, however, only one member will be used.

		"Welcome to the 'highly anticipated' improvement, to the previous Stone Protectors TAS. This TAS showcases over 1 minute and 6.38 seconds of improvements to the 18:28 movie submission. In this updated improvement, I'll be defeating, bosses not only quicker but, using a tactful glitch that will allow me to get inside of the enemies' hitboxes, by swinging a microphone. Yes, you did read that correctly, swinging a microphone. If you've kept up reading so far, you might be puzzled by the fact that a microphone can do such wondrous things. In this game, I'll be playing a character named Cornelius, the group's leader. Cornelius is the Singer of the group, so naturally, it's normal for such a character to have such weaponry. The official name is "Cornelius the Samurai", but, no "Samurai" things will be used, although I guess in retrospect the microphone kinda sorta acts like nun-chucks so, it could make sense.

		"Nun-Chucks ~ highly powerful when used correctly and for the right purpose. This is the sole basis of this run, where I'll be swinging the microphone as close as I can to enemies who will use some of my health. Getting inside of enemies' hitboxes can also take their health away as well, which I'll consider more of a trade of sorts. Each swing is tactfully used to do the most damage in the shortest amount of time possible. Having some bosses be immobile the entire fight, or some jumping sporadically trying their best to get somewhere to get a hit on me, although it will never work.

		"Ultra-Sonic Vocal Reverb ~ Used sparingly, and correctly, the Ultra-Sonic Vocal Reverb is great at getting rid of enemies who are further away to which the microphone Toss wouldn't be able to reach and or be slower. Now here is to say that while it's pretty effective at getting rid of enemies in one go, it certainly lasts a long time, (183 frames to be exact). While the most annoying move to listen to, it's, unfortunately, one of the 'quicker' moves to use alongside Microphone Toss.
