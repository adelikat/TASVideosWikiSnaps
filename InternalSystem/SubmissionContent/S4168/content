	": This is an awesome movie. But by being so good at setting up that funny trick, it brings everything to absurd level. We use to love TASes where input ends far before the real ending is reached, seeing how neatly the post-input events are planned. Now, you will need to wait for 3 days just to see the event this run aims for. And it's not even so that there is different action during this time - anything different ends a few seconds into the run.

	"Then, this is not quite a superplay. The author reports the same thing can be easily done in real time. Which means the game is coded so poorly it allows to farm the score forever by sticking the ball in the same pattern forever.

	"Finally, this run, even while reaching the point it aims for (after 3 days), does not finish the game! The fastest max score Tetris run dies once it meets its goal. In this run, there's no way to die.
