	"The main "glitch" present in this run, for those who have not played the game, is the skipping of the cutscene where Anne drowns in the pool, allowing Jennifer to reach the car without witnessing any of her friends dying (and in particular, without seeing Scissorman). This is not supposed to be allowed to happen, so the game does not know which ending to display when the title screen is reached resulting in a blank screen. In the post-credits game, Ending D is marked as being completed, although this is not Ending D (it is closest to Ending G/H).
