	" Tony finds himself stranded on a strange planet where nothing is familiar (and without his sister). However, a mech that has a vast knowledge of telepathic skills saves him and empowers Tony with the ability to take on the aliens' army. This machine becomes an important ally in the battle to save Tony's sister and stop the extraterrestrial invasion before it's too late. The game forces players to fight strange aliens across the galaxy. Players collect power-ups while in the mech but loses it after a single hit. The game includes some surreal enemies like a typical dog and some musical notes.

	"I TASed this game in 2013 after becoming interested in it when I watched controllerhead play it on his stream. So since it's been a while I don't remember many details; I'm just going to explain what I do remember. I used the Japanese version because the intro was faster (I think) and there were no drawbacks for English people such as Japanese text, anyway. I aimed to complete the game as fast as possible, using all known level warps and reducing lag along the way.
