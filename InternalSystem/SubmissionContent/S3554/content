	"Bomberman 64 is the first 3-D game within the Bomberman series. It also implements a different single-player mode by incorporating action-adventure and platforming stages, instead of arenas in which enemies or other elements must be destroyed. The game has spawned two sequels on the N64: Bomberman Hero and Bomberman 64: The Second Attack.

	"This is an any% run of Bomberman 64. I chose the Japanese version because of the shorter intro. I think both any% and 100% TASes should exist.

[p 
	"There are some known improvements, like the early bomb jump in the 1st fire stage; better luck for the fish boss; maybe getting bomb power-ups in first ice stage?
