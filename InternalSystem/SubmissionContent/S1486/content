	"I try to fly as high as I can(in some stages using flying dinosaur you can see a new world high up in the air).Then I fire to beat the enemies on the ground.I mean,when watching theses you can't see the enemy on the ground,but you can be sure that I really hit the enemy according to the sound or the increase of score.It's interesting but to make it is very hard.I tried many times but some enemies still can't be hit.However, it has no effect on the speed of the movie.
