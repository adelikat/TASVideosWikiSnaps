I aimed at beating the game as fast as possible, and tried to make it entertaining as much as I could (whenever I have to wait for cycles for instance). No speed/entertainment tradeoff was made.

			"Double jump
		]b
		": This is a particular mechanic of this game. If you jump immediately upon landing from a fall, you can make a bounce jump which is noticeably higher than a regular jump. This can be useful to reach certain platforms early. As far as I know, there is only one place in the game where such a jump is actually required to progress (a tricky jump in the Kitchen). It is also possible to get a bounce on enemies, which requires a tight timing (sometimes, only one frame depending on the enemy's position).

			"Corner-boosting
		]b
		": By walking off certain platforms or bumping Jerry's head on a corner, you can gain a boost of 1 or 2 pixels depending on your position (at full forward speed, you move at 2 pixels per frame, so being on odd or even pixels can give different results for corner-boosting). It does not work on all platforms though.

			"Super jump
		]b
		": I did not discover this glitch, I saw it in a YouTube TAS made by xRavenXP. Basically, there are a few places where Jerry can bounce from both an enemy and a platform at the same time. It saves a lot of time in the first level (around 17 seconds), but I didn't find any other use for it. It can be triggered in two possible ways:
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				"if the enemy is inside the platform Jerry bounces from, such as the mosquito in the first level,
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				"if Jerry falls from high enough so he reaches an enemy while in his "falling down" animation; then, he can bounce from the enemy and the floor at the same time. This version of the glitch is featured twice for entertainment purposes (it does not lose or save any time).
				$LF
			]li
		]ul
		[b 
			"Ceiling jump
		]b
		": If the floor and the ceiling are close enough, keeping down the jump button for long enough can result in Jerry doing a jump, bumping his head, and then doing another jump in mid-air. Unfortunately, I didn't find any place where this would save time, so I just execute the glitch for enjoyment purposes in levels 9 and 12. This can even lead to small zips in level 12, again with no real speed benefit.

			"Jump on cheesbits in level 1
		]b
		": Another useless glitch but I'll mention it anyway. In level 1 only, you can actually jump from cheesebits by pressing Down and B when falling on top of them. It is easy to do but wastes time because Jerry's speed is reduced when he hits cheesebits from the top. This only happens in the first level for some reason.

I took care of not jumping on the top of cheesebits, because that slows you down (I don't know why; but it only applies to this level) and to get on and off the elevator platform optimally. When you get to the ending zone, you have 1 frame to make Jerry pose, so I do that for every ending zone in the game.

I tested different solutions for this, and it seems that killing two fishes is the best choice. Close to the end of the level I super jump off of an ant, for some extra fun.

	"This level is the real challenge of this game. You have to defeat three Toms, each of which gives a key to unlock a rocket part. When you unlock a rocket part you must drop it to the bottom of the stage to recreate the rocket and push it into Tom's hand. It is impossible to hit Tom more than 4 times on each cycle, so each kill requires three cycles. Optimizing this level required some well-placed jumps to make sure I spawn Tom at the earliest possible moment. In particular, before the first Tom I wait for a spider to come close so I can bounce on the top part: in terms of pure movement, this is actually a bit slower than going there the normal way, but it ensures that Tom will get spawned quickly and not get despawned immediately after, which ended up saving a whole second. I also discovered that keys can work on any lock, so I already unlocked the middle and top parts of the rocket while fighting Toms #2 and #3, to save time. When Tom is defeated, the key will spawn either on the left side or the right side of the platform, depending on Jerry's position. For the first two Toms, the left position is optimal, so I had to make sure I wasn't standing too close to the left edge to get the key to spawn there. As I want to drop down immediately after the third Tom, getting the key on the right side is better. For the big fall to the bottom, I need to land on several platforms because you can die from falling from too high in this game! The last part is to deliver the rocket to Tom, which seems impossible to do in only one cycle of Tom's hand (you are missing about 13 pixels of rocket movement). So I go up and kill enemies to pass the time. I checked that doing this doesn't make the process any slower than just pushing the rocket all the way immediately. I also demonstrate some ceiling jumps and little zips to make the movie more entertaining in idle times between Tom phases.

	"After finishing the movie I discovered that the Tom fight in the Junkyard (level 6) could be improved by having still 2 hearts instead of 1 at the start of the fight, so you can fully jump towards Tom for the last couple hits and not die from the big magnet. I then implemented a solution which ended up saving 7 frames, but that led to weird desyncs in levels 11 and especially the last level, where some damage on Tom did not register the same way at all (forcing me to actually lose about 7 or 8 frames to get the first kill). Apart from that, this is my first TAS so I probably overlooked some other things as well.
