	"I used the VisualboyAdvance version 1.7.2  that the site required me to use. The only things I adjusted was screen size (to 2x), and made hotkeys for quicker save-stating.

	"The idea around this TAS is the use of luck manipulation to make my opponents miss, have my attacks be critical hits, or sometimes, to take  _enough damage_.

	"For any R/S/E players, the starters have the ability as to when their HP falls below 1/3, their Fire attacks get a 1.5x boost. I needed that to score OHKOs, so sometimes, I was simply asking for damage!. Therefore, I took damage to save some time!

	"Finally, I limited the amount of Pokemon Center visits to save time, and the reason I used Mauville's was because it was the starting point to many quests (Mt Chimney invaded by Team Aqua, returning to battle Norman, going on to the 6th Gym Leader). So my friendly Abra could teleport back to that Pokemon Center, savign seconds, even minutes off my time!
