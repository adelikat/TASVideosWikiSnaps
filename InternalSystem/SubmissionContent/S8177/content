	"The game doesn't advance the current level on its own, instead relying on the player pressing F4 to continue to the next level. As such, I could just press F4 at the start of each stage to reach the final level in a couple frames. That's really boring! Instead, I decided to only press it once the level complete text in the top right corner is visible. Not sure how that should affect the branch, if at all.

This time using the fact that walljumps bounce you back in the direction opposite to the one being held, meaning on the frame of the jump I can let go of left and instead press right to get more speed to the left and make it into the portal from below, saving major time over the intended route of going up and around.
