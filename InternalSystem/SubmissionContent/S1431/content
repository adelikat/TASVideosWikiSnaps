		" In most cases, rolling, then jumping to cancel the pause after rolling, then rolling again is the fastest form of travel. If I'm using Dixie and jumping puts her in the way of an obstacle, I jump on one frame, then press B on the next frame to cancel the jump, wait 3 frames, then roll again. This cannot be done with Kiddy since he cannot cancel his jump in midair.
