	"Hi! Here is my run of Super Mario Bros. 2. I decided to use this version because it has some differences in glitches and routing with the original NES version.

	"When picking up this game, I first thought that it would be easy to optimize because it looked simpled. I must say that I was wrong! The levels by themselves weren't that bad, but Birdo and Wart were quite a challenge. It is to note that a few of the glitches in this version were patched. The most important ones are: double jump, fast climbing on ladder/vine and the fake grab seen in 1-1 of the NES run. The mecanics are the same though meaning that Toad runs faster when carrying an enemy. In this run, I use Toad for his speed and Luigi for his jump.

	"Since I can't do double jump and fake grab, I have to use a different tactic. I use the potion to do a first ladder glitch to get to the grotto faster. I have to use Toad in this level because Luigi falls too slowly and can't go under the potion. In the grotto, I use the shyguy to do another ladder glitch. I then proceed to Birdo.

[p 
	"Going over the file myself in a number of places and checking anything I found strange or out of place, there are at least 3 seconds of improvements that I've found with little effort, and I'd estimate that maybe 5 or more can be saved overall. Now that doesn't sound like a lot, sure, but the biggest improvement is, in my opinion, a major oversight: Jumping off ladders to climb them faster. Yes, technically this is used all throughout the latter half of the run, but for some reason it isn't used when there are walls to either side of the ladder. It is still possible to jump off a ladder in this situation. Weirdly, this is actually used in 7-2 (where it's required to get on top of the stage), but there are several other places it could save time: Most notably 5-2, where it easily saves over a second by itself. Considering this is a trick used in the NES version TASes, it shouldn't have been missed at all. On top of that, the Birdo fight in 1-2 is also at least 45 frames slower than my

	", and I'm absolutely positive it can be optimized further than that with a little more effort.
	$LF

[p 
	"I don't have too much familiarity with SMB2/SMAS TASing, so I can't see if there are any other obvious improvements, but the ones I did see are pretty substantial for how easy they were for me to find. This makes me think that, despite the rest of the run being fairly optimized, not much effort was actually put into testing different strategies. For example, Toad should have been tested in 5-1: The cave section is quite a bit slower than Luigi, but the other parts of the stage make up for it in speed, and thus Toad ends up at least 12 frames faster.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"For that, I'll have to reject this run, not necessarily just due to there being improvements, but mostly because the improvements are obvious and substantial. I would love to see an optimized second submission, though, and judging from the audience response, most other people on the site would love to see it as well. This is still a really good first submission, though, so keep at it!
