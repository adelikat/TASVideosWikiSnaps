[p 
	"This run uses the good rom of Sky Blazer in an attempt to improve the currently published run that uses a beta 2 rom. There's slightly differences in the game engine between the two versions and I'll try to describe them now;
	$LF

	" Stage by Stage
	$LF

[p 
	"The first difference, the longer loading times can be noticed right at the start of the game, my first input can only be given 91 frames later than it's possible on the beta rom.

[h4 
	" Intro Stage
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Taking damage on the first stage is not meant to save time, but to avoid wasting more time on the cutscene with Ashura. 89 frames slower.

[h4 
	" Faltine's Woods
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Eventhough this stage was redone 3 times, it's still slower than the current run, I'd say it's another difference on the engine, but it may sound like a lame excuse. 16 frames slower.

[h4 
	" Temple Infernus
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Finally a faster stage, thanks to a better positioning at the end of the boss fight. 22 frames faster.

	" Cliffs of Peril

	" Tower of the Tarolisk
	$LF

[p 
	"The different height of the last two spiked platforms made me lose a lot of time on this stage. 225 frames slower.

	" Gateway to the Eastern Plain
	$LF

	" Petrolith Castle
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"It's not possible to jump while Sky is crouched under those crushing ceilings on the final version of the game, so, another slower stage. 14 frames slower.

	" The Falls of Torment

	"Better luck with those green slime balls to get what I wanted and this little stage is now a little faster. 38 frames faster.

	" Lair of Kharyon
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Unlike on the current run, I don't get a magic replenishment after the previous stage, so I have to deal with what I have left, also one of the eels are on a different location. 85 frames slower.

	" The Sand Rivers of Shirol
	$LF

[h4 
	" Gateway of Eternal Storms
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"I don't think it's fair to compare time on this stage as it's a completely different stage, and again, I'll not have any free magic refills at the end. 187 frames slower.

[h4 
	" Storm Fortress of Kh'lar
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Another stage that have a different layout, I don't know why they excluded the center platform on the boss fight, but it really pissed me off. 418 frames slower.

	" Caverns of Shirol
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This stage have just one name on the final version, but they also eliminated a really useful glitch; the Zipping Left Through the Roof. 228 frames slower.

[h4 
	" Dragonhil Forest
	$LF

[p 
	"Finally a stage that's untouched on the final version, and since the same strategy was used, I got the same result. 0 frames faster/slower.

	" The Great Tower
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Only the first part of this stage is different now, but I still don't get why they insist in making my life a lot more difficult. 286 frames slower.

[h4 
	" Shrine of Destiny
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The exact same input from Gateway to the Eastern Plain was used here, so what I said there still stands, it's just one frame slower than it was there. 9 frames faster.

[h4 
	" Raglan's Citadel
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The programmers reserved a really good surprise for me after so many difficult and slower stages; it's not needed to skip the conversation of the Old Man with the Sorceress anymore and the input can be ended a lot sooner. 2326 frames faster.

[h4 
	" More Differences
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"I've spent quite some time to optimize this run, but overall it's slower than the previous run for a myriad of reasons, so only comparing time stage by stage doesn't make much sense. Here's a chart with the frames spent on loadings and talkings, it shows how different the two versions are;

]h4
[p 
	"What kind of improvement is that when there's still possible improvements left? well, I only found the speed address of Sky when the run was completed, so it may be possible to save time watching this address, and of course the use of a different rom made it quite difficult to keep the previous run's pace, but now with the same version it will be easier.
