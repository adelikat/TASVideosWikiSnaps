	"Madagascar: Operation Penguin is a platformer that focuses on the Penguins from the movie. This run beats the game about 5 minutes faster than the RTA record. There is a surprising amount of optimization to do in this game, but most of it is pretty standard for TASing. The biggest optimization not present in the RTA run is jumping over people. The male people can be jumped over with a frame perfect jump. Female people cannot be jumped over for some reason. This saves time not only in the zoo but on the boat as well.
