	"I'm back with a splatterhouse timeattack ("Wanpaku Graffiti"). I have improved the movie at many possible ways according to my opinion. Plays the japanese version but its translated to english (I thought that was much funnier since you now can understand the epilogue of the movie for example). I thought my previous run on this game was really good-until now!
