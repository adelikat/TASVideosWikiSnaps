	"I hadn't seen this game before, but on watching EZ's original run I found I really liked the game and the run. Especially I think the N64 version has a lot of charm with its unique and colorful shading and graphics tricks, and near lack of loading times. The Poohsticks level of the run did look improvable though, and since EZ offered to resync the rest of the run if it was improved, I improved it. I also added a subtitle track that points out tricks as they happen, and added these comments to the BK2, under Comments. Overall working on this was pretty fun, but I might be as burnt out on this game as EZ is now.

	"Before we actually start the first level, we already do a glitch, dubbed “Ninja Skip” because it was found by NinjaCocktail.  Normally after completing a level, the main map screen creates a brick bridge that leads to the next stage.  Tigger does not move to the next level until this happens, which usually takes about 3-4 seconds.  By repeatedly pressing the up button as we bounce to the first stage, the game thinks Tigger is moving to the stage after it.  If we do the same trick as we exit level 1 and go back to the main hub, we instantly start moving to the next stage.  This disables the rest of the bridge building animations and saves about 24 seconds in total.

Basically, each round doesn't end until all sticks have made it to the end, meaning we need to make sure Pooh's stick also gets dropped as soon as possible.  On top of that, invisible lag and hard-to-predict physics act on the sticks so you might lose time by e.g. dropping a frame earlier.

The sticks jump forward after the pause to make up for lost in-game (gameplay) time so only the lag frames are affected.  Sometimes it leads to time loss instead of gain though, so it really needs more testing, and probably a better emulation core.
