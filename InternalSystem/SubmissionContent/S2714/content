Most of the work, however, went into grinding away at the other 40%, which consists of numerous small frame improvements - many visually obvious - in geometry and strategy.

	"Everyone knows Super Mario Bros. 3. Morimoto's historic TAS was the reason that a lot of us found the site. This was one of my favorite games when I was younger, so one day, a short time after the warped run was published, I decided to start an updated full game run, with some of the new tricks that had been discovered. After the first few days I was told that Adelikat and Lord Tom were planning a warpless TAS, so I asked if I could join them to do this. Needless to say, here we are, a year later with the finished product. I present to you Super Mario Bros. 3 in 47:04.70.

[p 
	"Firstly I'd like to thank Adelikat, Lord Tom and Tompa, for obvious reasons. I would like to especially thank Adelikat, since he had to put up with my incessant whining and procrastination for an entire year. If he wasn't telling me to "just get on with it you F***" I probably wouldn't have finished this TAS until sometime in the next century. He also had to put up with my constant misquotations as well.

	"As far as my SMB3 TASing experiences go, only one thing really stands out: luck manipulation. There are two things that need to be manipulated, Hammer Bros. and the end of level cards, which are based on two different frame based timers. The art here is finding the combination of manipulation that will give the least delay, while providing the right cards and the right hammer bros. movement. This generally cannot be done the first time around, so usually hex editing is required. To make it more complicated, if you need to insert frames inside a level that was previously done, which is sometimes a requirement, you have to manipulate mario's vertical and horizontal subpixel positions at the end to match those in the next level, otherwise the next level will desync, and you will have to start again. Therefore, if there was ever luck manipulation to be done, I promtly handed it over to one of the other team members; delegation, a quality of true leadership.

	"Before you start reading the comments, I would like to say first that for all the levels I've done, most have had time saved due to "greater precision".

Also, last time I the floor glitching in auto-scrollers early in world 8 last time so it wasn't represented in any of the airships.  That always bugged me and I wanted a chance to correct those levels.  This project took forever and grinded to a halt to many times but I really enjoyed working with my teammates even when they annoying picked at spots many levels behind our current progress.  The result was a tightly optimized movie that I am proud of so it was all good in the end.  Also, everyone of my teammates are good and finding small improvements in seemingly anything.  That kept me on my toes and forced the highest quality work in all of us.  Having said all that, I'm glad we are done!  Whew!

	"Lord Tom held things up for a good month pondering novel strats, notably using the card game to get 2 flowers, thereby saving time on bosses later in the game.  It turns out this is slower by about 1 second, but proving that was very difficult as the change in item usage would reverberate through many levels as far ahead as World 7!  After that disappointment, however, Lord Tom was pleased to discover a way to get across the bridge between 3-6 and 3-8 without first fighting both hammer brothers.  By manipulating the hammer brother carrying the very-necessary hammer-item to cross the bridge ahead of Mario, we're able to kill the hammer after completing 3-8, leaving the other hammer brother, carrying a nearly worthless star, unfought, and banking almost 8 seconds.
