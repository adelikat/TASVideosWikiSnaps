[p 
	"Adventure of Little Ralph is a Japan-exclusive action platformer for the Playstation. In addition to the typical running and jumping, there are regular boss encounters utilizing the same mechanics as the platforming sections, as well as the occasional Street Fighter style encounter where Ralph doubles in height to defeat the bad guys. Normal difficulty is chosen, as Easy mode ends the game after stage 5 and is otherwise nearly identical.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Stage layouts are fairly linear, there are side paths that typically lead to bonus items (that are for points only) or power-ups. For the most part, they're slower paths, and power-ups can be found in plain view later if you want them.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Ralph's movement is momentum based, accelerating at 56 subpixels/f in either direction until reaching max speed (512 sbpx/f, or 2 pixels/f). Jumping with no directional input sets your speed to zero, can be nice when changing direction sometimes. Bumping into walls doesn't change your speed, Ralph just waits until the obstacle is gone to move at full speed again. Jump height is completely fixed, no matter how long you hold X, making some platforming sections rather irritating since you overshoot one by a mile but don't quite reach the next.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Ralph is equipped with a sword he can use in a few ways:
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" Normal slashes of the sword deal 1 damage and hits a large area in front of Ralph, and can hit below him when he's airborne. Landing during a slash will inhibit your movement. Two power-ups exist for this attack, and both are grabbed in stage 1-1, a minor range increase, and a fireball.
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" Fireballs are fired midway through a regular attack, travel straight ahead slightly faster than Ralph, and deal 1 damage.
				$LF
			]li
		]ul
		" Charged slashes can be used in two ways, holding square while doing a normal slash on the ground, or holding square while landing from an air attack. They take about as long as a normal slash and deal 2 damage. Sends enemies flying as a secondary effect.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Downward stabs can be used in the air, won't affect your movement, and deal 3 damage.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"In addition to two power-ups for the slash attack, there is a health power-up that lets you take one hit without dying, and a companion power-up that follows you around and shoots projectiles when you do a normal attack (this one isn't actually used in this run).

	"The town is under attack by pigs and robots, apparently. There's an upper and a lower path through the town, leading to two different power-ups. The lower path is much faster, and yields the range upgrade, the upper path has the companion. There's a cutscene right before the "miniboss" (really its just a regular enemy with > 1 hp) that takes control away, the game doesn't set your speed to zero so jumping into the cutscene gets you closer to the enemy.

	"Rope climbing speed is 1.5px/f, repeatedly jumping is faster. This stage has the game's first real boss fight. You just have to beat up the guy controlling the big machine. It can drop large balls or snails on you. Sadly, attacks won't hit a target more than once, so a few slashes are used before a downward stab at the end of a jump, then a charged slash. The boss's hitbox isn't very tall, so attacking with more jumps and regular slashes is relatively inefficient.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The boss typically lets you hit him twice, then has an extended invulnerability period where he flies up and changes color before coming down to fight more (this happens in the second encounter). Instead, if you wait until his recoil is over, you can hit him again without triggering his invincibility. Baiting him near the raised ledge lets you maximize down stab use.

	"Taking damage during the floating block section is faster than taking damage during the boss fight. Speaking of, this is probably the worst boss in the game. It's the first boss to have multiple segments, only the main face matters. Breaking the other segments prevents the boss from using certain attacks. Using down stabs is harder on this boss since the floor is so far away and Ralph keeps his momentum so well. I'm not really sure why the first half of the flame attack doesn't seem to hurt you, I stayed in for as many attacks as I could before really having to get out. As far as I know, this attack isn't rng and is always the first one to come out.

	"The introduction to the Street Fighter part of the game. The health bar down below is not indicative of what their health actually is. All of the opponents in these sections seem to have an inner-ear disorder, they fall down incredibly easily, roughly every 5-6 hits they need to take a dive unless you wait an exceptionally long time. Falling down even takes priority over anything else. The main damage-dealing move is a 3-hit combo move, and if the opponent decides to fall down after the first or second hit, the subsequent hit(s) will miss. Sometimes waiting a handful of frames will let more hits occur, other times you're screwed. Manipulating opponent behavior can be done via spacing, ducking/jumping, whiffing an attack before they stand up from a knockdown, changing RNG by attacking more/less enemies in the platforming sections, or waiting. Avoiding the opponents jumping is a top priority, hitting them out of a jump is an immediate knockdown in one hit.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Ideally, you want the opponents to attack after you hit them, so you can just cut them off with your own attack. Ducking or walking will likely cause them to block your attacks unless you wait a bit.

	"This stage has the one refight in the game, 6 down stabs is exactly enough to kill him. The quick-kill strat won't work in this fight, once his recoil is over he's invulnerable, so his little power-up animations are unavoidable.

	"Like in 1-1, there's a cutscene that takes control away right in front of the boss, so jumping right before gets Ralph much closer. If the boss reaches the edge of the area and is still alive, it teleports back in bounds which takes forever, so Ralph just kills him before that can happen.

This puts him in the air so it, sadly, isn't a viable attack to let him use or you knock him down in one hit.
