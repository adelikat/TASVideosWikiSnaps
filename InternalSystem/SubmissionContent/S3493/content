		"Whirlo
	]em
	" is a platformer/action-adventure hybrid produced by Namco that was released in Japan and Europe in 1992. The eponymous hero seeks the Water of Life, promised to cure Whirlo’s son of a sickness caused by a poisonous ash cloud. En route, Whirlo must collect seven celestial orbs that are spread across the land. Pitchfork in hand, Whirlo saves his child in quick fashion.

[p 
	"Unlike most platformers, Whirlo places a large focus on momentum and inertia. In particular, Whirlo is extremely sensitive to changes in elevation. While no drop causes instant death, falls from too far lead to extremely long delays upon hitting the ground—especially if Whirlo’s pitchfork is drawn. It is difficult to convey just how crippling these delays are in a TAS because I obviously try to avoid them; regardless, please recognize that each jump’s height was calculated very carefully to keep Whirlo’s motion as fluid as possible.

	"When Whirlo attacks a typical enemy, it becomes transparent for a short time during which neither Whirlo nor the enemy can damage one another.

The two major exceptions are bosses and the two levels in the game where all enemies must be defeated to progress.

	" Air stab behavior
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Two attacking frames, not one, determine the total effect of using the pitchfork in midair. The first frame determines the damage dealt and the second determines Whirlo’s physical response to the attack. For example, performing a side-stab immediately prior to a downward thrust will cause minimal damage but allow Whirlo to bounce off the enemy. Because they are so important, each variation of this technique is covered individually. I consider this behavior as a glitch, but its status is debatable. I utilize it wherever possible regardless.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Air stab glitch
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"If Whirlo is airborne and performs a side-stab on an enemy for one frame, then immediately stabs downward, he will bounce upward off the enemy where he typically would not be able to otherwise. This is used to great effect throughout Mt. Alsandra 1 and Goblin Valley, among other places. The downside is that the attack only inflicts damage for the side-stab and not the downward thrust, but this is hardly an issue because the attack maintains Whirlo’s horizontal velocity.
	$LF

[h4 
	" Thrust bounce canceling
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Whirlo typically bounces of enemies when using a downward thrust, but if an enemy is hit by a thrust that lasts only a single frame, Whirlo will hit the enemy and proceed directly to the ground. This is useful if bouncing off an enemy would fly Whirlo to an undesirable location, such as off the stage or into a wall. Sometimes clearing one enemy with a thrust bounce cancel allows me to do the air stab glitch on an adjacent enemy. This subtle move is sprinkled throughout the run. See if you can pick up on it.

	" Platform edge grabbing

	[em 
		"does

[p 
	"Briefly pressing up or down when next to a rope will reset the game’s counter describing Whirlo’s maximum height, so it is possible to fall from a large height, brush a rope, and incur no delay upon hitting the ground. Nifty. I use this plenty of times in the Tree Island levels.

	"This level sets up the standard for most of the stages to follow. Whirlo moves nearly twice as quickly when sprinting as when running normally, so I sprint frequently throughout this level and the game as a whole. Whirlo can prolong his sprinting speed by using a downward stab on an enemy with or without the air stab glitch, so this too is used whenever possible. At frame 3057, Whirlo leaps and seems to be stopped in midair. This is done to avoid a text bubble that is supposed to show up, uttered by the character in the background.

[p 
	"This level requires a large number of Whirlowind maneuvers to get through the snow walls. Technically speaking, the Whirlowind allows for faster travel than any other move, but the quantity of frames it takes for Whirlo to wind up means that the move is usually only viable when it is necessary to progress. Because I would have to perform a Whirlowind to get past each snow wall anyway, there is no downside to using the attack liberally. At frame 6174, I briefly change my direction so that I can perform a Whirlowind at full height (necessary to reach the snowball below). This maneuver of skidding to build up speed seems counter-intuitive, but it works. I avoid a long delay by performing the Whirlowind at frame 6435—the earliest point at which the snow falling cut scene is triggered. Typically, Whirlo hits his head on the trunk and falls stunned, but because the attack was performed so early, this does not occur and I can grab the rope early.

[p 
	"The speed that the snowball rolls down the hill is independent of Whirlo's motion, so I get the opportunity to fool around with the snowball a bit and demonstrate some of the delays forced by poorly-timed maneuvers. Whirlo is supposed to shield himself from the snowball by hiding on the icy blue platform at the bottom of the slope, but due to a programming oversight, he can jump in the air and use the snowball to squeeze by the stone pillar just as it gets destroyed. By the way, the short hop at frame 10582 is faster than dashing off the rock platform because Whirlo doesn’t hit the ground as hard.

	"This level is unusual in that many of its enemies are completely immune to Whirlo's pitchfork. As a result, I have to use regular jumps much of the time and withstand a few excruciating delays (such as the one at frame 17857) before it's possible to move on. Opening the gate at the end is also a tedious process because Andy (the pink character) waits for a minimum amount of time and Whirlowind attempts before helping out. Andy is supposed to jump on the left crescent to slow it down, but because of a programming oversight, I hit the crescent out of the way first. As a result, Andy falls to the ground and jumps each time I hit the crescent for some mildly amusing results.

[p 
	"This level is filled with platform edge grabbing and some air stab glitches. I use partial Whirlowind maneuvers when the lava rises above Whirlo’s current platform. This proved more effective than using any other jump. Sadly, I was unable to find an expedient way to get past the flame pillars toward the end of the level. They cannot be jumped over when they reach their full height, and the Whirlowind move is ineffective since there are no enemies around that would cancel a painfully long delay upon hitting the ground.

	"This vertical level provided plenty of opportunities to ascend platforms using partial Whirlowinds. The odd-looking backward maneuver at frame 24919 is necessary so that I hit the following enemy at a precise location and land on a particular pixel of the vertical platform. A pixel farther and I would not be able to recover from Whirlo’s momentum. Sometimes it costs frames to make up frames—this is a perfect example. I use a Whirlowind to approach the boss platform, which works well since the King of the Crescent Moon cancels Whirlo’s stupor. I let the boss skip to the opposite side of me, enabling me to defeat him with three swift Whirlowinds.

	"Ugh, this level… Landing on a moving platform stops that platform, but also increases its speed the next time it moves. The only way to start a platform moving again is to transfer to the other one—or more specifically, overlap the opposite platform’s horizontal location. I make the distinction because it’s possible to jump to the side then back in midair and trick the game into thinking I’ve transferred platforms when I actually haven’t. Because the left platform is so slow to start with, I devote the start of the level to increasing its speed as quickly as possible, which inadvertently displays some very strange platform collision detection in the process. At a certain point, the platforms max out their speed and the rest of the level becomes a series of well-timed jumps.

	"This and Tree Island 5 were two devilishly frustrating levels to record because of extremely poor enemy programming and flat-out bad level design. All the vine-crawling critters need to be disposed of to complete the stage. The standard way to do this is to Whirlowind into walls repeatedly to knock down all the bugs within range, then attack the enemies while they bounce on the ground. But because using the Whirlowind into a wall is so ridiculously slow, I do my best to damage the bugs without knocking them down the rope first.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The spiders dash out of range as soon as Whirlo approaches them, meaning that Whirlo cannot damage them unless he has a significant vertical advantage. This is why I seem to jump higher than necessary when attacking bugs still on the ropes. To further complicate matters, each bug has 9 HP, meaning that a single direct Whirlowind is insufficient to knock them out. Finally, the spiders like to slide around when they are attacked on ground level, occasionally killing Whirlo even in his attacking animation. This last point cannot be demonstrated in a TAS, but feel free to try it yourself.

Throughout this level, I utilize rope as a ground delay canceller. Sometimes the nearest rope is away from the direction I want to go, but brushing the rope and switching directions there is still faster than hitting the ground directly. At frame 83537, I attack away from an enemy. As a consequence of sloppy programming, this actually pushes the spider backwards.

	"This level is pretty novel. To progress, Whirlo must acquire a certain amount of karma via saving birds and helping them to their mothers. Saving a balloon bird nets 4 points; helping a bird to its mother nets 4 points unless there’s a block in the way, in which case the task yields 2; saving a bird from a series of falling blocks is worth 2; discovering a woman in a box nets 2; and hitting a patch of flowers costs 5 points. Of the 36 points possible, 24 are required to progress. I accomplish this by saving three balloon birds (12), clearing two Whirlowind blocks (4), protecting two birds from falling rocks (4), and releasing two women along the way (4). Helping the birds to their mothers takes too much time to be useful, so I completely ignore it. The four ? blocks alternate between woman and monster, regardless of the order they are uncovered. This is why I release a monster at frame 124466 and pass a time-consuming block at frame 124811. Both birds in danger of falling blocks are cleared quickly by jumping up to the spawn point of the blocks, hence the periodic storm of shards.
