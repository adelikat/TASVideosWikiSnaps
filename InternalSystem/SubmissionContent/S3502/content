	"So I decided to stay off Crash Bandicoot Huge Adventure for a bit (no spoilers I'm doing 100%), to do a side-project sadly the emulator didn't work so I found the handheld version and completely different to the Playstation version I'm writing about The Emperor's New Groove. I should also mention this tas was done 100% Blind as I never touched the Gameboy version in my life OK to be exact if you're going What the hell why did you do it like this I actually went over the level to see what is happening.

	" Story Line
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Much like the movie Kuzco the young prince has been given a potion by Yzma and been transformed into a llama. Pacha a noble man who lives literately on the other hill decides to help reverse the spells of Kuzco as he was told that he "Kidnapped" Kuzco and turned HIM into a llama. Ok enough of the actual movie story line I don't want to spoil it to the ones who actually never seen the film and are willing to see it :D
