	"This was a long(ish) project turned short.  At first I was unaware of glitching into walls, after having found it, I spent a good 2 hours trying to glitch through the first wall you see me jump through.  No matter what I did, it was just not going to happen.  The game allows some walls to push you out the other side super mario style.  However the other walls automatically push you out the side you came in.  This wall was the latter.  The majority of rerecords were spent traveling through the first level to save wednesday.  Then I learned of another glitch.  While being pushed out a wall that was going to save me a good 5-6 seconds, I found I could glitch all over the place by pressing down while passing through.  This turned out to be mostly useless.  However, doing this you can make some random blocks appear and some blocks disappear.  All this is doable in real time mind you, just takes quick fingers.

	"After learning of this new development, I went back to that first wall, the one wall keeping me from skipping about 4/5ths of the game.  I worked on it for another 2 hours to no avail.  While working again on the first level, I noticed another Super mario style glitch where if Gomez hit the wall at the right height/speed he would bounce back a little and then move towards the wall again.  Using this I was able to combine these 2 glitches into passing that forsaken wall.  This however, is not doable in real time.  Also, it is important to note that this glitch is only doable from the left side.  You can not perform this glitch from the right side.

	"After that the rest of the run was a piece of cake.  A little help from Rydain Darkstar's guide on GameFaqs helped a lot until I finally figured out how to pass through that door.  But it is a really good guide and he has also posted a map as well.
