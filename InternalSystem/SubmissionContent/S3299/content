	"This run improves the 
	[a class=intlink href=/1721M 
		"published run

	" by 1145 frames (~19.052 seconds), mostly by finishing the first level quicker, by taking a shell and performing pipe glitch death (entering a pipe and dying in the process, then re-entering the level and going through the ground - this only works on the v1.0 ROM). This trick was already used in the previous run in Macro Zone 1 in order to acquire pipe glitched state so we can enter through the ground in Pumpkin Zone 1 in order to finish that level early. When I originally tested all the levels for their ability to be completed quick using the pipe glitch, I messed up and deemed the first level "unpipe-glitchable", but I recently found out you can move left after entering through the ground and thus reach the end of the level.

	"I didn't want to keep this insane 2 minute run outdated like this, so I took a look at it since yesterday and created this run. I was always afraid of using the new pixel trick because I couldn't quite understand it (and I didn't really bother understanding it since I didn't think I'd TAS the game again since andymac's around and doing a good job with the game himself). Maybe I messed up in a few spots during the run, I can't tell for sure. I tried my best, and it seems I even managed to save 4 frames outside of the first level, probably by better maneuvering in the OoB area. I didn't try to find a quicker way through the second half of the OoB area though, as there are quite many ways to reach 0xA2D5 (the byte that needs to be altered; which we enter the OoB area for) and I didn't feel like testing those.
