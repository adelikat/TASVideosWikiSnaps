	"A punch by pressing either L or R hits an opponent after five frames. Within five frames after the punch, the player can cancel its motion by giving the opposite punch of the one. Therefore pressing alternately L and R per five frames is the best strategy. Also cancellation is used to make a feint against some opponents who dodge a punch at the beginning of fight. The punch can be also canceled by pressing ↑ or → to shift from a jab to strong uppercuts quickly. Finishing by the uppercuts shortens a reaction of opponents when I beat, but it works well only at each fight of Pagero and Dorihey because the others attack me during the uppercuts.

	"After giving a punch, the opponent becomes invincible for a frame at regular intervals. At that time, I pressed L (or R), and pressed R (or L) at the next frame of the former input to avoid giving a punch during the opponent being invincible.
