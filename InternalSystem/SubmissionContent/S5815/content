This is slower than getting pattern #2 with a standard serve; thus, jump-serves rarely yield the quickest return.  After the first game, jump-serves were relegated to use when all 18 service options yielded return pattern #1 (taking advantage of the faster ball speed).

Both of these results in the referee doing an additional 'Ball Out' animation.  In the few instances this arose, I chose a different service/spike option that didn't result in the ball going out of bounds.  Though the volley may have taken a few extra frames, they were offset by not playing the animation.

	" that a different sequence of service choices could yield more short return combinations (#3 & #4) or even reduce some of the #1 returns to #2.   Any such sequence variations may shorten the overall video, but the volley on which that run deviates from this run would likely be slower than the current volley.
