	" Improvement

[p 
	"It is 108 seconds faster than my last run. The key to improvement is the using of tools which can be got after hitting enemy. There are many tools in this game, but most of them will not help us at all. So I only use two of them.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The first tool is the one which can help us walk faster. Its function is to add speed (only X-position). The normal speed is 2.5 pix. We can walk 3.5 pix with this tool. We will not get this tool in stage 5. This tool is no use in stage 3, because we don't need X-speed in stage 3. So I don't manipulate this tool in stages 3&5.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The second tool is the one which can help us hit more HP. Its function is add power (only add the power of the dart). The normal power is 1HP/hit. We can do 2HP/hit with this tool. But it is hard to get this tool. We can only get it in special room (it is not random but regular), and before it, we must get a key. The next problem is that we will level up by getting two of this tool except the first level up (we can level up by only one tool in the first level up). So I only level up once.

	" How to manipulate luck
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"There is nothing more to manipulates luck except tools. The memory address 0262 decides which tool we will get. There is only one thing we should take attention to. It is the memory address 0291. This memory address records how many enemies we have killed. We can get a tool only when the value of the memory address 0291 is even. If the value of the memory address 0291 is odd, how ever we manipulate luck, we will not get any tool.
