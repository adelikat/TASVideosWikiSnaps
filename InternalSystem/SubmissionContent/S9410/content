[div class=p 
	"This is the most commonly used technique in the run.
	$LF
	"When Sonic's speed reaches 10 on flat ground, it’s impossible to increase it further. Therefore, performing a spindash while Sonic’s speed is already above 10 is ineffective.
	$LF
	"The optimal strategy for maintaining maximum speed is to wait until Sonic's speed drops to 9.99, charge a spindash for 2 frames, and then release it. This boosts Sonic’s speed to 10.39. Once his speed decreases back to 9.99, repeat the process.
	$LF
	"This technique is a key reason why this TAS includes fewer spindashes compared to previous TASes for this character.

		"Rolling Slope
		$LF
	]dt
]dl
[div class=p 
	"When Sonic is on a slope, spindashing repeatedly is unnecessary, because the slope naturally increases his speed. Instead, you should release the spindash as soon as Sonic is on the slope and let him roll in a ball until the slope ends. A great example of this can be seen at 14:12 in the video submission, where Sonic rolls through most of the cave. This is also one of the reasons why this TAS uses fewer spindashes compared to previous TASes for this character in the game.

		"Storage Spindash
		$LF
	]dt
]dl
[div class=p 
	"When Sonic performs a spindash, his current forward speed (F speed) is saved and unleashed when you release the spindash. This technique is commonly used at the bottom of slopes to take advantage of the high speed generated while rolling downhill. For instance, in Lost World at 5.75, a speed of approximately 16.63 is stored and then released in the flame tunnel, allowing you to enter the tunnel with a starting speed of around 16.63.

		$LF

[div class=p 
	"Pressing A to perform a homing attack one frame before reaching the ground allows Sonic to reach around 4.5 speed, this technique is often used after a long jump which does not require homing attack cancel. if Sonic is above 4.5 in speed, doing an homing attack spindash is useless, since the homing attack necessarily resets Sonic's speed to 4.5 regardless of his initial speed.

		$LF

]dl
[div class=p

		"Pause Hovering
		$LF

]dl
[div class=p 
	"This technique involves pressing Start and then pressing A one frame later to pause the game for one frame and press the "Continue" button. By doing this, Sonic can hover mid-air when A is pressed. It's similar to the spindash hover, the only difference is that the hover of the spindash hover is performed as soon as Sonic is in the air, just after releasing the spindash, while the hover of the pause hovering is used as soon as the pause menu is closed.
	$LF
	"This technique is rarely used because pausing for a frame costs one frame. For pause hovering to be worthwhile, it must save at least two frames overall.

]dl
[div class=p 
	"Gravity control does not directly depend on how long you maintain rotated X/Z angles, but it depends on making sure you have enough "total speed". If the hypotenuse between forward and vertical speed (sqrt(Fspd^2 + Vspd^2)) is greater than 5, you will maintain whatever X/Z angles you have. Usually this means that you have to fall for a while so you have enough Vspd by the time your Fspd decreases to below 5, but how much time that takes varies depending on initial speed and trajectory. The best example of this is in Windy Valley Act 3, I release a spindash on the edge of the platform, I keep the same angle for 2 seconds, and Sonic can fall with a curved gravity until the end of the stage.

It's very weird that there's a wall here because it's useless, if you casually play this game you won't even see it, and it's even weirder that it's solid, and luckily it is long enough to reach the end of act 1.

				" it is apparently possible to reach the other side of the stage without hitting the lava. A member of the community informed me that he had managed to reach the other side by chance, by doing a normal F : 10 speed spindash, in non-TAS, but he did not record his gameplay and he never managed to reproduce this phenomenon again. I was stuck for more than 3 months in the progression of the TAS while trying to reproduce this phenomenon, but after a hundred hours of failure I never succeeded in reproducing this strat effectively.

				" I concluded that this person possibly used an as yet undiscovered mechanism by chance, so instead of continuing to look for a solution to reach this place, I decided to give up on that, and go through the lava. It was a difficult decision because this strat could have saved more than a second to finish the level in less than 30 seconds, but I judged that I had devoted enough time to it, and that it was time for me to continue my project instead of staying stuck.
