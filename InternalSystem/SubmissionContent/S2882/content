	"Battletoads for the Gameboy is not really as hard as its NES-counterpart, but have no illusions; it's still very hard. The greatest problem with this game is playing it on a Gameboy; there's so much shit going on and you can hardly see anything on that tiny screen of the GB. Anyway the game itself is awesome, the music is sweet as all hell, and the graphics are really crisp and clear for being a Gameboy-game. This should have been the standards for a Gameboy-game.

	"In this game, you are playing as Zitz on a quest to rescue Rash and Pimple from the Dark Queen. The idea is simple, run around and kill everything in sight. Makes sense.

	"Also pressing R + L at the same time makes Zitz run to the left, on his head. That's hilarious.
