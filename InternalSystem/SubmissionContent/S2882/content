	"Battletoads for the Gameboy is not really as hard as its NES-counterpart, but have no illusions; it's still very hard. The greatest problem with this game is playing it on a Gameboy; there's so much shit going on and you can hardly see anything on that tiny screen of the GB. Anyway the game itself is awesome, the music is sweet as all hell, and the graphics are really crisp and clear for being a Gameboy-game. This should have been the standards for a Gameboy-game.
