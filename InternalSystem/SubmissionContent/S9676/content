	"Plyuk is a ZX Spectrum homebrew released in February of 2025, its a puzzle game where Plyuk the plyuk plyuks itself to solve puzzles in 25 levels, the number of clones is limited, the number is pointed out in the top right, and in some levels its needed to walk around collecting purple orbs to increase the number of clones available.

	"Since its a puzzle game, all its about is just doing the fastest solution while plopping in and out the clones as soon as possible, tho I did find a few small timesaves here and there too, like in level 15, where Plyuk stops a bit in two blocks so that the path upwards is more direct later on.
