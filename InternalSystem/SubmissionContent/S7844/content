	"In Ninja Storm, you select one of three teams of Power Rangers to battle through 5 areas, squaring off against Lothor's forces. These teams are the Wind Rangers (Red/Blue/Yellow), the Thunder Rangers (Crimson/Navy), and Samurai Ranger (Singular. The Green Samurai Ranger goes alone.). Each team has special abilities to help progress through the game, such as charging attacks as the Thunder Rangers, preforming feats of mobility as the Wind Rangers, and engaging an HP-draining super mode as the Samurai Ranger. At the end of each area is a boss which you fight as the rangers, then, upon defeat, fight again in a giant robot, the Megazord. These are essentially western duels where reflexes are everything, as you continually input correct combinations of directions and buttons before the boss does. Additionally, power discs can be found within areas to be used in Megazord fights.

I may have also abused the way certain enemies spawn (of which spawn from a different location depending on which way you face on the frame before they spawn), although I believe this behavior was as intentional as it was exploitable.

[div class=p 
	"Picture this: You are an evil overlord named Lothor, who decided to take revenge against your brother by conquering the world. You have cannon fodder in countless amounts, and in increasing power. You also have some of the most formidable henchmen at your fingertips. Now imagine spending months to set up strategic planning, only to have it all crumbling down. Not by a team of bravehearted warriors, but three teens who were late to academic ninja training because they were too busy speedrunning The Ninja Warriors Again and Wild Gunman. The nightmare only gets worse... these losers are apparently cracked up on Mountain Dew and appear to move in a twitchy manner not-unlike these "speedrunner" people. And this guy in yellow, my goodness!!! He's so popped up, he thinks the torso is the superior method of human locomotion. And it's working!? These freakish creatures somehow became chosen to be next in line in a lineage your fellow evil-bookclub partners had spread horror stories about. And now, they had ruined everything, and in 26 minutes, too. Time to get a new hobby...

	": I have to echo the sentiments brought up in the thread. A lot of time can be saved over the course of the run through better enemy killing, relying less on standing still while constantly firing forward and being more dynamic in general. Proper timing of attacks and character positioning can go a long way to save time in a run, especially one of this length.
