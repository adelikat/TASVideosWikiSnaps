	"I TASed this game using my XBox360 controller, to do the analog control. This game is painful to TAS, because the camera moves constantly, which changes the direction Obi-wan moves while holding the analog stick in the same place. Thus, I was constantly fighting the camera to produce direct lines of movement. Also, Battle Droid and etc fire is avoidable by taking sharp curves, which is why I occasionally have erratic movements.

	""Iz that Wegal?" - I play quite a bit with the first boss. I race, I run, I jump, and I demonstrate how useless he is. Also, after the first boss, I use an invisible platform to jump through the piston, saving me from having to take the normal route. The bombs hitting the second boss would be impossible to replicate in real-time.

	""Yousa thinkin people gonna die?" - After the droid ships roll out, I grab the midway marker, and run off the edge of the screen. This gets rid of Jar Jar, who'd I'd otherwise have to wait to run across the entire screen.

	""This has not been our day for warm welcomes." - The first big jump is a shortcut that bypasses the staircase to the right. You have to jump from the very small sticking up platform on the banister to achieve that jump. I do have to waste time often, as I can't scroll the screen to far before the hand maiden is counted, or else she will disappear. I need to save 7 of the 8, so I skip the one on the rooftops - mainly because she takes forever to run far enough to count.

	"" I will not condone a course of action that will lead us to war." - The first part of the level contains one of my favorite shortcuts I discovered. I use a small part of the base of a column to jump up to the next level, saving having to take the long way to the left or right. Another shortcut involves jumping on to the column to the crypt.

	""I killed them. I killed them all. They're dead, every single one of them. And not just the men... but the women, and the children too." Ironically, the only Sand People that die are right in front of Anakin. This was required by the game, and also great... foreshadowing? No major shortcuts. Also, once you deal enough damage to Darth Maul, you have to wait until the music crescendo to board the ship.

	""Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering. I sense much fear in you." - This is my favorite level of the game, both in the TAS and just playing. I took many shortcuts in this level. First, after the boss destroys the ship you are ridding, you have to jump to a 2nd platform. There are 2 blue Greedos, the southmost you have to destroy to get a ship to raise, making the next jump possible. However, I shortcut this by jumping on the very small railing, and making a 2nd jump from there. Another minor shortcut comes after I kill the 1 blue greedo, my only kill the entire level. Normally, you have to wait for the ship to raise from below. A well done jump allows you to make the entire distance up, and hang from the edge.

	""No giving up, General Jar Jar, Mesa think of something." I found one major shortcut in this level by accident. After you defeat the first round of battle droids, if you use the cliff to run forward and disappear, you can bypass the 2nd set of battle droids. Normally, the game forces you to stop, and take on 3 Battle Droids and a Commander.

	""Stay in that cockpit." While you only need to save 5 of the 6 pilots, the level ends immediately after saving the 6th. Thus, I take out each of the six rooms as fast as possible. Also, the order chosen was to maximize the use of all the power-ups. The 2nd set of Droidekas is by far the hardest enemy in the game. They block nearly everything (including reflected shots.)

	""At last we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi. At last we will have revenge" - You will notice that Darth Maul blocks a ridiculous number of attacks. First, I had to attack during these times to manipulate Darth Maul's attack. He has a pretty well set pattern, and the way to advance him past his next planned action is to attack and have him block. Only some of his attacks are interruptable by Obi-wan's slash attack, so I had to advance him to one that I could actually attack during. Otherwise, all of DM's attack combos exceed Obi-wan's block meter, and result in damage. Also, when using a force powered attack, I will take damage to match damage to DM. Finally, I hope someone notices what I did special in this fight.
