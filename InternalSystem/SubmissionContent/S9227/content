	"Rockman Deus Ex Machina is one of the best sophisticated hacks in Mega Man II history. It is programmed almost every part of the game you’ve never expected before. The boss fights are incredibly hyperactive. Players find this hack a clear winner. Background Music is made by the author of Rockman No Constancy IKA.

	(__wikiLink|href=/5600M|implicitdisplaytext=5600M)
	", which has been ten years in the making, was finally published. After this movie, we also found that this TAS needs a lot of optimization, there are a lot of places that can be delayed scrolling, improve the details to improve the overall speed, which is also the same as 
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/Darkman425 
		"Darkman425

	"'s idea, so this submission compared to the previous one, to improve the details of the very much, increase the delayed scrolling, and at the same time with the help of the Wily Stage 6 of the Glitch for a big improvement.

	"Among other things, 
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/Yhc4913 
		"Yhc4913
	]a
	" discovered the Wily Stage's Glitch bug from the ReinVos RTA footage and utilized this into the new TAS, thus bringing an epic boost, as for the principle behind it, at this point, we're guessing that it should be the condition of reaching a certain address value that leads to the use of explosive damage, causing Zero's HP to decrease rapidly, this is just an estimation and a guess, but it does play a very important role in this TAS boost. So it is also considered a co-author of this TAS submission.

	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/Yhc4913

	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/CUI 
		"CUI
	]a
	" is also timing this glitch to be fast enough and accurate enough. The prerequisite for triggering the glitch can be reached by releasing the leaf shield somewhere during the penultimate map. Then when you fight Zero, you have to use the Clash weapon's explosive damage in order to make Zero's blood drop faster, which boosts the time quite a bit compared to the original.
