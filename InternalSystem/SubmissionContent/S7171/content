	(__wikiLink|displaytext=TASVideos submissions need to beat already existing records|href=/MovieRules#SpeedOrientedMovieMustBeatAllExistingRecords)
	". This submission's goal prioritizes score over speed, so it competes with our current published TAS. This movie's final score is 168300, with the published TAS getting a final score of 262710. 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=As outlined by Spikestuff|href=/Forum/Posts/507383)
	", your movie also fails to beat the latest published TAS in each event in various scoring metrics. The movie is also quite sloppy, note that while maximum score is the main goal, speed is a secondary goal and must be optimized when and after obtaining the maximum score. For instance, you should not aim for the longest jump in each long jump section, as only the longest jump is counted towards the game's scoring metrics. The same is true for the triple jump section or wind selection in Archery.
