	"In the game we can choose 3 players. I use Sasuke at main character, he moves faster than other two guys. Goemon is second character.

	"There are many gold coins in most end of stages, the amount of coins depend on the in-game time. I used a glitch to make the in-game time go faster in some stages which allows vertical scroll, less remaining time brought lower coins that saved a little time.

	"In a town of stage 2, you should buy a enter pass to walk cross a bridge which guards watch over it. I used glitch to pass here without buying anything. The glitch only can be used on Sasuke, I also used it at other stages.

	"Some bosses have more HP if use 2 players to fight them, so I often killed the second character before the boss fight. Also, at some stages, killed a player to save time.
