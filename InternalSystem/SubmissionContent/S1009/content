		"OK, so this isn't exactly a true-to-life, exciting in any way game as far as pure pinball goes. And maybe this isn't really much of an RPG. But I hate the majority of RPG's. Turn-based, random battles are simply not the way video games were meant to be played. But take that out, and throw in a pinball, some flippers, a boat, and all kinds of great random nonsense, and then you're getting somewhere. Let's just say that Jaleco put forth a completely one-of-a-kind game with this baby. Now, for sanity's sake, let us hope it is never attempted again.

I manage to hit the Witch twice in a row, twice, and then stop her from healing... you're supposed to destroy that weird thing in the top right (so she can't heal), but I ignore it and just keep smacking her with the ball. There really is nothing special about this level...

	"The timing in this level was unbelievably perfect -- normally, you have to kill the turtle on the small ramp to the roulette, but if your timing is good you'll just go onto it and not have to worry about it (like I did). On the boss fight, the second-to-last knight is extremely boring compared to the rest, but it's followed up with a nice triple hit afterwards, so I'm not too unhappy.
