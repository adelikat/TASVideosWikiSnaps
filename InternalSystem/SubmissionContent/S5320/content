	"The glitch involves the use of the first byte of the Trainer ID and the Trainer Name bytes, which are necessary to trigger the call to the function that triggers Hall of Fame. In order to do so, some luck manipulation was necessary. Then, the SRAM was corrupted by turning off the game, which allowed to access the Pokémon list, in which some entries are swapped in order to manipulate the game memory. The result was accessing Hall of Fame without having to also use the glitch on the item list.

	": I decided to cancel this submission because the credits are not executed perfectly since the game freezes at "THE END" screen and doesn't save the progress. From my research, it looks like it is possible to fix this, but I'm unable to do so with my current knowledge. Also, the v1.0 of the game can be beaten faster by using the same glitch, without taking in account the above-mentioned problem.
