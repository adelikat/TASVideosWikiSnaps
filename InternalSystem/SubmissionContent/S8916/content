	"Wonder Dog moves at the same speed wether he's on slopes or flat ground, and doesn't matter if you jump or not, or float, so optimizing movement revolves around mainly avoiding slowing down as much as possible, and when there's some obstacle that has to be slowed down for, have the most exit speed possible.

	"Taking damage kills your movement, but you can still jump and thrown stars while stunned from having been hit, this is used on Zone 2 of Planet Weird to climb up faster two vertical sections, by getting hit toinstantly jump up to the next ledge, instead of waiting to get grounded naturally.

	"In the boss of Zone 3 of Bunny Hop Meadow, I throw a bunch of stars over the boss after its dead, this is because there is actually a second boss offscreen, which can be defeated before he's on screen, you can barely see the ballons popping.

	"In the boss of Zone 2 of Dogsville, I don't get as close to it as with other bosses since one of its mechanics is that when you get close to it, it will start an attack that gives it invulnerability.

[div class=p 
	"In many bosses, I don't just spam stars since they have i-frames, since there can only be 3 tars on screen, its more important to shoot them at a specific rythm, and throw some in a trayectory where they'll hit the boss while on downtime, for example, when falling back down from a jump to hit the boss.

	"In Planet Foggia, it is possible to snipe stars into the boss while he's inside the tube, witthout having to wait for it to get all the way to one of the edges, while he's on the middle it is only really possible to get the correct angles and force of the tars to get inside while moving, so it is necessary to wait for him to get to a quarter of the tube, where its a lot easier to hit. In the TAS I hit it 8 times while in the middle, but I did find a way to hit an extra one, it ended up being slower tho, since each hit delays a bit the miniboss moving to a quarter, and even tho the miniboss is killed one star earlier, you still get hit, which negates all that possible timesave.

	"There's a specific spot in Zone 2 of Planet K-9 were it looks like I could jump up instead of digging down and around, you could jump up, but there's a warp to a bonus area, even when dying to get out of the bonus area it is slightly slower than going around.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"There's another spot, in Zone 3 of Planet K-9, where I hit some spikes, to then kill an enemy and shoot and slide through a small ceiling, this is because that specific enemy is only vulnerable after being startled, and you need speed to make the slide, getting hit there also gives you the option to bounce of the spikes later on, which is faster since you don't have to slow down to jump on the platform on the left.

	": I want to start off saying that the run on Speedrun.com is far from a good run. I was so bored with it that I had to find another one. If this game is that hard to run, then this TAS really blew it away; however, I'm still calling this out as a superb run. I eventually found a run on YouTube that was 17:44. Adjusting for RTA timing, your run is almost 5 minutes better than the human effort. This is an impressive amount of time, and your efforts show. This TAS also held me attention throughout the entire run, having some good time cutting tricks. Great work!
