	"This movie is 1106 frames faster than the previous (rejected) submission by lu9. This was mainly due to menu-ing optimizations as well as major path and movement optimizations. This run and the hardest difficulty run are vastly different due to the levels changing based on what difficulty you're playing on. The racing levels are perhaps the biggest changes between Easy and Hard, as there are different paths for each difficulty. The 10 collectables on each level are also placed in different places (some of them are really out of the way on hard mode). Overall, this run is nothing spectacular, but meets it's intended goal of Valut tier.

	]a
	". So even though this movie is way shorter than the existing one, the latter won't be obsoleted, due to feeling more of a record. And they can't be published alongside in Vault. Let this submission be referenced in the current movie's description. Rejecting.
