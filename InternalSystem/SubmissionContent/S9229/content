[div class=p 
	"This game doesn't have typical RNG factors, instead it has movement-based boss fight pattern RNG.  This means that walking into a boss arena drastically changes how the fight is determined before the fight even begins. This means that if one of the characters walks too fast or slow, the patterns greatly differ. Say Cornelius or Chester in this instance walked side by side, that influences RNG. Say Cornelius walks before Chester that also influences RNG. Say Chester walks (slower-Ish) than Cornelius into a boss arena that ALSO influences RNG. This can be seen throughout the run, mostly with the level 5 boss as it requires extremely awkward moment to and inside the boss arena to get the pattern I wanted.

	"While not as strong as Clifford, Chester or Angus (notice how I didn't say Maxwell, that's because he's the weakest), makes up for the walk speed and special moves in his arsenal.  Most notably Cornelius has a move called ‘Mic Toss’ which comes out with a button combo of: DDD,R,LL,r or reverse order: DDD,L,RR,r, this move takes 5 frames to activate, 6 frames to show the animation but takes 52 frames to finish and hits hard. Most of the time it’s pre setup work to find the correct time to activate it. Most of the time I take to wait for enemies is me preemptively activating the move. Cornelius also has a move called: Super-Sonic Reverb which makes him yell: “Twist Me” which takes 5 frames to activate, 8 frames for the animation to start and finishes at 174 frames total. The inputs for this move are: UUU,R,LL,l or reverse order: UUU,L,RR,l. Cornelius has a weird property with his mic toss move. When the move comes out it takes away health from the health bar (indicated in green, yellow, red) which is normal, however when Cornelius faces away from an enemy the bounding hitbox of the mic toss extends backwards just enough to take away health not only from himself but from enemies that are close enough to the move. I use this quite frequently in this run as it’s more efficient in different scenarios. For example, some enemies have way too much health, and as a result I use this to my advantage. Cornelius being the Samurai has a katana in his arsenal that takes 7 frames to activate with a 20 frame cool down. This move is used sparingly. Cornelius has a punch and a kick move. Punches take 5 frames to activate with 0-frame cool-down subsequent punches take 6 frames to activate. Kicks take 6 frames to activate with a 15-frame cool-down.

	"The muscle man of the band. Chester is used as the 2nd player in this run. Chester has four notable moves, three of which are faster than the other. Chester has a move called: Close-Line Thunder Crush, which when activated makes him fly at his enemies trying to knock them down. Chester also has a weird property with this, which makes him the most useful of the group. Typically, the move makes you fly at enemies trying to either knock them over and do a little damage or sometimes just outright defeat them. You see, Chester is strong, in fact maybe a little too strong. This move can be used to take away health from enemies without even knocking them over. If Chester gets stuck from an object such as a wall or maybe even Cornelius (as the game considers both characters objects) the bounding hitbox of the move is prioritized primarily to the little dash outline, so if let's say a boss were to approach from the back side and Chester faces away from them the enemy will rush into this move while being damaged in the process. This move takes 4 frames to activate with a 17-frame cool-down. Chester also has an uppercut which is used in conjunction to get rid of enemies with lower health quickly. This move takes 10 frames to activate with a 30 frame cool down. Chester also has a drop kick which takes 4 frames to activate with a 25 frame cool down.
