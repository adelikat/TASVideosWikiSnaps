	"Boxxle is a Game Boy adaptation of Thinking Rabbit's puzzle game Sokoban. There already exists a TAS for Sokoban DS and I wanted to do some for other releases. The puzzles used in Boxxle and Boxxle II appear in several other Thinking Rabbit releases, such as Shove It for Genesis, so the solution sets for those puzzles can easily be reused to TAS other games in the future.

	"The number of moves/pushes for the best known solutions in this puzzle set are posted publicly, but the solutions themselves are not. I used Sokoban autosolvers and swapped solutions to build up most of the solutions but Archanfel helped with supplying the ones I was missing.

	"Solutions are optimized by number of moves followed by number of pushes. All that matters for speedrun purposes is the number of moves but it's nice to have low pushes as a subgoal just to show off the best possible solutions.

	"As I said, these are the best known solutions for these puzzles. The puzzles here aren't hugely complex so I don't know if any of them are improvable, but if they ever are I will update it.

	": More than three hours of relatively slow-paced Sokoban puzzle action. Isn't this fun? There are impressive displays of puzzle-solving works over the course of this lengthy TAS with its more than 100 Sokoban puzzles solved within, but there's only one tier that this sort of movie fits into. Accepting for the Vault.
