	"So before I talk about the TAS I should mention an important part of this movie.  I found out this game can upscale the sprites and graphics if the window size is made bigger.  I can't increase the resolution in libTAS itself so I have to add --width 1080 --height 720 in command lines (which is the highest I can go otherwise the game will just crash).  That means this movie will only sync on that resolution, however I do have a native res version in case judges prefer the native res version:

	"I have a feeling other flash games are also like this, but the only issue is the fact that libTAS handles mouse inputs with coordinates, so any other resolution aside from the given one will desync.  But I'm hoping with this submission, it'll let staff discuss how they wanna handle resolutions for Flash games going forward.

	"The game is pretty messed up with physics, there are some instances where red beard will be pushed up higher when landing on a platform, and depending on his position, this could allow for a higher jump, which you can see once in awhile on some platforms.  There was also one instance where I accidentally fell through a purple platform in stage 12 by complete accident, but it saves time.

[div class=p 
	"so basically the concept of the game is that if red beard is holding colored orbs, the platforms in the stage will do something, either move or appear.  For some stages you may need more colored orbs for a platform to move, and you can't carry more than one color at a time.

	"I don't know if there might be any other glitches or places that could be improved, and if there are I can adjust the stages to include such times (this game despite being weird with physics is hex friendly)

	": Flash games can act weird if you randomly change resolution, especially if that breaks the game's native aspect ratio, because then you can click off-screen. That may need an extra discussion. But for movies that don't change aspect ratio, upscaling may result in a better look, because vector graphics will be able to use bigger internal resolution, which this run is doing. So while the native resolution movie is still the most legitimate, because it obeys original browser environment, higher resolution only requires slightly different mouse positioning (once in this case), and all the rest is the same, so it would be the most fair to have the hires run as a
