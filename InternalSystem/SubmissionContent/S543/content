	"Ok. So here it is (finally). After alot of work I managed to shave this baby down alot since current version. This is mainly caused by damage taking and frame-precise movement.

	"This version is 24 seconds faster than the old version and presents alot more stylish events. Some parts in the game can still look like a goof though. This is because of colision detection and invicible edges. There for I have to jump higher than it resonably looks. I also have to do some waiting at some parts of the game. But still know that at every exact frame such as taking damage, move, shoot etc I'm accurate, as far as I know. Frame advance ONLY in this run.

	"It was very hard and frustrating at some points, either at bosses or at complicated jumps+enemies events. Jumping through enemies is not a very easy thing to do. Takes alot of re-doing.

	"Also. When I take damage I jump at the very last frame possible. This is because when the character lands he can walk again. If I just walk into an enemy he will sort of anime style "die and explode for billions of years to come, while strong graphical animations passes by your eyes". Not really that much. But it would add up seconds if it wasn't done right. :)
