	"I believe this tas is about a half second faster compared to the RTA WR, simply by climbing up the poles frame perfectly to get a slight advantage.  So I dont believe this run is Trivial.

	", the game is not trivial to speedrun. Maybe it is trivial to play casually, even for an 8-year-old which this game targets, but for speedrunning, there are a few factors that differentiate TAS from RTA. Even with the same routing, the very gameplay requires a lot of frame perfect actions, and the fastest real-time record is approximately 46 frames behind. Given the same route and the small length of the game, I believe the loss, while small too, is still unavoidable for real-time play.
