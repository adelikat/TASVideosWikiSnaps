		" Regarding the more in-depth mechanics of this game, the 1-player run have already provided detailed explanations. Due to my limited English proficiency, I can't fully articulate them. However, just because I don't mention them doesn't mean I don't understand. Moreover, some superficial mechanics that appear flashy don't actually contribute to improving the run's speed. I believe that aside from speed, there's no other criterion to measure a SpeedRun—isn't that right?
