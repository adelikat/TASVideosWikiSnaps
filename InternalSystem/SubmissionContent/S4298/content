	"This move is 0.36 seconds and 21 frames faster than the previously movie file due to a new discovery of a new glitch. Here are the following glitches that are used in this run:
	$LF

[h3 id=DeathDelayGlitch 
	" Death Delay Glitch
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Often abbreviated as DDG it makes Abe invisible allowing him to get past things that would kill him. Abe will die if he falls of a ledge or gets zapped. A video made by Sligfantry can show you how this gltich works: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d394vrsfeA
	$LF
]p
[h3 id=AutoTurnDelayGlitch 
	" Auto Turn Delay Glitch
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This glitch works by standing on the edge of the ledge and pressing the down button quickly and run towards a spot where you would like to hoist down. You will need to press either 'left/down' or 'up/down' depending on which direction Abe was facing.
	$LF
]p
[h3 id=StopTurn 
	" Stop Turn
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"By timing this glitch perfectly you can make Abe stop and turn. Combing it with the auto turn glitch above a ledge you will be able to make Abe do a backwards jump. This will allow you to jump backwards to areas and skip Zulags. In a 100% run it will allow you to get to secret areas quicker and it skips a section of StockYards Escape after finishing the secret area. Sligfantry's video can show you how this glitch works: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIo1TJUBGlo
	$LF
]p
[h3 id=InvisibleElum 
	" Invisible Elum
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"When Abe is invisible this is done by just climbing on to Elum as soon as the mine touches him.

]h3

	"In the PSX version you can pick up to 10 greandes and skip the 'picking up' animation which saves some fames.
	$LF
]p
[h3 id=Diagonalfall 
	" Diagonal fall
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This is done by combining the stop turn and the auto turn glitch. It is used as a time saver in Monsaic Lines and to save a frame in RuptureFarms.
	$LF
]p
[h3 id=WalkthroughWallswithElum 
	" Walk through Walls with Elum
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This is done by simply letting go of the R1 button before Elum hits the wall.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This run contains a new glitch which saves a few frames. You can free the Mudokon a few frames earlier than a normal rescue. Here is the before and after video on how it looks when using the glitch. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAkt5dmlSU4

	"This seems like the fastest possible way to beat the game for now. I thank Dooty for fixing my movie file so it finishes the game and I did the editing work. I also need to thank Yaritaina for discovering the new Bird Portal Closure glitch. I hope you will all look forward to seeing speedruns of Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty and possibly a new 100% TAS of Oddysee in the future.

		"Update:
	]b
	" Feos now has a fix to the PCSXR emulator so that you can use any GPU plugin you like. As it's a TAS we would recommend using the TAS GPU Plugin which will show you the frames and the input that is being played which will help you undertand what Abe is doing whilst he is invisible. You can download it here:
