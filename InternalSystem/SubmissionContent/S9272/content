	"Super Off Road: The Baja is a sequel of Super Off Road. Unlike its predecessor which uses an isometric top-down view of a single-screen track, this arcade racing game is made specifically for the SNES and uses its Mode 7 hardware for a 3D racing experience with a 3rd person perspective.

	"The game has three different tournaments, the Mexico 250, Ensenada 500 and Baja 1000. Instead of having to drive many consecutive rounds on a small circuit the circuits are big and more akin to rally racing with a finish at a different location than the start. The game is still held with many opponents as well as non participating traffic and wildlife that can hinder the player or be ruthlessly run over. Along the bumpy off-road tracks the player can collect bags of money, just like in its predecessor. Money can be spend on improvements of various of the car's parts, such as: brakes, tires, shocks, lights, engine and nitros. --Moby Games

	"About two years ago, I was about to submit this game when I decided to do a review of it. Well, I quickly realized that I made a menuing error that cost me around 1600 frames. Well, that much certainly desynced the rest of the TAS and caused me to put this to the side for a while. Eventually I would come back to it over the past two years to complete it two more times, while realizing things that needed to be fixed. Finally, after 2+ years...I'm done with this sucker.
