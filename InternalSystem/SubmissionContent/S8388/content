	"Had to optimize the way I was gonna get 50 rings, with some perfect enemy bounces and spindash, I get to the part where you go underneath a section of the level by a moving platform, there I get the 50 rings. Then I use the zip strat to almost get to the end, there are red solidity display bars at each ends of the wall, to further continue the zip, knuckles would have to jump high enough to get to the other platform and finish the zip and level. But the red bars push us down from jumping at our max height. So I use the wall jump glide strat (
