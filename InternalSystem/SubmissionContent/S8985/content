	"When I start Wario's stage, there are three possible microgames, those being Saving Face, Crazy Cars and Wario Whirled. I delay the cutscene skip by 1 frame so that I can get the microgame Crazy Cars, the microgame loads and goes to the grid way before it starts. You might be wondering, "why did you pick Crazy Cars?". I use Crazy Cars to get the 999 because it is the only microgame out of the three that can be beaten with no input (only on level 3), this is very important for the hardest part of this run, which was ceasing inputs. The maximum amount of inputless wins you can have before you lose all of your lives is two, it's roughly a 1 in 6 chance to get it, so I have to manipulate it, I do that by pausing (you could also manipulate it by losing the microgame, but that's obviously counter intuitive). By choosing where I pause, I also manipulate the car in 993 to be a shark, which allows for the earliest A press out of all of the vehicles, ending inputs 2 frames earlier.

	"There's a microgame I have yet to talk about, it's called Dodge Balls (which also involves cars). Unlike Crazy Cars, you can beat the microgame with no input on every level, this means that you could, in theory use it to end inputs even earlier, there are a few caveats however: First off, it takes an aditional 23.40 seconds to start playing the microgame, this means that it would take at least 14 microgames just to be faster. There is roughly a 60% chance of beating the game with no input, this would mean that, just to be faster, it's a 1 in 1276 chance. If I were to spend 1276 frames manipulating this I would have saved 144 frames. But why stop there? In the most extreme case, I could try to get a 999 without ever playing the game. This would be an absolutely ludicrous 5.49E+220 probability, just so you know how low those odds are, if the entire universe was a movie that ran at 60 frames per second, it would only be 2.65E+19 frames long. A movie that manipulates this luck should be, in theory, 1.74E+213 years long (the universe is 1.4E+10 years long). Assuming you got those odds from the get go, this run would just be 42.30 seconds long.

	": Upon further discussion with other judges and senior staff, we realized this cannot be considered into Alternative. This is because, although fitting with the April Fool's premise, the entertainment value dilutes excessively over the half-hour of playtime. Since the movie does not complete the game nor offers significant entertainment value to compensate for it, I need to recategorize this movie into Playground.
