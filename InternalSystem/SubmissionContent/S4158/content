	": This run shows noticable suboptimality in many areas, such as engaging enemies not as fast as possible (sometimes waiting before approaching enemies) and other mistakes, such as enemies dropping out of infinite combo's, ending combo's without killing enemies or occasionally just not executing the combo as fast as possible. When fighting offscreen enemies, the run just seems to mash buttons at the edge of the screen, seemingly without regard for hitting enemies on the first frame possible, which may possibly be suboptimal and definitely looks suboptimal. A look at the button input doesn't give the impression frame advance was used for creating this run. Rejecting due to quality issues.
