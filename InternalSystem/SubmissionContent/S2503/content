	"Apparently the game was made just to demonstrate that the extra hardware in Supergrafx is worthy, it use 2 independant background (wohooo!), its one of the rare game made for that system (7 in total, japan only).
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"The game mechanisms are pretty basic, you either can shoot/swing at ennemys or jump on their head like in mario, any hit will kill you but you can take get a silver armor to take damage 1 time (work like mushrooms...), there are also gold armor that give you short time of invulnerability (see stars...).

	"There is 3 robots at your disposal, with different abilitys/weapons, green can fly/shoot at range, red and blue have hand weapons plus heavy attack abilitys.

	"Stages are cleared with the green robot (abusing fly ability) and bosses are taken down with blue most generaly.
	$LF

	"I didnt finded any glitches, well, on that matter it will probably look a bit dull for some viewers, this game have nothing heavly interresting, yet i like it (probably something to do with nostalgia).

	"Important notice: the old submision (2230S.mc2) included in the download package doesnt actually fully beat the game, a bug in the mcm translator prevented a full convertion, the movie end at final boss.
