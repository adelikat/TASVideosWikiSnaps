	"Granzort is a cute little plateformer inspired from a 
	[a class=extlink href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad%C5%8D_King_Granzort rel=nofollow 
		"manga
	]a
	" with robots, all religious implications of somes signs are purely coincidential (i think...).
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"Apparently the game was made just to demonstrate that the extra hardware in Supergrafx is worthy, it use 2 independant background (wohooo!), its one of the rare game made for that system (7 in total, japan only).
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"The game mechanisms are pretty basic, you either can shoot/swing at ennemys or jump on their head like in mario, any hit will kill you but you can take get a silver armor to take damage 1 time (work like mushrooms...), there are also gold armor that give you short time of invulnerability (see stars...).
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"There is 3 robots at your disposal, with different abilitys/weapons, green can fly/shoot at range, red and blue have hand weapons plus heavy attack abilitys.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"Stages are cleared with the green robot (abusing fly ability) and bosses are taken down with blue most generaly.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"I didnt finded any glitches, well, on that matter it will probably look a bit dull for some viewers, this game have nothing heavly interresting, yet i like it (probably something to do with nostalgia).
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"Important notice: the old submision (2230S.mc2) included in the download package doesnt actually fully beat the game, a bug in the mcm translator prevented a full convertion, the movie end at final boss.
	$LF
	[br

	"Also, i couldnt find bosses hp except for first stage, any help on that matter would be greatly appreciate.
