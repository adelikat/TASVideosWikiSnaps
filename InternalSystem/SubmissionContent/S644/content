	"Update to my glitched run.  Special Thanks to Zanapher for the Stair Glitch, and to Flagitious for the "HolyShitMyPantsAreOnFire" maneuver.  It's now under 4 minutes, and not sloppily done, and with an accurate re-record count.

	"I'm not sure that the through the bushes near the castle is actually quicker, but I made sure that I always got 2 pixel a frame on the up parts and I made an even number of frames on the right parts.  (Because when going right you step 1 pixels then 2 pixels, so I make sure I get it in sets, or I'm losing time).  And because I'm sure of that I know at least I didn't *lose* any time with it, and it looks more difficult.
