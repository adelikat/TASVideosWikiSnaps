	", are any items which can be used indefinitely once collected and include the boat, axe, and key. Once acquired, a flag is set for each which tells the game that the player can pass through rivers, forests, or gates respectively. These tools are only found in blue, red, and purple mountains respectively. Collecting any of these tools multiple times will have no effect. Quivers of arrows, while it can be argued that they are items, are NOT considered tools. Quivers are different in that:

	"The TAS will require going through three mountains to collect the three tools, and finally Cloudy Mountain to get both crown halves and beat the game. The restrictions on getting the fastest time in the first three mountains are pretty severe: the tool must be in a chamber adjacent to the starting one with the exit ladder adjacent to that one (their placements are RNG-determined). To know immediately whether this is the case...

	"Additionally, each room we visit can be one of eight possible shapes, as shown by the image below. The preferred room type is any which has a straight connecting corridor in the direction we're travelling. All the connections highlighted in red are bad, as they are curved and therefore waste too much time to traverse. Luckily, the majority of connections is straight, so getting good corridor RNG is more likely than not.

		"The Key
	]b
	$LF
	"Two of our three arrows were used to kill the dragon guarding the key, but why use the arrows here instead of somewhere else? Well, dragons and winged dragons are the only enemies on hard difficulty which cannot be outrun unless you're crafty, i.e. slowing down in spots to manipulate AI. Therefore, no need to use them on demons and snakes. However, enemies on screen like this one generate lag and we want to avoid any slow AI manips. So, it is best to use two arrows to kill this guy instead of three for the first winged dragon on Cloudy Mountain, which means less time for lag to accumulate. Besides, future RNG patterns become very disagreeable if we let this guy live.

	"After exiting, you can clearly see that the mountain we were just in was gray. The key is only found in purple mountains so how is this possible? By inputting a map movement on controllers 1 and 2 at the same time, we can enter a black mountain before the game is even able to process the mountain's true identity. Inside, a black mountain is identical to a purple mountain. This was done both for entertainment and the fact that this mountain had straight corridors unlike the others.

	"All we need to do is find both pieces of "The Crown of Kings", each being guarded by a winged dragon. RNG manipulation is easier this time since the order we find the objects doesn't matter. These dragons are formidable however, and with just one arrow, the only way past them is to trick their AI. By running smack into the back wall of the first dragon's lair, he gets stuck on the wall long enough to where he's no longer a problem. Not only does our brave adventurer get past both winged dragons with plenty of health to spare, he intentionally counts his last arrow twice then misses it to reduce costly lag !
