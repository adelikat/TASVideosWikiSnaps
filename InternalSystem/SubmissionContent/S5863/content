[div class=p 
	"Krusty's Super Funhouse is a puzzle based game that is often related to Lemmings. The object is for a player to redirect small rats to an extermination area through complicated maze-like levels. The player controls Krusty the Clown, who must navigate through his Krusty Brand Fun House. Each level is a puzzle in which a number of rats must be exterminated. Using different objects and obstacles, Krusty must create a path for the rats to follow and guide them towards an extermination device. Other creatures such as snakes and flying pigs attempt to hinder Krusty's progress by injuring him; he must throw pies in order to defeat them.

This can be viewed on one particular level where I lock myself into the door area for entertainment.

	": This was enjoyable to watch in a form of commentated stream, while also having some idea how this game works, but it just doesn't have enough entertaining content to compensate for its length. The music gets annoying, the actual puzzle solutions aren't always comprehensible, twitching around the exit to spend the downtime doesn't add much value on it own. At times gameplay gets really intense and impressive, but most of the time you just have to sit through the boring parts.
