]h3
[p 
	"Krusty's Super Funhouse is a puzzle based game that is often related to Lemmings. The object is for a player to redirect small rats to an extermination area through complicated maze-like levels. The player controls Krusty the Clown, who must navigate through his Krusty Brand Fun House. Each level is a puzzle in which a number of rats must be exterminated. Using different objects and obstacles, Krusty must create a path for the rats to follow and guide them towards an extermination device. Other creatures such as snakes and flying pigs attempt to hinder Krusty's progress by injuring him; he must throw pies in order to defeat them.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In each stage the extermination devices are run by a different character, including Bart, Homer, Corporal Punishment and Sideshow Mel.

[p 
	"Super Jumping: The ability to use obstacles to help boost your jump by 16 pixel in one frame. Additionally, if you were to press down while jumping (frame perfect), you will also take the block with you.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Turn-Around Glitch: If you were to place a block at the correct frame, you can force a rat to turn around. Unfortunately, it seems to only work when the rats are moving right.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Bridge Building: By taking the block with you on every jump, you can use two blocks to build a stair way. This was extremely useful for directing the rats much more quickly to the death chamber.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Clipping: Rarely used, but clipping was performed in a few places to gain a huge advantage. Basically, clipping requires the release of a block so that you can get pushed off to the right or left of your position...where you will notice that you are now in the area of where a block can be placed. This can be viewed on one particular level where I lock myself into the door area for entertainment.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Death: By killing Krusty at the beginning of a room, the game takes away the advantage of getting bonus time on reentry. Due to large amounts of bonuses (for a number of rooms), this death time is much shorter and prevents the tallying time...often saving anywhere from 5 to 17 seconds (depending on the remaining bonus)

One thing to note here, is that rats can be squeezed back into a hole if you lay a block down before they are fully in the next block area. This keeps them trapped, due to an overhead platform.

	": This was enjoyable to watch in a form of commentated stream, while also having some idea how this game works, but it just doesn't have enough entertaining content to compensate for its length. The music gets annoying, the actual puzzle solutions aren't always comprehensible, twitching around the exit to spend the downtime doesn't add much value on it own. At times gameplay gets really intense and impressive, but most of the time you just have to sit through the boring parts.
