	"Today I present you another version of the 100% run. It gets the Red Potion and the Big Shield additionally to the old TAS, therefore this run is over half a minute longer and nearly impossible to watch due to its non-existent entertaimnemt value. I hope more people will like the TAS now 
	[del 
		" , but feel free to vote no, since I already know it will be cancelled/rejected 
	]del
	" . Seriously this is the last time I make any kind of 100% Zelda run. The luck manipulation is itensivly hard and it requires a lot of attention and knowlegde to perform it correctly. I anybody wants to see a 100% run with another definition, make yourself one. I'm never going to include arbritary things like visiting all rooms or finish the game with 255 rupees. However this run was still fun to make.
