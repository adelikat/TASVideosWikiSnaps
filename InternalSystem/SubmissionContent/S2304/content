	"In two stages, I use a "glitch", in the stage of the pilars, in one part, a White Dragon (Bone Dragon) is forward on a destrucible pilar (that you need broke it to advance) i use a sub weapon in the frame that Eric will fall between the Plataform of the dragon and the one you jumped, that makes an extra frame of floor. The same in the stage of gears, the part of pistons, I Throw an Axe to an extra frame of jump to reach the top of the piston and don´t wait to the mechanism pass back and forward..
