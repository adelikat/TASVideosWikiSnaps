	"My first submission. (Still working on another one which is taking forever.) I didn't see any other recordings for this game so thought I'd give it a shot.

	"I used FCE Ultra 0.98.15 (the version I downloaded from the forums) to record this. My aim was to complete it as fast as possible while taking no damage.

	"The game is a wacky sort of platform game where you take on the role of Spider-Man and for some reason everything you kill explodes. Spider-Man must take on six villains. Respectively, Electro, Sandman, Mysterio, Vulture, Hobgoblin, and finally Dr. Octopus.

	"You can collect web fluid powerups to shoot pellets at your enemies, but strangely enough you can websling across the levels even when your web runs out.

	"Most of the tricks I used in the run are ones I discovered more or less by accident while recording. Example: Mysterio can be hit multiple times with a single punch if you're standing in the right spot and if you hold down the A button long enough. A much harder trick is dropping from a web to jump kick at the right moment, and then slinging a second web to grab the same platform. Especially because of the web's limited range. Hope you like it.

	":  Rejecting.  This run needs some improvements as discussed in the forum.  The game itself is certainly a publish-worthy game.  Therefore, I "formally" give a green light for the author to work on an improved version.
