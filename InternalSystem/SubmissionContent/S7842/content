	"Rolo to the Rescue is a short platformer for the Sega Genesis. In each level you need to defeat an enemy holding a key so you can free all of your animal friends. They each have special abilities, and also serve as additional hit points for Rolo. Only Rolo can rescue other animals, even though you can control the other animals after you rescue them. I improved the old run with some routing optimizations. Some of them come from the RTA record, some are new. There is actually a lot of optimization to do in this game, but most of it was already done very well by Aqfaq in the original run.
