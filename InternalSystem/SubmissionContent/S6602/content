	"Your task is to find and neutralize the head of space monsters, which is hidden in the mazes of numerous levels. To go between them there are special elevators, each of which you have to first find the key. But not everything is so simple: both of them are well guarded. And besides the monsters themselves, you will find many obstacles of varying degrees of difficulty: from completely harmless, but blocking the path of the bubbles to deadly drops that kill the first time. But the main enemy is time, inexorably decreasing every second ... In your arsenal there is only a laser pistol and faithful fast legs. Hurry up! Good luck!

	" When changing directions, Hardy's momentum will normally cause him to slide as he decelerates to change direction.  However, the game mechanics allow him to stop on a dime with blank input.  Thus a single frame of blank input before changing direction allowed for a much shorter (almost instant) direction change.  The gifs below show the difference.

		"Trick 3:

	" There is an instance where a pseudo wall-jump is used.  In level 6, there is a part of the wall that is likely not intended to be used as a floor, but due to the sprite positions/shapes it is indeed possible to jump off this ledge even though it's not possible to stand still on this ledge without falling off.

	"It is possible to stay on this ledge while holding right, but letting go of right will cause Hardy to fall off.  In the TAS this ledge is jumped off before Hardy can fall off.  Again, this is likely a programming oversight and jumping from the walls was unintentional.

		"Trick 4:
	]b
	" Air Jumping.  When Hardy walks off a platform instead of jumping off...he can jump during the fall while still in mid-air.  This is utilized a few times for better jumping positions and to make jumps that wouldn't otherwise be possible.  Again, likely a programming oversight.

The only specific I can think of would be finding a way to actively kill fewer exploding enemies while still maintaining enough health to complete the game; this could decrease lag frames and yield a slightly faster run.

	"The loading portion of this TAS contains the typical screeching data sound associated with loading from tape on ZX Spectrum.  BizHawk's audio settings within the ZX Spectrum core contain an option to alter the tape audio volume.  Reducing this to the lowest setting will allow for the loading portion of the TAS to be done silently instead of with the screeching data sound.  I don't believe changing this setting would affect the sync of the submitted .bk2; but if it did, copying the input and pasting into a new tasproj file that is initialized with the tape volume minimized should work.
