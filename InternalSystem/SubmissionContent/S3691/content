	"I originally got the idea to TAS this game a long time ago, after watching the Angry Video Game Nerd's review of it. I forgot for a long time because I was busy with other projects, but I'm glad that I finally got around to doing it. The game isn't one of the best, but it's certainly not one of the worst either. It's decently fun, decently fun to watch in my opinion, and pretty funny when Lester reacts to enemies and other trivial things like grabbing ledges.

	"To avoid taking damage from long falls, simply crouch as Lester falls. This will mean that he's unable to turn in the air (which sometimes makes it faster not to do, but not often), but can survive any long fall as long as Lester walks off the edge (if you run, you won't be able to do it). The crouch also has to be started shortly after walking off, before he begins is falling animation (once that starts, you can't get out of it til you land and take damage).

	"As this is the first level, there are a lot of places where Lester will stop because he's scared. I jump over all of these, which unfortunately means taking damage sometimes. It of course is faster overall, especially with the canteens along the way. A large jump is done straight into the loading zone at the end of this area, but unfortunately, the zone is just a little too far away to avoid taking damage from it.

	"There are various rocks along the way, and one is needed to open the chest for the ruby. The closest rock possible is taken to do this. It's important to note that although there is a rock in a better place in the first part of the level, it disappears after you hit the loading zone for the second part. Taking damage at the end from the bats was necessary.

	"Often, here, the player will fall through a house or fall onto the ground, which results in Lester being captured. When this happens, you have to retrieve a key from a guard and get out of jail. It puts you in the river level, but is slower than doing well-timed jumps across all of the houses to achieve the same result, so that's what's done.

After that, I stand right where the woman appears, which makes the distance Lester has to run afterwards minimal.

A bunch of switches need to be pressed in order to open the pathway on the bottom floor, but not every switch has to be hit. The room is optimised so that the required switches are hit in the fastest order.

	"In this area, we have to destroy the boulder blocking the way with the boomerang. It takes 8 hits to do this. The second and third platforms rise when you stand on the first one, so I stand on that long enough so that 5 hits can be done from the second one, and 3 from the third, which allows Lester to reach the final ledge without having to grab onto it first, which is by far the quickest way to clear this room.

	"There are spiders and spikes everywhere here, and although with damage invulnerability we can run through a few of them, it's faster to save that extra health for the pirates later on. The giant spider isn't a required boss; you only have to break the web. The web can only be damaged after a certain amount of time after the previous hit, which is why I wait a few times here.

	"A few pirates are skipped using damage invulnerability. Other than that, there isn't a lot to say til we get to the end. The candle is placed closer to the door to avoid having to climb over the cannon. The cannon has to blow open the door before we get the ladel/water, as if you try to put it on the ground, Lester empties the water out, meaning you can simply drop it, pick up the candle, light the cannon, then pick up the ladel again. Extinguishing the spark on the TNT to save Hector finishes the game.
