	"I thought about this for a bit, and despite there being a call for Vault publication in the thread, I'll have to reject this run. The lack of A.I. means that there isn't really a "game" to win. The faster TAS really lends itself more to being a "fastest death" run rather than a fastest win, with a controlled suicide leading to player 2's victory. You could argue that the player reaches a win condition, but at the same time I could argue that there's no lose condition in this case, ultimately making "winning" completely trivial. Imagine if there were a fighting game TAS where the first thing the player does is jump backward out of the arena, instantly conceding victory to the opponent. That's (Q)basically what this run is, the only difference here being that player 2 is being "controlled" as well. This also leads to a situation where the run can be easily matched in real time, since the run's strategy is "throw with 0 velocity", which as far as I can tell will lead to this result every single time.

[div class=p 
	"Now, the sentiment in the thread wasn't to Vault that movie, but to Vault the 1 frame slower version where player 1 ends up winning. But from my perspective, that run can't be Vaulted because there's only one end condition for the game: Someone wins. So that means that there is a file out there (this submission) that reaches the exact same end condition in both a faster real time and a faster TAS time.
