	"Web of shadows was the first game i ever TAS'd, about 10 years ago. I was the first person to really speedrun it and start to look into speed strats and eventually i switched to TAS only. My first Any% TAS time was 34:22 (back then i went by in game time which was 31:04). 2-3 years later i began making a NG+ TAS, which starts you off with all upgrades and items except abilities obtained from boss's. I can't remember what happened but i was mid way through Sewer and lost the file. 3 years later i began TAS'ing Super Metroid using input editor and learning much more advanced TAS optimization strats. In 2021, Themasterpro1212 made a NG+ TAS with a time of 24:25(24:41 TAS timing). Both of these previous Web of Shadows TAS's were made with frame advance in Desmume.

Managing it is a key part of this TAS, to ensure i get correct XP to buy critical upgrades. The way the combo meter increases is a little weird, you can't just repeat the same attacks over and over or it will start to decay. You have to vary your attacks and use them at the right time. Grouping enemies will greatly increase how much it goes up per hit. You may often see me mixing up my attacks for this, sometimes sacrificing a higher DPS combo for a lesser one, in order to maintain or boost the combo meter. The goal with group enemy fights is usually to get the combo meter up to max with the first spawns, and then kill with higher dps hits with the later spawns of a fight.

Spidey flicks the electricity switch and reminds the enemies that they should know better than to think they could win. Now we make our way back through the newly accessible area and down to the water drain switch room. Normally there is another group enemy fight here, but a glitch was discovered where if you put the drum in the doorway before draining the water, as you leave and it tries to lock you in for the fight, the door gets stuck and you can escape.

We then make our way to the top of Pier and over to the second warehouse section. In this room is the first use of Speedy Drum boost. In the next room is the first Pier group fight. This room took ages to do because i kept re-doing things earlier in the TAS, and i couldn't get optimal enemy rng and XP. The rng i did end up getting was really good, luring 5 green jumpers (or abes odysseys) into a single combo. The rng had to be manipulated by delaying some frames back on top of Pier.

I stay in Black suit until the Ichor wall before the damage Upgrade room to avoid switching suits 2 extra times. In the damage upgrade room a fight is forced on you, but we have to come back to this room later for portal hunt so we won't have to do it then.

In the final phase i spam uppercuts into midair snare and swing hits. Note that while the leader does have 2x Venom's HP, it takes 2x damage from attacks, meaning it actually has the same "effective" amount of HP as Venom.
