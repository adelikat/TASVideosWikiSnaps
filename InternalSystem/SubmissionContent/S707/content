	"One difference is that this one is played on the B difficulty compared to the A one.  The B difficulty is supposed to be harder, though the difference isn't noticable in a TAS.  And also, possibly because of that, Jumpman doesn't jump to avoid the spring on level 2, and he doesn't waste time jumping over any flames other than at the end to finish recording earlier, which was conveniently necessary in order to avoid the last flame.

	"In the movie there are three close calls that make the movie a little more interesting, in my opinion.  On the first level Jumpman barely makes it as he climbs a ladder avoiding a barrel.  If he was a frame slower he would have been hit.  On the second level a spring jumps through his left leg, but he's unharmed.  And finally, he jumps over a flame on the last level to land on the last block to be removed.

	"But I must credit OmnipotentEntity for the idea of jumping to stop the movie earlier.  I didn't think of that one at all.  And the fact that his run was accepted when my modified run that I didn't post was one second faster on the timer (1:20 vs 1:21) made me go back and change that ending and submit this.
