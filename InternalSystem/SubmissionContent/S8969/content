	"SNES Rampart has a "Classic" mode, which aims to be similar to the Arcade version of the game. For some reason, they put a level in this mode that's not in the original Rampart.

	"The biggest difference, by far, is that SNES Rampart will automatically pass the current level if all ships on screen are destroyed. This means levels go by much, much faster - especially since the game stops at hard difficulty, and does not have any kind of Very Hard, unlike the arcade version.

	"EDIT: I'm not entirely sure why I posted this. I think I wanted to show off just how different/more fair the SNES version of Rampart is - but honestly, this TAS neither aims for speed nor entertainment, and therefore achieves very little other than a weak demonstration. It's not much of a feat to complete this game on Tough/Hard - unlike the Arcade version, which is borderline impossible. I should have just linked this TAS's video in the submission notes of the Arcade Rampart TAS, rather than submitting it.
