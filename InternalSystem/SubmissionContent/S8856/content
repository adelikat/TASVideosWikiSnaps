This is important because when Serris is hit, it enters a dashing animation and becomes invincible for a bit, by doing this twice you can make it so that this only occurs once (not counting the introduction), if you didn't do this, you would have to sit through two extra animations, which would lose a significant amount of time (which is what happens in my previous TASes of this game).

Normally, you pass through the area where this Power Bomb is twice in the run, by carrying a Shinespark on the first visit, and only collecting it on the second visit saves roughly 200 frames, or 3 seconds, this is because if you use your Shinespark on the room, the total time you spend on it will be lower.

Still, that is only about 5 frames that could be saved.

This could've been used in Mons Fire (the fire area) and in Arx (the purple area). It's hard to save how much time this would save, but I'd estimate that it could save about 3 seconds. The worst part is that I actually tried doing this trick, but I spent about two hours trying to do it and I couldn't recreate it. You can see a clip of the glitch
