	"This hack features optimizations to reduce lag and frame drops, along with significant changes to certain stages, weapon acquisitions, and boss mechanics. The standout adjustment is the Top Man weapon, which I used extensively for speedrunning due to its ability to accelerate movement. Weapon balance has also been overhauled.

	"这次投稿的录像因为在romhacking找不到所以我投稿的时候把文件和录像一起放在压缩包里了方便即使查找和观看本次改版的特点在卡顿掉帧这一方有优化并且在一些关卡与获得武器和boss方面有较大的改动重点是陀螺人的武器因为可以加速跑图的时间所以我大部分的时间都用这个武器来赶路并且在武器克制方面也有较大的改动因为有优化掉帧这一方面的改动所以大部分时间很少能看见大规模掉帧的现象
