	"Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee is a 2D side scrolling platform game released in 1997 for the PS1 and PC. In 2014, a TAS was made by Samtastic and Dooty which introduced a new skip in the Monsaic Lines which allows us to skip Paramonia and Scrabania. 4 years later, a new speedrunner came along from Spain and improved the bee DDG in the Monsaic Lines. Then, after looking into this glitch a bit more, Legna found a way on setting up the DDG on the bottom instead of the top. Then, on December 25th 2018, Legna out of nowhere discovered a faster way on setting up the DDG that is now faster than the previous movie. It also has a 20% success rate on getting it to work in an RTA run. The movie beats the current published movie by 3 seconds! The movie is 160 frames faster than the previous movie!

	"Often abbreviated as DDG it makes Abe invisible and can corrupt his sprite and eventually become invisible at some point allowing him to get past things that would kill him. Abe will die if he falls of a ledge or gets zapped. A video made by Sligfantry can show you how this glitch works:

	"This glitch works by standing on the edge of the ledge and pressing the down button quickly and run towards a spot where you would like to hoist down. You will need to press either 'left/down' or 'right/down' depending on which direction Abe was facing.

	"By timing this glitch perfectly you can make Abe stop and turn. To set it up, Abe needs to be standing near a ledge (pressing up whilst tunring arround) you will be able to make Abe do a backwards jump. Notice that when you press the opposite direction to where Abe is standing at the incorrect frame, Abe will just jump up and stand. But if you time it perfectly, Abe will jump backwards and possibly jump to another screen. This will allow you to jump backwards to areas and skip Zulags. In a 100% run it will allow you to get to secret areas quicker and it skips a section of StockYards Escape after finishing the secret area. Sligfantry's video can show you how this glitch works: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIo1TJUBGlo

	"Whilst performing a backwards jump, simply press up/jump and Abe will do a multiple backwards jump and in this run Abe will use it to skip Zulag 3 to get to Zulag 4.

	"This section has made the frame difference thanks to Legna's new strat on setting up the DDG in the Monsaic Lines. We now no longer need to wait for Abe to get attacked by the bees by himself. Instead, at a random moment, the bees will automatically fly towards Abe and Abe can move to the bells whilst getting attacked. Abe needs to have 64 HP before he can trigger the DDG.
