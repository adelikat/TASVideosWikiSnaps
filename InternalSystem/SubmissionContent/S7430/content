Since then, I’ve made a good half-dozen significant attempts at an improvement, with incremental improvements in scripts and other work to decode and conquer the RNG. What really held me back, though, was never really finding a route improvement that was fast and novel enough to keep me motivated through all four crowns. I was surprised and pleased by the route that finally did it—watch first if you know the game and want to be surprised at this 58.5 second (3,511 frame) improvement to the

In the process, I found some other fun adds – moving the boss HP sprites, providing a game-aesthetic scroll counter. Finally, for the Atlas portion, each level is only revealed when the player enters it for the first time; this was inspired by

]h3
[div class=p 
	"Superficially, this route is more similar to that of my first TAS and current WR speedruns, in that it uses Lyll to get the first 3 crowns, skipping the Xemn character entirely. Other notable features are that we obtain the Power Knuckle but skip both the Magic Bottle (used to pass the “13 column” screen as Lyll in first TAS) and Key Stick (used in all prior TASes to open doors for Meyna’s crown). These three item choices are heavily interdependent throughout the run and drive me to collect a huge number of enemy drops, most notably for keys and magic, without stopping to grind.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Trying routes without the Power Knuckle resulted in many disappointing efforts. It doesn't take much time to get, but looking only at the time it saves on bosses, it wouldn't quite seem worth it. However, for this route it's vital as it is twice as efficient in damage per magic point (4x damage, 2x magic usage) and allows many enemies to be killed at a distance with one volley of fire, that would otherwise require multiple volleys with the associated long delay. This is most pronounced on the "13 columns" screen where the knuckle allows me to kill the diving enemies such that I can pick up their drops with minimal delay.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Because of the degree to which resource management and luck manipulation dominate the run, it is difficult to compare times to prior efforts on an apples-to-apples basis for particular sections. It takes time to kill so many enemies and take their drops, but that is weighed against extra money to buy the Key Stick, and time and money spent equipping the Key Stick and Magic Bottle at Inns. Overall, I believe skipping the Key Stick/Magic Bottle saves about 10 seconds and certainly seems the more entertaining option for any %.

[div class=p 
	"As described below, the random chance of a scroll or cross drop is 1 in 20, and the chance of a key drop is only 1 in 10. Needless to say, with the many crosses/scrolls and dozens of keys we manipulate, much energy was spent twisting and bending the RNG to the absolute max production I could manage.

[div class=p 
	"There are some small speed/entertainment tradeoffs in the run, maybe 45 frames in total. For several item drops where the fastest pickup would have the player hiding the item or show the item for only 1 frame, I let the item show for 3 frames before picking it up. In my viewing, this was the minimum to be able to see what the item is before it disappears and significantly improves the viewing experience. Also, when Roas kills the sphinx that technically wastes 6 frames -- as the 3 magic points used take that long to get filled back up when he visits the Inn later. I thought it was a little funny to kill it after climbing on it, especially on the atlas encode where its death sprite sticks around when we leave the screen.

[div class=p 
	"The RNG updates only when needed, which often happens at the start of a new screen and after that depending on when enemies need a new action. However, not all updates are created equal - depending on whether the game wants a 0-19, 0-5, 0-2 etc. result the ending RNG state for a single call will differ. So, I wrote many Lua scripts that emulated the RNG and would forecast items coming available from kills and crosses, but this was complicated on a few screens where enemies mix and match different RNG calls unpredictably.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Otherwise, all enemies use the same algorithm for computing drops, which are calculated based on the RNG when the enemy falls offscreen. Also, crosses kill every onscreen enemy, which freezes the RNG other than a d20 for each item drop. The flicker animation freezes the player for several frames.

	" RNG Manipulation
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"Once I found a target item in my forecasting script (say, a cross), the challenge is to line that RNG state up with a killed enemy dropping offscreen. Sometimes the player can influence enemies to make faster/slower RNG calls by moving in certain locations. Sometimes I kill enemies just to prevent them from making unwanted calls (if I can spare the magic). Switching back and forth vertically between certain screens (especially 13 columns) is often the fastest way to advance the RNG as many screens make calls shortly after loading.  
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Another nuance is that there are 2 major groups of RNG behavior. One makes calls of d3, d6, and d4 for a single enemy in a single frame. The other just makes a d3 call (or sometimes two) in a frame. For many cross/scroll drop situations, the desired item is much more readily available in one vs the other RNG group. This occurs throughout the game, but especially at the dungeon entrance (the first screen is 3-6-4, the next down is 3, and the bottom of the ladder is again 3-6-4). Having different groups connected vertically like this is ideal as you can quickly go back and forth to fine-tune the RNG for what is needed.

	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"At a glance, my route shouldn’t require much golds: You start with 50 golds, there’s a 50-golds chest in the first level I visit (Pochi’s), and I only need to spend 115 golds on the Mattock and 2 Inn stays. So, you might see that I aggressively collect golds throughout, and think it’s wasted excess. However, those extra golds are one of the most important time saving strats, especially for the 3rd and 4th crowns.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The reason is that fully 55% of RNG-based item drops will be “normal” items—bread, magic, or golds, whichever you currently have LEAST of. The impact of this is massive: if your golds are less than 30, it is impossible to get ANY magic refills until your magic drops to 29, at which point EVERYTHING will be magic – no scrolls, keys, or crosses. The same is true for life/bread at the 19 point level and when you have 0 or 1 key. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Having golds above 30 (the higher the better) lets me grab magic refills before I get desperately short on magic, which greatly increases flexibility on how I attack many rooms. It also provides the opportunity to grab an extra magic refill or two as extra on-route items on a cross drop whose main focus is either keys or a scroll.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Another notable use is on the “13 columns” screen, where I start grabbing magic refills on the 2nd column. If I had any less golds there, I would have gotten a golds drop instead of magic, making passage without the Magic Bottle item much more difficult. This isn’t theoretical—after a couple of test runs, I adjusted my route on the 3rd crown to collect more $ for just this reason, in particular with the cross drop on the screen before.

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"On the screen where I collect the Wings, I intentionally go down to 1 key opening the chest. Meanwhile, I have killed 5 enemies, who are falling offscreen. Ordinarily, only 1 in 10 items is a key, but having just 1 key forces all five drops to be keys. This is a huge boost toward completing the run without collecting the Key Stick and saved a few seconds through not having to generate RNG-based key drops elsewhere.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"One side effect of generating forced items is that, unlike regular item drops, they do not update the RNG. Usually, this doesn’t matter, but it can be used to great advantage.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"If the enemies that a cross kills would normally drop another cross (useless, because the enemies are already dead), forcing can be used to make the 2nd cross appear as the first item on the next screen (very useful!) instead. This only works if enemies on the following screen don’t use the RNG, but I was able to use it once in Xemn’s area. To do this, I waited until just before the 2nd cross would have appeared and then wasted magic. All remaining items on the current screen were forced to be magic refills, and the cross was teed up for the next screen. The same technique can be used with scrolls, keys, etc., but the payoff is bigger with a cross.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Another cool strat that I used a few times on the 3rd crown is to grab a cross and have magic at 30 until, e.g., the scroll I need is generated, then “waste” a shot to put magic at 29, forcing all remaining items to be magic. On the screen in Xemn’s area with the very tall pillar (requiring 2 pause jumps), I use this to maximum effect, having magic >= 30 to generate a cross, then going to 29 and grabbing 8 magic refills, to get up to 69 (minus a few points for blocks I have to break).

Many potential crosses were declined in this route as the available drops weren't good enough (most often 1 scroll + n keys is what I'm after, where n is as many as possible). With a script showing the drops for each RNG state ahead, it's pretty easy to see what's available and there isn't much you can do to modify that menu (rarely, killing an extra enemy may tweak one or two items). If a needed item is there but dropping off-route, you can sometimes push it on-route by shoot an extra enemy before grabbing the cross. Its drop then appears earlier than it otherwise would have, shifting the item that each affected enemy drops. This was very useful at several points in the run.

	"The last long-trek screen before the Crown is notably difficult as it has no RNG, only 6 enemies that can be killed for drops (3 are hidden among the locked doors atop the screen) and it is a must to manipulate a scroll as near as possible to the exit. As well, the screen before is another long one where I need to use a cross – after which, the RNG doesn’t run there, either. To conquer this, I used a script that would look at item drops multiple screens ahead, and the solution used here was really the only hope to get through.

	"The Rockgaea fight can be a few frames faster with better luck (it depends on when/where he shoots his bullets, which cause the player’s stationary shots to disappear when they hit) but this isn’t bad – there isn’t much opportunity to manipulate him as I need the cross and scroll drop just before grabbing the Crown.

	"I got faster scroll drops and a better sphinx climb, but otherwise the route to the Dragon Slayer was the same. I have to wait behind a door for the game’s final scroll to drop, or it would have been a key. If I had an extra key here, I could have gone through the door earlier to kill the enemy that drops the scroll with stationary shots and saved 25 frames, but it would have taken longer than that to get an extra key.

	"Keela’s head becomes vulnerable before the feet, so I made a small improvement by taking an early diagonal shot. A bigger improvement was obtained by jumping such that I hit Keela’s head, which pushed me back through the air to the left, while still being able to fire right (normally, you can’t move left and fire right). The landing was perfect to be far enough left that I wouldn’t burn up and die along with the boss, while also triggering Keela to breathe fire at me just as s/he died – an effect I think looks pretty cool.
