	"This movie is 20,354 frames faster than the currently published any% run, or a little more than 5 and a half minutes. The in-game timer is 2 minutes faster, but that was not a primary goal of mine. The majority of this gain came from a few different factors. The new route alone helped to shave off a few minutes. The arm pumping saved at least a minute or so. Overall better playing and optimization probably saved another minute. I also made great effort to avoid the pause menu and collecting unnecessary items. Not so surprisingly this run follows a similar route as the 14% run, but with the addition of 4 extra items which saved a ton of time by comparison.

	"Most Super Metroid runs aim for the lowest in-game timer, while this run instead aims for the lowest real time. Due to the fact that I am favoring real time, I have made some unorthodox route choices. These choices keep the flow of the game moving and reduce the amount of items and door transitions down to the near minimum.

	"Making this run became exponentially easier as I moved along. My knowledge of the game has increased vastly and my playing ability has increased as well. I had a lot of fun making the route and seeing how much faster I could be than the current run. Needless to say I am happy with the results. The run could not have been possible without the help of many people. So I will list the people who helped me in any way during the making of this run.

	"Bisqwit – For nesvideos and the nesvideos forum, without which this run would not exist.

	"DeHacked – For his micro-storage system which hosted my movie files.

	"Evilchen – Supplied with a short wip of a run he was working on, and gave support during the making of this movie.

	"Gocha – For the awesome Snes9x memory watch tool.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"JXQ – For his 100% run which set the standard for this game way higher than I thought imaginable. His run was the only run I had to compare times to, and this lead to an overall higher quality of my run. He was also kind enough to give advice and answer all my dumb questions.
	$LF

[p 
	"Michael Flatley – The man who invented the arm pump! This single trick of his saves countless seconds in any Super Metroid Run. He is also responsible for the Phantoon 1 round kill, which I implemented in my run as a 2 round kill.
	$LF

[p 
	"moozooh – Another great Super Metroid TASer. He helped motivate me to start my run. He also supplied me with gocha’s Snes9x memory watch tool and his own ini file that contained all the useful memory addresses in Super Metroid. He gave me much support throughout the run and answered many of my questions as well.
	$LF

	"nitsuja – The great coder responsible for the Snes9x improvements.

	"OgreSlayer – Supplied a useful trick, and gave general support throughout the project.

[p 
	"saturn – He has invented countless tricks for this game. In my run I implement his super short charge technique on many occasions, and I also use his amazing Draygon battle strategy. He has given me much support along the way too and answered the many questions that I had during the making of this run.
	$LF

[p 
	"terimakasih – He set the standard for Super Metroid TASes. Without his movies, I do not think I would have been as interested in doing this run. I used many of the tricks from his 14% run in this run.
