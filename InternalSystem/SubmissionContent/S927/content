	"I started to play this game again about 2 months ago because I thought my old attempt wasn't really that good. In the end I managed to improve my old run with 2 minutes and 39 seconds if I calculated it right (from 21:52 down to 19:13), and hopefully managed to make this run look better.

	"It's a quite simple game where your only goal is to get to the top of each mountain in order to grab the bird there. The bonus sections of each mountains was the hardest to optimize and in my old run I apparently didn't gave them that much attention. There are 8 different bonus sections and they loop in that order, so at mountain 9 there is the same bonus section as at mountain 1. There are also 32 unique mountains which has to be conquered in order to "complete" the game.

	"This time I manage to abuse some glitches in the game. For example it's possible to jump through ceiling if the screen hasn't scrolled yet. This, however requires very precise timing from both players and thus it's not possible nor time efficient to use everywhere. I use it in a few places though to save time.

	"When I first reached mountain 12 I found out that I could improve a few bonus sections so at that point I had to start over. A thanks goes to Bisqwit who bravely tried to hex my movie togheter again but with no success. It was good though because I managed to improve it slightly after I restarted. Another thanks goes to Angerfist who helped me check the fcm at one point. And finally, thanks Tourian for everlasting patience ;)

	"I don't have much more to say about the run itself. It's an improvement over my old one with 2 minutes and 39 seconds and I tried hard at the bonus sections to get the best time units. The time units differ at some mountains but that is because I either gets up at the "wrong" side of them and has to take a different route, or that both players has a slight different timing when they arrived there. It doesn't differ much though and I made sure to check that it was faster in frames than in time units.
	$LF
	"For example: Mountain 20 has 31.8 time units left where mountain 12 (which has the same bonus section has 32.6 time units left. It was ~200 frames faster though.

	"Oh, and sometimes it was better to let one player die, and sometimes it was unavoidable. The speed upwards however is not affected.
