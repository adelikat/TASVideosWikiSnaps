	"A Nightmare on Elm Street is a game I'd describe as medium rare, in that it's roughly in the middle of Rare's development library when ordering it by quality. Released in October 1989 in Europe and October 1990 in Europe 2: But They're In America, the game exists. Between one to four kids (depending on how slow you want the game to run) shamble about the titular Elm Street, punching everything in their way, except each other, because the real nightmares on Elm Street were the friends we made along the way. The game is probably known for either its music or the fact that a pissed-off bespectacled man once yelled at it a bunch.

	"Well hi! It's me, ya girl Samsara, back from a 3 year break and choosing the absolute perfect project to derust on: A horribly laggy video game with 4 players to manage. If I've learned anything in my break, it's that I'm apparently a literal insane person. My mentality with TASing has always been to challenge myself in some way. Pick a new system, pick a new genre, try something 2 player, stuff like that. Improving a very old 4 player TAS was the next logical step, if your definition of logic is the literal opposite of logic. This was a surprisingly quick project, actually. I got back in the groove quickly, worked hard, stayed fairly motivated the whole time, and... Welp, I mean, I actually have a result. More than I expected when I dropkicked that door down a few weeks back.

As much as I hate this stage, and as much as I hate how long of a stage it is because the exit's in the damn middle and you have to backtrack so much, and as much as I hate the screen, which is the worst thing in this game, this wasn't actually as horrible of an experience as I was expecting it to be. Improvements here are the same as in the last substage, about half lag and half gameplay. This is where the meat of the gameplay ends, the rest of the run is super straightforward except for the part where I still have 30 seconds left of time saves.

Anyway, completely preposterous things aside, I'm singling out the claw for a reason that I've already mentioned several times: Boss skips. This fight goes a lot quicker with four Athletes. It also lags quite a lot with four Athletes, but for once, doing it quicker means less lag overall. Hooray!

	"The screen normally moves at the same rate as the characters: 1.5 pixels per frame. When all four characters are ahead of the screen, though, the screen will move two pixels per frame to catch up. The screen position is what determines boss spawns (that's why the boss skips work in the first place, it's messing with the screen position to skip the triggers). When doing the boss skips, the characters will always stay around the middle of the screen, meaning the screen will be moving at a constant 1.5 pixels per frame. In the published run, chupapi generally has all four characters at the very right of the screen after each fight, meaning the screen is moving at a constant 2 pixels per frame, meaning he spends less time moving from boss to boss than I do.

	"I'm sure lag can be reduced more, but holy hell it was a chore. You'd think massive gameplay improvements would lead to a lot more than 5 seconds of lag saved, but the way the game works makes it near impossible to have consistent lag savings. The middle section of the run I actually end up losing a few seconds of lag over the published run (though the gameplay improvements outweigh all of it), but I have no idea how I could've fixed that, and I end up gaining back everything I lost and then some over the rest of the run without understanding why. I'm chalking it up to emulation differences
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"I have this really insane idea to use the game's sleep mechanic for a potential improvement. Imagine being able to use the Athlete form that decimates the bosses for entire levels. It jumps higher and can fire projectiles, which would lead to drastically different (and faster) routes and much easier lag management through faster enemy killing... The drawback is that it takes forever to fall asleep, and you have to deal with Freddy attacking you every now and then, so I don't think this would actually be an improvement.

I was in denial over having been abused in a previous relationship, I had started to watch my family drift apart due to a massive increase of internal tension, and eventually I realized just how much all of that was affecting me and my time on the site. Being staff, especially, while also being as volatile as I was back then... It wasn't something I could allow myself to keep doing. I stepped down to give myself some room to breathe, but things kept getting worse in my personal life, and eventually I exploded and left the site for good. I knew that if I ever came back, it wouldn't be until I was comfortable enough to ask for a second chance. It took a good year to even start considering coming back, but it only ever took a few seconds of thinking about it to convince myself that I wasn't ready yet.

I was expecting to spend the first week back explaining myself, the second week back apologizing, the third week back being silent and embarrassed, and the fourth week back as a casual mix of the first three weeks because not everyone is around all the time, but it took me roughly two days to realize that...

The game is a bit laggy and ultimately there wasn't a ton of variety to character movement, so it's not exactly incredible, but it's still good.
