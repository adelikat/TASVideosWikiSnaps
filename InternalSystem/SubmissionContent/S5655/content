	[a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Gunman rel=noopener external nofollow 
		"Wild Gunman
	]a
	" (NES), basically the objetive of this game is Shot faster than your different opponents, until finally you've beated Wes Flowers and become "The World Fastest Quickdraw". In this TAS, I'll get the fastest time possible to beat all my opponents in 0,02 or 0,03 seconds (TASing a game that aims for fastest goals lol).

[div class=p 
	"Why sometimes 0,03?: Well, I was in doubt at this when I was starting the TAS, but I have discovered it! Reloadin' Reg and some others it's impossible to get 0,02, minimun time its 0,03, BUT Stinky Steve and others its possible to get 0,02 but this time when I was in Steve's Stage, it started and some sub-frames has passed (a bit more than half-frame), so when it was the "DRAW!" time, (for example) if I shot in the frame 1, nothing happens, and If I shot in the frame 2 It gets 0,025 instead of 0,016 because the sub-frames at the start, it appears 0,03 because the game uses the system "half (0,5) or more = 1" (and that's the reason of the 0,02 and not 0,1). Instead, if I wait 1 frame for getting 0,02 I don't save any frame (or sub-frame) or I lost frames, I've tried that way (in Round 1) to get 0,02 but happens that 2 things I've said. I think if I was focused in-game time instead of real time, I've did this :p

[div class=p 
	"Why did you wait in some Double Shot stages?: Stages like Desertin Damodar, Dancing Dom, Crazy Carlos, The Double Shot is active in no more than 10 frames, but in Mad Mike and Double Shot Duke it takes more frames (almost 1 second) to activate the Second Shot :( (stupid game system 
	[small

	").
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Most Difficult Stages?: Stages like Headmaster Helen because "DRAW!" time starts like 15 frames before she even touch the gun, Stages like Desertin Damodar because in Shot 1 its normal but in the Shot 2 I have to shake to reload and Shot instantly, and the most difficult: Strickland Bros. (I HAAAAATE THEEEM) and Wes Flowers because I wanted to be precise in this last stage :p

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"1) "If a game consists of presenting a story, with little to no user creativity altering the game in any way, then it is unacceptable. This includes games which are overwhelmingly made up of cut scenes, with little to no user interaction anywhere. For example, Super Adventure Rockman."
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"This game consists of nothing more than pre-rendered video, and a small bit of interaction in order to shoot the person you're supposed to shoot. If considering the total amount of actual game play, there's probably about a second or two at most in a run of nearly 11 minutes in length.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"2) "The run must not be seen as trivial."
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"This ties into the first rule, as this game appears to be trivial from a TASing perspective. Despite this run aiming for Vault (and the votes would seem to indicate that this is to be considered a Vault-tier movie), we still have the option to reject a run if the run is deemed to be too trivial.
