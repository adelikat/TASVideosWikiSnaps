	"The precision of the making of this movie was greatly improved from
	$LF
	"the past. What most influenced that outcome, was an emulator feature,
	$LF
	"an FCEU extension, that shows the following things each frame:
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" Position and speed of Rockman (X, Y) at subpixel precision

		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" Combined with the data collected at 
				[a href=/GameResources/NES/Rockman/Data 
					"Rockman Data

		" BisqBot, a rerecording robot, was used to manipulate the weapon refills and to fight the Wily3 boss.

	"A lot of wall-passing / wrapping / zipping techniques are used in this movie.
	$LF
	"And this “a lot” means... adjectives are not enough to describe it.
	$LF
	"It has became increasingly difficult for even an expert player to comprehend what is going on in this movie.
	$LF
	"In a few situations, what appears on the screen is not what happens in the game.
	$LF
	"For example, Rockman may appear to pass through a spike unharmed or jump from air.
	$LF
	"In such situations, he’s usually temporarily inhabiting the “next screen” that
	$LF
	"is different from the one being displayed. Except, when he really actually hits
	$LF
	"a spike and still survives (this happens in Bombman stage).
