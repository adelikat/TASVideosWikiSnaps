Because of course I would do that instead of 3DS or Flash games first... Definitely... Absolutely... im so stupid LMAO

	"This is a TAS of Super Luigi 8 Bit 2D, a Super Mario 64 demake for the Game Boy. Instead of a 3D platformer starring Mario, it is now a top-down adventure game where you play as (red) Luigi. It was created by tononyto and the game can be obtained here:

	"This movie obtains all 3 stars available in this demo, beating King Bob-Omb and getting to the ending screen in record time. You can skip the optional star at the floating island with the monkeys, but I decide to collect it to showcase as much of the game as possible. There is another segment where you can enter a flying minigame, and go through 5 rings, but the game doesn't give you anything if you go through all 5 of them, no star at all, so I decided to skip it. The minimum stars required is 2 since you need to collect the Chain Chomp star in order to enter the next area in the level.

	"Right out of the bat, this game has some pretty wonky movement. It always feels like there's a delay for whenever you turn into one of the 8 directions, or even when you want to stop moving.

	"For some reason, when I enter Peach's Castle, the music completely glitches up, but it fixes itself when I enter Bob-Omb Battlefield. This only happened once to me in this TAS, casually I didn't encounter this audio glitch.

	"You can punch by pressing B. The log in the Chain Chomp area is punched at the right side, and with perfect rhythm. When entering the summit, I carefully move around to not get stuck. The walls can be very deceptive. I'm forced to collect the mushroom since it blocks the way.

	"The king just stands there for a while until he starts throwing bombs at you. I get to the most optimal position as I can to punch the bombs back at him as early as I possibly can. It looks rather janky at times... Hit him 3 times, and the fight is over. I don't know if theres a way you can speed up the fight in any way or make the king throw the bombs earlier.
