[ul 
	[li 
		"The "pit glitch". It's possible to walk downwards across pits one square tall, but only on some frames for some reason. Thanks to dezbeast for finding this trick!
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Bringing up the Start menu right before the text at the beginning of dungeons will cancel the text. This can be timed with an item switch to save some extra waiting.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		""Wall clips". If you climb a ladder from as far to the side as possible, pass by a vertical section of wall, then push into it, Link will be pushed to the top of the next segment of wall. If you wallclip below the top segment, you'll fall all the way down the ladder without having to climb down. Also, if you see Link suddenly teleport to the top of a wall, that's the result of this trick.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		""Superjumping". When doing a glitched pegasus boots dash, you can jump to be sent flying in a different direction. For example, when doing an u/d pegasus boots dash (which sends you up/right diagonally), jumping will send you downward across the entire screen (unless you bump into something). Unfortunately, it has somewhat limited uses, since it's very easy to bump into a wall and cancel the jump.

[ul 
	[li 
		"The A/B/Start/Select trick is used again to skip the text from opening chests (and other texts, in a few limited circumstances). I discovered that the optimal method is to let the object appear out of the chest for 5 frames, then A/B/Start/Select (previously, I would turn off frame advance because my keyboard couldn't press all those keys at once). This saves several frames off of any chest I need to open.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Much more precise movements. I tried to never let Link bump against a wall unless it was necessary or saved time. I also tried to walk as close to walls as possible (note that it's possible to clip the edge of a wall and walk a few extra pixels inward).
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Diagonal jumping with the feather. It was discovered about halfway through the previous run that it's faster to jump diagonally with the feather than simply walking diagonally. I make full use of this trick whenever I have the feather equipped.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Key bounces. Sometimes, when a key drops onto a square in a dungeon, it will bounce once before Link can collect it. It was seemingly unavoidable, but this time I found out that it's dependant on the frame Link enters the room.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"More Save and Quit warps (S&Q). Generally, if Link has to cross two screen transitions to reach a door, it's faster to S&Q warp. The exception is for the Piece of Power - for the PoP to drop, I have to kill a certain number of enemies, but S&Q warping will reset that number. So, I have to avoid S&Q warps until after I've used the Piece of Power.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		""Door closes". Link pauses for a few frames while a door is opening, unless he is in the air at the time. So, I avoid many unnecessary waits by jumping when a door opens.
