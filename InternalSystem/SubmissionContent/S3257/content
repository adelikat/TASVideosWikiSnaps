	"The last boss,I have a great miss in the previous run that I ignored the small robot can drop items just like C H L Bomb..
	$LF

[p 
	"When L hits the boss, the other items and pistal cannot hit it.
	$LF
	"So I must throw bombs when L stopped
	$LF

[p 
	"The bomb can only hit the first 2 bosses and Metal "See you in the hell" 50 HP.
	$LF
	"But it can hit the last boss 100 damage.However,the fire would not change.
