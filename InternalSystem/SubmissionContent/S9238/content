				"Early elevator in Stage 4, Abandoned Mine, was probably assumed to be impossible. TASers would delay spawning the second elevator after saving Maria because if you spawn the elevator, and you fail to jump onto the highest platform, you lose a lot of time waiting for the first cycle to finish. It fails mostly because there is a ghost there, I do believe that they did search for best possible frame for it to work, but it is actually kind of obscure and not easy to find. I spent a lot of time trying to find that frame and thankfully I found it through a really precise way that avoids getting hit by the ghost. It saves 3 seconds
