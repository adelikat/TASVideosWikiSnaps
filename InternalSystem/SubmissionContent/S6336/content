	"Super Mario Bros. contains a very secret debug menu which the developers used for testing the physics and behavior of the game, as well as add fun options while they were bored. One of these options includes an "acid trip" mode which is the first known example of procedural generation in video games and the first usage of the "portal gun", popularized later by Valve's Portal series, and served as the inspiration for the completely unrelated fangame Mari0 (of which this is definitely not a TAS of). The mode is a joke on Mario's famous powerup mushrooms.
