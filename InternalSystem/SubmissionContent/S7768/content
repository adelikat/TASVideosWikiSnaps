	"So this is a pretty huge improvement for this game.  Originally the improvements came from better optimization here and there, but then I discovered a huge time save regarding the red poles you might have seen in some levels.  if you swing off of the poles, you can set your movement speed to be slightly faster than normal horizontal speed, almost the same speed as taking a speed potion.  There's only one level where doing this doesn't seem to save time, but it really cuts a ton of frames in some horizontal levels.

	"anyways Chuck D Head's movement can affect how high he jumps, his acceleration is pretty unbearably slow at times, but if he's at full speed he can jump higher.  He also has a hover mechanic which in a TAS setting is way more exploitative.

	"For the bosses, it's optimal to have the head and Chuck's face attacking on the same frame as that does 100 points of damage, otherwise both attacks do 50 at once.  The previous publication fought this boss but did one hit with just the head on the ground, so through some VERY CAREFUL movements, I was able to get the head to stay on the ground to keep the attacks at 100 damage.

	"This is the first stage where we use a powerup, I use it after I jump out of the water because otherwise his jump would be to high for us to control, we use the speed powerup to let us run fast out of the level, then do a glitch where we bounce off of an enemy and a projectile to get out of bounds, and skip the boss of the stage.  We can also preserve the speed we have by continuously floating.
