	". It was originally made for PC in 1999, with a demake for the NES releasing in 2022 along with his other horror games. You play as Freddy Krueger, who has to play through a short version of the movie as well as a bonus nightmare level.

	"The game allows us to press start on frame 372, after a short developer logo plays. We also press start on frame 459, the first frame where the level's opening quote appears.

[div class=p 
	"Shortly after Josh's dream starts, we head left to keep up with him. Then we drop a barrel off of our platform and turn around. The barrel misses Josh, but it's all part of the game, more or less. By holding R at the right time, we can get the next cutscene to load 1 frame earlier, on frame 3058 instead of 3059.

[div class=p 
	"After the plot thickens a bit, we have to scale a wall as leftmost as possible. This action is interrupted for several seconds by a textbox. Once we scale said wall, we run - or should I say - float after Josh as a massive head.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Then, after Josh falls, we have to chase after him and kill him. This is once again interrupted by text, but this time there are 2 textboxes, so this takes quite a while.

[div class=p 
	"After this, we don't have to do anything for nearly a minute. We just watch the movie pan out. But then, on frames 10275-10376, we have to briefly chase Amanda and Mike. And just like that, we've disappeared again.

	"After the teacher swears, gets partially possessed by us and probably gets sacked from her job, all this while Amanda runs away from the classroom, we chase Mike out of said classroom as well.

[div class=p 
	"Then Mike runs through a couple of corridors, leading to our massive head with a robotic claw. We slice him with our claw on the first frame of the cutscene.

[div class=p 
	"Mike - expectedly - dies as a result, and Amanda runs away to her college dorm. We follow her to this room and get into contact with her as soon as possible. A quick thing to note in this part is that attacking Amanda from as far away as we can is 2 frames faster than just running to her.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"After Amanda goes down stairs that are "like quicksand", we chase after her and don't get slowed down by them at all. Then we have to attack Amanda using our powers. In this part, I discovered that by pressing A and B at the same time, we can kill Amanda on the first frame of the cutscene. For refrence, the RTA record performed by JoePulito does this in about a second.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Then us and Amanda split ways, and while that happens, we shapeshift into Mike. The next cutscene is a pick-your-dialogue section with 4 options per part. Now, it's time to use another one of my micro-optimisation findings. I found that by pressing 0-3 of the direction buttons as well as A all at the same time, we can select any option on the first frame possible. After this section, we enter the next cutscene, where we have to mash A and B as fast as possible in order to resist Amanda's love for Josh. 60 button presses can be done per second with this - 30 As a second and 30 Bs a second. Then we just have to hold right for 2 more screens as we chase Amanda down the path.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Now it's time for the final chase of the main level. On the first 2 screens of this chase, we have to climb down 3 ladders. Then we have to head south-east as everyone else but Amanda falls down either a drain or a bottomless pit. In the next section, we have to make a bridge in order to keep up with Amanda. This has to be done on quite a specific frame, otherwise we get 9 or 10 lag frames instead of the ideal 8. Then we chase Amanda through a hole in a brick wall, break a hanging light and kill Amanda. And that's the end of that.

	"Then we go back to where we started - Dream 2. This room is themed after the famous 1980 arcade game Pac-Man, with Pac-Man himself being our massive head. We have to munch all 4 of the ghosts as fast as possible. No power pellets required here.
