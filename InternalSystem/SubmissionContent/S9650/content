	"Metroid One Zone is a ROM hack of Metroid: Zero Mission developed by DuoLa Ayu. The hack was developed in 10 days mainly as a demonstration of the MAGE tool's ability to modify Metroid: Zero Mission, but the developer refined it further into a compact but polished standalone hack. This hack was released on 1 April 2025 where the main joke (I guess, kinda?) was that the Easy mode was designed to troll exactly one person in the Metroid Construction community while the other two difficulties are proper play experiences.

	"I still had the hack fresh in my head and got that drive in me to TAS this game a bit further. Hard mode has a fairly different starting progression compared to Normal mode for both the any% and 100% routes and I felt the Hard 100% routing was mostly straightforward even with the bit of backtracking needed. This also shows off most of what this hack has to offer outside the intentionally jokey Easy mode.

Mainly, Hard mode has a unique area all its own where Charge Beam (needed for Super Missiles), Super Missiles (needed for Hi-Jump Boots), and Hi-Jump Boots (needed for Morph Ball) are mandatory progression items. Also worth noting is that the door in the starting area that goes to the Power Grip room is permanently closed on that side which forces a different route when collecting all of the items on the map.

However, in my testing the time to lay the power bomb outweighed the benefit of regaining control since it mostly caused a time loss of 10-20 frames. The one use I got out of it was in the room with the regular Bomb item since that alleviated the need to take the time morphing into a ball to clear the way out with a bomb and unmorphing.

For this hack this affects Ridley, Kraid, and the hanging Kiru Giru (the Zero Mission Spore Spawn-like). This hack enables turning off a given suit upgrade for this reason but, again, it's not a problem since plasma isn't available for Hard mode Ridley and the other two bosses are solved with the many super missiles on hand.

Taking the left passageway to the far left vertical shaft a hidden path is taken by firing a super missile at the wall to open a secret path.

At least one power bomb is required to reach the next part of Hard mode. The hi-jump boots passageway is entered again, this time going through to reach the elevator. The left morph ball path from the top part is taken and the second power bomb tank is obtained with the space jump. After obtaining the tank, the elevator is taken again to return to the starting room and then the main Hard mode elevator. Back in the Hard mode vertical shaft the lower left path is taken.

The main thing that's done in this fight is to use the missiles and super missiles at the start of the fight and use charge shots while waiting for super missile drops. This fight has a lot of RNG concerns that I wasn't a fan of. The first RNG problem is getting Ridley to fire the big fireballs as soon as possible. While I didn't get the near immediate fireballs after the initial attack I did manage to get two big fireball attacks shortly after he turned around which I felt was acceptable enough.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"The second RNG problem was getting super missile drops, since super missiles have the highest DPS, from the big fireballs which was a more frustrating experience. Samus entered the fight with 4 regular missiles and 2 super missiles which is burned quickly. While I did manage to find the drop rates on some enemies and objects for Metroid: Zero Mission, it was missing the RNG rates for Ridley's big fireballs. While it might have shared the rate with something else I didn't see any notes on that so I kind of had to do a bit of experimenting to get drops. The first set of big fireballs did give 2 super missile drops for 4 extra shots as well as a bunch of regular missile drops. The second set of big fireballs was less kind, where for a lot of it I got just big health drops. I managed get one with the last super missile drop I needed to end the fight quickly with a couple of supplemental regular missile shots to reduce the amount of super missiles needed by 1 more.

	"Eagle eyed viewers might have noticed one of the charge shots hitting the small fireball rather than Ridley. That's a definite mistake but I was already kind of frustrated with the item drops and all that realistically affected was maybe firing one regular missile.

A power bomb is set and Samus is timed to leave and re-enter the room to skip the lengthy glass breaking cutscene, opening up an upper and lower path. The upper path is taken as there's a missile pack on the way to another upgrade. Another power bomb is set so it goes off while the missile pack text is onscreen to essentially have the wait on the explosion go off when the player loses control anyways. This clears a row of blocks to access the upper door to the Gravity Suit. While this hack doesn't automatically give the varia suit with it, this enables free movement throughout lava, water, and mysterious green goo. Convenient for speeding up movement.

Once the super missile pack is obtained, Samus goes past the door to get the Bomb (regular) (singular) upgrade but places a power bomb before picking it up. This serves the dual purpose of clearing the exit path from the upgrade as crumble blocks, uh, block the entrance to the bombs and regaining control after clearing the bomb text on the screen to move towards the exit before the armor menu shows up. This is the one case I found where using a power bomb to regain control sooner than intended saved actual time as it avoided the need to place and wait on a regular bomb to clear the way.

A shinespark is stored while Samus moves to the top middle part of the room under a breakable block. This section would normally require multiple ballsparks if the gravity suit wasn't obtained. With the gravity suit the only stop the ballspark needs is the one at the end where an up shinespark is needed to reach the super missile tank. Unmorphing for the shinespark allows Samus to hit the ceiling sooner to regain control compared to staying in ball form for an up ballspark.

Samus then moves through the acid, shooting to reveal the missile pack hidden in the room with minimal slowdown. Samus then builds speed going left while shooting to open the door. Space boosting is used to avoid the speed boost block on the ground that would cancel the boost as well as make the travel to the left much quicker.
