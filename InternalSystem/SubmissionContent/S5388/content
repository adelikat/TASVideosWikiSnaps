	"This is an improvement of 875 frames (14.6s) over the previous submission by ArandomGameTASer.  Improvements came from better speed control around corners, more usage of apples to get past enemies, more use of Hitbox Sword Extension, and subtle differences between getting past each enemy pack.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"No improvements on the first section, but managed to squeeze 12 frames by leaping over a guard, rather than just killing him.  Afterwards, properly aiming apples on the upper section gives us another few frames saved.

[p 
	"A more shallow angle saves 1 frame from first banister.  Ascending the rope manually saves an additional short jump to get up.  The boss gets a nice improvement this time.  By making sure each jump goes closer to the him, each one can be shorter and thus more frequent.  So much in fact that he doesn't even get the opportunity to create any offensive barrels to throw.

[p 
	"All the periodic platforms that you can see are on a global timer, 
	$LF
	"which sadly cannot be advanced in any way.  This puts a huge cap on basically every section of the level, preventing any real improvements from emerging.  What's rather stupid though, is that they don't actually start animating until the camera gets sufficiently close, which can often mean we arrive at basically a blank wall.  This is what needs to be overcome if we want to find some real improvements, which managed to be done in just one place.  Near the end, rather than slowly ascending through jumps to get to the last section, we can instead pause for a split second for a quick vertical camera pan, to make sure that the platform loads sooner, so that when we resume our climb it'll actually still be there.  This managed to save 1 full platform cycle, giving a massive 257 frame improvement on the final stretch.

	"05 Cave of Wonders

[p 
	"Slight optimisations throughout, with one large saving.  Properly controlling x coords managed to get us a skid jump on the necessary platform, to leap across and skip the section beneath the ghosts.

[h4 
	"06 The Escape
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"A few frames were saved at the start, but makes no difference as the small falling rocks are also on the global timer.  This means we need a little pause to bypass them, which evens out our time again.  But for the second half, delaying our skid to the appropriate time means we can jump past the trigger which spawns the top boulder.  This gives us access to the upper route, which is a nice stretch of land without intermediate jumps; giving us more skids and saves 48 frames getting across.

	"As this level is on rails, don't expect any improvements.

	"08 Inside the Lamp
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Despite being overlooked on previous runs, skidding can actually be performed along the blue genie trails that you see; it's just that they have less room for error.  The global timer still does control a few things, such as platform movement, but that doesn't mean we can't find other improvements.  Using an additional balloon gets us close enough to activate a finger flicker from behind, giving us a nice time boost.  That, plus using a hidden genie spring near the middle saves us time going around, giving this level the largest saving of the run.

	"09 Sultan's Palace

[p 
	"Better optimisation hopping across the Flamingos, better speed control going around corners, and faster Iago battle by jumping up on the barrel.

[h4 
	"10 Jafar's Palace
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Each stretch of this level gets improved by a few frames, plus far less damage gets taken in the process.  This does give us extra skids, as well as enough HP at the end to afford a slightly faster boss strat.  A considerable saving despite no extra shortcuts being discovered.
