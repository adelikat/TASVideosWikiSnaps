	"This was one of my favorites. I played it a lot, as it was quite addictive. It was programmed by a repeat coder named Mark Tuttle, which has a number of other fine games through out the magazine's life. What I find amazing is that the crew at "Compute's Gazette" challenged themselves to see how far they could get. The highest level achieved was number 9. I'm not surprised, as my analysis and TASing of this game shows that Levels 8 through 10 are completely unpredictable and completely unfair. It would actually require RNG manipulating in order to set the levels to be playable...as some layouts and block speeds are just too much to handle for a human.

	"This is the first BASIC written game that I've submitted. Thankfully, this makes it much easier to analyse and understand what is going on with figuring out how to make the TAS faster. This happens to be the 3rd game I've TAS, that was a BASIC sourced game. After seeing the same problems in this TAS, as with the other two, I finally had to sit down and figure out what is going on with controlling RNG. Below are some details that I determined for manipulating this game.
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		"First off, I need to mention that all my previous submissions were written in pure Machine Language (ML). RNG is completely determined in a different manner than BASIC written games. Instead of calling on the BASIC command, ML programs will scan an address to get a single digit from the last value of the "tick" counter. This is used by applications in different ways to perform different actions....thus the feel of RNG.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"RNG for BASIC games are controlled with the use of the command, RND. In this case, randomization is determined by use of a positive number. In viewing the code, you will see that it is written as "RND(1)". Because of this use, the game cannot be manipulated during play. The parts that are controlled, with this method...are the maze "holes" laid out on the template maze of each screen.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"This game also includes ML routines that are loaded up, after starting the game. Because of this, certainly parts of the game can be controlled in the manner of a purely ML written game. In this case, the moving blocks are controlled by this routine and can be manipulated to have various speeds; although, very difficult to control precisely.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"ML RNG can be controlled by pressing keys or a joystick direction. By doing this, an interrupt is made and the tick value will be different...by the time it is requested for an RNG value.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"BASIC RNG can be controlled by doing a "Pre-load" command, using RND before loading up the game. No matter what the situation is, if a program is calling on the use of RND(1), it will always be the same sequence of randomization. For some games, this has been a flaw and was corrected in future issues...due to it being extremely predictable.

	"While this is the first instance of someone using the

		"RND
	]b
	" command being to seed RNG, it's a valid use of the system.   Further, because it's performed before the game is even loaded into memory, the command is simply setting up the system environment.  Essentially this is makes it akin to setting an RTC in PC emulators or the various other systems that have real time clocks and use that time information for RNG seeding.  Interestingly, this would have been doable on a real C64 system (potentially even easier than setting an RTC as we do for other systems), thus there's no reason for us to exclude that ability here as it doesn't modify the game in any way.
