The tank superjumps is an abuse of the fact that the tank has a bigger hitbox than any other form due to its size. When you go parallel to the side of a platform placed above water or lava, if you give a wiggle, the tank will magically gain speed.
	$LF
	"The theory that we came up is that some generic code written for all Banjo forms considers that the tank is not on the ground, while the hitbox is still on the ground dueto its massive hitbox. This conflict confuses the game to give the tank more speed, as it thinks that it’s about to fall of a platform, but since we’re going parallel to the side of the platform, we do not fall.

	"After that, we superjump our way back into Grunty’s Industries, where we follow with lots of superjumps to help us collect gold nuggets up until we hit the spring pad pad switch. after that, we go into the laggiest place in the game, the platforms that we reach with the spring pad, and then head up-left into a part that is deceiving hard to do RTA: the blistering buttons. Doing a diagonal pack whack requires you to release 2 directions (ex.: up and left) on the same frame in order to face diagonally, because holding the 2 directions while pressing B would make you roll instead. When leaving, we want to be sure to be at 3 HP for upcoming damage boost.

This skips riding a really slow platform across the lava. After that, we damage our way into the tunnel that leads to Klungo 3, fight him, and damage boost our way out. Fun fact: the Spiller’s Harbor music plays for a few seconds during the cutscene after you beat Klungo 3, this is most likely an oversight from the developers. After that, we melt the gold nuggets to get a jiggy, then leave Grunty Industries. We unfortunately need to visit the Grunty Industry twice, due to where the jinjos and the jinjo oracle statue are.

After that, we get a jiggy and some notes on our way to Mumbo’s pad, at which point we do the stuff that requires transformations.

	"Doing octopus -> candle -> tank saves about half a second from doing tank -> octopus -> candle or tank -> candle -> octopus, as scrolling from the tank to the octopus for the first transformation loses no time, and doing the candle before the tank saves time from the fact that the fireworks don’t block the tank when you’re doing that section. Getting rid of the notes and the fireworks early by Mumbo’s pad also reduces lag in that area for when I pass as the tank.

At this point, we head towards a puzzle that only the candle can do, doing a really precise jump in the cave. the puzzle is always the same, but had to lose time from killing a ghost that wouldn’t move out the way.

It’s the most dreaded part of speedruns, and it took me 10k to 15k rerecords to manipulate that, due to extraordinarily bad luck.

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"At first, I really wasn’t using the BizHawk tools to do a speedrun. I was instead using TAStudio for 2 things: getting a better understanding of the tricks and certain jumps that are made in the real-time speedrun, and getting myself used to TAStudio before making a TAS. I really have to say that using TAStudio makes understanding what I do, for the fact that it’s much easier to go through each frame, as opposed to traditional savestates which make rewinds a little weird to do without knowing the frame that you want to reach. The “insert frame” feature of TAStudio also was making it easy to delay inputs by 1 or many frames to see the possible window for an input. I really wish people did this more, TAStudio practice is so good.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"After I felt like I was decent at using TAStudio, I started doing a 10 jiggies TAS of this game. 10 jiggies is a meme category that is pretty self-explanatory: get 10 jiggies as fast as possible. This was done mainly to get myself used to actually doing optimisation with TAStudio. The TAS can be found here:

	" .
	$LF
	"This TAS was done over only a few days, as I didn’t fully optimise the hardest sections, nor did I put much effort in doing RNG manip. I also made this without any intention to submit this on TASVideos, due to the highly arbitrary choice of goal, and from the fact that nobody would care about watching it. But it did the practice that I needed in order to make the 100% TAS.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"After that, I started messing around with a script graciously made by Blazephlozard, that displayed the position and the speed of BK. I hadn’t messed around with any of memory watching until now, and it made some things a lot easier when making the TAS, mainly from finding tiny movement optimisations, and finding a way to get the fastest speed out of a superjump. There wasn’t much known about RNG until when I got into the mansion in BMB in the TAS making. At that time, Blazephlozard managed to find the RAM address of the RNG value. With that, it was much easier to figure out what changed RNG, and what didn’t, which made me spend my time more efficiently past that point. Huge shoutouts to Blazephlozard for that.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"I will say, there’s 2 points in the TAS where I almost gave up. The first being at the very beginning, where there are a lot of gruntlings to manipulate, and then the mansion in BMB, where the gruntlings just refused to get out of way. RNG manip is not a fun thing, but I had to learn to persevere in the first case, and to give up on having perfect RNG in the second case, as there was no fast way to change the RNG fast enough to get to good values. Other than RNG manip, I will say that the rest of the making of the TAS was lots of fun, and I really enjoyed the experience.
