	"Explanations on this run's improvements:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Most of the time saved came from some OoB using the fact that at the beginning of each level, the inputs usually used for doing double jumps automatically created a glitch with the character's sprite; knowing that he is loaded first, then the enemies and the level itself is loaded last, I managed to discover that if a collision between the character and an enemy occurs before the game loads the level, it is possible to force the game to eject the player past the map's boudaries.
	$LF
	"I've also found 2 other OoB that unfortunately lead to instant death because you end up "spawning" in the water or inside spikes!!
	$LF

[p 
	"I've also saved time with route optimizations, which was not easy because sonikkustar's run was very well done on that front, hats off to him since gaining those few frames has been a tough job!!
	$LF

[p 
	"Last bits: an improvement on the lava boss where I manipulated him to come faster to me so that I could attack sooner. I could also improve the final boss; to do that I worked on the fact that "DOWN+C" followed by a "blank" input then other "DOWN+C" inputs create what I call an "elevator glitch" that causes the character to be raised (floating) above the ground...
	$LF
	"...Knowing this, it is then possible to replace the blank input with "UP+B", so we end up floating but now with the weapon pointing up, an ideal position to constantly touch the hitbox of the boss.

	"I've also played through the whole run with visual glitches that only serve an entertaining purpose to the viewer, to whom I'd say as a last word:
