	"Bored of waiting to get past the Piranha Plants guarding Bowser's lair, Mario decides that this time he will stop along the way to pick up a fire flower. He tests it out on many of the World 8 enemies, and finally, for good measure, gives Bowser the blasting he deserves.
	$LF
	"Much to his surprise, he finds that he has arrived 12 frames earlier than ever before!

	"The main change to this run is picking up a fire flower to avoid waiting for the piranha plants guarding the pipes in 8-4, saving 170 frames within 8-4. There were several good options for where to get the powerups:
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		"4-1: The fastest overall for mushroom (81f) and close to it for fire flower (79f) - this has the advantage that you would usually have to wait for the timer to tick down at the end of the level to avoid fireworks. The fire flower is not feasible here as all previous places to pick up a mushroom are very slow (119f+).
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"4-2: Another fast fire flower (77f), since it spawns in a place where you would have to pass by anyway. Furthermore, when Big Mario is walking underneath the low wall, the game classes him as being inside the wall, and tries to push him out, gaining 1 pixel per frame.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"8-2 and 8-3: As with 4-1, you would usually have to wait for the timer to tick down to avoid fireworks. In this case, the timer we are avoiding ends in 3, and picking up the extra item loses 2 in-game time units, so we end up still having to wait to avoid the timer ending in 1. In both cases, the fire flower loses much more time (93f).

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"I didn't test thoroughly to see the exact amount of time picking up a mushroom in 4-2 loses, since all of the later fire flowers are too slow, and this also loses the benefit of walking underneath the low wall as Big Mario. Combined, these combinations would be slower.
