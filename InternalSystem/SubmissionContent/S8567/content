	"Klonoa can only move, jump, flutter (for ~1s) and throw his ring to try to catch an enemy (AKA Moo). If he is holding an enemy, he can throw him or use him to do a double-jump in the air. Unlike most PSX games, this game runs at 60 FPS.

	"Some game elements use frames rules based on a global timer, most notably air currents and Moo spawners (~4 frames rule for this one). It usually leads to needing different input for screens with air currents, as well as the ones where we must wait for a newly spawned Moo to be reachable.

	"In the air, Klonoa's speed goes instantly to 18432 in 1 frame (as long as his previous speed was lower than that), and in other cases increases by 2048 each frame. If his speed is higher than 53248 (0xD000), then it will decrease by 2048 instead. It means that once Klonoa reaches his aerial top speed, his speed will go up and down by 2048 until he is back on the ground.

[div class=p 
	"While randomly jumping would usually result in a slower speed than just walking, jumping at specific speeds in order to get a high "aerial speed pairing" is actually faster than walking. The highest pairing you can get is 53248-55296 (so a speed of 54272 on average), which is ~1,6% faster than walking, saving on average 2 frames every 3 jumps. The best and fastest way to get a high pairing when Klonoa is already at max walking speed (and that this speed would not give a high pairing) is often to stop moving for one frame (which sligthly decreases Klonoa's speed) and then start moving again until a high pairing is available (after 4 or 5 frames usually).

	"Rivers (visions 2-2 and 4-2) : They give a boost of speed of 45056 (0xB000), and most of them are slopes, so you can reach a speed cap of either ~98300 or 126976. In both cases, stopping to move gives an instant extra boost of speed of 45056 but then the speed decreases by 2048 each frame. Starting to move again gives an instant penalty of speed of 45056 and then the speed increases like normal (depending if it's a slope or not). From my calculations, the optimal way to move under these conditions is to reach the cap, then stop moving for 1 frame, then move again until the cap and repeat the process. If a screen ends with a river, it may be better to totally stop moving at the end.

		" Wall clip: When trying to get close to a wall while holding an enemy and in the air, the game will reposition Klonoa, however it will not do this if Klonoa isnt looking left or right. In addition, if Klonoa wasn't repositioned and try to move through the wall for 1 frame (and then looking up or down for at least 1 frame), the game will shift him a little bit on the left. After doing this enough time, Klonoa will be so far to the left that the game will not try to reposition him anymore. As an extension of this glitch, you can carry enemies through passages with low ceilings, which in some cases can break the level design (like vision 6-1).

		" Storing a double-jump: When Klonoa try to jump while in the air and while his ring catched an enemy, the game will automatically do a double-jump once the ring is back to him. However if in the meantime Klonoa is on the ground, the double-jump will be stored and will be done as soon as Klonoa leaves the ground. It's usually a bad glitch since we want to avoid double-jumps, but in the case of opening a door with a key it will save some time since we can regain control of Klonoa almost instantly instead of waiting for the cutscene to end.

		" Ultra jump: While in an air current sending you up, you can cancel a double jump by throwing your ring (Square or Circle), leaving Klonoa and the Moo in a weird spot where the game will proceed with the double jump as soon as possible. However, this "as soon as possible" is only when Klonoa is in the air not throwing his ring, except in air currents where it will be as soon as Klonoa isn't pressing a new throw button (e.g. you must alternate between Square and Circle every single frame). Once the double jump is resumed, it will be performed at the expected vertical position but at Klonoa's current horizontal position, which under the right circunstances allow Klonoa to perform a double jump at a higher than intended position.

		" Displacement: Klonoa's horizontal coordinate is relative to the current "plane", said plane is only updated when Klonoa is on the ground. When landing in a new plane, Klonoa's horizontal coordinate is updated according to this plane, but is slightly displaced if Klonoa was moving left and pressed Up or Down at the frame he touched the ground. The displacement can send Klonoa slightly to the left or to the right depending only on the landing position. It is used frequently in the TAS to save few frames every time, as well as once to clip into an otherwize unclipable wall in 5-2.
