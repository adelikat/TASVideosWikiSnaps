	"Star Control is a game hybrid borrowing elements from Asteroids and Archon. The game mode in this run is called melee. In the melee mode the goal is to destroy all spacecraft of the enemy faction. There are two factions, Hierarchy and Alliance. Both factions have 7 unique spacecraft. Each spaceraft has a normal attack and a special attack. Each ship also has unique rules for fuel consumption and fuel regeneration.

	"I choose Alliance because after some testing it seems faster. I choose Chenjesu as my champion because it has a very strong weapon with practically infinite reach. A direct hit delivers 6 damage. Each crystal fragment deals 2 damage. Some spacecraft have a large hull, so many fragments can hit at once. The maximum damage that I can deliver with a single shot is with five crystal fragments exploding close to the hull of Vux, for a a total of 10 damage. Opportunities for a shot like that are rare. In the heat of the battle it is often better to do a direct hit or even just a small fragmentary hit. I never use the special attack of Chenjesu because it deals no direct damage and wastes all my fuel which regenerates slowly.
