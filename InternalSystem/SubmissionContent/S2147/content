	"This is an improvement over Nitsujas previously published run, it is 4784 frames (or just under 80 seconds) faster. The biggest improvements came from many of the bosses in the game (especially the boxing fight), by using even more dangerous strategies, and finding the address for boss health to make sure to use the optimal amount of hits to kill them (without having to slow down). But a lot of it also came from more optimized movement, pretty much everything is faster by some amount. Finally some seconds of the improvement is lag reduction. Note that whenever I don't use spindash where it looks like it would be faster to, it is either because using it too much will make me incapacitated for a few seconds or it actually isn't faster (usually due to having to wait for your chargemeter to go up).
