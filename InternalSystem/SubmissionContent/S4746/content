	"(Mrmory must be selected at Status Cursor in the Config Menu.) The game remember in which sub menu you entered last time. (Other than the Config Menu) The game remember the following menu: Use, Sort and Drop in Item. Use and Sort in Spell. Next and Return in Status. The options in Equip. The game remember, if the last menu was horizontal, or vertical and remember the number of options in this menu. If you go directly in the Config Menu when you open the main menu, the game doesn't remember any thing, so he will count an horizontal menu with one option only. Each sub menu has an ID. Item is 0, Status is 1, Spell is 2, ... Here is an example for a better view. Select Clear at Status Cursor. Close the main menu, then open it again. Then open Equip by selecting a character. Then goto Music, then press left once. You are now in the top position of a vertical menu that contains 5 options. (The same 5 options as in the Equip menu) If you press A there, you will open the sub menu ID No 0 (Item). If you press down once, then you press A, you will open the Status menu. If you select Memory at Status Cursor, the game will remember in wich position your cursor was if you press B in the hidden menu at Music. With Memory selected, open the main menu and goto Music directly and press left twice, then close the menu. The first time you press left, the game open the menu of 1 option only, because no sub menu was opened. The second time you press left, the game will try to move the cursor one space to the left, but there is only one option. It can't go right, of left. So the game will select the option ID #-1. Don't press A at this position, or the game will crash, because there is no sub menu with the ID #-1. So, if you close this menu at position -1, the game will remember it. This menu is horizontal, so the game will remember this -1 as the position in a horizontal menu. Now, open the main menu, then goto Equip and close it without exiting the main menu, then goto Music. Press left once. Now, we are in the vertical sub menu of Equip that contains 5 options. The horizontal position of the cursor is replaced at the remembered number of -1 and the the vertical position is at 0. Now press down once. The vertical position of the cursor is now at 1. Normaly, you are at the position of the Status menu, but because of some match calculation with both positions, the game doesn't really know on which ID you are, because the horizontal position is at -1, instead of 0. So, if you press A at this position, the game will make the following calculation for the ID of the menu to open (Vertical Position X total number of options at horizontal position + Horizontal Position) So, 1 X 1 + -1 = 0. So, the ID of the sub menu to open, is 0 (Item). But, as I say, the game is doing some miss calculation with the -1. So, he doesn't remember the last position of the cursor in the Inventory. So, the inventory list is now corrupted. Because of the name displayed for the unexisted items in the list, the game will screw up the name of your main character and the Dialog Option Trigger can be added there.
