	"The boxer hitten will move a little bit in the opposite direction of your punch so the best strat is to punch with the other hand and if necessary, move a little bit in the opposite direction of the opponent

	": The game is far from trivial, the run is faster than human records, the difficulty settings are correct, the ending (KO) is reached, everything in this run is legit. Game-play is as simplistic as most A2600 games, so even when feedback is somewhat above average, the rating will still be low. Accepting to Vault.
