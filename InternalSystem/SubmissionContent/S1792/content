	"Before watching the run, I suggest you to play the game yourself a few times. I myself only came till the second level (there are three levels). You only have one life, and you cannot save in this difficult fighting game, which can be quite frustrating at times. I chose the Gameboy version because there is already a run for the NES-version (but both differ somewhat).
