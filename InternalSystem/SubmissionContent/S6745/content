	"Asterix and the Great Rescue is a platformer. Asterix and his friend Obelix need to go to Rome to rescue some friends. This run shows of a bunch of new glitches, tricks, and routes. Additionally, it carefully plans where to tank damage and get health for optimal frame savings.

	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"- Your attack has a very short range. It's nearly impossible to hit enemies that are walking away from you without hurting yourself. Attacking does not slow you down, but since your range is so short, if you don't stop moving when hitting an enemy with 2 HP, then you walk into them because they freeze in place when hit. I abuse this against a jumping enemy so I can crawl under them without stopping.

	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"- You get 6 HP per life. Healing is very hard to come by. We're going to be tanking a lot of hits, so it's important to spend it carefully. The route is planned meticulously to optimize damage tanking, health pickups, and death abuse.

[h4 id=CloudZip 
	" Cloud zip 
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"- You can create temporary platforms. This is great for abusing clipping. Asterix can jump repeatedly until he zips upward out of the wall.
	$LF
]div
[h4 id=ItemSwap 
	" Item Swap 
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"- When you throw an item, your inventory locks. The game doesn't remember which item you threw, but instead just locks your inventory so you can't change your items until the thrown item hits the wall. I abuse this by throwing two bombs. When the first bomb hits the wall, it unlocks the inventory, allowing you to swap items again. I swap to clouds, resulting in the second bomb activating as if it had been a cloud that was thrown (it only checks your current active item, because it doesn't remember what you threw). This allows me to use clouds in levels that don't have them, and thus also use zips where I shouldn't be able to.
	$LF
]div
[h4 id=OutOfBounds 
	" Out of Bounds 
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"- You can go slightly out of bounds on one level (the sausage level). This lets you perform a zip without a cloud. Other levels do let you zip out of the top of the map, but this just freezes the game, or gets you trapped, so it isn't used.
	$LF
]div
[h4 id=Asterix 
	" Asterix 
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"- He is smaller. This is a major advantage. His hisbox is smaller, he can jump farther than Obelix (because he doesn't bump his head), and many more benefits. Also, he has a powerup that Obelix can't even obtain (not used in the run, Disguise). He's the Main Character and it's obvious.
	$LF
]div
[h4 id=Obelix 
	" Obelix 
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"- At first, it seems like he's probably awful. He's big, he has to crouch to go through some places that Asterix can just walk through (you can't attack while crouching), and when he tries to zip, he just gets stuck in the wall or pushed out. But he has a few advantages. Sometimes being bigger helps him touch something just out of reach, and his throw-arc starts higher than Asterix. The original run used him just once, but this run adds more levels where he actually shows some of his potential.
