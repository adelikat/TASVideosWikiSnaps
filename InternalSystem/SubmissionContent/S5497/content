	"I'll start with an overview of gameplay mechanics that will be relevant to the run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Horizontal Movement
	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Of the two axes, the horizontal is generally the simplest to optimize. I can dash along the ground and also do dash jumps and dash walljumps. Each of these moves me at 3.5 pixels per frame and can be combined without consequence. I can walk along the ground or do non-dash jumps to move at 2.0 pixels per frame instead. Obviously that's a worse option when I'm trying to cover as much distance as I can, but there are several situations where I deliberately walk for one frame in order to avoid overshooting a point I need to hit. A common example of this is situations where I will need to return the way I came after accomplishing some objective; in such situations going further than I need to in one direction would mean having to backtrack a greater distance on the return trip.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Walking on the ground for a frame isn't the only way to accomplish this; I can also do a non-dash jump and then switch to dash speed on the next frame. This is called a delayed dash, it is a critically important technique in vertical movement, but also has some uses in the horizontal variety. In addition to the application I described earlier, delayed dash jumps have an added role in lag reduction. Starting a dash on the ground generates a sizable dust sprite at Zero's feet, but if I jump immediately as I land and delay the dash by one frame that dust will not appear. Doing so costs 1.5 pixels; I pay it gladly if it lets me dodge lag.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In addition to the regular dashing and walking speeds, there is slothlike, 0.5 pixels per frame, acceleration speed that Zero will move at for five frames when going from a full stop up to walking speed. I use this in a few spots where I want to get a precise positioning and I have to wait on something else anyways.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Dashes can be done either by pressing the dash button or by double tapping left or right (Command Dash). Alternating full length regular dashes with command dashes allows me to indefinitely move along the ground at full speed. In a few places I use this to avoid lag that would occur were I to jump.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I can also save frames with a technique I call the Ledge Dash. If I dash horizontally over an edge while holding forward and not jumping I get a free 3.5 pixels of movement. Well, sometimes it's free, other times it's laggy as frig. So if you ever see me not dashing over ledges when it seems like I ought to be; I'm probably avoiding lag. I'm not certain, but I think what happens when ledge dashing is that there is a frame where the game gets confused about whether I'm dashing along the ground or if I'm moving through the air at dash speed, and it gives me the 3.5 pixels movement from both on the same frame.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Zero's dash attack has some significance to my movement because after the attack is initiated it forces me to move in that direction for numerous frames. My average speed when dash attacking is pretty pathetic, but in certain cases when I'm about to lose control of my life I can dash attack at the last moment and cover a significant distance during a time when I would normally be immobile. This is often used as my finishing move against a boss in order to leave me in a favorable location for whatever I need to do after that fight. Note that there are a great many situations where my control is taken away but this technique is not applicable due to invisible walls or the like.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"It's also worth mentioning how Zero's hitbox becomes significantly shorter and wider when dashing. I can use the shortness of the dash hitbox to go under enemies or attacks, and I can use the thinness of the jumping hitbox to get closer to things before hitting them; in many cases I'll use the fatness of the dashing hitbox to hit things from farther away than I could otherwise. A common application of this is from going through doors. When Zero hits a door it triggers a movement of some fixed distance through that door. If I am very close to the door when I touch it I’ll be rather far beyond it after going through. If I hit the door from far away by dashing into it then I will be close to the door on the far side.  From that point if I dash along the ground my widening hitbox will hit the wall behind me and push me forward several pixels. There are exceptions, but that seemed to be the optimal strategy for most doors.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Vertical Movement
	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Vertical movement is generally much more complicated to optimize, especially for large climbs. Jumping gives Zero an initial rate of ascent of 5.00 pixels per frame with a constant acceleration of -0.25 pixels per frame^2. It seems as if the affects of gravity apply earlier when walljumping vs. jumping from the ground, so your initial rate of ascent is a slightly slower 4.75 pixels per frame. Upon releasing the jump button your ascent is stopped immediately.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Climbing with full hops would be extremely slow because of the constant deceleration from gravity; I would spend a large number of frames moving very slowly before reaching the peak of my jump. On the other hand doing extremely short jumps would also be bad because it would mean spending a lot of frames not ascending while the jump button is released. Optimal climbing needs to strike a balance between not letting the jumps get too slow and not releasing the jump button too frequently. Theoretically, the optimal number of frames to hold each walljump is 5; in reality what’s possible and optimal depends a lot on the specific wall I’m climbing.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"For up to seven frames after jumping from a wall Zero will move away from that wall despite any directional input from the player. Releasing the jump early will cancel this repulsion and allow me to immediately start moving back in the direction I came. This is often used when trying to climb up and over a ledge; I only jump as high as I need to to clear the ledge and then I release the jump to start moving forward. This concept is also useful for doing double walljumps. If I start one jump very close to wall I will still be close enough to jump off of it again even after several frames of kicking away from it. Usually four frames is the limit before double walljumping becomes impossible, but in some extreme conditions I can jump five frames and still be within range of the wall. Double walljumps aren’t always faster than regular climbing, but they can be a very useful option if my jumps don’t line up well with the height I’m trying to hit.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"During the seven repulsion frames at the start of each jump Zero can be moving either at walking speed 2 pixels per frame, or dash speed 3.5 pixels per frame. I mentioned in the Horizontal Speed section that it’s possible to delay dash inputs until the 5th frame of a jump; this is critically important to fast wallclimbing because it means I can spend 4 / 7 repulsion frames at walking speed and thus reduce the distance I get pushed away from that wall. I mentioned earlier that the ideal amount of frames to jump before starting a new one is 5; it turns out that even with the delayed dash tech it’s not generally possibly to climb walls at that rate because I don’t get close enough to start another jump that early. This means that I generally just want to start my next jump at the earliest possible moment as I return to the wall, usually this is around 11 frames after starting the jump. When moving up a narrow passage with walls on both sides I can alternate jumping off each side for a faster climb.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I learned late in the TAS that there is more to delayed dashes than I initially thought. I discovered that doing a full walljump towards the wall there is a period around the very peak, 17 frames into the jump, where a dash input will be accepted. I call this the super delayed dash walljump; it has no practical application that I know of because starting a dash that late would be just silly. Next I discovered that if I walljump away from a wall I can start a dash 9 frames in. So I guess that would be the semi super delayed dash walljump. I jest, I’ll just call them short, medium and long delays. The medium also has no practical application as is because if I’m trying to move away from a wall I would just start the dash immediately. However, I messed around a bit more and discovered that if I’m in an attack animation I can do a medium delay without moving away from the wall. This has an additional quirk; if I was facing towards the wall when I jumped from it and I move towards that wall on the 8th frame the dash input on the next frame will not work. If I was facing away from the wall then I can move towards the wall on that frame.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Doing medium delay dash walljumps is slightly better than the standard short delay; putting me either 1 or 3 pixels closer to the wall, depending on if I was allowed to use the first frame of movement. Most of the time I am facing the walls I climb off of, so normally only the 1 pixel advantage is available. If I have the Triple Rod equipped I can change the direction I’m facing by attacking away from the wall while kicking off from it. This would allow me to get the 3 pixel advantage every time regardless of which way I’m moving; I did not end up finding any viable application of that Triple Rod technique unfortunately.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Overall I wasn’t able to save very many frames with medium delays for a few reasons. First of all, climbing walls in general tends to be a hotspot for lag frames; doing a bunch of extra attacks while climbing will make that even worse. Furthermore, many of the climbs I do are set up so I get almost exactly the height needed to make it over a wall; using medium delays to jump more frequently would simply cause me to fall short and need an additional jump.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Weapons / Boss Strategies
	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This TAS will use three different weapons: Buster, Z-Saber and Triple Rod. There is a fourth weapon, the Shield Boomerang, which would almost certainly not be worth collecting in a TAS. The melee weapons, the saber and the Triple Rod, generate four frames of hitlag every time they connect with an enemy; I only strike down enemies with them when necessary.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There are also three elemental chips that are acquired as rewards for certain missions. These chips will change the elemental type of Zero's fully charged attacks, allowing him to take advantage of boss weaknesses. I only use elemental weakness against two bosses because there are usually better options.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The buster is my weapon of choice for killing non-boss enemies thanks to it's lack of hitlag. At TAS levels of mashing it's potential damage output is quite substantial, although the slowness of the projectiles and the fact that only three of them can coexist on screen can be rather limiting, especially at long range. Lemons generally deal 1 damage, though those fired while dashing along the ground deal 1.5. The buster can be semi-charged to a green shot that does 3 damage. During this run I get two levelups for the gun, the first allows me to have four shots onscreen, and the second let's me do a fully charged shot for 6 damage. With one exception, the buster is not used to damage bosses.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"For boss kills, the saber reigns supreme. It features several attacks that will give a boss only 12 frames of invincibility as opposed to the standard 90 frames; I'll refer to these as combo attacks. While stationary on the ground Zero can perform a three hit sequence, the first two swings of which are combos. Optimal strategy on most bosses is to do those first two attacks and then cancel the combo before the third swing; thus avoiding ever giving the boss full invincibility. Canceling the combo can be done either by walking a step (walk canceling) or by attacking with another weapon. Shooting the gun (buster canceling) is the preferred combo cancel because it can be done several frames earlier than walk canceling, however it is important that I’m not standing too far from the boss or else their 12 frames invulnerability will run out before the lemon hits.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If I am standing close to a grounded enemy I can swing at full speed, damaging the boss again immediately when they become vulnerable. If the target is somewhat far away this won’t work because the hitbox of the second swing becomes pretty small by the time the bosses I frames are up, so in those cases I need to delay the 2nd swing until the boss has only 4 frames of invulnerability left. If the boss is hovering some distance off the ground, like Herculious as he’s dashing, I need to delay the 2nd swing even longer: until the boss has 2 I frames left.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The spinning slash that Zero performs in the air can also be used as a combo attack, although it only does 2 damage per hit so I only use that when there are no other options.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Lastly we have the Triple Rod. It can’t attack quite as fast as the saber, and it’s combos do a bit less damage, but it can hit certain bosses that could otherwise only be reached with spinslashes. The train boss, the hydra robot in the factory, and Anubis are all sped up substantially by using the Triple Rod’s reach. It can also be used to pogo off enemies, granting a few small time saves and a really significant skip in Stop the Hacking.

	"The previously published TAS by Rolanmen was done on VBA, whereas mine was made with Bizhawk. Lag emulation is much more accurate in Bizhawk; I will be losing time from this lag constantly throughout the run. These losses will be more than offset by the numerous optimizations I've implemented.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Apart from various small and large improvements; I also feature two major route changes: First is performing the so called "EXP Glitch" on the intro stage boss to farm saber experience points. Second is collecting the optional weapon: Triple Rod, which allows for various time saving pogos and faster boss strats.

		"Triple Rod: To see if the cumulative savings of the weapon outweigh the frames spent collecting it, equipping it and equipping it.

Additionally it's possible to walk on the frames of and immediately after the saber input while still getting a standing slash. In total I can cover a pretty appreciable distance between each combo without slowing my attack rhythm.

This is significant because due to some quirk of the game engine you can actually get closer to walls or other objects if you are facing away from them (probably for the same reason, you can walljump from further away if you are facing towards a wall than if you are facing away.) There aren’t many cases where I can take advantage of this because for some reason Zero doesn’t know how to moonwalk; in this situation I had time to set it up while waiting for the boss to explode.

	"Grounded Triple Rod attacks are combo moves that can be used repeatedly against the Pantheon Core. They can be buster cancelled like saber swings, but doing so is slightly slower than just waiting out the full duration of the attack. Except for the first attack after a damage boost it’s possibly to move for one frame while inputting the next attack. This is useful after being dboosted towards the boss: dashing one frame into him while still invulnerable pushes me far enough away that I don’t take contact damage after my invincibility runs out. Before the third damage boost you will see me spend some time moving away from the boss; this does not cost me any time because I could only fit so many hits in the cycle. This repositioning helps me dodge some lag.

Much of that required EXP was earned in the train, the rest will be picked up from hitting stuff during this stage. The shield barrier enemies here have two hitboxes; one for themselves and one for their shield. By hitting both hitboxes simultaneously I get TWICE THE EXP for just one instance of hitlag. I do some fancy jumping off the corner to get over the 2nd shield guy; a later review of the strat determined that just spinning with a triple rod attack to hit him twice gets through several frames faster. I ended up losing all the saved time to lag later though so I kept things as they are.

By getting the level earlier in the stage I save time overall.

The main advantage of Protect Factory first is that there is more saber EXP available in that mission than there is in Rescue Colbor, so I could spend less time farming on the golem with that route. Colbor first on the other hand lets me do a small pogo in that stage and I get to use charged saber and buster attacks later in Protect Factory.

This makes a really big difference because the faster I can get that bomb and get back the easier it is to make it back onto my moving platform. The previous TAS had to wait longer for the bomb so it needed to do an extra walljump to get back to that platform, and then wait for the lightning to get out of the way before climbing onto it.

I have one frame of control after breaking the lock and before that dialogue starts; I need to be in a state where I’m capable of starting a dash attack on that frame. If I was in the middle of a saber attack animation on that frame I would not be able to do the dash. Instead what I do is start a jump slash a couple frames before hitting the ground; landing takes me out of the jump attack animation but the hitbox persists for awhile.

If I had to go all the way across the lake and back it would cost me a lot more than the ~550 frames Rolan spends making that trip, because I would be lagging the entire time. It’s impossible to say for sure without actually TASing out a no Triple Rod route, but I do believe that the Triple Rod is worth it on the more accurate emulation of Bizhawk. If not, at the very least it would end up being close enough that the speed entertainment tradeoff of using the Triple Rod would be justified.

	"As for the movement in this area through the sub skip, it’s mostly just lag avoidance, there’s not a whole lot else to it. In the computer room I use my charge attack to destroy the top and middle layers, instead of the bottom and middle, so that I never have to climb all the way up to the top; saving around half a second. On Leviathan I end the fight with a charged flame shot, this prevents me from doing buster canceled combos for the final few seconds of the fight, so I walk cancel them instead. Overall it’s marginally faster ingame time than the previous strat of jumping over her ice ring attack, but most notably it’s much less laggy. Even on VBA the previous strat lagged a lot; this is one of the few instances where I save a non negligible amount (17f) of lag related time.

	"For the big guy in the way at the bottom of the elevator shaft I hit him with a jump slash as I go over him; this causes him to respond by putting up his arm defensively. The changing of his hitbox size and position when he defends allows me to get over him without stopping (other than the 4 frames of hitlag.) You can skip the hitlag by firing the buster while jumping over him, but when I tried that I ended up getting a much laggier engine room. Interestingly I couldn’t get it to work for the guy on the upper level of the base, which is a shame because it would have actually saved time on him most likely. Instead I deliberately slow down while approaching him so the moving of his hitbox when he does his arm swing corresponds to my jump over him. This is slightly faster than forcing the block with a saber swing, though not as fast as him blocking a buster shot if I could get that to work.

There is a floating platform a fair distance to the right from the top of this building; if it is hit with an attack it becomes active and moves over to the building and back. The intended use is so players can get onto the building after they have gone through it and collect some cyber elves up there.

	"I mentioned a long time ago that I generally save fair amounts of time on vertical movement thanks to the delayed dash walljumps. These savings are quite substantial on this stage because it is almost all wall climbing.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The most significant single time save comes from a trick called the Spike Jump, with which it is possible under very specific conditions to walljump off of spike blocks. I use it three times in the climb, though by far the most notable is in the middle of the climb when I use it to catch shots fired by a pantheon and climb the spikes while invincible.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"To perform I spike jump I need to just barely cut the corner of the spikes from underneath, release my jump and turn into the spikes for two frames, then do the walljump. If you continue to hold d-pad towards the spikes on the frame that you walljump you will die. This is kind of odd because you’re movement and positioning aren’t affected at all by directional inputs at the start of walljumps, but I guess something is different enough to cause problems for this specific trick.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I have two notable changes to the Rainbow Devil fight. First is that I mash out of his grab attack much faster than was previously thought possible. From what I can tell the previous belief was that only one input per frame would count towards mashing out. In reality, any number of the main buttons (A, B, L and R) will be counted, and up to 1 dpad input. So you can get 5 effective inputs every other frame and 1 input on the rest. This allows me to escape from his grab 10 frames faster.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The second change is the final implementation of the Triple Rod. While the Rainbow Devil is in his tall tornado form the Triple Rod can attack him much more frequently than the saber. After he shrinks down to his smaller form I can use it to cancel out of my saber combos just like buster canceling, and then cancel that animation back to the saber. Overall the time this saves on the fight would not be enough to justify the time spent equipping the Triple Rod, but I also have some use for it at the start of the boss rush coming up.

[p 
	"I wasn’t able to get the safe spot between the two zombies to work during this refight, I think there might be slight differences in how the zombies spawn, or I’m just dumb.

[p 
	"Other than top left room first there’s not much significance to boss order, I just did whatever was more convenient for getting good patterns. Maha and Blizzack are basically identical to their fights from earlier in the run. Herculious is a bit different; I don’t care where I am in the room or where he dies because there is no elf to pickup after the battle this time. I manipulate for him to only dash into me once and just kill him as fast as I can. There are quite a few timesaving damage boosts in the boss rush and doing Triple Rod strats on Anubis adds a few extra, so I do pick up one large health container during this first set of bosses.

[p 
	"I take a different route in the passage between the two boss rush rooms. Instead of going through the two doors on the upper route I drop down. There is a bit of a wall climb at the end of the lower route, but it ends up being about 100 frames faster than the door transitions.

	"The idea on Phantom is the same as it was except here I have a lot more time to setup a good RNG manipulation ahead of time. I still have to fire some lemons during the fight but doing so does not cost me time because of how few I need and when. At Fefnir I found it faster to attack him right away this time instead of waiting for him to start his first attack. Honestly I’m not certain what made the difference on this; I believe it’s because there is a small hill behind him during Duel in the Desert. Knocking him back at the start of that fight would cause him to land on that hill, affecting various timings in the battle.

[p 
	"Leviathan is pretty neat. If she is far enough above you at the start of the fight she will start by dropping down until she is closer. By waiting a bit during her pre-battle dialogue and then lowering ourselves by going off the ledge on the left we can manipulate her into a good location. Because we start this fight so much closer than on Stop the Hacking we get to end the fight before being hit in the face with the ice ring. This strategy isn’t anything new but I do save a few frames from executing it more optimally. Most of the improvement came from falling off the ledge better. Because of how wide Zero’s hitbox is while dashing it can take awhile to actually fall off of something; if you stop dashing after you are partially over the edge you can start to fall a few frames faster. This is doubly important on this fight because it means I don’t need to wait as long before clearing the text.

Vertical movement is often pretty tricky to optimize so long climbs are definite suspects. In particular the tower could likely be improved somehow; considering it is both a lot of lag and a lot of climbing. Otherwise I expect there are various small improvements here and there that I missed. It’s entirely possible that there are entirely new techniques still to be discovered. Things like the EXP gltich, spike jump and super delayed dash walljumps are all pretty bizarre glitches; who knows what else is possible?
