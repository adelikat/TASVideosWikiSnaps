	"After several attempts of trial and error the shortest input file I got was 3 frames long. It was on the Poorlords mode with left difficulty on false. At this point it is just verifying wheter it is the fastest or not means testing all input combations for 2 frames on both difficulties. But first I made sure what buttons are actually only in use, as it turned out r, s, B are the only ones that changed the stated of the game, which means 64 combinations to test in each difficulty instead of 8192. Well probably it would be less, because P and Player 2 wouldn't be used anyway. I tested all 128 combinations and they all failed, which means the TAS can't be pushed down more, how sad.

	"Emulation issues aside, the fact that the game is "winnable" in less than half a second just by starting the game (even on console), and has been proven so even in real-time while console verifying, renders the objective of this run trivial. Rejecting for this reason as well.
