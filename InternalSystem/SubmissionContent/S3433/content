	"This is my very first speedrun, I'm a huge fan of TH series, so I wanted to beat one of them in 5 minutes, and as the emulation of systems older than the PSx isnt rely ok for me and my computer, i chose a GBA version of THPS2.

	"No warps/glitch/passwords used. In this game you have to complete goals the get cash, this cash allows you to unlock stuff, stat points and following levels, all i did is trying to earn the minimum cash required to get the the next levels (some levels are competitions though, no goals in them, you have to get the best 2 scores out of 3 attempts. For these i've ended the runs as soon as possible, and I didn't take the 3rd attempts because it didnt matter not to take them)

	"My aim was just to have some fun establishing a record on a TH episode. The hardest part was maybe to get into this TAS world i didn't know anything about. I know my run can be optimized, i've lost a few seconds several times, but i've tried not to play it too simply, so its still fun to watch :)

	"I've hesitated between 2 options: beating the levels, or beating them with 100% goals and cash. I've chosen option number one, because i thought that its more fun to beat a game that fast. The sad point about this option is that you don't get a "real" ending screen (credits, not sure you get one with 100% though) and that the ending screen you get after all these efforts kinda suck as you will see...

	": I believe that the general consensus was that this game is much more suited for a 100% run, not an any% run. Given the difference in isometric versus 3rd person view point, I'd think there is space on the site for a GBA run in addition to a PSX/N64 run. However, I'm rejecting this run for bad goal choice. I'd say the audience would approve of a 100% run. I hope to see one from you in the future.
