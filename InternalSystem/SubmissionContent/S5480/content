	"This is a adventure "platformer" game that basically has the plot of Titanic, but came out several years earlier. It is made by the same developers as Clock Tower. This run achieves the worst ending as quickly as possible (any%)

	"The gameplay is mostly that of a platformer with a few annoying RNG elements to it. In particular, the rotation of the ship in the pipe room (and the later reversal) occurs at a random time and manipulating it to occur exactly as desired was the main improvement of the TAS over a traditional speedrun (also minor execution improvements everywhere, of course).
