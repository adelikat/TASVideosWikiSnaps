	"This one was a bit trickier than 1-1. The reason I was having a bit of a hard time was the way to getting to the World 4 warp pipe. I was getting into the pipe at 346 instead of 347, but I figured it out. This level is also the level that I figured out you lose a bit of speed by entering a wall, so you should try to avoid entering walls often.

	"This is another tricky one. By the time I tried to do the wrong warp, the framerule was already 375, but I figured out that if you step out at the right time to go to the right of the screen, you will potentially enter the pipe at the framerule 376, therefore tying the world record for this category.

[div class=p 
	"The thing I would like to improve is my last movement to the axe in 8-4, so I can save a bit of time since time ends as soon as all the sprites on-screen disappear. But for my first TAS, I'll let it slide.
