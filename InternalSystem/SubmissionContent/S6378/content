	"Although this was my first TAS ever made and it doesn't look the best, I think I did a pretty good job.

	"On a 1 - 10 scale of how hard making this TAS was, I'd say it was about a 7, especially for 4-2, which I will explain why in my stage-by-stage comments.

	"This one wasn't much of a challenge. Get to the flagpole, and do FPG on the framerule 370.

	"This one was a bit trickier than 1-1. The reason I was having a bit of a hard time was the way to getting to the World 4 warp pipe. I was getting into the pipe at 346 instead of 347, but I figured it out. This level is also the level that I figured out you lose a bit of speed by entering a wall, so you should try to avoid entering walls often.

[p 
	"This level is a bit plain and boring. This one I shouldn't even create comments on because it's so boring other than the ending where I jumped then jumped IMMEDIATELY after I landed to do the FPG required to save time.

	" 4-2
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This is another tricky one. By the time I tried to do the wrong warp, the framerule was already 375, but I figured out that if you step out at the right time to go to the right of the screen, you will potentially enter the pipe at the framerule 376, therefore tying the world record for this category.

]h4
[p 
	"Another boring level, but more boring than 8-1. I guess the only thing I can take note of in this level is how I went left, right, every single frame to make sure you don't get fireworks. (Fireworks kill your time.)

[p 
	"Another auto-scroller, but more interesting than 8-1 and 8-2. Here I made a quick kill to the bullet bill at the beginning (which appears to be just jumping straight into the path of the bullet bill), just for some extra swag. More rapid left, right movements are used here.

[p 
	"Ahh, the last level. Here, I saved a framerule over the world record by entering the pipe faster (at 4:18 on the YouTube video) by using the strategy to enter the warp pipes in previous stages.

	"To be honest, I believe others would like to see different games of different categories, since Super Mario Bros. is most likely the most TASed video game of all time. But I feel that I did something unique, and I'm proud.

[p 
	"The thing I would like to improve is my last movement to the axe in 8-4, so I can save a bit of time since time ends as soon as all the sprites on-screen disappear. But for my first TAS, I'll let it slide.
