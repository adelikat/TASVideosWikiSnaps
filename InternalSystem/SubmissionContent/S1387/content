	"At the beginning of the movie, you see me going to the practice menu and you might be wondering for what good reason I am doing this as it just wastes time. Well, this is for entertainment purposes as it allows me later on to perform the two Stage Fatalities, which would otherwise not be possible. After that, I set the difficulty level to Ultimate, select Shinnok as the fighter and Master II as the destiny. Then begins the first fight...

	"I morph into Scorpion and perform a 12 hit combo (registered as 11) which deals 55% damage. Then another 8 hit combo which deals 43%. I finish this round by throwing the weapon, which I conveniently got as a result of the last combo.

	"Liu Kang is raised from the dead only to take out Reiko. He does so together with Sonya. I must mention here that Reiko is a very hard oppenent as he sometimes performs a move at the start of the battle, even before you can block or jump away, which is completely unavoidable.

	"Scorpion, Fujin, Reiko and Sub-Zero join forces to kill this beast. Since Goro resists any damage done to him, there is much room for combos. This results in the best part of this movie: the final combo with Reiko. I am not going to spoil anything. You should definitely watch this movie, if only it was for this part.
