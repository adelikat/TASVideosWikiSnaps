In retaliation for just how angry I am at this, I am rejecting this run and you're not even getting a "Hello and welcome to TASvideos!" out of it >:c And sure that's entirely because you've been involved with the community for a very long time so a welcome is not necessary but I have to have an iron fist about SOMETHING!!!
