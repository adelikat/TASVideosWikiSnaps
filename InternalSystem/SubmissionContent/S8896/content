	"There are 3 playable characters.  The first is Buzz, a slow wrestler type character.  Ty is used since he has a strong cancel-able elbow that has the highest dps in the game by far.  The elbow seems to have been nerfed a bit in later versions.  Ty also has stun lock trick.  Kato, the third select-able character lacks the strong elbow attack, but he also can stun lock enemies even easier than Ty.

[div class=p 
	"The game progresses through a series of one round matches where opponents may reappear later on.  Intersperced between the matches are Grudge matches where players fight player characters. If doing single player you have to knockdown a cpu. If multiplayer you fight against the other players.  Meaning if there are two players, on the next match there will be two opponents.  Right before the last boss there could be an Elimination Match if there is more than one player. This is the main reason why not more than one player is used since as far as I could tell the player characters are not susceptible to the stun lock, and they would not be able to save enough time to make up for a full Elimination Round and its point calculation.

	"The arena that you fight in for the matches are all the same size, but vary slightly.  Around the left and right side of the arena are walls, but in front of those walls are background audience members.  These members are not interact-able unless they come out of the crowd.  When they do that they try to attack the contestants.  RNG dependent on if, when, and where they come out.

[div class=p 
	"The arenas usually have a variety of weapons and barrels to pick up and use or throw.  The most important item is inside of some of the barrels.  And that item is the powerup.  The powerup is used in the dual Chainman fight, and the last boss.  Otherwise you lose time getting it.  Note that the fastest way to get the powerup is to get lucky for an audience member to come out to attack you and you can throw the barrel against them. This makes the item come out and be able to picked up.  The rounds that have weapons right near the starting enemies are all manniped out, because it causes the enemies to wander off towards them, and the pickup animation has lots of i frames.

	"Pit Fighter does not properly check for character animation states.  Pressing other buttons often is enough to change the move to another one.  This is why Ty's elbow attack is so good. The move is being cancelled every 3 frames with another move, then used again 3 frames later.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The game also does not check the states when they are close together.  This means after pressing a button you can usually do another move even if you are not in the correct "state".  This is used to save time by jumping and picking up the powerups which would normally not be possible.  Also a lot of the post enemy defeat scenes show oddities like mid air three button specials for entertainment.

	"The forward forward Cartwheel/Roll/Flip of the respective characters is able to break out of almost everything.   This makes it possible to breakout of using Ty's special two hit special. Ty's first hit will stun the opponent for a while and then the second hit will always hit if the first does. When you cancel the attack after the first one using forward forward, the game will have some frames where the opponent waits. However, the AI breaks if you do it while the opponent is falling. If you cancel after the first hit while they are falling, then rapidly hit with the elbow, they will not be able to do anything until their entire health bar is depleted.  Calling this the Stunlock bug.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"The Stunlock using Ty can be a bit tricky since not all players are easily susceptible to it.  The enemies have three type of knockdowns.  They can fall forward, back, or get popped up into the air and land further up in the arena.  The enemies have different timings for their knockdowns so some are too fast to catch them as they about to fall.  Mad Miles in particular needs to get thrown against a wall in order to Stunlock him since that gives just enough time to hit him with the first hit of the special to cancel it.

	"Enemy AI was very challenging before the Stunlock bug was found.  Originally I was RNG manipping the elbow hits to not knockdown the opponents unless they would be defeated before falling down.  Everyone of the enemies would try to break out of the elbow cancelling, but edging away, or by just using some kind of invincible counter, or invincible escape move like a roll.  Once the Stunlock was found and used all those RNG elbows went away.  That is the main reason the Rerecord count is so high.
