	"A final run of Bart's Nightmare by Samhain-Grim (also known as VANDAL), which is about 73 seconds faster than the previous run.  Improvements are all over the place in this run and also there are parts where I lose time but in the end it's all rectified.

	"Being the highlight of the run last time, it's interesting to see this level first rather than third.  What I was shooting for was destroying all rockets and Krusty Balloons, with varying diversity, since dodging them prolongs lag.  You'll also see I time my hits by measuring and shooting further than before.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"After two sets of vertical rockets, you'll see that there are some horizontal rockets in which I don't destroy all off right away.  I do this to cause a few of the other set of horizontal rockets to disappear in order to reduce lag.  Now, on to the first boss.

	"After the boss, more flying with not really anything different except for that cloud with lightning shooting from it.  Another boss is on the way.  Before the fight starts though, you'll see Nelson was coming toward me but with certain directional input (while the boss fight was loading) you'll see he somehow gets sucked up into the air, leaving without a fight.

	"Barney has an erratic pattern depending on your location, he seems to circle around in front of you while he burps out green gas and his elephant spews out peanuts.  The interesting part of this fight is the location you must be in in order for the pelts to hit him, before he's on screen, otherwise they miss.  I make short work of him by sending up a bunch of pelts before he comes onto the screen and then I just nail him as soon as possible each time.

	"Smithers comes equipped with large rocket looking darts which take half your life if you're hit by just one of them.  There are two ways of finishing this fight, the fast way and the slow way.  The fast way has you destroy or dodge his projectiles until he's out and then he just leaves the screen and you can continue.  The slow way requires you to shoot him up until he explodes.  I take the fast way as you'll see.
	$LF

[p 
	"On my way, further on I pick up an extra life which the Krusty Balloons only drop (which I don't necessarily need).  I destroy some horizontal rockets before entering a contaminated field of clouds in which shock you when you touch them.  On the way through them there are vertical rockets that try to get in the way but they end up being target practice.  The next boss is Smithers!?

	"Last time to fly on ahead.  As I progress you'll see horrendous lag but there is nothing on screen or anything I can do about it either.  Then there's more rockets, real abruptly, and even double sets of rockets (rockets laid right on top and beside each other in which require two pelts instead of one).  The last boss is up ahead.

[p 
	"When comparing the previous run's bloodstream level to this run's, I shattered the old time.  The trick to that was manipulating two germs to come out around the same time as I blow up the red germ (the red germ eliminates everything on screen) and this greatly progresses this level.  After that it's just a little luck manipulation based on my location and where my momentum is going that determines where the Smilin' Joe Fission guy appears to be.

	"I apologize for this paper taking a while to get (as well as not doing anything spectacular with the Skateboard but it's frame consuming going from the sidewalk to the street.  Also, for the horrible sound that is 'Z's' adding to my life bar) but luck manipulation just wasn't on my side (probably because I've saved quite a bit of time already.  Also, I exaggerate the wait).  I go to the left on the Skateboard to the next paper which is Itchy and Scratchy.

[p 
	"This level (along with the other one) is probably the low point of the run since there is waiting periods and running back and forth throughout both.  I attempted to make it interesting every once in a while with quirky movements.  There's also a couple of instances where I lodge myself into the wall or edge of the screen in order to hit the enemies coming sooner than possible.  There's really not much to say that isn't hack and slash, more like pound and shoot.

[p 
	"Another level of this, kind makes you think 'why didn't they make this a double page level?'.  Oh well, at least this one ups the challenge a little.  Now I have to deal with an Itchy and Scratchy as stationary nuisances that can't be defeated.  Also, there's these bubbles that come out of the sink as well as a sort of boss at the end.  The boss is just a furnace that can spew fire out of it but I don't even go far enough to let it on screen so it's kind of a waste to describe it.  That's it for this level as it's not very interesting.

	"In this level you play as Bart but as a monster that resembles Godzilla.  The objective is to progress with as little hits as possible (not a problem) and then you get zapped, somehow turn small and that gets you a paper?!  But there's more.  Now that you are small, you have to climb a sky scraper in order to get another paper, the last paper.  On the way up, you'll see I move to the sides to avoid a butterfly Marge and manipulate it so no one drops any crap on me.  At the top, you get see Homer as a gorilla and I zap him for the last paper.  The End.
