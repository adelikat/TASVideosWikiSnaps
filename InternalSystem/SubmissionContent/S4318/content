	"So this was the first 3D Frogger game and it was release for both PC and PSX.  It's grid based with minimal RNG.  The objective of each level is to collect 5 frogs in order to proceed to the next level.  New zones are unlocked by obtaining a gold frog.  There is one gold frog in each zone.  You complete the game by obtaining the gold frog in the last zone.  There is an alternate ending if you obtain all gold frogs.

	"The goal of this run was to obtain all the frogs as fast as possible (100%).  Often times in levels, you are limited in how fast you can complete the level by certain driving cycles.  In order to make the run more interesting I made a secondary goal to reduce in game time as much as possible.  At points where I had to waist time in the level I did random hoping, croaking, or ate stuff.

	"The same level can be completed in the same amount of real time while having a large variation in in-game time.  Essentially, you can sack time on the score screen after each frog to simulate the level without counting in game time.  Some cycles do not simulate on the score screen which in some instances made it possible to save both real and in game time by sacking time.  This also meant in some places I had to waist time with the in game clock running, so in some levels, specifically Lily Islands and Spinning Lilies, I had to waist time at the beginning of the level waiting for log cycles because it was necessary for a certain bird cycle to line up.

	"Super hop and auto hop can be obtained in one level at the same time.  They don't make the TAS any faster but it wasn't slower to grab them both.  Auto hop and super hop both make you go faster so they were obtained strategically where possible.  The other two where just obtained because they were there.
