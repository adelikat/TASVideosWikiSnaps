	"Numerous videos have been made of of Battle Chess aiming for quick checkmates (speed).  For the most part, however, they have not been accepted because chess is a board game; and board games are generally unacceptable for vault.  Based on rejections, most (if not all) of these submissions weren't entertaining enough to attain Moon tier.

	"Hopefully we can break that streak.  This video is a simple playaround that demonstrates the battle animations for all the different game-pieces against each of the others.  The only exception being King vs King as that is not possible.

	"This was a very simple and rapid TAS to set up.  Time was not heavily considered and optimizations of movement may be possible, but speed isn't really the point.

	"This game also has a PC port with moderately better graphics (including blood during the battles, resulting in some of the deaths making more sense).  I'm still new enough to TASing that I've not yet experimented with PC game TASes.  If someone were to mimic this TAS using that version, it would look better and possibly be more entertaining.  Until that happens (or until I figure it out), hopefully this video will qualify for moon tier.

	": This is a run that does not aim for speed, is far from optimal in that sense, and it also fails to provide entertainment or anything notable in the way the game is played. The category choice was not received well at all.

	"This run fails to qualify as either a speedrun or superplay; as such, it fails to qualify for publication on this site. Rejecting.
