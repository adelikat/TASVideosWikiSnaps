	"Unlike the 
	[a class=intlink href=/1695M 
		"published movie
	]a
	" this movie takes advantage of the clock stopping glitch.  This is a glitch that allows the clock to stop which can significantly reduce clock times.  It is only available on opponents that Mac can "rapid punch".  This is possible on 5 opponents.  The glitch is utilized on 4 of them.

	"The clock stopping glitch involves delivering a rapid punch to the opponent then doing a delayed jab that will glitch the clock into remaining stopped.  It will not restart again unless Mac delivers a stunned punch or uppercut (or either Mac or the opponent get knocked down).  Not all opponent punches can be countered with rapid punches so the logic here is to get the opponent to throw such a punch as soon as possible.  This leads to some very counter intuitive strategies.  For instance, on both Soda & Don II, I have to get knocked down twice.  In fact, in each case Mac is one punch away from losing the fight.
	$LF

[p 
	"The clock stopping glitch makes a real time trade off of about 1 minute because once the clock is stopped, uppercuts can not be used which lengthens the fights (as well as being knocked down).  However, real time is not the primary goal in this movie nor the no glitch version.  And the no glitch version makes a number of real time tradeoffs.  Sandman, Piston II, Piston I, and Don II could all be beaten faster if aiming for real time.  Also, both take advantage of clock stopping.  The clock stops momentarily during rapid punches, stunned punches, and uppercuts.  Maximizing the time that the clock is stopped is a standard feature of most fast Punch-Out Strats.

	"This version shows off a nice glitch and some surprising strategies and so I propose that this movie be published along side the glitchless version.
