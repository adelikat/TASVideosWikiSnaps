Then I redid the entire thing from scratch, now on the newest BizHawk (I used VBA on the previous one), with more experience and better optimization.

	"The game has this odd thing where when you stop running, you'll continue to run for some reason, being unable to stop for a few seconds and then die because of that. You can fall trough solid ground too for some reason, and then die. You can't manipulate your jumps until like 5 seconds later and then you'll die too. Enemies can kill you easily because of your crappy controls and their small hitbox. Loads of lag. Lack of useful powerups, etc etc etc.
