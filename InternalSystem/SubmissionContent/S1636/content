	"Level 1: Not much to say here. Avoiding gem 101 takes more time than to pick it up and make the game count it down.

	"Level 2: An okay level with almost no luck manipulation. As for the boss, not killing bats before the door appears makes fewer bats attack Kuros.
	$LF

[p 
	"Level 3: It is possible to get the Pink Potion from the second candle, and that way make it last longer, but, it's only possible to get a 1-gem from the first candle, so that would be a lost gem. Thanks to Bablo for the wall glitch.
	$LF

[p 
	"Level 4: The only level where I restore Kuros' HP to make the boss battle faster... Also, at around frame 19950-isch, I use the Potion Of Levitation for seemingly no reason, but not using it makes Kuros enter another Bonus Room (Which never was an option, since it was a room with very few gems).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Level 5: A luck manipulation mayhem. Getting all the spiders in the right place and then getting gems from them was just as horrible as I just made it sound. Ugh. Getting the Red Key looks ugly, but it was the only way to get the last 2 gems I needed :/
	$LF
	"Also I get knocked down by the boss to make myself invulnerable for a longer time, since it is triggered later than if I would have gotten a beating in the jump.
	$LF

[p 
	"Level 6: Alot of jumping, and some abuse of the block-glitch. Other than that, not much to say here either. Getting the Bonus Room rather than the chest in the end was like, 100 frames faster. The ham at around frame 30100 is impossible to avoid.
