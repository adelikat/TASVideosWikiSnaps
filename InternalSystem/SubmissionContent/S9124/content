	"Duck Amuck mini game collection only released on the Nintendo DS. There are many different games you can play by interacting with Daffy Duck in different ways. These increase the thermometer. When at full, you he game ends. By slicing Daffy Duck in half, you start a mini game where you have to clear all the Daffy ducks on screen. This is done by slicing him in half, which creates two smaller copies. This continues until each copy is small enough that it is eliminated. However, this is all irrelevant. By frame perfectly slicing right before they load in, you end the stage immediately, making this the fastest mini game. After each 5 stages, 2 cutscenes play out. One can be skipped once the screen is fully widened, and as for the other you have to wait until after the thermometer goes off screen and slice him. Once you've done this cycle 7 times, he gets angry enough and the credits roll. There's a lot more to this game than just this minigame, but it terms of reaching the credits, this is the way to go.
