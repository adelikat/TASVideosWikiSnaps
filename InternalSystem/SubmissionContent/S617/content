	""What you need to do is defeat all the Phalanx X-Men clones except for one. It doesn't matter what order you do it in just so long as all but one are dead. Now, once you've done that, head back down to the very bottom of the area -- the end of the hallway where the Phalanx mech's claws turned into your character(s). Now, hit the wall to the left. If you do this, the wall should emit a circle of explosions which circle around twice and into a sort of close-eyed blank-looking smiley face.(Looks like this -> -_-) Now, head back up into the second room from the bottom on the right. This room should have a wall blocking your progression. However, if you did as I said, if you hit this small wall, it should shatter like glass. Walk into the room, and there, you will fight Phalanx-Magneto!"
