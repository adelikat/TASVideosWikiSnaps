	"Even if we were to take this run at face value, "STUPID DIE%" cannot be clearly defined as a goal for a run. There is no objectivity to the category outside of the player death. One could argue that any death is or isn't "stupid", as the word in this context is entirely subjective. We would have to classify exactly what a "stupid death" is for it to be publishable, and I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that is not something we're planning on doing.
