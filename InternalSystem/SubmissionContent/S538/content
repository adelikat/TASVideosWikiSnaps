	"Some word of the game maybe. You play as Gomez who is gonna save his wife (or whatever) from that evil dude in the basement. To be able to reach that evil guy Gomez must collect 1 million dollars, because they have a security door for some reason, in the basement and the door will only open if you weigh in your big pile of money. Thus I have to collect loads of money throughout the run. And on top of that! The big steel door can only be unlocked by Pugsley, who needs to be shrinked. The shrinking potion is made of a "Bone", an ugly "Blue Egg" and some "Fog". Awesome.

	"This game is also VERY hard! Even though it might seem like a simple game. This is because Gomez takes damage from everything basically. And he (and/or) the enemies is bigger than they appear so sometimes I have to wait for them before I can proceed. One example of this is in the area before "The Pond". There are several tomatoes in the trees and this time I jumped "over" them to save time, but I had to wait that long before moving forward because else I would have taken damage.

	"I managed to shave a minute off from my old run. This is because of several things.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"First: I did everything more precise and also changed a few minor things. For example I pick up two money bags in "The Landing" different because then I don't have to backtrack for a few pixels. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Second: I discovered a nice glitch that allows me to jump through certain walls. This is only doable in "The Freezer" though since the slippery floor force me to slide. I still have to wait for the snowballs on my way to rescue Wednesday but the waiting is shorter now and it looks much better.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Third: I used "Thing" different. I wasted him one time at the Attic this time but that was really useful because then I could skip some minor delays caused by the evil bats.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Forth: I found a new shortcut that allowed me to not backtrack that much to save Pugsley. Also I could use my waiting time here better, collecting some money.

	"And hmm, that's what I can think of now.. Oh, and I actually die one time :P Can you spot where?
