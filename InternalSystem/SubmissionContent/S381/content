	"Game Description:
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"This game, based on the hit franchise from the 80's, takes 
	$LF
	"you through several Cobra bases in various parts of the 
	$LF
	"world.  You can control six different Joes (one of which can 
	$LF
	"only be played in the last level), each with different 
	$LF
	"stats and characteristics, as you bring down enemy forces.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Levels come in sets of three, save the last set which is 
	$LF
	"one.  The second one of each set has you going through a 
	$LF
	"small maze-like complex as you put explosive charges at 
	$LF
	"certain spots; the other two are your average shooter fare.  
	$LF
	"Each set has a leader Joe you must take with you; you pick 
	$LF
	"the other two for the set.

	"Glitches:
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-I found a glitch a few years ago which allows you to 
	$LF
	"transfer one Joe's jump height to another by switching mid 
	$LF
	"flight; I use this a couple of time to grab some powerups in 
	$LF
	"the first level.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"-Punching, while ordinarily very slow, can be sped up 
	$LF
	"drastically by alternating between standing and ducking or 
	$LF
	"switching between punching and shooting.  I use this to 
	$LF
	"clear some obstacles and enemies and use it against some 
	$LF
	"bosses, although it could be applied in many other areas 
	$LF
	"than I did.

[div class=p 
	"Damage:
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-I take lots of damage in this movie.  I usually take a hit 
	$LF
	"if dodging ends up taking more time than getting hit.  If I 
	$LF
	"do get hit, I make sure it either benefits me or doesn't 
	$LF
	"hinder me much.  Death is not advantageous in any way.

	"Luck:
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-I manipulate luck to get some bosses in a position for me 
	$LF
	"to smack them around better.  I also use it in the final 
	$LF
	"battle to redirect some grenades.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"-I tried manipulating luck in 1-2 to grab some upgrades 
	$LF
	"from item drops to reach full power sooner, but after 100 
	$LF
	"redoes or so and only getting two rations and an ammo clip 
	$LF
	"from one enemy, I gave up and continued on.  I don't know 
	$LF
	"how to manipulate the item drops. (upgrades are much more 
	$LF

	"Notes:
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-I played almost all this game at 12% speed.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"-I use Rock & Roll for much of the game, despite him having 
	$LF
	"the second weakest punch and the worst jump, thanks to his 
	$LF
	"ultra powerful gun.  The only levels I don't use him in are 
	$LF
	"4-1, 5-2 (although he begins and ends this one), and 6.  He 
	$LF
	"is only used for a portion in 4-2.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"-Jumping is a bit faster than just walking, so I do jump 
	$LF
	"around a lot.  I don't jump if the landing spot hinders me 
	$LF
	"in any way.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"-I grab vehicles if the time spent getting them is worth the 
	$LF
	"time saved using them.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"-3-1 may look sloppy, but I was just goofing around for much 
	$LF
	"of it.  Goofing there doesn't affect my time due to the 
	$LF
	"auto-scrolling.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"-In the last level, I take some time to grab some upgrades 
	$LF
	"to get General Hawk to full power; Cobra Commander is beaten 
	$LF
	"much faster by doing this.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"-Many of the bosses are beaten real quick; the speed in 
	$LF
	"which some of them fell surprised me!  I believe the only 
	$LF
	"time the boss music ever fully looped was the 5-2 boss, but 
	$LF
	"that's because it takes a while getting to him.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"-I can see some Christians getting offended by this movie 
	$LF
	"due to an accident in 4-2; trust me, I didn't intend to do
