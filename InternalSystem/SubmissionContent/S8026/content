[div class=p 
	"There's one big problem with the Blizzard Arrow. Actually getting each part to hit some bosses is an incredibly difficult task. Part of it is that the initial ice ball is incredibly short range and requires getting close to the target, making sure they don't move out of the way. Another factor is that the icicle shots are horizontally offset from the ice ball , slightly more forward from where the ice ball was released. Fired in the wrong place and while the ice ball would connect the icicles will sail right past the intended target's hitbox. Adding to that is that the icicles come out in a timed delay so bosses and mid-bosses have to be manipulated into favorable patterns or else shots will whiff completely. The last part is that due to the vertical offset of the icicles getting the right position to get them to land is much harder on smaller targets.

					" The mirror match is a real pain to optimize blizzard arrow shots for. Every hit that lands when Omega isn't attacking causes knockback. This knockback is dependent on where he's hit, similar to Zero. This leads to the problem of misplaced shots having the icicles or the ball miss. The other concern is that distance from Omega is the only really big influence on his attack pattern manipulations. His
