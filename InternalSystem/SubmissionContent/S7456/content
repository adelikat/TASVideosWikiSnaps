	"Snow White in Happily Ever After is a game based on the 1990 Happily Ever After movie by Filmation; not the Disney one. This movie runs through various levels collecting coins and sneaking through hazards. This run completes Easy difficulty in 7:22.395 speedrun timing, which is 1:33 faster than the current world record. As a heads up, all of the enemies flash when they take damage; this is most apparent during the Maliss fight.

	"I chose to run this because this is a game I loved a lot as a kid. This is on Easy mode due to the other difficulties requiring more coins and having more exploration, and also having a longer final boss. I think Difficult could also make an interesting TAS, however. You can play as Snow White or Shadow Man, and in this run I choose Shadow Man due to him not having as tall of a hitbox, which makes it easier to avoid obstacles and also makes you throw from lower, which saves a lot of time in the final level. This does make it harder to collect coins, however.
