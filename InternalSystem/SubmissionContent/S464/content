[ul

		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" Koopa's brother in 8-4 was especially pain. It was impossible to bypass without delays. I solved it accidentally with a wall-omission trick (which is easy to perform though). Koopa himself was solved by avoiding the beetle right before him, after many tests.
				$LF
			]li
		]ul
		" How to prevent the game lagging in multiple coins/monsters scenes without playing too passively
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"Many other problems solved themselves rather automatically. I call it experience. :)
	$LF
	"To my surprise, the bullets in 4-3 and 8-1 are affected also by coins. I thought previously that only the timer affects them.

[ul

		" When Mario falls off a ledge while ducking, he looks like he's standing, but his collisions are calculated as if he's ducking. I use this in 4-4. Mario's head passes through a wall.

		" If you go swimming while ducking, Mario's collision checks are calculated as if he's ducking, even though he appears to be swimming in his full height.

	"Lastly - it's probably possible to improve this movie.
	$LF
	"I created it as a proof-of-concept movie, or rather as
	$LF

	$LF
	"against a fake Koopa in 4-4.
	$LF

[p 
	"I did that, but more importantly, I managed to get the
	$LF
	"through-a-wall trick working in 1-2. This and other minor
	$LF
	"details resulted that in the beginning of 5-1, the movie
	$LF
	"was 
	[em 
		"exactly
	]em
	" as long as the previous version.
	$LF
	"I had not lost or gained anything.
	$LF
	"From that on, the fireflower gained speed everywhere.
	$LF
	"I didn't have to wait for anything.
	$LF
	"Except the rotating fires in 8-4. They actually costed me time,
	$LF
	"because Mario was bigger than previously. However, the result
	$LF
