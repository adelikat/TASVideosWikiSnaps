	"A lot of the improvement came from exploiting the "window of opportunity" just before each boss room. There is one frame where you can jump. In fact you can continue to jump as long as you jump on the 1 frame of opportunity. This allows scrooge to jump into the room instead of SLOWLY walk into it. Also, I can get much closer to the boss and hit him much sooner.
