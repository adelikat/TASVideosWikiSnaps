	$LF
	"Alcahest is a top-down Action RPG which offers lots of movement tech and a moderate amount of glitches.
	$LF
	"Aside from moving around with the D-pad, you can sprint by tapping the direction button twice. You also have a basic attack button which you can charge and release. The type of charge is based on the guardian you have with you, which is indicated by the colour of the player. You also have a spell button which consumes MP, and a button that makes your companion use their ability, which consumes SP.

	$LF
	"Here is where things get interesting. When I get to the miniboss I die on purpose at the same frame the boss dies. This causes me to be "dead" while still being able to control myself. This makes me able to move around while dialogues are playing. This does save a lot of time but not as much as one would think, because chests that contain "key items" need to be on-screen when the text box disappears in order for me to get the item in my inventory. You cannot skip the item jingle that plays when you pick up a "key item". I cannot pick up health items or get hit by anything while being in this glitched state, because it would either kill me instantly or cancel the glitch. While being in this state, I can skip many of the boss dialogues, which also causes the camera to detach from the player. It is just a funny side effect. I also press the pause button on the same frame a dialogue box appears. This causes the dialogue to be skipped completely. This only works on some dialogues. This also makes us able to completely skip the follower Sirius.

I also use the same dialogue pause glitch as in stage 3. Here we also get the best follower, which is Magna, who can use time stop, which resets enemy iframes and freeze them in place.

	"We skip most of this stage because we completely skip the magnet boots, which allows us to walk on the conveyor belts. We do this by charging the red sword while standing on the last pixel of a conveyor belt. If we then release the charge and press a direction, we can travel forward a pixel, allowing us to get away from the belt. This makes us able to pick up a key item needed to head to the boss. Then we use the pause button to skip the dialogues as usual.

The boss of stage 8 is the final boss, Alcahest.

	$LF
	"Alcahest has 2 phases and on phase 1 we start by using Magna's time stop ability together with blue sword charge. Because of the high SP cost of time stop, we trigger the Sage Stone we picked up earlier, which restores SP and MP when SP becomes depleted. We also get something called Aura Blade, which makes our regular attacks shoot out projectiles for a while. We use this to kill the first phase in 2 cycles.
	$LF
	"In phase 2, we use the red guardian spell together with blue sword charge to kill the boss. We only use time stop at the end, because if you deal too much damage too fast, the boss goes into a phase where the boss teleports away and shoots lightning that expands in a pattern. When the boss reaches 0 HP, we have a small amount of dialogues left after we lose control of our inputs.

	(__wikiLink|displaytext=left it off of my alternate DTC10 choices list|href=/Forum/Topics/22636)
	" strictly so I could use it in the event I host another DTC. Now I get the thrill of the final product without the stress of the hunt! It almost feels like the game was made to be TASed: Movement is quick and precise, there's that fun death glitch that leads to both solid timesaves and a lot of added entertainment, and the bosses are mindblowingly quick with the huge variety of attacks, all used to perfection in the run.
