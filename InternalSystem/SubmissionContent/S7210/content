	"There are not many mechanics, and those that do exist are very clearly unfinished. Wall detection is very poor, oftentimes making you get caught on walls you aren't even close to. Combat is in its early stages as well - although it seems like it may have gotten finished and used in The Amazing Spider-Man.

	"When wall crawling, if you're going straight up, it's best to just hold up and let spider-man do his thing. But if you're moving even slightly sideways, it's faster to repeatedly jump up the wall. Sideways and diagonal wall crawling is extremely slow. Additionally, when you reach the top of a wall, spider-man has a very slow animation where he rolls up onto his feet. You can avoid it by double jumping over the top of the wall - though the area where spider-man can crawl extends much higher than it should, so you have to jump quite high to get over it.

	"In combat, it seems like the jump button acts as a dodge button, but it usually doesn't actually evade attacks. It's best to try to group enemies together and hit multiple of them at once, and they die in 3 hits.
