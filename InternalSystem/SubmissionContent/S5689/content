	"Happy Halloween, everyone. I prepared TAS of scary(?) game for Halloween. This is well known for "EarthBound Halloween Hack", it is also the first appearance of Toby Fox's signature song, "Megalovania". Probably this is a most famous ROM Hack of EarthBound. The story of this Hack is that the bounty hunter Varik enters the memory of Dr. Andonuts and rescues Ness and Co. Unfortunately, Ness was not found until the end.

	" Many players call it "bad ending". Then, is there any way we can leave him alone? When the option "Kill Him" appears, it is possible to NOT kill him by pressing the B button. That's why this game is also known as "Press the B Button, Stupid!". From now on, the conditions for "best ending" are met. Also Varik to regain stability and can be rescue his three missing friends, Paula, Jeff, and Poo. However, in this movie, I didn't need to do this unnecessary conversation because I changed the order of the events using "Skipping a trigger spot" glitch. Details of the tricks I used, including this glitch are here: http://tasvideos.org/GameResources/SNES/Earthbound.html
