		"Visually, this submission appears to be recorded methodical, yet flawed (i.e. missed jumps), human play as opposed to a planned/executed TAS of the game using available TAS tools.

		"The game is not completed as presented in this submission; stopping instead after world 8-3.

		"The optimization of this submission is woefully sub-optimal compared to the 
		(__wikiLink|displaytext=various runs of this game already published|href=/1G)
		"; "glitchless" play notwithstanding.  Further, this run (as-is) is already slower than the current human record for the same category.  Even subtracting the additional TAS timing from power-on, adding 8-4 to the run would add enough time to the total displayed on this submission that it would still be longer than human play.
