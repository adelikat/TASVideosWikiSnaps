	"At the end of 2-2, Mario comes out of the side of the pipe instead of inside the pipe. My friend and I looked into this a little bit and came up with the general principle.
	$LF
	"First of all, Mario's entrance is controlled by the address $7FFE, which in most cases has a value of 0, but at the end of 2-2 it changes to 1. This causes Mario to come out of the pipe. We found that its value can be changed by manipulating enemies. One enemy with ID 1A is particularly important, because it will directly determine the value of $7FFE. This enemy is generated once per frame in each empty slot. So to not change the value of $7FFE, each enemy slot cannot be empty. So this is bothering us. But we've looked everywhere, and only 2-2 works. A very close level is 4-2, but because the exit pipe is so far away from the enemies, the enemies disappear before Mario gets there.
