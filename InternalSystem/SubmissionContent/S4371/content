	"This movie was started after Inzult PMed me a 20 frame improvement, it was a simple overworld luck manipulation. He was sure there were five more frames to save. So I gave it a try, after a month.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"The first one frame improvement came from doing the healer glitch faster. For no reason there was one frame delayed when talking to the lady, the delay did absolutely nothing. With that one frame improvement the overworld manipulation can be done faster, which lead to some more frames to improve. So in total 28 frames were saved until picking up the hammer. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Now there would be potential for more improvement after the game restart sequence, but the RNG destroyed everything in the Great Palace. There were 29 frames total until entering Great Palace - 35 frames maximum, but some where lost due to overworld manipulation. But the red knight wouldn't like to attack as quickly as in the published run, this means 9 frames were lost. Luckily the random numbers reset after a game restart sequence, so I used the inputs from the published run after the game restart sequence, changed them a bit to make this movie look a bit different.

	"The luck for enemy behaviour seems only to depend on the the time the enemy does an action, but the values change depending on the frame when Link enters a house, they don't just freeze, a completely new value is the result, I'm not sure if this counts for every exit Link takes. For example the on frame improvement with the healer glitch. When talking to the lady the RNG freezes, this means Link will enter the house with always the same values, but at a different time, which lead to different values when entering the next sectiion. I was not able to debug this, so I don't really know how it works.
