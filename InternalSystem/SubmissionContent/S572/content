	"-This is a unbelievable 8 Star Super Battle walkthrough beating all opponents in average 16 seconds and got a awesome score of 1.795.500! This time I concentrated more on the combos than on the time or power of the hits and it's definitely the better choice. I mastered up to sensational 8 hard hit combos with a incomparable 6800 combo-score. Beated every opponent on a absolutely different way so you will be addicated to watch this run over and over again.
