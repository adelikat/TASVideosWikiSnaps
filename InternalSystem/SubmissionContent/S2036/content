	"I notice that people have posted links to this in both the Sonic 06 LP thread, and Cybershell's SONIC series LP thread, so I should like to explain myself. Basically, the idea I had here was "Hey, pokecapn, kungfujesus, medibot. I know you've watched some of my stuff. I watch your stuff, too. How about you drop by and say hi to the nice TASvideos forum users?" No disrespect was meant to IlluminatusVespucci. I simply do not know if he watches and/or cares about TASes at all. For that matter, no disrespect was meant to pokecapn, KFJ, or medibot. This was like a shout out, but more differenter. --Upthorn

The reason for this is because the TSC records are recorded in Time Attack mode, where none of the timezone posts are present, and having to slow down in order to get rid of a Future post causes me to lose a fair few frames, as I can't jump to fall faster on the cliff just after this.
