	"Ys: The Vanished Omens is normally a game about exploring the world, defeating bosses, collecting items and experience and saving the world. Thanks to how broken the mirror inside Pim's shop is, however, Adol decides he doesn't want to bother with any of that pesky exploring business, and instead warps himself to the end of his journey.

I discovered by pure coincidence that certain vertical scrolls allow the credits warp to be triggered without entering the in-game menu. I wanted to see if this would save any time, and the result is this TAS, which saves 21 frames over the previous by CoolKirby.
