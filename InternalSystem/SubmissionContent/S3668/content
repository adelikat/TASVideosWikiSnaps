	"New Super Mario Bros. Is a DS game published by Nintendo in 2006. This game reuses the basic controls, powerups and objects found in the original Super Mario Bros. for NES. However, it adds a few powerups, such as:

[p 
	"- Unlock World 7 instead of 6. This is because world 6 has many levels that I can't skip, while World 7 has less levels and more skips.

	"While watching the existing TAS on this game, which beats the game in 21:01 minutes, I noticed how the maker used the cannons to skip a big part of the game. So, I decided to TAS the game myself, and see if I could get a good time. However, I want people to see more of the game, so I decided not to use cannons in this run. I was surprised to see I could finish the run in under an hour, spending an average of 10 min. per world.

	"I could probably improve my run by a few minutes, but since it was my first time TASing with DeSMuME, I wasn't used to all the tools.

	[a class=intlink href=/1863M 
		"any% run
	]a
	". In some stages, in World 8 in particular, you lose upwards of 30 seconds in some stages, which is far too much to be considered acceptable. From just watching the play, it looks generally not optimized, as many mistakes are plainly visible and some strange choices are made (such as getting a Mega Mushroom right before the final stage, which takes a minute to get, but does not actually save any time; compare the final boss battle to the any% run). Because of all these flaws, I'll have to reject this run.
