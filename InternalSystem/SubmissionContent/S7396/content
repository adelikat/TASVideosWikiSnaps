	"This game doesn't have much to do. You have two mini-games you can do, but they don't change in difficulty after the first time. The credits can also be navigated to in the menus immediately upon booting the game so there isn't even any "unlocking" credits like the Game Boy Camera. The most "unlocking" that could be done would be the little mini-movies they have next to the credits, but that ends up just being boring grinding I'm too lazy to do. This TAS is also probably improvable by getting a better pattern for the sliding puzzle (I just used the first one I got).
