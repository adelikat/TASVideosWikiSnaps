	"Heart of Darkness if a 1998 cinematic platformer action-adventure game developed by Amazing Studio and supervised by Eric Chahi, also known as the creator of Another World (AKA: Out of This World). The game follows Andy as he is travelling through another world called the Darkland to rescue his dog.

	"Due to the cinematic nature of this game, the framerate is quite low, usually between 10 and 15 FPS.

	"The first three screens are the most glitch inducing ones of the run. You are supposed to wait 40s in the second screen before the enemies stop spawning and new ones spawn in the third screen, and the game try really hard to make sure you don't escape before that. There are in particular three shadows that instantly respawn when killed and don't move from the exit of the screen. I initially thought it was impossible even for a TAS to get out early but with carefull manipulation of the enemies behavior I managed to find a window to got to the next room 22s earlier.
	$LF
	"The main issue of this early escape is that some enemies are bugged and don't despawn, which may softlock the game at the 4th screen (which is why I killed some shadows on the third one even though it wasn't necessary to climb the ladder) and at the first rock screen (the only way I found to prevent the softlock was to shot with the plasma cannon for a few frames). One last softlock is when falling to the big bridge area, and the only way to prevent it was to get killed, which in the end is still faster than waiting the whole 40s in the second room.
