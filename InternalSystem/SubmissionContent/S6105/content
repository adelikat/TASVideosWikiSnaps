	"This TAS was completed with 54 checkpoints. The route used was Intermission Skip, which is normally not used to speedrun the game, but in this case it has fewer checkpoints than DIS (Double Intermission Skip) or Gravitron Skip. The category is No Telejumping, where you cannot telejump, which is used to skip many large sections of the game.

	$LF
	"This level has the most unskippable checkpoints compared to all the other stages. There is one room with 11 checkpoints alone. This stage has the Double Gordian Knot trick and the Lighter than Air trick. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In the Double Gordian Knot trick, the player flips onto the two moving platforms and then flips in between them to get on the underside of the second platform. The player waits on the platform for a little while, then flips onto the top of the ground on the opposite side. This requires two frame-perfect inputs, but is still used by speedrunners in real time.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In the Lighter than Air trick, the player falls onto the checkpoint, flips immediately twice and falls upwards without having to pause in the holes like in the intended route. This requires two frame-perfect inputs, but is much easier than the Double Gordian Knot trick as you can buffer the flips. The trick requires you to hit the checkpoint, but that checkpoint is unskippable anyways.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There is also another trick that is used many, many times throughout the run. It is called the edge flip. In VVVVVV, the game gives the player 2 extra frames to flip after they walk off a platform. This means that you can flip when you're already falling off the platform, causing you to gain more height and distance. You cannot use this trick if you flip while you're on the ground, except in a special case which I'll talk about later.

	"In this level, there are screens that wrap around the sides, so you can continually fall up or down or move left or right. This level uses the Warp Token Death trick, but only once compared to the usual two. The second warp token death requires the use of a skippable checkpoint, however, so it is not used.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In the room "Short Circuit", I use a skip where instead of having to wrap around the right side of the screen, I just fall straight into the hole. This trick is performed in real time speedruns.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In the room "Shockwave Rider", there are two tricks. First of all, you don't have to go the intended route in the first part of the screen, you can barely squeeze into the hole without getting hit by the enemies. Second of all, you don't have to fall down twice, you can just flip onto the bar in between the enemies and avoid them.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In the room immediately afterwards, "Sweeney's Maze", there is a frame- and pixel-perfect turnaround to avoid the checkpoint. I thought that this was impossible, until tzann, another runner, found that it was.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The first death warp in the rooms "This will make you flip" and "Twisty Little Passages" causes the warp token to teleport the player up to a platform that is closer to the next room than the regular route. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The problem with death warps is that you have to get a checkpoint for them to work. The checkpoint in "This will make you flip" happens to be unskippable, so that is used for the death warp.

	" Intermission Skip
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Checkpoints hit: 1
	$LF
	"As I stated in the comments, this skip is used instead of the Gravitron Skip or DIS because it hits fewer checkpoints. Normally, at the beginning of the game you complete Space Station 1 and get the corresponding crewmate, but that is skipped. Usually, after 3 crewmates are rescued, you get teleported to an area called Intermission 1. However, the crewmate at the end of Space Station 1 initiates a cutscene, allowing the intermission to be skipped. However, in the cutscene the rescued crewmates get erased from memory, causing the game to think they aren't rescued and softlocking the game. However, if you kill yourself as the Level Complete screen shows up, you can skip the cutscene, making the crewmates still saved. During the next stage, though, there will be the Level Complete banner at the top of the screen, obstructing the view of the level.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Another interesting thing to note is that you usually have to touch a teleporter to use it again, but if you go straight back to the teleporter without walking offscreen after teleporting, you have the teleporter at the end of Space Station 1 unlocked. I do not know why this is the case.

]h4
[p 
	"Checkpoints Hit: 6
	$LF
	"It may seem like there are only 5 checkpoints hit, but that is because there is a checkpoint hidden behind the Level Complete banner. This level has an autoscrolling theme, causing it to be one of the slowest levels in the game. However, there is a trick where you die near the top of the screen, causing the screen to scroll upwards faster. This is normally used 6 times in a run, but the trick requires you to hit a checkpoint. There is one checkpoint there that is unskippable, so I do the death scroll there.

	$LF
	"This is one of the most tedious levels in the game for causal players and speedrunners. It is an avoidance level, with lines that flip your gravity bouncing you up and down while trying to avoid enemies. In this category, the Gravitron is usually skipped, but it has fewer checkpoints than the other routes. There is one checkpoint at the end of the Gravitron, but that is skippable. Even if it wasn't skippable, this route would still have fewer checkpoints. The Gravitron takes longer than Intermission 1, though, so that caused my run to be longer.

	$LF
	"This level is normally the first level found in casual gameplay, but in this route it is done last. It introduces the gimmick of gravity lines, which are strings that flip your gravity when you touch them. There is one trick that is used four times during the run, called the line clip. If you flip again two frames after you flip off the ground, you can clip through a line because the game thinks that you're still on the ground, so it causes you to flip and negate the line flip. This is only used once in "Three's a Crowd", but it will be used three times in the next level.

So all that's there to compare is strats and techniques. And in that regard, you're losing to an existing record, which breaks
