[p 
	"That's not to say the game itself is bad.  Its platforming is solid and is a fairly good way to unwind.  It's just that the title is wholly unremarkable and will leave little to no impact on you unless you've played it as a child.  And, as a corollary to that, this game seems like it would be good for kids.

	"A Few Notes About the Run
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	[b 
		"About the minigames:
	]b
	" For the most part, I aim to simply get through the levels as quickly as possible.  However, in the first ten minutes, I have to play four different minigames.  I decided that watching me fail some of them in order to reduce bonus time would be rather dull, so I decided to do as well as possible within the constraints of tool assistance, regardless of the bonus that should come.  This results in getting a score of 117 for the matching game and the 109 lives that come as a consequence.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"About the sound:
	]b
	" This game uses CD audio for its music.  If you want to hear the (often illfitting) music, burn the ISO to a disc and read 
	[a class=intlink href=/Forum/P/190131#190131 
		"mz's post here
	]a

[h3 
	"Notable Bugs
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The main conceit behind this title is that scattered throughout the levels are various devices that aid the player in doing whatever.  The most useful bugs are the result of these.
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		[b 
			"Switch Jumping:
		]b
		" After changing between outfits in midair, you have a window of two frames in which you can jump.  Good for accessing shortcuts and working around some obstacles.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		[b 
			"Switch Snapping:
		]b
		" If you're within a certain distance distance of certain platforms, Punky will "snap" to that platform's level.  Used to climb faster is some cases and to assist in the above glitch in others.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		[b 
			"Claw Walking:
		]b
		" Comes in two forms, both of which can only be done while wearing the claws.
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				[b 
					"Fast Walking:
				]b
				" When you press left and right at the same time, Punky will double his walking speed in whatever direction he was facing.  Needs to be a good distance from dirt to work.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				[b 
					"Wall Zipping:
				]b
				" If you press the opposite direction you were walking with no gaps in the input, Punky will continue walking in the original direction, but walls will act like he's walking the direction you are holding.  This allows you to enter into walls and initiate a wall warp once you get in far enough.  There can be no dirt laterally near the place you are entering, and can screw with how objects get generated in the level.  In part two of Pathgrinder III, if I had entered at the earlier point, a boulder would have appeared where I would have gotten out at, blocking my path.  In Crevasse Chaos, I couldn't perform the zip right before the end because the flagpole wouldn't have generated. (also, in Pathgrinder I, the vertical zip was the result of the quicksand right next to the wall)
				$LF
			]li
		]ul
		[b 
			"Dirt Grabbing:
		]b
		" Another claw glitch.  If Punky catches a dirt wall while falling, he may get a vertical boost putting him 16 pixels above where he should have grabbed.  If his head gets lodged in a wall or a boulder as a result, you can perform the afore-mentioned wall warp.

[ul

		[b 
			"Stink Extension:
		]b
		" While in standard outfit, attacking near the apex of a jump will cause Punky to hover for the duration of the attack animation.  Used mainly for some minor stuff.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		[b 
			"Victory in Death:
		]b
		" After hitting the flagpole, the screen will stop scrolling.  If there's no solid ground underneath you at the time, this will create a pit which will kill you, but the level will still finish anyway.  Used once to force the end-of-level bonus time down.  Does not work in Aeroskunk.

]h3
[ul 
	[li 
		"I made two in Pathgrinder II, both in part 2: First, I should have wall warped at the very beginning to reduce travel time as standard Punky.  Second, I should have fast walked closer to the flagpole to reduce claw travel time.

		"I probably should have waited in the dialog during Drill Sargent in order to manipulate the Commander's final position to be closer to the bottom.

		"In both Castle Hassle and Sugar Rush Hour, I should have jumped first thing after grabbing the roller blades.  This would have brought me up to max speed instantly.

	]li
	[li 
		"I don't think I handled most of the updrafts optimally.  Who knew falling for a bit before entering would give you slightly greater height?

		"About half way through I realized I was handling the dialog boxes wrong.  As such, most of these can be improved by exactly one frame.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"Most of these could be hexed in, except the RNG that functions on many levels is based on a universal timer that gets started when you begin the first level.  In order to hex these in, I would have had to redo most of the levels, probably multiple times, in order to get things to synch back up, and I don't quite have ComicalFlop's near lethal determination.
