	"An interesting little game-breaker, triggered off of the boss of Stage 4. There's a lot of technical explanation behind the glitch, but the gist of it is that it's a permanent hitbox change, and you can push yourself into ceilings and zip through corners. Yes, it's permanent until the console is turned off.

Going in earlier would lock the boss in a horrible, unusable pattern. Luckily this one works just fine.
