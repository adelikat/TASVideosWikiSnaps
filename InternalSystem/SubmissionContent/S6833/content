	"There was some confusion regarding what the rules for unofficial games mean, and we're working on improving their wording, but the concept won't change, so it's safe to judge this movie now. The game doesn't look terribly unplayable, it even resembles the original game in some aspects, even though it's still a typical Taiwanese bootleg in terms of overall quality. But I think down-porting from a 16-bit platform deserves recognition, as there's no other NES equivalent.
