	"Finally done!! Took almost 3 months to make this run! I totally agree with Highness when he wrote back then in his submission-text, that this game is one of the hardest games ever made! I had nothing to do one day so I clicked around in this site, checked out some movies and

	"I thought, "Hey! Why not improve any movie, which is published?" and after I checked out Highness movie here, I thought that this could be a good movie to improve! But before I started I wanted Highness permission. I could have done this movie without asking him, but because I'm so polite, I asked if he had any plans on making a run of Toki, but if he doesn't have any plans on do a run, then I could do it!

	"For starters, I use the same rom as Highness for the same reason he wrote: because not everybody will understand japanese. Then I recorded it in gens9j! After some stages (in stage 6) I discover the latest emulator gens_movie_9Z and start to continue the recording with that emulator instead! I use extremely much luck manipulation, so that the movie will be fast as possible and entertaining as possible. I don't really get why Highness wrote in his submission-text that he used programming errors, but I THINK I use that at one place: stage 6, when

	"I get the hi-jump boots. But I'm not sure! Okay I'll explain more of the stuff I used in this movie: no death or damage. Yes, belive it or not but I'm not taking damage in this movie, not a single time, I'm not dying in this movie either. And the sad thing is that you can't take damage to save time, cause damage=death. So I fake death (you can also say play with death if that sounds more correct), or what I should call it! That means that it looks like I'm touching things (that kill you at once normally) but it doesn't! :P

	"for fun! Yes, I hurt/kill enemies often during waiting time, but also when I'm in action sometimes! When I'm not finding any enemy to hurt or kill during the waiting time I usually wobbling to make the movie less boring, but maybe I'm doing that to often? If so, I have to make a new run of this game in the future, where I'm not doing that so often! And last but not least: plays at the hardest level!
