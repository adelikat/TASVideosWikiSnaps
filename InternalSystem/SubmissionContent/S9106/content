	"Yes, I know. Another smw hack submission. However this one's actually a little more interesting since there's more glitches. Although nearly none of them are used besides corner clips and occasional walljumps. There's also a few things to note with this hack. First, the normal jump sound is removed because the dev thought it was annoying (it literally says that in the readme) so if it sounds way quieter than normal, that's probably why. Second, I don't know what is wrong with the credits. Looking at them in Lunar Magic showed the exact same glitched tiles that you see in-game. It's not a core issue, it's just... how it looks. Third, that abomination of a thing that is the final boss is actually how it looks. Also no glitched tiles, intentional design. I think...

	"Nothing really special going on here but there is one thing worth noting. The No Yoshi intro isn't automated and isn't skippable. What this means is in this small little room we can build P-Speed, jump and gain takeoff metre to activate instant flight for the actual first room of the level. However we don't see it much since it's the shortest run.

	"Second instance of the No Yoshi intro. However we don't actually instantly get cape flight because we'd need more height. In the sublevel we bring the spring with us to speed up the journey while we're in water and fall out of water above us faster since with item swimming you can press down to instantly start descending unlike without items where you need to either wait to lose momentum or hit a ceiling.

	"It's the same as usual. Going under the entire level. However the one difference is that we're getting the secret exit this time. And for this we need the P-Switch, meaning the on/off blocks need to be in the "off" state. By hitting the on/off switch in a specific way we can be going down fast enough when we hit it to be able to beat the blocks to the underside of the level. Then at approximately 0E screens we go up to get the P-Switch and then come back down to continue our journey through this colourful palace. 5 screens later and we go up again to get to the pipe that's blocked off with brown blocks. There's our secret exit. Then we just, yet again, go under the entire section until we get to the key and keyhole.

	"A classic "Choose Your Own Adventure" style final level as seen many times before. The entire level is the same thing repeated. Go to one side, get cape flight, enter the door with takeoff metre, get instant cape flight in the sublevel, repeat. In hub 3 however, you can save a ton of time by going into the point where the two coloured blocks meet indicated by coins. This puts you in a room where the door to the next hub is right next to you. After all these hubs though, we finally reach the midpoint. This boss door puts you in a long room with nothing in it besides a goal post at the end with no goal tape and a pit afterwards. This pit takes you into a room with cloud blocks that aren't to hard to maneuver around. Then we have a short little autoscroller section before the true final boss. No, the boss isn't bowser. Instead it's a... big boo? Thing? I don't know to be exact but it's basically a corrupted big boo. Anyway the first hit isn't insta-hittable due to the airship-like foreground so we do have to take that time to go grab a throwblock to hit it with. Every hit after that however is instant so just a little bit of flying around while waiting. After the third hit that's it.
