As I was skimming through the inputs, I found a stray frame in Secret Base 2 and ended up discovering a few more frames due to a resulted desync. This lead me to coming across even more improvements than anticipated.

The other one, the one used in this run, utilizes a 10-rev spindash at the edge of the first platform and punch at the edge of the second one to reach the collapsing platform much faster. The rest is essentially the same.
