	"This is a ~14s improvement of the current movie. This is mostly due to more precise, and in some cases different, cursor movement. This movie uses the same route as Walker Boh's movie, but as said earlier, the cursor movement is slightly different. Overall, the ~14s improvement is pretty hard to see with the naked eye, but you can see it if you use frame advance :)
