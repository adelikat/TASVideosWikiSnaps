	"Road Rash II is a motorcycle racing game for the Sega Genesis. It is the second release in the series and was published by Electronic Arts, hitting store shelves in 1992. The game features fast pace racing at speeds in excess of 180 MPH around roads based in the United States. Twisting turns, hills, obstacles and the fuzz provide a hazardous ride on these courses. Some of the other "Rashers" hold on to weapons as they race to up the difficulty of winning. Keep up, win first, and you may be victorious and move on to face a more difficult crowd. Don't forget to knock down an opponent or two on your way to the top.

]h3
[div class=p 
	"This run features the use of a menu code to achieve a hidden bike at the beginning called the "Wild Thing". It is capable of reaching speeds of 200MPH and even faster with it's unlimited nitro capabilities. It is also impossible to fall off of the bike unless there is a collision. I utilize the motorcycles handling and speed to not only reach the end as fast as possible, but also to dodge road signs, trees, cars, and provide mammoth jumps off of large hills and scenery which is one of the main playarounds in the video. I suggest turning the volume down, as I am very liberal with the use of the nitro which makes a high pitch whining noise when activated. These speed boosts are very necessary to keep maximum speed available where possible to achieve highest jumps and quick and breakneck slaloming.

[div class=p 
	"Not only is it lightning fast, but it provides tons of entertainment that a standard bike wouldn't. The wild thing provides a no-falling experience unless a collision has happened. This makes sharp curves especially off road at these speeds possible. You can also gain much more air off of jumps with the extra speed and nitro that is provided.

Overall I really enjoyed the experience and can see myself doing as another hobby addition to the world of gaming. It seemed a little tedious at first having to go back and forth and make sure inputs were in correctly, spending hours to achieve something that seemed decent. After all that work it felt very rewarding to see something that looked fairly decent.
