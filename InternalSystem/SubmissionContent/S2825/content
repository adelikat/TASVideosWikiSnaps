	"This game was on my gameboy collection catridge along with many other gameboy games. My plan in the long run was to TAS most of the games I knew from that catridge and this is why I'm so addicted with gameboy games. I made a testrun in 2008 and uploaded it to Youtube, but nothing much else happened. mmbossman contacted me later about this testrun and eventually we began working on a new version. I found a whole ton of new glitches at that time, shaving more and more time from the route but the project was stuck when we didn't know how to manipulate luck in a certain room. Time went by and I found later on that you can manipulate luck by pausing the game, though there wasn't any progress on the run anymore. Scepheo contacted me about my WIP and wanted to assist me. The project still didn't gain much more progress, but he made some useful technical discoveries.

	"But today things have changed. I randomly played this game out of boredom and tried the Out-of-bounds glitch in stage 2. From the testings I made on the GB version, I expected the game to crash but it didn't on the SGB version. And within hours a whole new and faster route was found and the TAS was finally done, within 1 day! Yes, I had so much fun doing this and I couldn't stop. I like these kinds of projects where you aren't stuck at a certain place and where you know what to do. :D

If you reach the end of the room with this speed, you gain access to the 'superstages', a set of levels the programmers left in as a challenge for advanced players. You are given many lives and points (for HP refills and weapon changes). In this TAS, I slow down before the screen transition to enter room 2 instead of the superstages. I keep my speed status throughout the entire battle with K-9 (dog) to exit the room faster later on.

You can stay offscreen by holding "down", but you can't directly go out of bounds. In order to go out of bounds, you need to exit the previous room with a jump and in the state of shooting. If done correctly, you can go out of bounds once you are falling downwards in the next room (while holding "down").

All you have to do is kill Marvin in this room and survive 20 seconds until the Staff credits play, but it takes me 2 deaths. I have many lives left so I could have ended input early. But I thought that part would look sloppy if I had done this and it would have extended the encode. So I chose to end the input once you can see the first frame of the Staff credits.
