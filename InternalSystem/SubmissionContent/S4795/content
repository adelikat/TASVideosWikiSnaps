	": Hi, arandomgameTASer.  Congrats on finally finishing this (and thanks for including commentary with the encode)!  It's apparent that much work went into optimizing movements, equips, and fight strategies, throughout (watching Roxas's limit break abuse was especially a treat to watch).  Outstanding job, and looking forward to your next TAS.
