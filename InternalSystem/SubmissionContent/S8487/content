	"Chess Challenger was a game originally programmed for the Colecovision in 1983 by Fidelity Electronics but was never commercially released, with only a few demo cartridges of the game ever being produced. In 2011, Collectorvision got hold of one of the rare demo carts, turned it into a finished game, and finally released it to the public.

	"The goal is not necessarily to checkmate in the least number of moves but to deliver the checkmate that makes the computer "think" the least (of course, reducing the number of moves does help significantly). Shorter "thinking" times are achieved by keeping the position simple. Giving the computer few options and not attacking with a lot of pieces simultaneously is a good way to minimize thinking times.

It turns out the computer is much more willing to make bad pawn moves as white than as black, essentially falling for some longer variation of the Fool's Mate.

	"Computer moves here are determined with a fairly wide degree of randomness compared to other board games on old consoles. Fortunately, RNG can be manipulated through the timing and type of both cursor movements and moves—meaning it is, like, really easy to manipulate. This is great because if the computer decides it's safe to make an opening move, there's a good chance we can get it to make a bad pawn move. RNG manipulation with the cursor is so versatile, we only sacrificed a single frame in the whole TAS for RNG manipulation.

This makes a little less sense to me how computer thinking times can be manipulated in this way but I guess it must call RNG during some point(s) in its search algorithm. In any cases, I tested this extensively to make sure the computer made each move in the least time possible.

		" A: The computer is not stupid enough to throw mate in 1, so the computer will not play g4 or f4 on the second move if it played g4 or f4 on move 1. But it will play those two moves if it has already played h4, which is why we must allow it. Now while the computer won't miss mate in 1, it can miss mate in 2, which is why we had to set up some sort of more complicated version of the Fool's Mate. By taking white's knight with our bishop, we set up a trap. The right move here for the computer is not to take back, as then the rook would stop defending the h pawn. The computer chooses incorrectly (probably because the engine is too material-focused), blundering mate in 2 as our queen can now come in and deliver the final blow.
