	"I was asked to do this game again but on the Japanese version. So here it is. Almost 3 minutes faster then Morimotos run. However, I couldn´t find it and I didn´t searched that much, but I recall the rules to be something like: "Famtasia is NTCS so the game should be NTCS". The reason for bringing this up is cus the japanese version beats my own USA version with almost 4 minutes! That´s pretty much.
