	".  This allowed me to detect any lag and remove/minimize it.  It also helped me monitor enemy HP values to optimize boss/mini-boss fights.

	"Some slight lag reduction was done for a few frames.  The big change is that I get the homing weapon instead of the firebal.  This allows me to destroy the boss a few frames faster and make one less jump (jumping costs 2 frames).  The big payoff from this change will come in level 2.

	"This is where the homing missles pay off.  One shot of homing missles can do 3 damage on a boss if positioned perfectly as opposed to the 2hp that a F blast does.  I use this to save some time on every tank in this level.

	"The homing gun allows me to minimize lag in the first half of the level.  I get the F weapon here in preparation for the final boss fight.  I was able to destroy the final form of the boss before he became invulnerable the first time.  This saved the largest portion of the savings of this level.

		" Spread is basically useless since shooting every 8 frames keeps me from doing the single stream of bullet technique like was done in contra.  Also, if 2 or more bullets hit an enemy at the same time, it only registers 1 hit. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Homing is potentially the best weapon to use.  Each blast is a set of 3 bullets that follow a target.  If used properly you can get 2 of the bullets to arc toward a target so that each of the 3 hit for 3 damage.  This means a blast of 3 hp per shot instead of 2 of the F.  It is a big pain to optimize, however.  Comparable to optimizing the spread gun in contra.

	[li 
		" Vertical scrolling levels have an up+down glitch.  You can use this to move through solid objects.  This was used to save a lot of time in levels 2 & 4 (ventuz used it as well as hero of the day in his test run).  It is also used to shorten the level end cutscene.  By having the character off screen, the game will immediately go to the next level without even playing the level complete music.  This saves about 5 seconds on each level.
