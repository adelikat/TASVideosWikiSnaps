	"We have shown a proof of concept for arbitrary code execution in the Japanese version of the game a year ago. However, it requires to gather one of several items that are only available in the late game (after about 2 hours of run), so we let it go. After the discovery of the game over glitch that lead to the

	", featuring 15 boring minutes of game overs, we were eager to find another route that could beat this time and be more fun to watch. This is where we remembered of the mid-frame reset technique used in a couple of published TAS, that might lead to getting these items much quicker. This was the beginning of our third work on this game. Comments are embedded in the above video and are available

The Nico TAS that's 18 seconds faster than this one (and that's not counting this submission ending input 5 minutes early, but I won't be pedantic about that) also aims for the fastest glitched time. For the purposes of this site, "game end glitch" refers to any way that the ending is reached far earlier than expected. This could be something as simple as 
	[a href=/5109S 
		"holding two buttons on an elevator and landing somewhere

Unfortunately for them, a separate team completed a run with a faster time that just so happens to not be nearly as entertaining. Sure, entertainment is a huge focus for us as TASers, but for years now it has not been the primary focus. We do publish new categories if people find them entertaining enough, but not two runs in the same category. And yes, all of these arguments do end up going in circles and coming around to the same point, that the detractors are almost literally saying "publish this run in the same category as a different category".

	"Pop quiz: Is this how we do things? No. The existence of the faster run is the reason why we can't accept it. It doesn't matter where it exists, how it exists, or when it exists. What matters is that we have it as public knowledge. There's an input file for us to easily verify it. There's an encode for people to watch it. It's there. It's faster. We don't publish RTA runs here, but if a TAS is slower than an RTA run then we reject it exactly because of that. Part of the judgement process is verifying that the run in question is the fastest known record for the game. We're human, we do miss clear and known improvements sometimes, especially ones hosted nowhere except on a OneDrive link that's only shared on Twitter to a small group of people, and yes there are times where we accidentally publish a run before we find a known improvement. But this is not the case.

	"Trust me, I think this is a great run and I would have loved to see it accepted and published, but this particular run in its current state, as I and others have mentioned several times before, cannot be published, even as a different category. I extended some leniency, hoping that there was a way the run could be salvaged and improved or at least explained in a way that makes it drastically different enough to publish, but over the responses I see in the thread it doesn't look like anything I suggested is going to be met. There was a slight ray of hope in the Nico TAS starting from dirty SRAM, but looking at the file more closely the SRAM is blank, much in the same way that this submission was at first, so it turned from a ray of hope into the final nail in the coffin.
