	"Hetfield90's RosenkreuzStilette "Spiritia" TAS in 28:01.15. It is 57.34 seconds faster than the 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=published run|href=/3496S)
	" by in-game timing parameters, and an improvement of 1087 frames(18.1s) through directly comparable improvements. (Note that the reason why this run appears to be 3s slower than the published run by standard TAS timing parameters is because the published run ends input before the final boss fight whereas this one does not, since doing so is detrimental to in-game time).
