	"Hetfield90's RosenkreuzStilette "Spiritia" TAS in 28:01.15. It is 57.34 seconds faster than the 
	[a class=intlink href=/3496S 
		"published run
	]a
	" by in-game timing parameters, and an improvement of 1087 frames(18.1s) through directly comparable improvements. (Note that the reason why this run appears to be 3s slower than the published run by standard TAS timing parameters is because the published run ends input before the final boss fight whereas this one does not, since doing so is detrimental to in-game time).

	" In-Game Time
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The in-game timer in the RosenkreuzStilette games is a strictly real-time clock that takes everything into account including lag, framerate, pauses, etc... which runs from the first stage select screen until the last cutscene plays after defeating Iris. Therefor the only thing that changes strategy-wise when aiming for fastest in-game time completion is not freeing Lilli to end input before the final Iris fight.

[p 
	"This run's in-game time completion is 26:35.90, which can be seen after the credits.

	" Stage Comparisons
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Differences surrounding Lilli acquisition and the Iris fight have been omitted from the stage by stage comparisons. Also, since ammo does not refill between fortress stages, frames sacrificed from ammo refills in those stages have been subtracted from their respective stage's framecount and consolidated into a separate value.
