	"The game is generally easy compared to the "brain-teasing" puzzle games, but some levels could pose quite some challenge. Most levels can be solved in more than one way. With help of glitches, we are able to beat the game even more quickly.

		" "Stomp" glitch: The "stomp" ability works in such a way that when a Green Robot or a Robot with Glasses uses the ability on the block to destroy, it first jumps up one-block high, then falls down back on the block, removes the block (by replacing it with a "blank" BG tile) and continues to fall through the blank space. This procedure however can be interrupted, by landing the robot on a ladder or solid floor. When this happens, the robot regains control and can move freely as usual, but the game still schedules "to replace a tile underneath a robot with blank" whenever any one robot moves down. This opens up some major shortcuts in some levels.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" "Climb-through" glitch: When a robot uses other robots as a ladder, it ignores collission-detection and can move through solid blocks. This opens up some minor shortcuts in some levels.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" "Push-in-place" glitch: The Red Robot usually moves along with the pushed block until the block stops or falls down in the air, even if the block was supporting other robots. However, if the Red Robot is supporting other robots as a ladder when pushing a blue block, the block will be pushed away while the Red Robot will be constrained in place. This can sometimes save time avoiding backtracking.

	"This movie had some fairly mixed reception from the audience. I personally feel the lack of music really hurts this run, and it's not quite that visually stunning compared to some other games that suffer from similar issues. I liked the amount of planning visible here, but it's not enough to overcome some serious flaws.
