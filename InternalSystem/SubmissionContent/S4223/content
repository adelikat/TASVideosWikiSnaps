	"Running is fastest method of transport, with the basic jump being slowest.  Franky can glitch the jump though by turning around a few frames in, cutting the jump short and thus landing quicker.  Since we want these jumps to be forward facing, this obviously requires turning around twice within the jump.  This means the fastest way of doing a given room is to just run straight through all enemies, at the cost of our own HP.  We have up to 3 lives, but going through the dying animation costs around 200 frames which is far more than the occasional damage shortcut would save.  This means we use only our initial life, avoiding as much damage as possible, and eventually ending the run on 1hp.  Sometimes jumps are done out of the way for the sake of killing enemies, who would otherwise cause significant slowdown.  Quite often the frames saved from lag removal are more than the few extra ones created by doing a slow jump, and so as many enemies will get killed throughout.  This needs to be done while jumping, as there's no run/shoot ability, you either need to be either standing or jumping while shooting.

	"Each major area cannot get completed independently, which means plenty of backtracking is needed between places.  Thankfully a teleporter picked up in Village helps quite a bit, and when returning to places such as Forest and Garden, there's no immediate hurry.  If the only thing left there was the tablet piece, then might as well grab that near the very end, when we need to go close to those areas anyway.  Speaking of which, Egypt is the only place with a skip in the run.  Grabbing a shield before entering gives just enough time to run across the deadly hot sand leading up to the pyramid.  This skips entering the first building, plus searching all over the sky for a collection of coins to trigger the intentional carpet transport.  Skipping that, plus an optional HP regeneration fuse gives a final completion of 93%.
