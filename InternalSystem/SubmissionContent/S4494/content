While notability is not easy to define, and this game has some level of it, the most important thing is the spirit of the law: we have the rule so that bad or meaningless homebrew games aren't accepted. This one is neither bad, nor meaningless, it's a nice port imitating the SNES style. It also is technically optimized. Accepting to Vault.
