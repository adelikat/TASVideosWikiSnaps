The stage changes to an Acid Rain Scenario (as X) or as a Junk Compressor Scenario (as Zero), which is the main reason of using X, Zero can also skip half of the stage, but, the Junk Compressor part  would take more frames than saved. There is an old trick used in the previous TAS against High Max, by destroying his shields twice, he goes to Berserk Mode, allowing X to damage him faster. As for Gate, if the character destroys his spheres as quick as possible, Gate instantly throws another right after getting hit, but to do this, X needs to get hit, this was done until X's HP was down to 1.

Zero uses a technique called SDC (Saber Dash Cancel), which allows him to use the 2 first saber attack from his triple combo to harm the enemy quickly and cancel with a dash and attack again. Repeating this process makes the boss fight realy quick, since these 2 attacks doesn't trigger invincibility barrier on bosses.

After a few other bosses, Scaravich comes, this fight was shorter by a good amount of frames by making him get hit by Yammark, instead of letting him go offscreen to come back. 6 frames were sacrificed to manipulate Metal Shark Player, this attack is faster than his usual dive attack. 7 frames were sacrificed to manipulate Wolfang, his ice ball attack makes him stand still, allowing Zero to SDC him.

My thanks goes to Atma and Mothrayas, Atma was already familiar with Megaman PSX TASing, letting me know some anomalities from this area wich is was new. And Mothrayas for helping on some bosses and letting me understand how the system works.

The biggest trick I found was to spawn the vertical platform earlier than the last run did in Gate 2. You'll know where it is because it looks like it wastes time even though it doesn't.
