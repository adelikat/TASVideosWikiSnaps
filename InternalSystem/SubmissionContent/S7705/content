[div class=p 
	"So we don't jump at all. There are 3 "heights" you can run in. If you're on the bottom row and move to the middle row on a certain frame, the game puts you past the hurdle and you don't have to jump. This saves around half a second since each jump would have cost a couple frames.

	"Probably the trickiest event of the bunch since the old mash strats don't work in this level for whatever reason. I tried numerous different patterns and couldn't find anything better than what I used. The one button mash doesn't work, alernating with no gaps in between was too slow, etc.

	": It all looks good to me from here. I did find a single frame of improvement, but the nature of it is insignificant enough (one of the steps in the tunnel section was a frame slower than the rest) that I'll just throw it in for free without need for co-author credit. I did have a look at all the other stages, but the only things I could really do were make that man move funny in slightly different, but equally speedy ways
