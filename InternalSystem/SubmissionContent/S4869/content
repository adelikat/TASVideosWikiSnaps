	"Here, I jumped out of the second moving platform in a better frame. Since Jumpman is slower when he is in the air, I jumped when the platform was in a lower position (so that he reaches the ground faster), and in a way that he reaches the ground in a 'good' frame. Divisibility by 3 and by 2 of the frame matters here, since Jumpman can't advance a pixel in 1 out of 3 frames when he is in the ground, and in 1 out of 2 frames when he is in the air.
	$LF
	"In the next platform, I boosted in the stairs that were below Jumpman, by pressing down to warp to it and then pressing up immediately to keep walking, and the jump to the last platform was also improved. Overall, 4 frames were saved in this stage.

	"In this stage I performed stair boosts in the stairs that were below Jumpman, which, luckily, made me to reach some of the stairs in better frames. The initial Y position of Jumpman, when he starts climbing a stair, depends of the value of an address that changes every frame he walks or jumps. 9 frames were saved in this stage.
