Additionally, Left, Right, and Jump presses are stored while climbing a ladder so that the actions would be done immediately at the end of ladder; this helped ending the input sooner, at the start of the last ladder.

	(__wikiLink|displaytext=responded to my question|href=/Forum/Topics/26027)
	" by saying that delaying the start of the game and changing in-game inputs didn't affect the barrel RNG at all. I have verified that to be the case from my testing as well. Another possible factor that I tested was changing the starting real-time clock date in the sync settings for the TAS, and it didn't affect a single thing as the first level synced perfectly with the same inputs but different date. Thus it doesn't look like doing any RNG manipulation for faster movement is possible with the knowledge currently known. As for everything else, the gameplay looks well optimized, so nice work on that!
