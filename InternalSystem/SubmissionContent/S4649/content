	"Batman Returns for the Sega Master System, like its cousins, is a sidescrolling action game based upon the 1992 Batman Returns film.

	"Batman can use his Batarang to attack enemies with 1 and can jump with 2. By pressing 2 quickly in mid air, Batman can swing around with his grappling hook. Batman can also glide in the air by pressing and holding 2 in mid air.

	"There are a few power ups in the game which can be acquired by hitting the bat symbols with Batarangs. The red symbol gives one extra life, grey symbol increases power and speed of Batarangs, and the yellow symbol increases the Batarangs' speed (Disputed).

	"I found the skip glitch one day cause I didn't realize that the truck was a barrage. (I picked route 2 cause I was thinking it skipped route 1, useful mistake)... Despite this fact, I wasn't able to beat Oswald (or reach him often, Tas power gave me my vengeance, and let me save Gotham!). (Route 2 is the hard mode...and allows you to do the skip glitch at 5-4, while route 1 has the skip at 5-3.)
