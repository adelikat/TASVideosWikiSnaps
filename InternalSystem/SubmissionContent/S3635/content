	": This game lives up to its reputation. Not only for regular play is it bad, it's pretty bad for a TAS too. The game looks like it's running in slow motion all the time, not just to create the TAS. The gameplay is rather boring, and 10 minutes for a game this bad is just way too much. Most of the audience can't stand this game, rejecting.
