	"Boppin' is a puzzle game developed by Accursed Toys and published by Apogee from 1994. The heroes, Yeet and Boik, notice one day that their arcade games have no monsters, and find out that Hunnybunz has taken them all away in his attempt to create a pure, anodyne world free of anything that could be perceived as controversial. Yeet and Boik set off to free these monsters at the behest of other video game heroes, because what else would they do if there was nothing to fight against?

	"This game was somewhat controversial in its time. The original version had disturbing animations when the players got a game over, but later versions had to have them activated by a command line parameter. Boppin' is also known for its bizarre imagery and its numerous religious and political references.

	"Some levels have gravity and some of them don't. Players can't move while blocks or bonuses are falling - except when they are walking off an elevator that just moved, in which case this restriction is cancelled. This quirk can be exploited to save a little bit of time. If a lot of blocks are falling, there's an additional flinching animation.

	"While freeing monsters is the story's objective, this actually wastes a lot of time and should be avoided whenever possible. Not only do you get the "I am free!" scene, but if you free at least one monster, you get a brief summary of freed monsters after the level. Not freeing anything skips all of this. If you must free one, try to position yourself in a way that minimizes the distance the monster has to travel to get to you.

The menu inputs can be buffered while the previous level is fading out, but if some blocks start the level in mid-air, the save + load must be done after they are finished falling. This cuts about 2.4 seconds off every level.

This sounds counter-productive, but the level ending triggers when you eliminate a certain number of blocks, NOT when you completely clear all blocks. This can allow you to skip certain blocks and end the level earlier than intended. This is not always worth doing because saving + loading takes some time. This trick also disables all elevators.
	$LF

[div class=p

To cut the boss's time in half, both players would need a score of 160000, and to quarter it, both need a score of 320000. Obviously this run skips as many monsters and mystery spots as possible, so the boss takes a lot more hits than it would in a normal playthrough. It's unknown if it's worth collecting more points to make the boss shorter, but it's unlikely to pay off, as each player would have to quadruple their current score to start having any effect, and would need eight times more points to cut the boss time in half. It's an interesting min/max problem, and it's perhaps worth looking into, but it would require collecting different amounts of points and redoing the whole run several times.
