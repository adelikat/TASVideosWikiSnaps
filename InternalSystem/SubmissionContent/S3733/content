	"As a note, the video is compressed in h.264 lossless, but I'm an encoding noob so the file was way too big for it to be beyond 480p and the video glitches out at certain time stamps (noted in the video description). Since then, Abahbob told me about a better way to encode videos, through x264 to very small mp4 files, so my future videos will all have "Original" settings and should be spared of video glitches.

	"The any% TAS from 2007 was outdated so I made a new run. This new run uses a lot of new strategies, soft resets and better optimization than before. I haven't watched my previous run for years, so I will not directly compare and tell what has been improved, but I will point out a few things. Many of the route improvements were copied from the new RTA by 黒パン | Blackbread | @JetToast(Twitter) which can be seen here:

	"3:43 We go to Carrot Castle on a different and much faster path. Also adopted from Blackbread. The idea is to complete Castle, have wheel and reappear next to Rainbow Route's door to go to Mustard Mountain. I'm still conflicted if no-reset saves enough time or not (my testing was a bit faulty), to be honest, but it is very minimal.

	"19:50 At the time of production, I wasn't sure if to reset here but it turned out you can skip the Dark Metaknight cutscene by softresetting, saving about 16 seconds in total (but leaving you with no Throw ability). It is faster this way. I also use double stars for all the Dark Minds instead of throw. This is also faster because I get to keep Master which starts the subsequent fight faster (you don't have to grab the sword first).

	"21:52 I use a pal Kirby to use Hammer Up b's in the air to deal much damage. And somehow, if you manage to hit both mirrors at the same time you can deal damage on both mirrors. At the time of production , I didn't know this was possible (the old strategy involved hitting the eye and the mirror instead of both mirrors).

	"22:46 I don't have the exact frame numbers at hand, but 22:46 is the point where the last hit on Dark Mind 6 is dealt and so the TAS' length measured in RTA timing would be about 22:45. But I don't end timing here since Kirby & Amazing Mirror TASes have a tradition of completing the Staff roll minigame with a ridiculous hit number. 240 is possible with Kirby alone. It had been mentioned that you could use other Kirbys to kill Darkmind6 faster and get a higher number and I had said that you can't because of his invincibility spans. I think the truth is, you can't kill Darkmind6 faster because he does have invincibility spans. But you can get higher hit numbers because the game does keep track of each hit regardless of an invincibility span. But you can't really control the stupid AI and make it much more ridiculous so I only got 248 out of the game along with Green Kirby. In theory, multiplayer could get 960 (maximum the game allows is 999, then it loops to 0).
