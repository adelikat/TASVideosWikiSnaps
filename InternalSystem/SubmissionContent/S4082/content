	"After many years of watching and enjoying tool-assisted superplays, I decided last month to get busy and make one of my own.  Since I grew up during the 8-bit and 16-bit eras, I wanted my first run to be from one of these systems.  I'm also a fan of RPGs and strategy games; and after skimming through the list of current movies, I noticed that a particular favorite of mine was missing.

	"I remembered this one fondly growing up.  The catchy music, the cool attacks commanders used to decimate enemy units, the DIFFICULTY, and so forth.  After a brief test run, where I figured out basic timing and RNG formulas, I became driven to finally give this 'gem' a run (hopefully) worthy of tasvideos.  My goal, simply, was to COMPLETE EVERY STAGE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE, with a few speed/entertainment tradeoffs along the way (noted in the stage commentary, below).
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"For those unfamiliar, the Warsong/Langrisser franchise is a collection of traditional strategy role-playing games.  Warsong is the first game of the series, which places you in control of primary commander Garett, along with other subordinate commanders as they become available over the course of the story.  The game's intro stage places you in control of Garett during a siege attack on Baltia Castle by the evil Dalsis Empire.  Upon being overrun by enemy forces, Garett's father, King Alfador, urges him to flee and gather reinforcements.  With sword master Baldarov by his side, Garett embarks on a journey uncovering a plot of global implications for all mankind...

	"Being my first TAS, my initial challenges came from getting used to frame-by-frame input (frame advance), as well as discovering the earliest possible frame in which I could begin/confirm an action.  The game's RNG was also a headache to deal with, at times.  Specifically, the game's 'Player' and 'A.I./Enemy' phases operate on two different RNG cycles.  
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"'Player' phases deal with the battle outcomes of your own controllable troops--which, by far, is the easier of the two to manipulate.  Basically, after moving next to an enemy target and before confirming whether to attack it, each individual frame onward is capable of producing a different outcome, depending on when the 'C' button is pressed.  Here's brief example of how pressing 'C' on different frames can produce wildly different results:

	"Fairly simple.  On the other hand, manipulating outcomes during Ally/Enemy phases is an entirely different story.  I've yet to COMPLETELY figure out the formula, myself, as this would require better knowledge of understanding RAM addresses.  However, I have developed a method which has proved reliable for me throughout my run.  Due to length of explanation, you can simply head over to my 'Warsong' page in the 'Genesis' forum (page 1) to check it my findings.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Constructing individual stage strategies was also an important consideration, since heavy luck manipulation allowed for completion times far beyond the possibility of a real-time speedrun.  For example, every commander in the game is capable of hiring up to 8 mercenary units (soldiers, archers, etc.), whom are immediately destroyed upon that commander's death.  I exploit this to the FULLEST throughout my run, with the exception of cases where I needed to level grind my characters.  I tried to keep this to a minimum, although some stages went longer, by necessity, in order to have my characters strong enough to handle the challenges ahead.

Case in point, Tiberon's mermen had to perform in a specific fashion in order to both prevent the enemy from attacking Tiberon multiple times, and also to die in the earliest possible frame.  A clash between Sabra and Geryon's soldiers also had to end with them dying at the same time (which took quite a while for me to manipulate).

Due to this, I always either position my characters just outside of their spell range prior to attacking, or have another commander pose as a 'decoy' to drain their MP.  I applied the latter method with Baldarov throughout this stage to ensure that Garett could eventually move in at full power and go for the kill.

	"During the first turn I manipulated 7 of Thorne's soldiers to die off in order to save time on ally movements.  The reason I didn't kill off the 8th one was because, as long as an enemy commander has at least 1 remaining mercenary, they WON'T ATTACK YOU (that is, if you're not directly next to them).  Neither Thorne nor Baldarov could've reliably killed him off during the 'Enemy' phase, otherwise.  Afterwards, I positioned Baldarov to act in response to Thorne's A.I. behavior; another reason why I left his remaining soldier unit alive.  Thorne moving east allowed me to position Baldarov just outside of the Shaman's spell range in order to set up an attack during the next turn.

	"Either way I looked at it, this was going to be a long stage.  At this point in the game, slimes are way too powerful to take on (even with Baldarov) and staying in one spot while defending is just suicide.  Accordingly, I moved my commanders in an orderly cadence towards the southeast corner of the map, where a peculiarly placed corpse resided just over a small mountain (maybe put there as a hint?).  This also served to keep all of the slimes away from Mina's reinforcements as long as possible.  Despite attracting one of the smaller forces, she managed to kill its commander off with her guardsmen in 2 turns.

I make use of the game's 'Semi-Automatic' feature in cases where my commanders are too far apart from each other to justify moving the cursor back and forth.  Unfortunately, spell casting isn't an available option while using the feature (which is stupid..).  This is where I really begin to use heavy luck manipulation to kill off commanders with my under-leveled fighters.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"I also included a small speed/entertainment tradeoff here to showcase a slight bug.  After this stage's conclusion, Baldarov is scripted to die in the story due to taking an enemy arrow intended for Garett.  However, I'm guessing that the game designers forgot to take into account a situation where Baldarov is killed during the ACTUAL BATTLE.  As a result, Baldarov's post-stage dialogue carries out regardless of whether he lived or not.  I showcase this by having Baldarov killed during the final battle with Lance, as well as allowing the relevant dialogue screens to play out longer.

I think I easily spent 5-7 minutes per battle in rerecords.  Getting the optimum battle formation for this stage took some trial and error, also.  I did have some fun manipulating Thorne's Superman impression, though.

	"Admittedly, there's one glaring mistake in this stage that I was unable to correct, at the time, without losing frames.  It turns out that I actually didn't need Sabra to follow Garett into battle with the remaining Enemy Lord.  However, I was unable to duplicate a similar one-hit kill on either of the Royal Soldiers unit a second time when trying to correct this (go figure), which would have made me lose an entire round in the process.  Despite that, I was pleased with how the final fight played out.

Specifically, Bayard is trapped within a small fort halfway across the map with just 8 soldiers to fight against 2 aggressive enemy commanders (with 16 archers, total).  Normally, you're supposed to race to his location as fast as humanely possible before Bayard becomes overwhelmed and dies.  However, in this TAS lady fortune smiles upon Bayard as his forces manage to kill off EVERY attacking unit without Garett and Co's help.

I positioned Calais along the bank's right flank in order to draw away the Serpent Commander from Garett.  Meanwhile Tiberon crushed advancing enemy forces as Garett safely crossed.  On Calais's end, casting fireball was a major help towards killing off stubborn enemy units.  In this case, lizardmen are DECEPTIVELY TOUGH at full power and are very difficult to reliably consecutively manipulate one-hit kills.

The big obstacle in this stage was to eliminate the enemy Bishop within a single round; however, successfully killing off one of his archers proved to be much tougher than their stats indicated.  I improvised by having Sabra move in first, instead of Garett.  Bayard also managed to one-hit kill an advancing Serpent Commander with 7 HP (a very rare outcome).  However, I wasn't able to repeat that with the Serpent Commander along the left-hand side (go figure).

Bayard weakened the Grand Knight enough for Garett to finish off during the next combat round.  Meanwhile, Calais and Co. tightened up their initial formation and waited out a viscous enemy assault before responding in kind during the next turn.  Newcomer Duke Carleon's level 9 status was taken advantage of as I promoted him to 'Knight' in order to generate enough attack power to defeat Emperor Pythion.
