	"Due to a programming oversight with edges, it's possible to enter invisible walls and ledge corners via precise angles. This one oversight leads to a great deal of bugs, the most important of which is attaining a high degree of velocity due to the game attempting to eject Yerba and flipping out from the edge case. Near as I can tell, the game thinks Yerba is both in air and on the ground, which additionally means the dash is recharged for further exploits. Fun!

	"Beyond the dash, Yerba moves incredibly slow, so airtime is reduced as much as possible to take advantage of the dash's speed instead.
