	"I thougth this was a very good game to TAS. It kept me interested, since I am a big fan of the SNES Super Metroid game. They main part of the layouts stay true to the original, but with the Zero Mission style. Additionally, I'm glad to hear the original NES soundtrack with some updates. Additionally, I like how the game has some new editions to the existing Super Metroid layouts, where it was nice to see some hidden pathways as alternate ways to getting to some of the common areas.
