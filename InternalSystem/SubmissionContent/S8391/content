	"The SV-318 and SV-328 are home computers released by Spectravideo in 1983. The same year, the MSX standard for home computers was announced, which was based on the SV-328. As such, MSX and SV-3x8 are quite similar and openMSX supports both. Experimental support was added in

	"openMSX was an interesting experience. I like trying out other emulators in an era dominated by BizHawk. It records your inputs by default and has rewinding, which is cool. If you want to make your movie by other means though you may have difficulty. Savestates are awkward, and due to the movie format I didn't want to attempt modifying earlier inputs in a text editor (let alone in a TAStudio style). There seem to be a few issues for SV-3x8 as well. The input display doesn't map correctly, and I had an issue every time I saved that parsed the character references wrong and added garbage input near the start of the movie. This is

This design can variously be described as "unique and creative", or "unintuitive and stupid", depending on your mood. The menu has three difficulty options and increases the difficulty level after each loop; the manual claims you can start on difficulty 4 but I don't see how. I played through the game for

The octopodes (not "octopi", manual) spawn a lot faster in this difficulty. My execution likely isn't perfect but it's quite an awkward stage. I get a group of 3 lined up nicely at the end.

The speed at which you kill the monsters (the diamond shapes) doesn't seem to matter. The last Beatle of each pack should be killed as soon as possible to spawn the next monster phase. I tried to optimise for last input, which means shooting the very last Beatle from as far away as possible.
