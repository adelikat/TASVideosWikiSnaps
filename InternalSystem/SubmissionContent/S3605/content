	"Crash Bandicoot is a platform video game published by Sony Computer Entertainment, produced by Universal Interactive Studios (now the defunct Vivendi Games) and developed by Naughty Dog for the PlayStation. It was released in North America on August 31, 1996 and in Europe on November 1996. It was re-released for the Sony Greatest Hits line-up on September 15, 1997 and for the Platinum Range on March 1998. It has since been re-released as a downloadable game for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable via PlayStation Network in North America in 2006 and in the PAL regions in 2007. Crash Bandicoot is the first installment in the Crash Bandicoot series, chronicling the creation of the titular character at the hands of the series antagonist Doctor Neo Cortex and his henchman Doctor Nitrus Brio. The game's story follows Crash's effort to stop his creators' plans for world domination, clean up any pollution they have caused, and save his girlfriend Tawna, a female bandicoot also evolved by Doctor Cortex and Nitrus Brio.

	": Hello iiro2, and welcome to TASVideos. Unfortunately, it appears that your TAS is improvable in many areas, as shown by other TASers who are more familiar with the workings of the game. Because of this, as well as the fact that viewer response in general is quite poor, I'll have to reject this run.
