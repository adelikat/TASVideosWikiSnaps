	"The first few levels were made by 'playing normally' as far as TAS-making goes, then it became too tedious for me (with 2 characters to control) so I added auto-hold to FCEU and used that heavily (and mostly frame advance) for making the rest.

	"The biggest mistake I made in this run is missing a shortcut near the start of level 4 that would've saved 3 seconds (and thus 1 or 2 seconds over Hanzou's run). Normally I'd consider that unacceptable especially in such a short movie, but I didn't discover it until after the movie was finished, and it's a 2-character run with many hard-to-make optimizations, and most everything else is faster, much more than enough to make up for that time loss even without including things that are only made possible by having 2 players. Anyway, besides that, and the unavoidable delays caused by having an extra character that doesn't share powerups, and the extra lag caused by having a second character, most things are (as I said) noticeably faster than before, and I think having 2 players made it a lot more fun overall (because of better pacing of action and more stuff going on at once).
