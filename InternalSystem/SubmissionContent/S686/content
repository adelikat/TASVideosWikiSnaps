	$LF
	"I use most the best weapons for the Bosses. Sometimes an other weapon is maybe stronger, but Morning Star can attack 4 times with one hit.

My left hand hurts much now, because the keys on my keyboard for Frame Advance are in a stupid position (Strg & n). But for this game I have done it without watch out for my left hand. So I hope many like this run and see what is possible in this adventure game what you normaly play over more hours.
