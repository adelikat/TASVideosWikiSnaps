	": The way touch input is mashed during menus makes it evident that frame advance was not used, or at least was not used effectively. The way answers are drawn shows no amount of technical optimization is applied - lines are drawn reasonably fast but clearly not optimal, and are not straight, looking more like slightly sped up human drawing rather than anything actually resembling tool-assisted precision. The fact one answer started out drawn wrong and had to be quickly erased and re-input inside the run also shows that savestates are not used effectively.

	"The conclusion is that tools are not used effectively, which results in this movie being suboptimal and not representing itself well as a TAS. Rejecting.
