	">Nuts & Milk is a platform game deriving influences from a number of famous Nintendo games, including Mario Bros. (green and red fireballs), Donkey Kong Jr. (spring platforms, jumping from ladder to ladder and fruits) and Wrecking Crew (barrels). And as Kirby shows us, nothing can go wrong when you start with pink blobs.

	"Since submitted, this run has been improved for 120 more frames, by improving enemy manipulations on Stage 4, 7 and 16, fixing minor errors on Stage 31 and 45, and taking a new route on Stage 39.

	" Enemy-death animations
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The game waits for the evil blob(s) to drow before advancing to the next stage. Therefore minimizing their falling-into-water animations is favourable.

	" Zipping on ladders
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"It is possible to zip forward on leftmost and rightmost ladders, by pressing Up or Down at the right frames.

	" Wall-jump glitch
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"There is a glitch-wall-jump trick available.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"To perform this trick, one must position the controllable pink blob under the edge of a platform, jump against it from the ground below, and jump again on the wall.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"However, to jump through a gap between two platforms and land on one of them, blob's horizontal position value has to be adjusted to an odd number, which can be achieved by interupting a slow jump with a wall or ceiling at the correct frame.

[p 
	"I intentionally wasted 14 frames in this stage, in order to manipulate the evil blob to fall into the water. This saved 32 frames in the end.

	" Stage 24
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The two trampolines were too far away from the house. It would be slower to bounce from them with either one or two high-jumps, since the pink blob would be stunned when it landed in front of the house.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"It would be slower to zip on the leftmost ladder, as it would make the landing slower.

[p 
	"I intentionally wasted 10 frames in this stage, in order to manipulate the evil blob not to climb up. If I did't do this, I would lose 14 frames in the end.
