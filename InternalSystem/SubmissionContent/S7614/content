	"Mine Mayhem is a 2021 homebrew where a landslide has not only trapped a bunch of crystal miners but also unleashed dangerous monsters from the depths of the earth. The player's goal is to rescue the miners, all while keeping an eye on the oxygen meter and making sure they don't get killed by the monsters. This TAS isn't at all concerned about either as it effortlessly navigates the mines.

	"There really isn't much to this TAS that isn't shown on screen. It's worth noting that it's faster to bounce on the floor and then starting flying using the jetpack than starting to boost on the first frame possible before rescuing a miner. The oxygen meter depletes slowly during the level and is emptied at the end. Unfortunately, there is no way to empty it quickly while playing. There are bonus tanks in case your running low but there is thankfully only one place where this is unavoidable.

	": I'm disappointed with this one. Some very basic optimization was not done here, like figuring out the best frame to start holding A when landing and taking off quickly. You've put good effort into some of your movies lately, but this just feels like a step backwards. If you're not already, use TAStudio to easily edit inputs and use RAM watch to track your position and anything else useful - you might find some unexpected behavior and you'll have a better way to compare different strategies. I posted an example movie of some more optimized movement in level 2.
