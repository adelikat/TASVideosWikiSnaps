		"This game was reletively easy to manipulate. I heavily abused the warp glitch in the game and played just about the entire thing frame-by-frame. I wanted to redo this run because I noticed a few small errors that only frame-by-frame play could fix. I found a few shorter ways in my paths, saving me a second or two. During the boss battle I managed to get a few hits in sooner, and with frame-by-frame editing I was able to get the earlier possible frame for launching my  power-up sword attacks.  At the end of the battle, unlike the previous run, I was able to land the stairs the exact frame I was allowed to climb them.

		"I took damage during the axe knight part of the battle to save time. Getting hit by the axes pushed me forward just enough to allow me a good swing at him at the earliest possible frame. Having him move the other way would have wasted time because I would have continued to get hit by the axes.

		"All in all I saved 328 frames, or about 5.5 seconds. Not a vast improvement, but it certainly looks a lot more crisp to the eye then before.
