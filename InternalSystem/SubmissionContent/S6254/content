	"Live the Legend.
	$LF
	"Twin brothers Billy and Jimmy Lee learned to fight before they could walk. Martial arts and street smarts carved them into the baddest fighting machines in the big city.
	$LF
	"But now Billy is faced with his greatest challenge - to save his girlfriend Marian from the evil clutches of the mysterious Shadow Boss and the lethal gang of thugs known as the "Black Warriors."
	$LF
	"As a master Ninja you'll punch, head-butt, and high-kick gutter slime into submission.
	$LF
	"Knives, whips, baseball bats, rocks, oil drums and dynamite are your weapons.  Rat-infested slums, toxic factories and brutal back alleys are your combat zones.
	$LF
	"It's non-stop, high-voltage action culminating in an epic battle with the Shadow Boss - Billy's own twin brother Jimmy!

	$LF
	"That takes me forever to find this way, cause i was always searching for the quickest way.(to mention it is where i found the transition d. glitch cause i was searching a way to kill W. asap with the whip (free pick during W. spawn animation) that cause me restart the polish run lol then failed get the good set, then find bat opportunity, then cross my fingers transition glitch work with it.
