	"I always wondered why this site didn't have a Mega Man X 100% run.  Everyone who attempted it seemed to always give up on it after they started.  That kind of made me think that this game is too hard for me to do.  But after a while I decided to give this run a shot.  So here after 5 months of tedious work, I finally finished.

	"This was the first stage where I encountered a lot of lag.  Some was avoidable, some was not.  You'll notice that I shot for no apparent reason a couple of times.  That was to reduce lag.  The boss battle went pretty well.  It was 6 frames longer than the battle in the any% run, but I was still pretty green when it came to boss battles so I was happy with that and kept it.

	"More lag.  There's not really anyway to avoid it.  The only thing I didn't do optimally from what I can see is the part right after I got the helmet.  I wall jumped to the left side losing 9 frames.  I should have wall jumped from the right.  This was before I learned that wall jumping from the opposite direction of where you will end up is always faster.  FractalFusion came to my rescue again and redid the Storm Eagle battle, this time saving almost 100 frames.  He demonstrated that it's possible to jump over Storm Eagle while he's flapping his wings and go straight to doing the wall trick.  He also demonstrated that having the boss explosion out of view get's rid of the lag.

	"By far the most aggravating level of the game.  Not only is there lag after lag after lag, but I played through the last part of the level 3 times (required for hadoken weapon), and there's still 2 to come.  I had to move around on the cart like an idiot in order to avoid the lag.  It wasn't for entertainment.  There is something I spotted in the any% run that I didn't do in the stage this time around.  That is dash jumping off the cart as early as possible.  I estimate around 15 frames can be saved by doing that in case anyone wants to improve this run.  The Armored Armadillo fight was so hard to manipulate because he just wouldn't go out of the ball form right away like I saw done in the any% run.  But after hours of hex editing and wall slide testing I finally got him to do it.
