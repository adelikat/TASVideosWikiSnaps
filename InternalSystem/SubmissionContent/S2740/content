	"Digger - The Legend of the Lost City is a game where you star as Digger T. Rock, who must dig his way through 8 caverns to find the lost city, which if you look in the credits, still has a running water fountain! This game is fairly hard in real-time but with tools it becomes quite fun.

	"We started this run when SilentSlayers looked at my submission. He ended up saving a few frames, and when he found the new way to do the shortcut on Cavern 3, I canceled my run and we decided to improve it. We also found a tons of new routes everywhere that save a lot of time. We also optimized a lot of movement and saved a lot frames on every level.
