		"Bari

	", with it refusing to move to the right earlier. I killed the boss with nothing but a poisonous boomerang. For the last Link, it was quite difficult. I had to be at cordinates (4479,5489) to activate the credits. I also had to kill Link without dying or with any input. I positioned myself so that when Link slashes the boomerang, it would push me to the right spot without him using his jump-stab attack.

At the moment, the game can be completed faster with input appended to the end of the movie file, which would suggest that the objective is not achieved.
