Although it is a hack, it has a very high IGN review score and is in fact a lot more fun than the original NSMBW. The levels are carefully designed, the artwork is beautiful and new sprites are added. This run is meant to beat the game as fast as possible, which has never been done with TAS before.

	"This run is meant to beat the game as fast as possible, which has never been done with TAS before. In NrSMBW, there are eight regular worlds and five hidden worlds, and by completing World C, Sky City, skips Worlds 5 and 6, which are the most time-consuminng worlds. The run also skips as many auto-scroll levels as possible, although some cannot be avoided. In this new version of the run, glitches are used to progress faster.

	"A glitch used in Worlds 2 and 3: Theoretical Time vs. Actual Time (Loading Screen Glitch). In two levels of Worlds 2 and 3, if the level is finished within a certain frames range, the delay before the Map Screen loads varies. I don't know why this happens, but I attemped to time the level end accurate enough to save time on the delay screen. This might involve slowing down intensionally in front of the flagpole or before the Boss door or in the level, or completing the level without slowing down a single frame to time the glitch.

	"1-Tower (new glitch discovered! for entertainment elements only)
	$LF
	"Skips 1-4. In this level, nets are replaced by honey hives. This is a vertical level, and the goal is to go up as fast as possible. During the Boss fight, Big Fuzzy is invincible while he rolls on the ground, and the fastest way to finish the fight is to hit him as soon as his rolling state is over. The collision detection for Fuzzy is a little glitchy. If you ground pound him on the right spot, you will not get hit but bounce off of him. This does not help to save time, but is definitely fun to watch.

The trick is jumping on the exact frame Mario lands during the slide, and Mario will maintain his momentum for a long time. But sliding restrics Mario's jumping height, so pressing up while jumping ends the sliding and allows Mario to do a regular jump.

	"To get to the Bowser fight, you have to hit three switches in three diferrent areas. During the first phase of the fight, I used the propellar suit that I got way back in 2-Tower to fly over Bowser and hit the switch. Unlike the original NSMBW, you have to hit four switches instead of one to finish the first phase of the fight. In the second phase, you're given a clown car with a cannon, and the fight is finished after you hit Bowser 25 times. I saved three million tons of time using a different strategy in the fight. Instead of hitting Bowser from the front, I started with hitting him on the back, and I was able to make shots quickly. There is a delay before Mario can shoot again after a shot, and this time is used to position Mario for the next shot. In the last part of the fight, obstacles can block the cannon, and I had to wait until Bowser had himself exposed, but this can't be avoided anyway.
