	$LF
	"After 4 years and 4 months, I come back with another TAS of Goonies 2, which is one of my favourite games. This time, the game will be totally glitched and broken, as there are several new glitches found in the past years starting from my run.

	"When you stands on an horizontal moving platform, and then you move on the same direction of the platform, you can instantly increase the speed by moving forward then at a certain optional frame, release everything but the A button to jump. That will give you a super speed while jumping only, as if you land the speed automaticaly returns to normal.

	"Firstly, I found that glitch and I used it in my current run, also I found what is called damage boost (same as Adventure Island 4) that gives a great speed while jumping only, the setup is similar to speed boost but the frame is precise and stored in one frame only after taking the damage. Thanks to sooi, a Japanese player who combined these two tricks and added to them the use of the bomb to produce an insane speed that can gives the ability to wrong warp to other places and make a new route that saves huge time (something reminds me of super sliding on OoT and MM). Sliding after taking damage on a horizontal moving platform is much faster than on ground and jumping with that speed can breaks the game sprites and gives new ones that still usable in the area where the glitch happened, going to another place fixes every thing, however that break is very useful since it creates ladders to go up or down. Going down is better and easier than going up since sometimes, a ladder can be cut in middle but if it is near to the ground, you climb on it like if it exist. Those ladders are the most useful in this run.

	"The glasses can be used even if they are not present in the tools menu, by replacing them with the transceiver. You can make the game think that the transceiver is the glasses by pressing B in one frame then after one another, press A to execute the, again this is a precise trick since it has only on frame to perform. This glitch skips the visit fir glasses as well as skipping the boomerang and so, getting the key holders from enemies waste a lot of time, and the better option rest is entering the door containing the keys in green cave and take them, however, as soon as I go to the water, I get that boomerang because I need it later for getting keys from enemies. This saves around 42sec.

	$LF

[p 
	"Regarding branching, the speed boost that allows new shortcuts and the out-of-bounds techniques presented here don't look like one would be able to get a run that avoids them to Moons, because the current any% branch that doesn't have them is in Vault. So on one hand, we can reasonably predict that the "no OOB" branch will be poorly received, and even if its feedback is decent, the difference is still not that dramatic to go the 
	[em 
		""X glitch" VS "no X glitch"
	]em
	" path here, because of the reasons explained in 
	[a class=intlink href=/5280S 
		"this judgment note
	]a
	". So this run is not just a speed improvement over the current one, but an entertainment and content quality improvement too, the old strats are now completely obsolete.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The same likely goes to the 100% category: its current publication doesn't have too good rating and submission feedback regarding entertainment, so the chance for a "no OOB 100%" run to be acceptable is also very low.
