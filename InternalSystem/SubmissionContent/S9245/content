	"Chuckie Egg is a platform game from 1983, which describes itself as a "Game of Skill", the premise is straightforward - each of the 8 level layouts contain a dozen eggs, which you need to collect all 12 to advance, each loop increases* the difficulty,

	"Chuckie Egg was released on many platforms at the time, my dad had a ZX Spectrum at the time and I probably spent countless hours of my childhood on this game.  TinyTim also ran it recently at the BSG Marathon.   C64 was a consideration, but I found the audio worse,

	"Level 41 onwards repeat level 33-40 but decrease the time limit per stage, this bottoms out at level 80 at 400s per stage.  This would mean the TAS would just be repeating almost the same inputs (varying for lag etc) for any remaining levels.  The game only shows 2 digits for the levels so e.g. level 100 will show as level 00, 101 as 01.  After level 256, the game will complete reset back to level 1 (byte overflow).

[div class=p 
	"So completing level 40 seems the most logical place to stop, as there is nothing else to see from that point on.  Also, we have 63 lives at the end of the movie (despite only 6 hats showing), so losing them to get on the high score table would take quite some time.
