		"Distant Homing Attacks: If you gain a lot of speed without touching the ground near an enemy, you can keep locked on to them while being feet away. This bugs Sonic because you'd be more closer to the enemy to homing attack them. This only happens in Hazy Maze Cave because of it being crowded and needed to clip.
