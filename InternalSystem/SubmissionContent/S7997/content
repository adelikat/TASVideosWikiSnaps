	"After trying to TAS a "Floor is Lava" run, I was surprised to find that my first draft, an unoptimised basic outline of the route was only 4 seconds off the any% TAS. It used a different route that avoided the ceiling clip after pin jumping out of the hole the house is in because jumping inside a wall counts as touching the floor. It turns out this is faster in any% too because it skips a locked gate.

	"There's also a glitch I exploit a couple of times in the run for entertainment purposes and it doesn't slow the run down at all. Getting just the head of the pin to show after shooting it (which can be seen at the start of the run) is done by holding up and down while shooting. The effects of this glitch can be enhanced by holding all four directions. There were a couple of points where I could have done this without Nalle deciding to walk left but the more extreme effects make the game seriously lag so even though it'd be entertaining and fun to watch, it is avoided to get the best time possible.
