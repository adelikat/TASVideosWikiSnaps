[div class=p 
	"Same mode as 
	(__wikiLink|href=/4652M|implicitdisplaytext=4652M)
	", but with a different map! This time I used the camera controls to show what the police cars are doing in the most important moments. Still, this turned out much shorter than the other movie, because there are these huge no-spawn zones not too far from the starting point... Well, what else can I say? Enjoy the much more accurate cyclecount of Nymashock ;)
