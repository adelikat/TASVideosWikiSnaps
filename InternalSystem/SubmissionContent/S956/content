		"Final Fantasy - Mystic Quest is one of the first RPG's to ever come out. A lot of people say that this game was made poorly. It was released in the US in 1992, and as a pioneer to RPG gaming it was designed to warm people to the idea of an RPG. The game is reletively simple and user friendly. Armor and weapons automatically equip and the second player can even be set to attack automatically. The music in my opinion is quite good and it's been one of my favorites since I beat it a long time ago...The goal in this game is to acquire the four elemental stones from bosses who have stolen them. This will lead to the Dark King who has caused the whole mess.

		"I watched Hero's movie. I noticed that a lot of the paths he chose were very good, but I also noticed that some of the luck manipulation could be improved. I set out to do this. This movie was very time consuming to make, though the difficulty wasn't too much. I discovered new ways of manipulating luck that I didn't see in Hero's run of this game. Things like what monsters the next battle will have are decided as far back as your last move in the current battle. I abused that A LOT. Most of my time was saved in battle times. First strikes, critical hits and even the attacks my enemies used were manipulated heavily. Not only for damage taken, but for speed as well. I saved a lot of time in boss battles, though they also took the longest to manipulate. There are a few places where it looks as though I could have optimized more. Those could have been done, but at the cost of time I didn't need to use to do it.

I hadn't known that where he appeared was a random thing. I had always assumed that you HAD to get all three switches. Thanks Hero!!
