	"This game was released on the NES by Rare Inc. in 1991 and is based on a real pinball machine released by Williams pinball in 1985.  I had always enjoyed pinball as a kid but this game pushed me over the edge in that I eventually purchased several pinball machines, High Speed included.  I can authoritatively say that the core rules of High Speed were ported over fairly faithfully although Rare decided to add in two different minigames and a "wizard mode" goal.  Rare had previously ported Pinbot to the NES and in which they opted to do unusual things like changing the ball into a triangle.  Between the two games I feel High Speed offers more depth and a lot more defined goal, so I decided to do a TAS on it as my first project.  This is my first submission, so please have grace with me if I've  missed something.

	"The game places tokens at random on the playfield which can be collected by shooting the ball past them.  Collecting three helicopter tokens causes a racing minigame to start and collecting three safe icons causes a "Pachinko" cannon shooter minigame to start.  Entering the minigames with more than one ball allows for more balls in the race minigagme and a faster shooting rate in the pachinko minigame.  Completing all three races and all four pachinko minigames causes a spaceship to appear which displays a message that states "you have beaten the system".  Reaching this screen is the primary goal of this run.

I play around with some input animations throughout to pass the time and advance as quickly as it is possible to do so but I'd recommend speeding past them.

	"There are three banks of three stoplights and each light has to be hit once to advance.  You can also spot stoplights by using the ramp but this takes valuable time so I opt to nudge the table around a fair amount to try to hit the lights as quickly as possible.  Once the light is red I run the red light (which is much more interesting on the physical pinball machine because it turns on a siren and a beacon light on top of the game, but I digress).  After launching and locking two more balls I take advantage of the extra balls in play to quickly snag the last safe token to start the pachinko  minigame.

	"I initially took the approach of  carefully aiming the cannon and firing an exact shot into one cup at a time but there is absolutely no speed benefit to holding back on the number of balls fired.  So, after landing the first two cups I go postal on the remaining two.  It's more entertaining that way.

	"While starting the second minigame I get a multiball jackpot (which spots a minigame token) as well as an extra ball which gives me no benefit at all but has to be collected sooner or later to advance to the spaceship.  I let a ball go behind  / under the right flipper for a split second before returning it to play.  Unfortunately, the jackpot shot left a ball in the right lock hole which I have to wait on; I avoid this in future iterations.

	"This is the easiest race - I catch all three balls on the right flipper and release the flipper  for a single frame which causes them to go straight up but never displays any flipper animation.  This makes for an interesting effect.  Hitting your car makes it go faster while hitting enemies fouls them up, although the speedup effect is not consistent (this can be seen in the second-to-last lap where a solid shot gives very little boost).  I play around with some input animation after taking 1st.

	"Luck manipulation improvements.  I can't say this enough.  The pachinko minigames nearly killed me as they are a lot tougher than they look.  It turns out that every frame the fire button is held after a ball is released from the cannon significantly impacts the speed at which it travels and subsequently changes its bounce pattern (which means balls you have already fired are impacted by future ball releases).  I didn't fully understand this mechanism until after the third cannon minigame.  The main table and the race minigame could also be improved significantly by finding out more about the memory addresses that trigger the minigame tokens and the nitro boosters.

[p 
	"I opted to get multiball as quickly as possible to eliminate all enemies on the main table and give me more "ammo" in the miniames, but this also meant I had to load three balls for every minigame and it also increased the forced bonus animations.  It's possible a one-ball run may be faster, but that would eliminate the possibility of collecting the "hideout escape" bonus which scores several minigame tokens at once and would introduce enemies into the main table.
