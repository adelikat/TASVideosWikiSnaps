	"Hong Kong 97 is an unpublished video game made for the Super Famicom, developed by HappySoft in 1995. In Japan and Taiwan, this game has gained cult status and been labelled as a kuso-ge (which in the literal sense, means "shitty game" in Japanese), and some have labelled it as one of the worst games ever made.
