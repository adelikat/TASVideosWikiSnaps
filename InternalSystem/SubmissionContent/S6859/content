	": Hello, ItsPietroFelix, and welcome to TASVideos! As been stated in the thread, this submission breaks the rules that we have here on our site. We do not allow the usage of cheat codes or external tools that alter the gameplay, such as Game Genie and Cheat Engine. The other thing is that although Super Mario Bros. is a very popular game, it is not recommended for newcomers to submit for this game unless there's something groundbreaking or very exceptional in entertainment due to the massive amount of optimization that has went into the game over the years.
