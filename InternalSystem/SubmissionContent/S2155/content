	"'s Rocman X (Thunder Blaster Man) in 13:24. An infamous unlicensed game with pirated box and title screen. Other than that, the "Ready!" shoutout, and a few small references to Mega Man game mechanics, this game has nothing to do with Mega Man.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Unlike what the box and title want to indicate to you, this game is an original creation. It has a story too. The main character, Thunder Blast Man (not "Thunder Blaster Man", not "Rocman X") must save the city from an evil crime syndicate (heard that before?) who has kidnapped Miss Lucy and overrun the city with its many robotic enemies.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The graphics are surprisingly decent for an unlicensed game, although there are some obvious graphical glitches. The music ranges from decent to Mega Man II (GB) bad. It is, however, the gameplay design that is utterly atrocious, and what the game is known for. It is explained in the next few paragraphs.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Thunder Blast Man starts with a super-weak boomerang. It can only shoot one at a time, in any of four cardinal directions, and cannot pass through walls. Only the weakest of enemies die in one hit. Most standard baddies take three or more hits to kill. Some take a lot more, even as many as 20 hits. I haven't even talked about the bosses yet.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"During the game (before a boss fight), it is possible to upgrade to a triple shot of super-weak boomerangs, or even the batarangs. The batarangs are the most useful, since they are three times stronger than a normal boomerang and can travel through walls. In fact, this run goes out of the way just to buy one ASAP.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"To buy upgrades, however, you need money. As one will eventually figure out, the city level is entirely devoid of coins (except from enemies), and the sky level has very few. This leaves only the ocean level, which is a good starting spot as it has many coins. Fortunately, there is a continue/game over glitch to respawn coins.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There are two types of continues in this game, literal continues (you start off in the same spot you died or float out of a pit), and game over continues. You can only possess at most one literal continue, and can choose whether to use it or take a game over continue. Did you know that if you die without a literal continue, you lose all your upgrades, but you don't if you select "No" when prompted to use a literal continue? As if it wasn't weird enough.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Thunder Blast Man has 16 health. That sounds all right at first (even Mega Man X starts with 16 health), but the problem is that most enemies in the game do 4 damage. Yes, any contact with an enemy is an automatic 4 damage. This includes spikes (thankfully they don't automatically kill in this game). The enemies are very hard to take down (with the starting boomerang) and very hard to avoid, especially the bird robots. The gunner enemies are cheap and cannot be killed unless you get behind them.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Physics does not favor you. TBM has quite a short-distance jump and cannot cross pits if it weren't for a very useful feature: the air-dash. When charged up, TBM can perform a horizontal air-dash or even air-dash upwards. However, you lose the charge if you are hit. Problem is that much of the game was designed around this air-dash. If you fall in a spike pit, good luck getting out. You cannot stop an air-dash in the middle, nor are you invincible when doing the air-dash. As a result, some parts of the game practically require an air-dash of faith. Hello, sky level.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Normal boss fights take a very long time. Even with the batarang, bosses have long recoveries and many invincible actions. The actions are set and cannot be luck-manipulated. Normal bosses have 26 HP. They take 9 hits with the batarang (ranging from 45s to 75s) to 26 hits with the normal boomerang (about 3 times as long). Oh, and yes, the sky miniboss. Hopefully, you didn't spend 15 minutes there just to die. I didn't, but I can envision someone who did. In contrast, this run takes 10 seconds.
	$LF

[p 
	"There are some nicely done parts like the highway stage and boss (TBM's motorbike acts just like Mega Man here), and the minecart ride (though there's some cheapness involved), but this game is generally a

	"At the beginning, health is restored. This stage is an autoscroller. The boss is the pod thing that has spikes surrounding it. It has 101 HP. A normal shot does 1, and a charged shot does 10. However, the normal shot can be autofired here, so I can do 17 damage per jump. With timed pausing (5 frames B _ BS _ S looped), it is possible to do 24 damage per jump; however, there is a frame rule so pausing only increases the time. I carefully arrange it so as to minimize damage taken to 12. The following bonus run allows me to recover most of the health, and then TBM inexplicably gains two more afterward.
