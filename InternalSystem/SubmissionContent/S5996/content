	"The Magic of Scheherazade is a hidden gem for the NES that contains a mixture of adventure and RPG elements.  I had done numerous speedruns of the game normally before ever considering making a TAS of it.  One day, I started messing around with the TAS editor feature of FCEUX 2.2.2, and it ultimately led to making this run over the next few months, in addition to improving the route I use in normal speedruns. Though the TAS was made entirely using FCEUX 2.2.2, it also runs properly in FCEUX 2.2.3 (and the compact save file was made in 2.2.3).
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The goal of this TAS was to beat The Magic of Scheherazade from start to finish as quickly as possible, making substantial use of both luck manipulation and snapping mechanics to finish with a time far lower than any human playing could reasonably do.  I made virtually no effort to find credit warps or other game-breaking glitches.  Rather, the purpose was to make a near-optimal speedrun using the game’s normal mechanics (and a few minor glitches, mentioned later).

	"When making this TAS, I did not look directly at the game’s code, but I used RAM watch in some demon fights to keep track of enemy HP.  Special thanks to ct187 and synthpopisback for help with FCEUX (including memory locations for RAM watch) as well as some route suggestions.

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"In general, I sought to optimize snaps completely (at least to the point of getting optimal framerules – see below).  This included making sure all individual snaps were properly placed as well as planning out the snaps that would be used on each screen.  When there were multiple reasonable ways of handling a screen, I often charted the screen each way and chose the method that used the fewest frames.

[div class=p 
	"After any transition where the screen gradually darkens (entering or leaving a town or palace, entering a shop/mosque/staircase/demon's room, emerging from a carpet ride/time door, etc.), the screen reappears according to a 16-frame framerule.  Entering one of these transitions on a slightly different frame has no effect on when the screen reappears unless the change is enough to move the transition to the previous or next framerule, in which case the screen will reappear exactly 16 frames earlier or later.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The existence of these framerules played a significant part in the making of this TAS.  For one thing, it meant that a missed snap or an otherwise slightly suboptimal walk might not make the run take any extra frames overall.  In some cases, this let me use extra frames to avoid taking damage or kill a few more enemies without penalty.  In many cases, I found a way to cut out a framerule and ultimately save 16 frames by finding a slight improvement or killing fewer enemies/taking more damage.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"At each framerule transition, I checked how many frames there were to spare before being pushed back to the next framerule, and if I saw I was in a situation where I only needed to save a few frames in order to make the next screen appear 16 frames earlier, I looked for ways to save those frames.  These “framerule battles” occasionally led to discovering or figuring out mechanics, such as the shimmy into the staircase first used in Ch. 3.

	"In addition to the usual overworld enemies, this game contains turn-based encounters (similar to Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy) which occur at screen transitions.  More specifically, some screens are flagged as encounter screens, and walking off one of these screens has a chance to spawn a turn-based battle before entering the next screen.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"When an encounter appeared, it typically could not be avoided trivially by leaving the screen at a different frame or pixel, though the exact frame affected which enemy formation showed up.  Escaping from the battle on the first try was trivial (just needed to select “Escape” on a frame that works), but it still cost about 4 seconds to have a fight appear and immediately escape from it.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Encounters appearing typically led to long sessions of trying to manipulate them away, sometimes successfully.  Usually when I was able to avoid an encounter I initially got, it was by taking damage on an earlier screen, possibly to a specific enemy.  Making changes to other stats such as MP or coins did not seem to have any effect.  Also, before getting Ramipas (a spell which temporarily reduces the rate of both overworld enemies and turn-based encounters), every fourth encounter seemed particularly difficult to avoid.  In the first 3 chapters, I ended up taking the encounters from precisely the 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 20th, and 24th encounter screens, each time manipulating it to be the enemy formation which used the fewest frames.  (I actually found a way out of the 24th one but then got both the 25th and 26th possible encounters, so I ended up putting myself back in the 24th encounter to avoid the next two.)  In the last two chapters, with access to Ramipas, there was only one encounter I could not successfully avoid.

This cuts out the need for three rod shots to change the star’s color one by one.
