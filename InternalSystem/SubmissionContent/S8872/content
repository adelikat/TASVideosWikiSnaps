	"Action 52 is an unlicensed game made for the NES and Sega Genesis, featuring - you guessed it - 52 different video games. The NES version was published in 1991, whereas the Genesis version was published in 1993. Both versions were published by Active Enterprises.

	"Given that this is essentially an auto-scroller, optimisation is very trivial for the first 3 levels. All we have to do is survive by moving L/R to avoid the meteors and shooting when necessary to take down enemy ships, as well as pressing start on the earliest frame possible to start the levels quicker.

	"On Level 4, there's a certain X position in the level where the stars align (haha get it?) and we can avoid both all the meteors and all the spacecrafts. When the level starts, we hold D+R for 13 non-lag frames. Then we let go of R and hold D on its own for 11 frames. This way, everything is avoided and input ends about 50 seconds earlier than the actual level does, on frame 10440.

	": I thought I would go ahead and knock this one out, since I have judged more of these than other members. It follows the same pattern as many of the other Action 52 auto-scrollers. One thing that I want to re-iterate, is the fact that each level is on a timer, so it doesn't matter if you move to the top...it won't make a difference. But the best feature of this TAS is the early input ending at the beginning of the last level. This was HUGE! Great job.
