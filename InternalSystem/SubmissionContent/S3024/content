	"Theres vaste improvements in the inverted castle over published movies, the big skull in inverted castle, faster manipulate black panther, drop king stone from imp (allow single cast of medusa on dracula along with better stats), faster manipulate on spectral sword, also its faster to use masamune on shaft.

	": There was one major trade-off in this movie: to skip the two long sequences wolf-morph-elevation glitch with an alternative glitch that was slower in the end, which would have been even slower if the movie had not started from a predefined save (which rendered this movie impure). Entertainment value is subjective - and in some extense, so is the value of movie purity - but the audience buy that and this movie. Although there were some "known improvements", we have been living with them all along. Accepted as an improvement to the published "any%" movie while obsoleting it.
