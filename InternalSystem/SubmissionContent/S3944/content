The ultimate goal of the game is to acquire a treasure by traversing a group of unorthodox levels and gameplay styles until your goal is accomplished. This is an alternative goal to the already quite uncovential glitched run

	"On my rejected warped run someone requested a traditional playthrough of the game and since I had just spent time learning the mechanics I figured why not. As it turns out a traditional any% TAS of this game is not the most entertaining thing on earth because when played at super-human speed and in a different language you do not pick up on the outrageous story-line or what some of the text displays. Regardless I persevered and this is the result.

	"The majority of the run is just moving from location to location learning skills, acquiring money, and speaking to people. This could take up a lot of room in the submission text so I will leave those features at that.  Some interesting aspects to the story that I won’t go into detail on is that you quit your job, get divorced, get into multiple brawls,  and get black out drunk.

	"A different aspect of gameplay is the Pachinko machine in a chance to win the guitar that we just learned to play. Playing the game without prior knowledge would lead you to believe that you are supposed to win the game over and over until you have enough tokens which would take a long time, but in this run we use the Famicom Microphone add-on for the first time by screaming while playing the game angering a group of thugs who try to attack us. We easily defeat them and use the 5,000 tokens they already had to win purchase our guitar. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"We again use the Microphone to play a few rounds of karaoke.  As the microphone is not actually emulated you can get the same affect by hitting “A” on the second controller technically making this a 2-Player run but not really. You are supposed to sing along with the tune of the song but if you simply alternate every frame you will be considered good enough each round. I specifically choose the song as it is the shortest possible in the game. After singing 3 times a separate group of thugs gets angry that they want their own turn and try to attack the player. You must defeat them and then an old man will appear with a map that will lead you to buried treasure.

	"This is where the most exciting segment ever featured in a TAS comes into play where you stare at a blue screen without hitting any buttons for 5 minutes which is just enough time to finally reveal the map. You must then kill the old man and move on to Africa.

	"Additionally you must handglide which in realtime would be one of the harder parts of the game. You can fly left right or down but you can only move up if you fly through a gust. In addition you have to avoid ducks and flying saucers which would be quite complex as your movement is not quick and your weapon can only fire straight forward with one bullet on screen at a time.

	"There are a lot of aspects of the game that are simply unfair and thus have helped it acquire its cult status. First every time you learn a skill or make a purchase there are normally between 3 and 5 options. You do not know which items are important so if you pick the wrong items you will then die without warning at some later point in the game.

	"Finally there are specific ways you must interact with people or else you will lose the game at a point in the future without explanation. A perfect example of this is the fight with the old man. You would assume since he gave you a map and isn’t immediately attacking you that you should probably leave him alone and go on your way. But as it turns out, if you leave him alone you will be able to continue the remainder of the game, a solid amount of time, and then at the very last second as you pick up the treasure he will appear and give you a game over.
