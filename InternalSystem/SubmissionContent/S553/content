	"My goal in this time attack was to complete the game quickly, with a maximum score and without taking a single hit.  The latter was the more difficult to perform, most notably in the spaceship stage, where there can be so many shots on screen that they start to overlap one another and you cannot tell where the enemy's shots are.

	"Another tough aspect was fighting the bosses without being hit, since your 'toad tends to use the slow boot attack when the enemy's stunned. But by manipulating luck, I was able to maneuver the boss into using a slow move of their own, giving me enough time to get an attack in.

	"One last note: I deliberately miss one mine in the spaceship stage.  This is due to the fact that the small, round mines stop giving points after you destroy a certain number of them.
