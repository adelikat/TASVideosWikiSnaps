	"Most of the improvements come from better optimization. I also found that pressing left+right on ladders gives a great speed to the left and you are at max speed directly after letting go of the ladder.

	"I used a different strat to do the ladder glitch at the beggining of the level saving 41 frames. It is possible to clip in the ground with the help of a veggie. I lost back that time to the Birdo frame rule, but I saved 1 frame at the Birdo fight.

	"After reviewing the NES and GBA runs, I've determined that this is sufficiently different to stand on its own as another separate publication, so with the much heavier amount of optimization this time around I'm accepting it to Moons.
