	"Hi. This is a new run of Windows Spyman that, requested by 
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/turska 
		"turska

	", completes the game using the correct 50 fps setting. There is also an improvement of 988 frames which is a lot more then I expected. It looks like only 2 seconds because the game is now running at 50 fps.
