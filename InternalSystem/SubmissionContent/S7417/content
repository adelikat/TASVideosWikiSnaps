	"Punch-Out!! No TKO is a hack of Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! It has the same opponents, same patterns, very different strategies, since you can't TKO your opponents. However, you have infinite star punches, allowing for ultra-fast knockdowns. This submission improves on my previous submission by 23 seconds real time and 32 seconds or so in game. I decided to submit this only because it's a big improvement to my older TAS. The new times are as follows:

	"It's faster (in-game time) to knock him down several times, rather than knocking him out at 42.00, as shown here. Also, in phase 1, holding up while each star punch lands (and delaying some) will deal more damage, saving a star punch (and a delay later on.)

I throw 1 more star punch, which he takes, but then he'd start dodging my star punches if I didn't jab, block or dodge, jab (if blocked) and star (either way.) For the next phase, punch, dodge, star, repeat, jab, block, jab, star for the knockdown. When he gets up, punch, dodge, star. Now he goes into punches on his own, a lot faster. Duck his punch, jab, star for the knockdown. Duck, star for KO.

	"The old strategy I used had the 52.82 strat for phases 1, 2 and 3. However, I found a 3 second improvement to those phases, even though it's eaten back up later on. For phases 4 and 5, I do 55.25 strat, since I don't have 3 stars anymore. For phase 6, throw 3 stars to counter all three of his hooks, dodge his uppercut and throw a star punch. He will get up on the count of 1, so counter his punch with a star punch to send him down again. Here's where he gets up on the count of 9, like Bald Bull 2. Duck his first three punches, following up with a star punch after each one. Dodge his uppercut, and press Start, which will send him down to the mat again. Now, the Bull Charge will happen, since the clock is at the right time to do so. Hit him in the gut at the right time, and send him down in one hit. When he gets up, counter two hooks with two star punches, wait for the rolling jabs, and star him for the knockdown. Star him twice more for the KO!

	(__wikiLink|displaytext=in last year's submission|href=/7066S)
	", namely that the purpose of the no TKO challenge is kinda defeated by the addition of infinite star punches, but the addition of infinite star punches does actually set this hack apart from what a normal no TKO run would look like on the original game. It's an interesting enough tweak and this is a solid enough run that I think we can Playground this.
