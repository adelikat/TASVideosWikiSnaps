	"This is a very relaxing game to spend an entire afternoon playing. You are an old-timer looking to make a fortune mining gold during the Gold Rush years.

	"It is one of the first real-life management games a la SIMS I've ever played. You've got to control hunger, thirst and health while exploring each of the hundred+ caves in search for gold. If you're lucky, you might find the legendary Lost Dutchman Mine (LDM) that contains riches beyond imagination.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Making this TAS took playing the game the right way first to find exactly where the LDM was located. To do this I had to defeat the gambler at poker to get the first piece of the map, then visit dozens of other caves to get the other pieces. After finding LDM, I then replayed the game to go straight to it. The only items you need is a rope (to descend -- and without gloves for extra fun), a lantern, and some matches :P

If you climb up after discovering the lower part of the mine, you find the entrance has been sealed by failling debris. So the only way to exit (and win the game) is to climb the spider ropes.
