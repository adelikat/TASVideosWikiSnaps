	"Obviously you see me collecting boots. These boots make our hero very fast. However, we can't give all the boots to 1p in the multiplayer, because that would make the screen NEVER scroll because 2 player would always have to catch up. The only time 2 player may save time is in the boss fights near the end, where speed isn't nessescary, but I figured it wouldn't make a true 1 player run. If people are against this, I can redo the end of the movie.
