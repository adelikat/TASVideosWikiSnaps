Features an isometric view, worthless combat, and hamburgers. The goal is to reach the end of stage 6, where the evil ninja Kunitoki needs to be defeated.

	"The game boils down to taking perfect lines to get the necessary items and move from screen to screen. Some screens have an enemy. These suck. Luckily there is never more than one at the same time, likely because the NES would explode. The enemies are extremely aggressive, and just from a glance at any screen with one, you can see their movements are erratic. When an enemy attacks you, Ninja gets frozen in place and bonked in the head. There is a huge frame window to avoid damage every time by kicking or swinging your weapon in sync with the enemies attack, this results in no damage for either. However it takes 32 frames to attack, so it was almost always better to avoid this.

	"Only two enemies get attacks off. At the very beginning of stage 4, the guy is on top of you, so it was best to sync-kick with him. The final boss does a completely unavoidable hit as soon as you spawn him, as far as I can tell. (And it does just under 50% of your life!) Some enemies throw ninja stars when you get far away, this is preferable to having them close enough to attack. Though this always causes a lag frame or two.

	"Jumping into screen transitions sometimes saves an extra frame. Sometimes it doesn't. I don't know. In theory it's because you move marginally faster in the air. However, during normal movement this is pointless because of the landing animation. It's important to note I abuse this animation to get some enemies off of me. Another note about jumping, it barely works when enemies are around. If even a pixel of one gets in the way your momentum completely stops.

The stick is required to activate a boat, and open a gate in a later stage. The boats are completely insane to get across, the hitboxes on them make no sense at all. Of course, Ninja can't swim and you lose a life.

The bottle is required to beat stage 3. The first streetlight that I pass is on some sort of global timer. If the light is green, a motorcycle comes by and instakills you. There is absolutely no way to avoid this, believe me, I have tried. The second stoplight isn't on a global timer at all and I have to wait. One more pixel to the right would have got Ninja killed.

To get by the panther guard (?) you have to grab the chicken (??) and coat it with suddenly green opium (???), or cocaine (????), don't ask me. It's required in this stage to grab a code from the terminal. As far as I and my crack squad of researchers know, any code from 0000-9999 is possible. You have to enter this code in the final stage to spawn the final boss. The best code is 0000, it takes 1 frame to input at the end. I tried manipulating this code the best I could, wasting a few frames got 0800, which is extremely lucky. This code only takes 4 frames to input at the end. Waiting an extra frame outside the code room generates a whole new set of codes to test, but none ended up as good as 0800. A miracle, really.

You need this to enter the dumbwaiter shaft (??) to the kitchen, which leads to the room that had the key. Despite the door being open, this is the only way. I don't know. The room after the kitchen is the worst room to tas in the entire game, that guy is unbelievably aggressive. The dark room at the end of the level has spike walls everywhere that you can't see cause I skipped the light switch.

The final boss is one of the craziest concepts I've ever seen. He has to be knocked out (only possible with ninja stars) inside the star, and then all five candles need to be lit before he recovers. If he gets up, all the candles go out. Any you light before spawning him go out upon the spawn as well. The hitbox on him being considered inside the star seems to be generous at the top (where I kill him), but the bottom is another story. See here -

	"I love quirky short NES games, and this fit the the bill perfectly. It has some weird charm but doesn't overstay its welcome. I've been running this game RTA for a while (that line hurt to type) and since there was absolutely nothing TAS related, I thought I'd give it a shot as my first one. Was a lot of fun since most of it was simple. A good experience.
