	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This is an improvement of current run by Atma and FractalFusion, I used Psxjin to make it, because Psxjin causes less lag frames than PCSX so that more inputs can be used in the run. 
	$LF

	"The most of improvements come from details, except opening stage, you can see the main improvement at the boss fight. The tricks and glitches are used just as they were used in the current run. You can find more informations in submission

	"The run used a new trick which was found by 
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/Rolanmen1 
		"Rolanmen1
	]a
	", one frame action can be made before refight “WARNING” appears, and “WARNING” appears as normal while you are making the action, but not for all refights. It is for moving ahead to boss with Ryuenjin, a few time is saved. WARNING is for bosses more than Zero himself.

	"I also made Raijingeki more useful at boss fights, it gives 4 damage to Slash Beast,Split Mushroom and Magma Dragoon in the last hit, and can be faster used in place of a second or third ground slash.
