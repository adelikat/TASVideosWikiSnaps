	[em 
		"Kung-Fu Master
	]em
	" is an arcade game produced and released by Irem in 1984.  It is perhaps more widely known by its NES title, 
	[em 
		"Kung Fu
	]em
	".  
	[em 
		"Kung-Fu Master
	]em
	" is the seminal game of the "beat 'em up" genre, and it would influence the arcade game industry for years to come.  It was a great success for Irem, not just for the arcade market, but also later for the home video game market, as it (as well as Irem's 
	[em 
		"10-Yard Fight
	]em
	") was chosen as one of the launch titles for the NES.  
	[em 
		"Kung-Fu Master
	]em
	" is based on Bruce Lee's final film, 
	[em 
		"Game of Death
	]em
	", wherein the hero must ascend a pagoda at his increasing peril, with each floor guarded by a master of a different martial art.  The game even features digitized audio of Bruce Lee ("woo-DAH!").  However, before the game was released, it was roughly retooled to be used as a promotional tie-in for the Jackie Chan film, 
	[em 
		"Spartan X
	]em
	", and the game was released in Japan under the same title as the film.  It is from 
	[em 
		"Spartan X
	]em
	" that the character names Thomas and Silvia are derived.  The gameplay is fast-paced, and the stage  music is simple elegance with an Eastern flavor.  The game is a thing of Golden Age beauty: simple, easy to learn, fun, and

	"Animation Cancellation:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"A standing attack can be cancelled by Jumping or Crouching.  A Crouching attack can be cancelled by Jumping.  A Jump can be cancelled by Crouching.  Cancelling input (e.g. Jump) can begin after just 1 Frame of attack input has been entered, there is no need to hold the attack input for 2 Frames before entering cancelling input.  However, a Kick requires 1 more Frame than a Punch, so the attack input must be held for 2 Frames before entering cancelling input.  A Forward Jump delays Thomas for 5 Frames after he lands.  By holding Down on the joystick for 2 Frames starting 1 Frame before Thomas reaches his final X location (1 Frame before he can begin an attack), this delay can be reduced to only 2 Frames.  Cancelling an attack by Crouching saves as many as 19 Frames compared to allowing the attack to complete normally.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Hit Cancel:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When Thomas is hit while he is standing, he is delayed for 9 Frames.  Using this technique, this delay can be reduced to as few as 2 Frames.  If Thomas is hit during Forward Jump, his horizontal movement is stopped until he lands.  However, if Thomas is hit during Forward Jump, there is no delay to resume walking after landing as there normally would be after landing from a Forward Jump.  Hold Up for 2 Frames just before Thomas is hit.  The earliest possible Frame on which to begin holding Up is 5 Frames before Thomas is hit.  The last possible Frame on which to begin holding Up is 3 Frames before Thomas is hit.  This causes Thomas to be hit after the Jump animation has begun, but before Thomas has left the ground.  Because the game recognizes that Thomas was hit during a Jump, and because Thomas never left the ground, there is no delay to resume walking after landing.  The window of opportunity is only 3 Frames in duration.  After holding Up for 2 Frames, the joystick can be briefly released before walking can be resumed.  For a Forward Jump Hit Cancel started on the last possible Frame, the joystick can be released for 1 Frame.  For a Vertical Jump Hit Cancel started on the last possible Frame, the joystick can be released for 2 Frames.  A Vertical Jump Hit Cancel causes a delay of 4 Frames.  Because a Forward Jump allows Thomas to continue moving forward during the 2 Frames that Up is being held, a Forward Jump Hit Cancel causes a delay of just 2 Frames.  The same effect as a Forward Jump Hit Cancel can be achieved if Thomas is hit as he lands from a Forward Jump.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Post-Jump Quick Action:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"After landing from a Forward Jump, holding Down on the joystick for 2 Frames allows Thomas to immediately begin walking again.  By delaying 1 Frame after Thomas lands, the Punch button can also be held while Down is held on the joystick.  If Thomas uses a Forward Jump Kick against a Boss or Knife Thrower, lands within Punch range, and then uses Cancel Punch 1 Frame after landing, Thomas can hit the enemy 2 times at a cost of just 3 Frames.  Using this technique saves 1 Frame compared to using 2 Cancel Punches (the fastest alternative).  This technique also allows Thomas to hit an enemy that is approaching from behind him for just 3 Frames.  Using this technique to attack an enemy behind Thomas saves 1 Frame compared to using a Turn Cancel Punch or Turn Cancel Kick (the fastest alternative).  Because this technique allows an attack to begin on an otherwise "dead" Frame, 1 Frame can be saved by using Post-Jump Quick Action compared to the normal delay of using an attack.  This technique can save up to 2 Frames when breaking an enemy's hold.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Quick Turn Attack:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Thomas can turn to face the opposite direction while an attack is in progress.  This allows him to quickly attack enemies in front of him and behind him.  If it is necessary to turn to face the opposite direction during a Punch, the joystick can be held in the opposite direction starting on the same Frame that the Punch button is held.  This causes Thomas to Punch for 1 Frame in the direction he is facing before turning to Punch in the opposite direction.  This saves 2 Frames compared to entering the Punch input before entering the turning input.  If it is necessary to turn to face the opposite direction during a Kick, Down can be held on the joystick during the 2nd Frame of turning input.  This saves 1 Frame compared to holding the turning input for 2 Frames before holding Down on the joystick.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Double Hit:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This technique works only for Boss Giant.  Hold the Punch button or Kick button for 2 Frames.  Release the button and hold Down on the joystick.  The initial attack is applied a second time when the joystick is pressed.  This can be done even more quickly by holding the Punch button or Kick button for 1 Frame, and on the next Frame continue to hold the button and also hold Down on the joystick.  On the 3rd Frame, release the button and hold Down on the joystick.

	"Knife Thrower requires 2 hits to defeat, regardless of the attack type.  Knife does 24 Hit Points of damage.  Destroying Knife Thrower with Punch is worth 800 points.  Destroying Knife Thrower with Kick is worth 500 points.  Destroying Knife Thrower with Jump Kick is worth 1,000 points.  When Knife Thrower is hit, he becomes invulnerable for several Frames.  As such, Knife Thrower can only be hit a maximum of once per each 7 Frames.  When Knife Thrower spawns, he approaches Thomas and throws a Knife as soon as he is within range (80 pixels).  Knife Thrower will continue to throw Knives until he is destroyed.  Knife Thrower throws a Knife once per each 252 Frames If Thomas is stationary, or once per each 119 Frames if Thomas is walking.  When a Knife Thrower is on the screen, enemies will not spawn on the side of the screen occupied by Knife Thrower.  This is exploited throughout the TAS to control enemy spawns as needed.

[p 
	"Tom Tom does 12 Hit Points of damage.  Tom Tom can not be hit by Punch or Kick.  Destroying Tom Tom with Crouching Punch is worth 300 points.  Destroying Tom Tom with Crouching Kick is worth 300 points.  When Tom Tom jumps, he becomes immune to attacks, though a collision with Thomas will destroy him, provided Thomas is not Crouching when the contact occurs.  Destroying Tom Tom by contact while standing is worth 200 points.  Destroying Tom Tom by contact while Jumping is worth 400 points.  If Thomas is Crouching, and the RNG is favorable, Tom Tom will jump toward Thomas when he moves within 44 pixels of Thomas.  This occurs 31-34 Frames after Tom Tom spawns.  Tom Tom can be manipulated to jump with as few as just 1 Frame of Crouching, though in certain conditions, Thomas must delay for 1 Frame before beginning Crouching input.  It is also possible to Jump over Tom Tom.

The ending tells us that it's not quite the end, since X isn't ever going to stop stealing the chick, but it's the same kind of ending as in Ghosts'n'Goblins, where we still only require a single loop.
