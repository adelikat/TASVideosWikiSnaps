	" is a 2022 homebrew game made by Mikebloke for the Fairchild Channel F. It’s quite self-explanatory and is somewhat similar to Atari’s Boxing game from 1980. It’s a 2 player game where the goal is to land as many punches on each other in a 3 minute in-game timer. The player with the most points (1 point per punch) wins.

	"This TAS aims to max out the score at 999 as fast as possible, playing as P1. Due to the Channel F’s strange design, P1 (blue) is on the right and P2 (red) is on the left.

	"The strategy here is to get both boxers as close to each other as possible while getting P2 to X=0 (the left side of the ring). This is lag efficient and ensures that P1 can land all 999 punches consecutively. Due to the Channel F processing inputs much slower than its framerate, each punch takes, on average, 17 frames (16 frames has approximately a 1/75 chance).
