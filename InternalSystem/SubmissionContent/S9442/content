	"Maze Craze is a simple two-player Atari game. In this game, you have to find the exit in a randomly generated maze. This game has a boatload of customizable options, including adding enemies, changing the maze's visibility, or even placing fake walls. It's worth mentioning that you can increase the player's speed, but this takes way too long to do, so it's not done here.

[div class=p 
	"When powering on the game, the game randomly chooses between 16 starting seeds. By adding power inputs during the first few frames of the run, we can choose our starting seed. After this, the seed is updated every frame. When we reset, the game uses that seed to generate a new maze. The objective of this TAS is to generate the shortest possible maze in the fewest amount of frames.

	". I switched to BizHawk 2.10 with the Stella core because it emulates the loading more accurately. In past TASes, I was able to press reset while the game was generating a maze, which simply isn't possible on actual hardware.

You could potentially do more resets to generate these mazes faster, but at that point, they're not viable. Doing more than one reset is too slow.

	": Ok, I see that the new files are not getting us anywhere. This situation is weird, because to get the ultimate pattern, you would have to reset to until you get what you want. Because we don't know how long the speed runners perform these resets, this run will suffice. TAS timing starts at power on, but the RTA runs don't. The actual IGT gameplay, may be longer than the human effort...but the overall effort certainly is going to beat a human. I'm just disappointed that desired patterned couldn't be achieved. I'm turning down all the files submitted after my original request...seeing that they all get longer in length.

In my opinion, that kind of human run should be clocked from the very start of the effort. If that was done, then we could certainly solidify a judgement on this. Instead, I'm accepting this because it appears to be out of reach for any human to find the results of this movie. Yes...the IGT part is slower, but this TAS is way above human capabilities.
