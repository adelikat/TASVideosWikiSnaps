	(__wikiLink|displaytext=last submission|href=/6239S)
	" because they chose to stop input before the credits instead of getting back to the main menu. The basic movement optimization is pretty much on point. It also appears that a lot of thought was put into distributing experience between characters so that the level gates are opened with as little grinding as possible. I appreciated the sequences of rapid-fire equipment drops thanks to some quality RNG manipulation. There aren't too many skips, but the ones you found are quite effective.

It feels like the battles should be repetitive to watch, but I found myself strangely entertained by them. The action is fast-paced and the enemies are varied. The cutscenes are also limited enough to keep my attention. It may change tiers after some ratings come in, but for now, accepting to Moons.
