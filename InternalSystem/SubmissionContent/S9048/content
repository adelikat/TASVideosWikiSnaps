You would have to move left one frame and then up the next. A is the only action button that really does anything unless the game tells you to press start.

	"So, clearly there is rng at play here. The layout of the cards gets changed every frame you wait on the main menu. So, I tested several frames on the main menu, starting with pressing Start on the first frame possible. To see what the best outcome would be, I counted the frames off of a theoretical perfect outcome, which doesn’t exist in this case. That would be when getting past the menu on frame one, every card being right next to each other, because you can go straight to it and press A on the same frame. On a frame 1 menu, there are 0 frames lost to waiting in the menu and 11 frames lost to movement in the game due to less than perfect rng. The next frame has 1 frame lost to waiting in the menu and >10 frames lost to movement in the game. Once the lost frames exceed the leader (frame one), I move on to the next starting frame, aka the next memory layout. As it turns out, a frame one menu is the fastest outcome.

	": Well...first off. Congratulations on your first successful submission. Yes, you heard me right. :) Second...I know this is a simple game, but people often do not treat simple games with a serious approach. As a judge, it is not expected of us to find every frame you miss; however, my initial review showed nothing to find. I'm in the mindset of always believing that something exists, yet it depends on how much effort you are willing to put in to find it. That effort was enough for me to accept it. BUT!
