	""Normal Game" was selected here. Unlike the "Hard Game", the AI in the "Normal Game" has a chance of not blocking a win in 1. This TAS plays the fastest game of Connect Four theoretically possible, both in terms of turn number and checker drop time, winning with just a simple four-checker sequence vertically.

	"Embedded above is an existing TAS of "Normal Game" by k80may from 8.5 years ago. It is 570 frames according to RTA timing (screen going black after selecting "One Player" to when the Connect Fourâ„¢ text appears after winning). This submission is 574 frames using that same timing. That's 4 frames slower, so what gives? Well notice how k80may's video footage starts when "Connect Four" is selected from the menu, not from power on. We therefore have no idea when power on actually happened relative to this TAS, which I feel is very important to consider relative to the "submission must match or beat all known records" clause in the Movie Rules. I mean, k80may could have waited an hour on that title screen to get godly RNG for all we know, which would clearly NOT be faster relative to the TAS timing rules of this site. And as I mentioned earlier, I exhaustively tested 
	[em 
		"everything
	]em
	" to try and get this submission to match k80may's RTA time while still maximizing TAS time without luck. Therefore, while this submission does not beat all known records relative to RTA timing, it almost certainly beats all known records relative to TAS timing; thus I believe this submission is acceptable for the site.

Basically, we can separate "Normal" and "Hard" into "Fastest Completion" and "Full Completion". This TAS would basically qualify for "Fastest Completion"...meaning that among the 3 difficulty selections, "Normal" beats the games as fast as possible.

[div class=p 
	"I tested the "Easy" selection and you are completely correct. It takes way much longer and automatically default to "Normal", seeing that the fastest completion of the game (in terms of moves) wouldn't be any different. Additionally, I would like to add that the "other" TAS mentioned here isn't something that I am concerned with, because we have no way to scientifically verify (in this case a movie file) the speed of it. Since it wasn't published, you get the first stab at a publication.
