	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"So it was after my TAS got rejected, Andzura posted in the forum a rolling superjump that he found. So 	I contacted him on Skype, then the project started.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"But I couldn't start the TAS because I was doing Rayman 2 (future project : 100% TAS?). Then I told him if when I finish it I will join the project.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Then I lost interest doing Rayman 2 because it was too hard to find the values/route planning. So I started Rayman 3.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Andzura did a great leap forward by finding some values with Cheat Engine, he found:
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"- Score address
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"- Altitude
	[br

	"- Z Pointer
	[br

	$LF
	"- Facing
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"But those values were too useless.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Then I was bored and Yoshifan helped me to set the lua script like Masterjun (but Yoshifan one was a modified one)
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Then after hours of retries it finally worked :D
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"But, we decided with Andzura to find the velocity values. I found the Y Speed. Andzura found after the X and Z. We used them. We sadly looked at them, they were wrong.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"But, Andzura told me that to make them work, we should use pythagoras (If you forget then you're drunk XD.)
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"So Xspd²+Zspd² = Speed.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Then, we tried to find the position but we couldn't. then a day later I lost internet. During that time I was searching the position.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I thought logically. He told me that the Y Position was the easiest one to find. So I found one and told myself that if the Y value is XXXXXXX8, Z or X will be XXXXXXX4 or XXXXXXX0
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"So it worked, but the values were wrong. When cheating them they all do nothing. So I found another speed, but when I changed the last number, it wasn't correct value, then Andzura told me it was the right value, instead of having a positive value I should have it negative and it worked!
