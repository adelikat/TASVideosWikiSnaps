	$LF

	"This is a bad name for this unnamed glitch, but basically $7E1697 increments not only when you stomp an enemy but when you mount Yoshi. You can abuse this by mounting and dismounting him before landing on ground consecutively, for example, 7 times in a row and then stomping a Kooopa to get a free 1up. I used this glitch to quickly get 255 for $7E1697, by abusing that other glitch where you smash A when touching a solid ceiling with Mario's head, which basically kills your vertical momentum if done correctly .
