		"This glitch found by Acmlm, I made it sense by myself. To use this glitch, you can everts the world wherever you are. When you die, you fall down like supermario from dead point to bottom, if a eversion point is below you, you can everts while you touching the eversion point. After the death ends and before the black background tip appears by 1 frame, in this frame everts the world and you get this glitch. If you everts from lower to higher world, you can only everts the world +1 each time. Otherwise, if you everts from higher to lower world, you can only everts the world -1 each time.To get the good ending, the possible way is everts to world 7-8 and access to world 8, this glitch is for that. Some waiting is for this glitch.
