	"Hello and welcome back to this Riviera TAS, my name is Flameberger. This is my updated version of the TAS I submitted last year, featuring major route improvements and overall higher levels of optimization. In total I saved 16,929 frames. Riviera is a somewhat obscure turn based jrpg. It was originally released on the Wonderswan Color and was later remade first for the GBA (my version of choice,) and then for the PSP. Compared to my action packed platformer submissions this one takes a bit of a slower pace. Above anything else this was an exercise in routing, putting the actual TAS together was relatively simple after I finalized the route, a process that I originally worked on for around two and a half months, and then later had to revise significantly to make room for new strats on this remake. Apart from finding specific strategies for each battle, managing the big picture was a struggle because of how interconnected everything is. Didn't get enough levels on Fia in Chapter 4? Guess she'll die to Malice in Chapter 7.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Thankfully I did start with a lot of game knowledge from my experience running the game in RTA. The basic structure of the route turned out pretty similar in terms of which characters are good, which items are worth picking up, etc. Naturally I was able to trim a lot of fat by ignoring safety and it was possible to set up for very efficient battles using RNG manipulation.

	$LF
]h2
[div class=p 
	"In terms of optimizing the TAS RNG manipulation is by far the next biggest thing after routing. Riviera uses values from three separate memory addresses to create the random number that's used to determine outcomes. The first is a value that starts with a seeded value and is then changed via some formula every time a random event occurs, it does not change on every frame. Second is a simple frame counter that counts up to some value and then resets to 0.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The last one is the oddball. It changes chaotically every frame based on things I don't entirely understand involving one of the system's I/O registers. It's listed as vcount in the memory map I found, 0x4000006. As far as I can tell it has something to do with how the hardware handles drawing things to the screen. I mentioned it changes chaotically, this is very significant. There are cases where I have multiple options on how to go through a menu or do something else, even if different options take the same number of frames and have the same number of random events involved the vcount rng will usually end up different. This gives me more options on manipulating but it also makes any kind of resynching after a hex edit unfeasible. Also of note, inputs which should have no impact on the game can cause very minor changes to the value (usually, a decrease by 1.) This is handy as an option to manipulate RNG without wasting frames, but it has some major limitations. Firstly, it's not as if every input has this effect, I might be able to only trigger it once or twice in 50 frames. Secondly, there's always some upper limit on how many of these manipulations I can do before negatively impacting a previous random event. Thirdly, certain things are easier to affect than others.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Because it just decreases the final RNG value by 1 the most common impact on damage rolls is to also decrease their damage by 1. I use this to reduce damage I take in certain spots, if you see me survive with 1 or 2 hp you can bet there was probably some vcount manipulation that made that happen. I also do this to trim unnecessary damage done by my characters to cut time spent watching enemy health bars depleting. It is also possible to wrap around from minimum to maximum damage so there are  cases where I use it to increase my damage done or taken. Affecting Miss or Guards generally requires a larger number of manipulations because these are determined by taking the RNG (compressed to a value in 0 to 99) and checking to see if it's greater or less than some other stat. Changing the RNG by just a few points won't change the outcome unless it was already very close to the critical value. Changing who gets targeted by randomized targeting is very easy though, I guess it just modulo the amount of targets and each change in value gives a new result. Adjusting the initial turn order is very important as well. In general all units in the battle will be shifted by the same amount from a manipulation, but I can often change initial orders by having units roll under from their minimum initial wait time to their maximum. Even with this option it's very common for the turn order I'm looking for to be unobtainable, in those cases I need to sacrifice frames while changing the main RNG value.

	"In Riviera characters do not equip items or have innate skills. Instead, on every battle I choose four items to bring and my characters can use the skills that they have associated with those items. Picking the right items for a battle is a major part of the game's strategy. Additionally, character's can earn levelups by using specific items enough times. Earning levels increases stats and also unlocks an Overskill that the character can use with that item, assuming the Overdrive meter is sufficiently filled. Items have durability and can only be used a certain number of times. Basic weapons like swords and bows are generally available in very large stacks, while more powerful items are limited in uses.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Offensive skills are divided into two categories, Attacks and Magics. They are functionally identical except that Attack damage is based on the attacker and the defender's strength stat, whereas Magics use the magic stat. The fact that strength and magic are not just offensive, but also defensive stats is very important. In the run I'll be mostly focused on collecting large amounts of strength and killing enemies with Attacks, this will leave me very vulnerable to enemy Magic.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Turn orders are determined by wait times. After using a skill a character or enemy will have some number of these time units before their next turn. Wait time is determined by the skill being used and the agility stat of the user. At the start of a battle the initial wait times of each unit are chosen randomly from a range of values, also affected by agility.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Enemies choose skills based on the rage meter in the bottom right of the screen. Each enemy has three main types of skill: Normal, Rage and Max. The small line at 60% indicates where Rage skills will be used. If the bar is completely filled the next enemy turn will be a Max skill and the meter gets reset. Generally power and wait times are proportional to the type of skill being used. I often deliberately trigger Rage or Max skills in order for the enemy to get less turns than they would if they were using faster Normal skills. On the other hand, there's a strong correlation between skill level and animation times, many Max skills are very time consuming and might be avoided for that reason. Enemies can also use a fourth type, called ETC skills, under special circumstances. There aren't general rules for when ETC skills other than the fact that no enemy will ever use one on their first turn. Otherwise their use is determined on a case by case basis by that enemy's particular AI.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Player characters and enemies are placed on two 3x2 grids. Which units get attacked is based on the targeting type of the skill and where things are located on the grids. For example when Ein swings a sword it targets the nearest enemy, when he uses Einherjar it hits all enemies in the front row. My choice of where to place my units affects which enemies I attack and which of my characters will get targeted.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"The game has multiple endings based on which party member has the highest of an invisible affection stat. This is significant because that character will not be available for the final battle. I go out of my way a few times to ensure that the chosen character isn't someone I need for that battle. Party members can also get minor combat bonuses based on these systems, this is only rarely a significant part of the routing. My most important character is pretty much always in a good mood from killing enemies anyways.

This saves roughly half a second when it's to my advantage, and it also costs around that much when I need to cancel and switch to a different setup.

	"Another tough one. Fia has to take some pretty big damage from the Swing Around to make her Zantetsu uses strong enough. In particular here in bee route I need Fia to take 3 out of 4 hits from the Swing Around, whereas just 2 out of 4 was sufficient before. This is because Serene hasn't finished her Black Scythe level yet and is therefore hitting for a lot less. Technically she could take that damage after her first use, it wouldn't be strong enough to kill the imp in that case but I could have Ein finish it off with his scythe, he needs to hit the other imp anyway, again because of Serene's lower damage. Speaking of Ein, it's fortunate that I have a character to spare because I don't think there's anyone in my party that could survive her Nightmare Waltz without getting an unreasonable numbers of misses. He's not farming any EXP or contributing to the kill so he can just take one for the team. When Serene gets her wait time inverted by the imp's Paradox it actually accelerates her turn by a lot. This allows her to max the rage before the Sage's second turn which in turn ensures she doesn't get a third turn.

This was leaving me with just one other item slot for my attacking weapon, the Holy Sabre. Serene needs three H.Sabre EXP to level but she was using it twice each in these battles, I wanted to take that extra fourth Sabre use and put it towards the Blood Fang, which you will recall she is behind on EXP for this route. To free up the inventory space required for a second weapon I had to do both of my vanishes with Wings instead of using the Blue Bomber. The two are not completely interchangeable though; I would later run into issues of not having enough wings when I need them had I not saved one by using bees instead on the Tethyian Robbers fight in Chapter 4. There was an additional issue of actually getting kills with Serene using the Blood Fang instead of the Holy Sabre, by switching my target to the skeleton in this fight instead of the knight I was able to get around that. The skeleton has a larger health pool but has 0 VIT and a greater weakness to holy, making it actually a lot squishier. I was even able to switch both of Serene's attacks to Blood Fangs, meaning she is now caught up on that and just one point short on the Holy Sabre.

The time cost is very significant, I estimate it at a bit under 3 minutes counting both the time of the fight and the time spent hitting all the stakes to open the door. The benefits to me are one point of Blood Fang EXP on Serene, 10x Rosier and 5x Kiku-Ichimonji. The one point of EXP is obviously nothing huge, maybe saves me 5 seconds. The Rosier is essential for the boss rush but I could pick up a stack from the Giant Fortress fight in Chapter 7 instead. I would miss out on the two uses in Chapter 6 and it would add a lot of time to that Giant Fortress battle, it's tough to say but I'd count it as around a minute in my advantage. This leaves nearly 2 minutes that needs to be accounted for by 5x Kiku-Ichimonji. On one hand that's a lot of time to make up, on the other hand the route wouldn't work without those katanas. No two ways about it, I get to the boss rush without any of these and I'm just done, not enough damage.

I also save one Zantetsu, which is nice. At this point Serene is now back on track with all her levels.

	"The reason I was running around collecting those three Ankhs is because I need them to solve the lake puzzle in this upcoming area. The basic idea is that there are three crystal shrines, one at the entrance and two in the lake. At each shrine I can place an Ankh and it will lower the water in certain rooms in the lake. The rooms that are affected are based on the shape of the letter of the Ankh (L Ankh affects the left and bottom sides, for example.) I can only traverse rooms that have had the water lowered at least once, and if a room is being lowered by two or more Ankhs at the same time there might be something special, like a treasure chest or an item, that's otherwise inaccessible. I completely ignored the Southern Catacombs where I could have fought a bunch more and gotten three more Ankhs, conveniently the puzzle can be solved with just the northern Ankhs. In fact I can make it all the way across the lake with just A and X active, the problem is that neither of those will allow me to reach a second crystal shrine. I need to temporarily use L to get to the yellow shrine. The top left corner has a chest with Wyvernzem, a powerful claw weapon. Conveniently the water is lowered twice there by L and X and I can collect it without any trouble.

By getting him to incur a long delay time on his first turn, when it's impossible for him to change forms, gives me a lot of time to bring him down before he gets a chance. Having him use his Max skill would give me even more time to work with (saving me from needing Serene to be so much faster at the start,) but I need the Rage specifically to bring Fia's hp low for her katana use.

First, the Night Scythe that Death drops really didn't turn out to be very practical. It seems pretty strong but I just had too much other important stuff for Serene and my other characters to do. Second the Rosier stack is precious, I need 8 for the boss rush and that leaves me only 2 to use elsewhere.

Thankfully in the calculations the amount of damage that a defender can block by having higher strength is limited by how much vitality they have. Because the katanas have Not-VIT Ledah's vitality is effectively zero, and thus he can't block any of the damage no matter how much stronger he is. This also means that Fia's strength is not a factor in her damage done, any amount of strength that's less than or equal to the target's would do the same amount of damage. More than anything else this is what makes Fia so good in the route, she can deal major damage to endgame bosses without needing to pick up a ton of levels throughout the run.

Normally Ledah using magic is pretty laughable but in this case Serene having even less (27 to 30) and a sizable weakness to fire makes it a pretty powerful skill.

With Serene being directly targeted and Fia taking collateral damage from the final hits they are both only barely able to survive with +30 magic from the Mage Rings and +7 from Magic Formation. Serene has good ice resistance but it only goes so far when she's got 27 magic to awakened Malice's 106. Ein obviously has no chance.

	"Throwing Ice Emblems here is actually not the reason I picked them up. Originally I had Lina shooting a Wind Bowgun which served the same purpose. Once I added the emblems to the route I no longer had inventory space for the bowguns so it was really fortunate that I could substitute them in like this. I kept a Holy Sabre for this fight because I don't have any other weapons that Ein can get at least two hits with, which is needed for getting back to level 2 overdrive between the No Mercy.

	"Previously I was having Fia use the Power Wrist so she could just barely survive 2/3 hits from the Downward Slash, setting up a strong Revenge multiplier. I had to move the Power Wrist to Serene so she could get the level she needs and then have Fia get hit by only 1/3 attacks instead. This left her with too much HP and I was falling short on damage. Thankfully Downward Slash has a very unique property called Element. This causes the elemental type of the skill to change based on what she was last hit by. Having Ein go before her and dealing Holy damage with the Battle Pixies changes Downward Slashes type to Dark, which Fia is weak to. This extra damage from the weakness was enough to keep the strat working.

	"Reworked this fight a bit. Previously I thought that Serene would need to do four No Mercy to end the fight, and there wasn't enough time to do that without Death getting another turn. This time through I realized I could have Serene do one Rosier and three No Mercy. With No Mercy being a much faster animation than a Level 3 Disaresta I saved a lot of time by having Ein take the death and Serene finishing the fight. To make up for my extra Rosier use I simply had Ein replace his use with another Einherjar swing.

	"This is by far the most difficult fight in the run from a routing perspective. Normally it could be a tossup between this and the other final boss but not in TAS because I do have Fanelia for that fight but I don't have Longinus for this one. After Lindwurm this was the only other fight that really made me despair. 11,000 HP is just so much to get through, even when I'm getting juicy 2500 damage No Mercy and strong Katana hits. There was no reasonable way to survive long enough. Then I had the idea to pick up the Ice Emblems and the route was saved. My first draft had 1 Kiku-Ichimonji and 1 Zantetsu, instead of 2 of the former, so that made it even more unreasonable.

	"Hector's resistances and the element type of his skills are determined by which of four forms he is in. I didn't disassemble it to be certain, but as far as I can tell the AI is that anytime Hector would use a Normal Skill except for his first turn in a form he will use Element Transition. The ice form he starts in is by far the ideal because it's weak to lightning and it doesn't murder Serene too badly. I'll be preventing him from ever transitioning by having him use Max Skills in each of his turns after his first. Fia can not survive one of those Ether Bursts, even with the Mage Ring buff, and Serene can only take one. That's what I picked up those Ice Emblems for in Chapter 6. You'll notice Serene becomes outright immune to the element after using it, her base resistance of +40 with an extra +60 from the emblem renders his spell invalid. This was actually a bit of a problem in the first draft when I only had 1 Kiku-Ichimonji because I needed to do another No Mercy but I wasn't getting any overdrive from being hit by spells I was immune to.

	": Since the previous submission was made, I took my time playing casually through this game, in order to figure out and comfirm the purpose behind most TASing choices made here. Turns out that this movie is very optimized in all aspects, thanks to the appropriate routing choices, on both the short and the long term through the run. Everything that could be seen as a mistake in the eyes of a clueless viewer is actually part of a neatly-designed project.

	"What said above brings us to the following question: how much can an average watcher enjoy this movie? In my opinion, the main problem is about the unvarying gameplay flow: most of the movie consists in either turn-based battles or plot dialogue (which you can't even read because of the speed). What's worse is that the battles themselves consist in either grinding EXP or instant wiping out the enemy, with few exceptions. The most compelling parts are the boss battles, which are won by a hair's breadth thanks to the careful planning and RNG manipulation, but it's still not enough to compensate. It also doesn't help that the movie in itself is more than 3 hours long.
