	"This is a weird one.  While jumping in the air press up+down and attack with the normal weapon.  The turtle sprite will be replaced by an enemy sprite briefly.  Also a "flying weapon" will appear on the screen that can damage enemies.  With don, this is a sprite of Leo's sword.  This can be used to strategically hit bosses earlier and speed up fights (particularly the technodrome).

	"This isn't really a glitch but weapons do more damage when you turtle is under %50 health.  I take damage intentionally in order to do more damage.  This saved time on every boss in the game.

	"This glitch was discovered by Spider-waffle and allows you to scroll down to the screen below by jumping up a near a ladder and attacking with your weapon at the right time.  For this to work you have to a) be able to reach the top of the screen b) there must be two tiles of roof next to the ladder.  This was used in level 5 to save about 150 frames and level 6 to save about 13 seconds.
