Also for helping me in the 2nd space shooter to find out why the enemy counter sometimes ticks down even if you seemly hit nothing. Sadly this couldn't be used as much as I hoped since this makes the next enemy spawn quite long afterwards but it is used once, at the very end since then no more enemy spawns.
