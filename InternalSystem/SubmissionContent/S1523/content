	" About The Game
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The game is about a three-eye boy who set out to rescue a lovely girl. All together there's five stages.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The boy can use the normal weapon as well as a red lance which can be called out by pressing the B button for several seconds.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"At first the lance cause no damege to enemies. But if the hero went into the shop and paied 1ooo yen (why yen? because this story happened in Japan) to buy a lance's power-up, the lance can be used to beat all kinds of enemies.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Especially the in BOSS fighting, the hero can always destroy these guys within 3 seconds with the help of red lance. That will make the movie much faster.
	$LF

	"The problem is how to gain 1000 yen and not to cause any lags in the game.
	$LF
	"In the game ,a small enemy will drop a coin when it is beaten by the hero. Then the hero can can keep on shooting the coin once and once again to make it bigger and bigger (but too much hits will make the coin disappear) For example, a 20 yen coin can be changed into a 100 one.
	$LF
	"In stage 1-1, there's a truck on which appear 13 dogs. Each dog can drop a 20 yen coin and I have enough spare time to hit them into 100 yen coins. But it's not so easy even if I slow down the speed, for the hero can throw out three shots an one time but at most there will be 5 or more coins on the screen. Finally I gained 1110 yen and that's enough for me:)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Besides the red lance the hero can also choose to buy three kinds of special weapons: wave, high and speed. Their power is the same as the normal weapon. If I want to buy one of these weapons I had to pay hundreds of frames' time to gain another 1000 yen(each weapon worth 1000 yen). So I decided not to buy any of them.

	" Which Level Should I Choose 
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"There are two levels to choose at beginning: easy and normal. The only difference is that if you carelessly drop the hero into a gulf there's a bird to carry you out in easy level but no one in normal level.Other things are the same, like the HP of small enemies and boss. There's no need to choose the normal level and not to choose it can save a frame's time.

		" As I've mentioned above, how to work out 1000 yen on the truck is a hard but interesting thing.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Killing all the boss within several seconds under the help of the lance. I even ended the movie so early when the final boss haven't come out.
		$LF

	[li 
		" Dancing with enemies in stage 4-1. I had much spare time then, and the music is so wonderful.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" "Kiss" the iron thorns in stage 5. The thorns can send the hero to death by one touch and I try to make it look like a narrow pass.
