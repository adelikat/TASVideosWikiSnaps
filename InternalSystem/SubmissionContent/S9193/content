		"Welp, unlike the NES version, the GB version is actually broken. I think due to coding issues, they disregarded the fact that you can duck while falling from a platform. This is big for this game because you can trigger the animation for letting go of a soft platform, if you're too close, you can land inside the hard platform, from then, you can wiggle to zip to the left side of the screen, and LUCKILY that triggers the victory music which clears the level without fighting any boss

		"I think this glitch is worth showcasing, as it is fun to see everything being skipped. Moreover, it is properly broken because it does require a platform to fall from, which for instance, in scene 5-1, we go through a bit of the stage to find the closest platform for the skip. A lot of lag management is involved there as well.
