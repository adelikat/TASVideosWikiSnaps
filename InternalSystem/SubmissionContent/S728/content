	": Updating Rejection reason from Game Choice to Optimization.  The goal of the tas seems to be maximum score so changing goal to reflect that.  However if going for a maximum score this is very inconsistent.  The ideal scoring looks to be if you continually steal the ball after scoring then dunk immediately which takes about 2 seconds on the clock.  Stealing the ball then running to the side and scoring a 3 takes up to 7 seconds on the clock.  Though If a submission were to do fastest completion what would need to be done is just to keep anyone from scoring until the final couple seconds on the clock.
