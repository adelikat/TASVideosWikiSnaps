	"Well Well guyz, on this shot'n up jet/ship game I decide to use animals instead (which are robots as I found on somes sources), Rabio and Lepus were choosen, well, I wasn't sure why should I use them... but after somes emails, research and feedbacks I realized why I should use them, using normals characters I usually will fight throught only 7 stages, well thats logic why 1 stage is skipped by using a normal jet, who would be crazy to shot against his own nation? since they dont have an exactly location, using Rabio and Lepus I can go throught all 8 stages, another thing I have to clarify too, someone might say "Man but they are secret characters, they are too strongt, the game will be a cheap thing..." well well, to make sure I make it clear enought to the viewers, the strongest characters in-game are Willian(1P Britsh) and Keith (2P USA)... his subshots are very strong, more than Rabio and Lepus, so thats why Fastest time isnt my main goal , instead I decide to use them because I never found a single gameplay using them both...so it could be nice to someone make it at least (surely I can be wrong)but I made sure to not make anything sloopy, another thing I have to specific before someone flames me, "hey but along the run you missed many shots, its a fail"... well I would like the game to be more precise about shots but for 1 input it comes out 6 shots, if you press a input during the third/fourth shot you can increase 2/3 more pellets, I reallly did my best to make all shots precise enough but in somes cases I had to give 1 more input due to the subshot interval thats 1 frame per subshot or else the bosses shouldn't die, I really did my best to make it look nice, well another thing too, MAAAAAN thats very hard to make a 2P tas even doing Frame-by-frame... all moves had to be very well done but I liked the result a lot well Enough! of this... its time to explain all stages and things I did during the TAS...

	"I surely used the Hardest dificult, it increase number of enemys(and lag that I make sure to be the lowest possible) you need a code to acess it,on the title screen hold down the R button, and enter the following code on the first or second controller: Up, Left, Down, Right, B, A, X, Y. Go to the option menu, and scroll the difficulty settings. The difficulty mode "SUPER" should appear. Please note that this mode can also be accessed by finishing the game on "HARD" mode as well, another thing someone might say "Hey, but why Lepus have a 001 points on the begining? did he died and used continues?" no I didn't died or someone thing, to save 2 frames, instead of choosing 2 Players on the title screen, I just choose 1Players then on the beginning of the stage 1 I already press start to make him appear, so it makes appear as he used continue. I didnt died(at least on the beginning) nor used continues.

I had to keep my distance close to him to make my subshots hits him as well, another detail, when he stops shinning red, I had to shot from his sides instead of middle, because there is a shield that could drain my shots making it a bit slower, another great thing, since my main aim is Maximum Kills, I had to get a bit away from him, you can notice few sub shots comes outs, so thats because after I kill him, I stand on the bottom of the screen, using the sub shots to help me I manage to kill 2 tanks on the almost very end of the screen fade if I didnt do this, I could go throught the screen fade but they could be visible... so you guyz got it right? dont worry I didn't wasted any time...

	"A good annotation I have to make, most WIPS and Rejected projects I saw... no one managed to shot the boss on the moment the floor moves, instead, they wait until a bit of the 2nd part is showed up to begin to shot and they shots from far instead from the very inside, thats one of the main improvments over all WIPS and Rejects I saw...
