	" I've taken a look at this submission, compared it with the currently published SNES run, and come to 3 conclusions: 1) This run lacks a lot of the content that the currently published run does; 2) The only new content that this run adds when compared to the published run is the flagpole glitch and a couple different walking through wall locations (which make up a very small percentage of the movie); and 3) The stylistic choices in this run are neutral to slightly worse than that of the current run (I particularly don't like the repetitive jumping while facing backwards, except in the stages with flying fish). Considering this, I think it's obvious that this run shouldn't obsolete the SNES version, and I also don't believe it provides enough unique content to warrant a separate category for SMB2(J), so I'm setting this to 'rejected'.
