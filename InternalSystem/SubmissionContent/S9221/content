	""Enchanted: Once Upon Andalasia" is a prequel to the 2007 Disney Movie "Enchanted" (which is a movie I am a massive fan of, I cannot recommend it enough). It is also one of the absolute latest Game Boy Advance games, releasing in mid November 2007. The game is a 2D platformer where you take control of Giselle, Pip and prince Edward who have to save Andalasia from an evil fairy who is stealing Andalasia's magic and kidnapping innocent animals. Being a prequel to the movie, the game takes place exclusively in Andalasia, so we never Giselle, Edward and so on go to the real world outside of a handful of stills from the movie being in the game. The game has a total of 13 levels, 9 Giselle levels and 4 Edward levels. The final level is only accessible if you beat the game 100% and as that would require playing a majority of the levels twice, we just stick to beating up to level 12 in Any%.

	" as that goes into detail about the run and all of the tricks used. While I was happy with how that run turned out, it was my first TAS and I noticed more and more mistakes as time went on. With that being said, I managed to save way more time in this run than I could have ever imagined.

	"This run is close to 32 seconds faster than my previous TAS when taking emulation differences into account. My old TAS was made on standard BizHawk and the run was just over 10 seconds slower when resynced onto GBAHawk. One thing which saved a whole bunch of time in this run was that I turned off the music. When I made the old TAS, I knew that having music on lost time but I kept it on anyway as a speed-entertainment trade off. With this updated TAS however, I took the bullet and turned music off as the game is significantly laggier on GBAHawk/real hardware. I believe turning music off saved somewhere from 12-14 seconds due to significantly reduced lag which is a shame as the soundtrack is quite solid but that's just how things go sometimes. For my YouTube upload, I edited the music back in. It isn't perfect but it does get the job done. Whether a music edit is published here or not is up to the TASVideos team. Turning off sound effects should save even more time but I wasn't willing to go that far so I left the sound effects on. The time save from turning them off would be minimal and that would have sacrificed entertainment even more so I kept them on.

	"A majority of time saves however come from better movement and new strats. Every main level has noticeable improvements throughout. The only levels which have not been improved are the Edward levels which are very short chase levels which were already performed to perfection. One of the main ways I saved time throughout the run was with more strategic Pip usage. I swap between Giselle and Pip far more frequently to get more stuff done without having to wait around. I will go more into detail about some of these strats in the level comments.

In this TAS however, I quickly switch to Giselle during the section to move her forwards without slowing Pip down too much. Giselle has to jump onto ledges which takes quite some time so playing as Pip while Giselle is doing that is highly efficient. As a result, Giselle ended up right next to troll once the rock drops on his head, saving a fair amount of time.

The main reason I did this in the original TAS was to set up a death warp in chapter 9. However, I ended up routing out the death warp in chapter 9 with a faster strat and I was too lazy to route out the death in chapter 3 since I was still new to TASing.

I miss out on the note to the left but I don't need it anymore since I entered the section with an extra note.

	"And that is my updated TAS for Enchanted: Once Upon Andalasia. The final run clocks in at 16:40.426 or roughly a 16:21 with RTA timing (RTA WR is 18:55 as of writing this). My original TAS was the first TAS I ever made and even back then, I knew it was improvable. I was disappointed that I didn't get sub 17 since I was so close. This improvement however is much bigger than what I imagined back then, saving close to 32 seconds when considering emulation differences. Sub 17 was inevitable with removed music but a 16:40 is much lower than what I thought I would get when I started this improvement. The amount of improvements I managed to incorporate into this run is much greater than I anticipated (the improvements also saved more time than the removed music) and I am really proud of what I was able to achieve. There might still be a bit more time to squeeze out of this game but I am highly satisfied with how this run turned out. There was almost nothing in this game when I started running it RTA and the game has come so far since then with plenty of exploits, skips and optimised movement, I am very happy with how far I have managed to push this game basically single-handedly.
