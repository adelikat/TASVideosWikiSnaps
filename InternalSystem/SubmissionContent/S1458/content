	"I decided to do this run because it was in the list of ideas on the site. The run is made a lot quicker due to a couple of glitches I discovered by accident.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The first glitch, which I use throughout the entire run is what I like to call the long jump trick. If you push the jump key on the exact right frame (one frame before you land) and don't press any of the arrow keys, the velocity of the previous jump transfers to the next one. This is useful because double jumps are faster than walking. However, normally if you were to constantly double jump, Batman would hit the right side of the screen, and would be slowed down. With long jumps there isn't that problem.IF you push a direction button at any time while in the air, Batman's speed will be reset. 
	$LF

[p 
	"The other trick is the backwards jump. There are two ways to do a backwards jump. One is to take at least one step in the direction you want to move, then immediately press the opposite direction and jump on the same frame. The other is to push in the opposite direction of where you're moving during the jump animation when you're long jumping. Backwards jump is useful because it messes with collision detection, which allows you to

]p
[p 
	"What actions this boss takes depends how far you are away from him when he decides to attack (which is always on the same frames). If you are very far away, he will inch forward and not attack. If you get a little closer, he will duck down and run forward to try uppercutting you. If you get even closer, he will stand in place and try to punch you. If you are right next to him, he will uppercut in place.

[p 
	"I think this is my favorite level. Here we are introduced to the wall jumping trick, which really, no Batman game should be without wall jumping. Double jumping off a long jump neither changes where Batman lands nor how long a jump takes. What it does change is Batman's position on the screen. I use it to manipulate the chandeliers, which don't start falling until they appear on screen.

	"This is an autoscrolling level. I tried to make it interesting, but there's not much I can do since the batmobile is big, slow, and doesn't have any cool powerups. Feel free to fast-forward through this if you like. It ends when the tank that's two batmobiles wide explodes.
