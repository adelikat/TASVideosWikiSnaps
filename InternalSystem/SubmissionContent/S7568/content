We have to save our kitty (in this case) which is kidnapped by the Evil Dragon by going in the castle and fighting him. This game mostly works on Level Cycles, which was good because I have to improve this TAS a ton of times.....

Sometimes, only 2 jumps in the room will result us getting bumped at the end wall. To prevent it, we have to make one jump in between these two jumps so that our jumping alternation varies. It leads us to jump one frame before the bumping jump frame.
