	"This was certainly a tough game to do.  There was more manipulation of boss luck then I'm willing to admit, especially during the kitchen boss.  But I'm very happy with how this turned out.

	"One thing to note is why I avoid some tokens in the first 3 worlds, this is so I don't trigger a bonus game after each boss.  If you collect more than 4 tokens then any boss you complete (besides the last robot boss and the TV boss) will trigger a bonus game to win extra lives.  The cutscene takes about 10-15 seconds so it’s just faster to slow down and avoid collecting any tokens.

	"probably the toughest boss I've ever had to deal with.  there's a small chance you can hit the boss right before the pot returns, this causes the boss to fall over again.  however a side effect to this is the collision on the pot doesn't go away, so it's moving back and forth on the same plane as the char.  if you see me jumping for seemingly no reason, that's why.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Another thing is the position of the boss.  When you knock him over, the pot goes into the background and has to touch both sides of the wall before returning,  I can manipulate the boss to be on the far end of the screen so the pot has to take the longest route before returning, this makes me able to get so many hits on him than normal.
