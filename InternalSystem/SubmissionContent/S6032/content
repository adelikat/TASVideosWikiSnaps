	"One thing to note is why I avoid some tokens in the first 3 worlds, this is so I don't trigger a bonus game after each boss.  If you collect more than 4 tokens then any boss you complete (besides the last robot boss and the TV boss) will trigger a bonus game to win extra lives.  The cutscene takes about 10-15 seconds so it’s just faster to slow down and avoid collecting any tokens.

	"Another thing is the position of the boss.  When you knock him over, the pot goes into the background and has to touch both sides of the wall before returning,  I can manipulate the boss to be on the far end of the screen so the pot has to take the longest route before returning, this makes me able to get so many hits on him than normal.
