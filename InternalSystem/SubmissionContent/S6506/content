	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Tempo|href=/32M)
	" released only in Japan for the Sega Saturn.  I started this TAS when the Mednafen saturn finally could emulate it soon before porting to BizHawk.  Prior to this the game was only a black screen on the mednafen core and of course on Yabause.

	"Unfortunately, getting points increases the length of the movie since there's a score tally.  Getting any points at all in a level is far worse since then you get to win an item at the end of the level.  So a lot of stategy revolves around minimizing score.  Unfortunately the game is very generous with giving you points and it isn't so easy to avoid them

As has been pointed out by the audience, the game is fairly slow too. The audience response was rather divided, but I feel that the criticisms regarding pacing are too much to overlook.
