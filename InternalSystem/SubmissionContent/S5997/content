	": Since this game is well programmed I couldn't find anything like corner clips to get some sort of boost in speed. I also noticed the owl in level 6 giving exactly one reason this submission has to turn left. I tried seeing if there was some way to avoid that but the best I got was not holding right for a brief bit to avoid the owl that only tied the submission time. Not slowing down results in running into that stupid owl. Curse that owl. Otherwise optimization for this game is pretty straightforward and solid here.
