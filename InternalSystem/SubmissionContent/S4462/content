Someone can't shoot down (guess who) and someone can't shoot up like enemies from windows so some guys survived again. I took Laser Gun because I just didn't have enough ammo to kill the enemy attack (first boss). After walking on the rooftop, we go down on the top of another elevator and meet a new kind of enemies - flying robots. They decrease the energy during the contact. One of them pushed me down and disappeared after a while. Then we meet another guy written in Paint who repairs the robot and runs away when the enemies appear. My try to talk to him crouched didn't bring the success! Anyway, I allowed the robot to shoot some times so it showed its usefulness or otherwise I wasted 5 seconds looking at the repairment. On the way to the boss I didn't take any weapon because with flamethrower and rocket launcher I kill the boss 4 frames later.

There I decided to play in pacifist again because there no ability to destroy all the enemies like in other similar shooters. I had improved the boss fight twice before I got the fastest tactic. If he was slower, I'd make some more point blanks.

	"In the Church I tried to take as less damage as I could. Laser Gun wasn't taken to save time. New add-ons are stairs and door that require keys. Who jumps up the stairs and goes through the steps?? Even RoboCop 1 for NES has more realistic animations! Anyway, its used to save time. I tried to bypass the door performing all possible actions and cut the route to the first door (fall down), but nothing helped! Funny that you can jump once after the falling if you haven't reached the floor, but no more second jump (taking damage didn't help too)! The boss is too easy: he can't damage you if you are too close to him, but you somehow can't use your weapons.
