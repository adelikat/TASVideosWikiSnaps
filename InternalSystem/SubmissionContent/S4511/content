	"This movie takes advantage of a bug in the dialogue handling that was discovered by accident during a live streamed playthrough. Under certain conditions, the game will erroneously present a dialogue choice allowing the player to skip to unrelated parts of the game script, which is used to skip to the "The End" screen. This shaves more than 40 seconds from the previous

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"If the selling menu is opened with the initial cursor position past the end of the menu, you can sell an empty inventory slot and get paid for a Griffin Helm. This is possible because the selling menu does not save the cursor position when leaving the menu. Therefore, at first a candy and a chocolate is bought. The inventory menu is brought up and the cursor moved to the chocolate. Both items are then sold. It is then necessary to open the shop menu to populate the menu with items. Then, the selling menu is opened again. The menu will always be rotated so that the initial selection comes first, and this procedure assumes that a menu contains at least one item. One therefore overflows into the old items from the shop menu. These item positions all correspond to empty slots in the inventory, with the invalid item code $1F, which sells for 29666 GP.

[p 
	"If a script is triggered on a specific frame following the disappearance of a status message from the screen, and the script displays the player's money before printing anything else, the game will instead give an invisible prompt using the last parameters. Entering the save menu will clear the number of options, allowing underflowing to option 256 by pressing left. After making a choice, both the jump table pointer and the script pointer will point to the selected entry in the jump table. Furthermore, if this location contains text rather than a script command, the game will continue giving invisible prompts. The table pointer is also used to point at the tables for printing names of enemies, equipment and spells.
