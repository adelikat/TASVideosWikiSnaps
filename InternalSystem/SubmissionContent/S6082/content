	"It's been quite a while since I made the first version of this TAS. I figured that since I didn't have access to current tools like TAStudio, there might have been some small mistakes in my older runs. It didn't take long after looking over it again to start finding improvements. But I was surprised at how many I actually did find. The total frames saved was 2619. Not only were new tricks discovered, but entire new routes in many stages were found to be faster.

[p 
	"Temporary encode of the new improvements:
	$LF
	(youtube|v=o8P_rqDiWX8)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Let's start off talking about the basics of the game again. In each stage, Tinhead must collect a star before he is able to exit a stage. Entering a teleporter without the star will not accomplish anything. Tinhead fires small round metal ball projectiles from his head. The direction in which they are fired can be changed by pressing A (this is shown by the indicator at the top of the screen in the shape of an arrow). Like most things in this game, there are frame rules between how often you can change the direction of your shots. In this case, 10 frames is the limit before you can change again. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There are 3 angles to shoot with. 
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"The Down+Right Arrow
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Your shot will be lobbed in an arc, and will continuously bounce along the ground, and ricochet off of walls. This shot lingers longer than any other shot before it disappears, and is especially useful for hitting enemies below you; if it's timed right, it can fall faster than tinhead will fall. It also has various other uses for hitting enemies in specific situations which the other shots can't reach.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"The Right Arrow
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Your shot will fire straight in the direction Tinhead is facing. It will bounce off of solid objects 180 degrees. It cannot change position vertically, this shot only moves horizontally. When Tinhead is in his basic form, this shot will travel much faster than he can run, so it's useful for shooting down enemies directly ahead of him. When jumping up to higher solid platforms, this shot can be used to get an early hit in on enemies.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" The Up+Right Arrow
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This shot fires diagonally UP+(whatever direction tinhead is facing). That means the shot can either be Up+Left or Up+right. This shot will ricochet off of ceilings (forming a 90 degree angle) making it quite useful for hitting flying enemies and is especially useful for getting early hits on enemies that are standing on semisolid platforms that you must jump to. There's also the odd case where if you shoot directly into the corner of a solid object, it will actually bounce back at a 180 degree angle. This is used once in World 3, and will be explained later.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Now that we have the ways that tinhead can shoot, it must also be noted that there is also a frame rule between shots. You guessed it, 10 frames. With that said, let's cover the powerups. Also, projectiles will disappear from existance as soon as they are off screen, so it is important to keep them on screen if you want to hit anything.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Multi-shot powerups
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"These powerups increase the number of shots that are allowed to exist on screen at the same time. There is also an indicator for this in the top left of the screen. It's the number right next to the arrow of the shot direction from the previous segment. The number indicates how many shots can exist. The powerups come in +1, +2, and +3 varieties. These do not set your shot limiter to that number, but rather increase it by that value. No matter how many you collect, this number maxes out at 5. Generally, you're not going to have many opportunities to have 5 shots on screen at once due to the shot frame rule, but there are a couple of cases where we do. Taking damage not only reduces your HP, but it also reduces your shot counter by 1 each time. You can imagine this is annoying, but in many cases you don't actually need to have that many shots on screen at once.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Health Powerups
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Tinhead's HP carries over from stage to stage as well as from World to World. This means you have to carefully select where to take damage. That's where health powerups come in handy. They come in 2 forms; the battery (canister with lightning symbol), which increases your current hp by 1. This same canister is also used to display your total HP, which is conveniently placed in the top left corner of the screen. Then we have the blue lightning bolt (called Sparks by the manual), which maxes out your health at 5 instantly. These are usually worth grabbing, even if you have to sacrifice a little bit of time to get them. More on why this is will be explained in the next segment. 
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Heart Pieces
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Collecting hearts increases your number of lives. I think we all know what that means. The same icon is used to display said lives in... yes: the top left corner of the screen. These are completely irrelevant for a TAS, because killing yourself must absolutely be avoided. Not only is the respawn time incredibly long, but if you happen to have collected the star for that level, it is now gone. There is no reason to kill yourself in this game.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Points Objects
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Also completely irrelevant, there are many many different types of items that give you points. The most common are the metal orbs, which litter the maps. 
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Bonus Stage Item
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"These take you to a bonus stage, where generally you're given a small room to stock up on powerups and points. You have to teleport into it, in the same manner as entering a stage, and you exit them in the same manner you normally exit a stage, via an exit portal. You can imagine this is really long and not even worth considering. The bonus rooms are timed, if you haven't exited via the portal when the time runs out, it will force you out. Sometimes there ARE transformation powerups (next segment), but you are not allowed to keep them, be it by exiting normally or running out of time. So in essence: these bonus rooms are useless.
	$LF
]p
[h2 
	"Transformations
	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"Now we get into the powerups where this game takes off in my opinion. There are 4 different transformations that Tinhead can undergo, most of which are useful. 
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Hyper-Hopper
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The one exception to the useful powerup rule; this one. This is incredibly slow and awkward and should be avoided at all costs. Unfortunately, world 1 still has 1 location that it must be used, and despite how slow it looks, it is the fastest known way to do that segment. 
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Rocket Pack
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Next powerup seen in the run is the rocket powerup. This one moves fairly fast horizontally, but not as much vertically. I guess now is a good time to talk about horizontal movement in the game. With most powerups, Tinhead actually can move faster to the left than he can to the right. Most of the time he doesn't do this on his own, you have to release your direction for 1 frame and then resume. With the rocket powerup, you can travel left at a speed of -6. Travelling right maxes out at 5 no matter what you do. Controlling this powerup vertically is very awkward, as you do it by pressing the jump button. You naturally float downwards and have to feather pressing and holding jump button for various intervals to increase your vertical speed upwards. It is very sensitive as well, as if you want to just barely fly upwards, you literally only need to press C for a few frames. However your momentum is carried upwards, and there is no fast way to correct it downwards, you just have to let the game carry you down with it's own momentum system.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Gyrocopter
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The next powerup is the Helicopter powerup. This is viewed as the god powerup for the run, as it can fly very fast in all directions (except downwards I guess). Unlike the rocket powerup, this one is not controlled by pressing jump; You only need to use the d-pad to direct it. This makes maneuvering much more accessible as you don't have to wait for momentum to carry you downwards, you can simply press down on the d-pad. This also brings up vertical speed variance, which is very similar to the horizontal one mentioned before. This time, you can travel faster upwards with this powerup than you can travelling downwards. This requires you to release Up for one frame before resuming, increasing your maximum upwards speed from -5 to -6. Downwards speed is always 5.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Unicycle
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The final transformation in the game you will see is the unicycle (yes that's the official name the developers cleverly came up with). This powerup can obtain the highest horizontal speed in the game. Like the other powerups, travelling left has the same speed boosts. During a standard jump to the left, your speed is -4. You can guess what happens if you let go of left for just one frame. Yes: -5 speed. This is actually a very good thing because certain skips were only possible because of this slight increase in speed. Travelling to the right while airborne is set at 4. However, this also works to the left when travelling down slopes. Normally, your speed caps out at 10, but by doing our handy-dandy frame release trick, it now caps at 11. Also it sets our max horizontal speed from -8 to -9. But this only occurs on flat ground after you have descended a slope sadly. If you reach ground by any other means, it still caps out at -8. The final quirk about this powerup is it's used to trigger another variant of our graphical glitch. More on this discussed in tricks section.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"So, with our transformations out of the way, let's talk about Tinhead's basic form for a bit. His speed along flat surfaces caps out at 4 and sliding down slopes, it caps out at 6. Then unfortunately we must talk about his basic jumping. How this passed judgement from a coding and playtesting perspective is beyond me, especially considering the unicycle powerup does not suffer from this same flaw. What flaw? Well as you'll probably notice very early on: Jumping sucks. It MUST be avoided whenever necessary. Sure, when you first start your jump, your speed is fine. However it quickly declines to the apex of your jump, where it reaches the lowest possible speed the game can render: 1. That's right, 1. This also occurs on any ledges you drop down from, and THIS is why I mentioned that health powerups are essential. You want to take as much damage as possible to avoid jumping in your basic form. Something that should be able to be used freely makes management in this game unnecessarily difficult. With that said, let's talk about some tricks that can cut down on this a bit.
	$LF
]p
[h2 
	"Tricks/Glitches
	$LF
]h2
[h3 
	"Right-Facing Ledge Downwards Teleport
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"When you're in basic form approaching a rightwards cliff, pressing left for one frame before a blank frame just as you reach the very edge causes you to slip inside the terrain just a bit. Since the game thinks you shouldn't be there, naturally it lags as it's trying to determine where it can send you. However; Instead of the normal zipping techniques used in many other games, this game searches for a specific terrain tile and sends you there instead. Since the game thinks you're still on top of the ledge, it tries to put you back on a ledge, but it checks beneath Tinhead (for whatever reason) This instantly sends him to the next ledge available that's below. If there is no ledge below it will eject you out the side of the terrain instead. Now why is this useful? Well, as I said before jumping sucks. Being able to instantly teleport to a ledge below (despite the game lagging for a few frames) cuts that entire falling segment out entirely. No frames of falling at 1 speed. Instead you're now on flat ground and you can accelerate to the max speed of 4 in just 4 frames. Yes, your speed increments that fast: 1, 2, 3, 4. Unfortunately (or fortunately if you like not knowing what's going on in the level) this usually breaks the graphics in most cases. It offsets them by the distance you've teleported downward, and in some levels it's done multiple times. So the terrain is likely to get entirely lost in those levels. It also has 1 other instance of significance in world 2. If you're at the correct pixel position when you perform this, pressing right just after the lag frame will actually teleport Tinhead back up to the ledge he started from. How is that useful? Well in that particular level, I needed to grab a rocket powerup that was down the ledge. It just so happens even though you're being teleported you still trigger the item. Instantly teleporting back up allows you to then grab it. I'll explain more on it in the stage notes for that level.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Non-steep slope traversing
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"In the first world, the slopes are very gradual. If you let go of the direction for just 1 frame, you start your sliding animation. This snaps you to a location further up on the slope. If you resume travelling that direction immediately after, you've gained that much distance. Travelling right, you've gained +12 pixels. Travelling left you've gained +10 pixels. That's the equivalent of moving at a speed of 12 for 1 frame or 10 for 1 frame respectively. Of course you can't do this every consecutive frame as doing this usually causes heavy lag. Mitigating when to do it where it doesn't cause lag is a chore, but it's faster to not have the lag there. You can't just muscle your way up every slope like this. It's possible to gain a slight advantage on the steeper slopes seen after World 1, but only at the very top of the slope, and it only saves time if it doesn't cause a frame of lag. Sometimes it doesn't, but most of the time (especially in later stages) it will cause lag. What I'm talking about is doing the trick at the very top, so that when you are advanced forward you are now on top of flat ground. Doing this allows you to not get thrown backwards by the steep slope. Because of this you can only do it 1 time when there's a steep slope and only saves 1 frame every time it's successful.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Slide Cancelling
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"When you slide in your basic form, reaching the bottom will cause a slight skid where your speed will drop considerably. However, if you press left for one frame and then resume pressing the direction you're going you can cancel the skid. The net speed lost from pressing left outweighs the speed lost if you allow the skid to occur.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Unicycle Slope Teleport
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This is similar to the vertical teleport mentioned before, however it occurs horizontally on slopes when you have the unicycle powerup. This can only be done on right-wards facing slopes. In this case when you manage to wedge your hitbox into the slope, the game is tricked and doesn't know which direction you're actually facing. Since the game knows you're inside a slope tile it decides that it needs to check which slope tile to send you to. However, it checks to your LEFT when you're already facing left. It locates the nearest slope tile to the left and sends you there instead. This is an instant teleport and will send you to one as long as there is one anywhere on the same horizontal plane as the slope tile you clipped into. Naturally this trick saves a lot of time as you can travel great distances instantly. If there is no relevant slope tile to the left the game freezes in infinite lag frames because it knows you're inside terrain but can't decide where to send you. This is not advised. 
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Powerup Cancelling
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Powerups can serve as an extra hit of damage of sorts. While it's usually not beneficial to take damage with them, sometimes it's forced by the stage layout or used to cut out the long animation when you enter the exit portals. Also, taking damage in this form does not reduce your HP value or your Shot counter; It simply removes your powerup. I take advantage of avoiding the exit portal animation whenever there's a relevant source to take damage near enough to the portal. The animation lasts just as long as when you first collect the powerup, so you can see why we want to avoid it.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"The Duck Shot
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"I promise no ducks were harmed in the making of this movie. Instead, ducking allows you to shoot just a bit lower with the straight shot than you would normally be able to. This is used to hit small enemies that are low to the ground or otherwise awkward to jump over. As a general rule, most enemies that take 3 or less hits to defeat are best just killed instead of jumped over. And any that require 4 or more hits are best jumped over or damage boosted through. Usually.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Faster Magnet Sliding
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"With some new routing in most stages, there's actually very few places I actually use the magnets in World 4. The magnets behave like.. magnets. If Tinhead jumps too close to them he gets his head stuck to them, but he can still slowly slide his way back and forth along them. You can also drop down from them. But the trick here is pressing L+R just as your slide is about to halt. This allows you to perform a second slide almost instantly, and saves time in a very similar manner to the Slide Cancelling trick.
	$LF

	"....I think that's about it for any major tricks. The rest is just routing and platforming optimizations for the most part, so let's get on to the stage commentary.

	"But before I do that, I have something else to add! I promise we'll get there. Due to emulation differences I start off the run behind the previous publication.

The only way to avoid this would be to find some glitch to clip completely through floors or walls.

Since the object that contains the newly discovered rocket powerup is between tinhead and the floor below, the only way to get it normally is to fall and go all the way around and ride that escalator-esque moving platform back up. That's slow, but luckily the double teleport is not, and somehow the item gets triggered on the way down. I'll take it.

That's all I've got to explain this bizarre phenomenon. Sometimes if you move right after your jump it will change before you jump. But if you just jump straight up it won't.

This is in contrast to the old method of damage boosting to the left and using the slingshot to reach that ledge.

It saves around 20 frames or so. The improvement is to just fly directly into the exit portal and the rocket de-transformation begins.

This ensures I can gun down the first phase of the boss sooner. Not to mention that the previous attempt that did not kill this egg resulted in the second phase of the boss freezing infinitely. For what reason I can't even begin to say. Probably something stupid. But let's talk about the second phase, it enters from the top of the screen also. This is yet another reason why I hastily rushed up to the top so I can begin shooting at it as early as possible. Oh and the first phase of the boss has 32 hp.

It's just some design choices, the basic jumping mechanic that should have been the first thing the developers worked out. Instead we get this super awkward momentum-killing jump which often times leads to missed gaps or falling directly into a pit of spikes. Of course it's not as much of a problem in a TAS, besides making the game take longer to complete, but for casual play it's very awkward. Not to mention the hitboxes for tinhead and most obstacles are huge, and the game overall plays just a bit too herky-jerky.
