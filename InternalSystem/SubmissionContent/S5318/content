	"Hudson Hawk is a short platforming game loosely based around the movie of the same name. There are 3 levels which you hop your way through to find a treasure at the end, dodging obstacles and defeating enemies as you go.

	"I decided to play this game since I saw it both in the SDA runs without a TAS page as well as the TASMania spreadsheet. It looked short and fast so I gave it a try. Overall it's a pretty simple game but does require a bit of luck manipulation and strategy.

	"Some tricks to look out for are the punch-jump, where you can get a lot of extra hgeight by timing jump inputs just right on top of a punch animation, jumping through croughing areas, and hopping wherever practical which saves a little time with each jump.

	"There isn't much to say about each level overall. Level 1 was the most involved in trying to optimize the lasers and the gas jets, the other two levels were just a lot of running and jumping.
