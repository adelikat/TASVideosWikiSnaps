	"Look at that, a new improvement! It took so long before I found a possible way to beat the other TAS. I knew it was possible to beat, but wanted to beat it HARD. And I did it. This run started when I tried a 100% run RTA. I discovered the tailor parent gives 800 gils (money of the game) pretty easily. With that in mind, I managed to route my money with an all new perspective.

[div class=p 
	"First of all, I choose the Lilty tribe, like before. This race has the most strength, which saves a lot of time. Like I said, I choose a tailor father, who gives me a letter I have to answer and give a gourd potato to please him. Fortunately, we have free gourd potato in our inventory! At the end of the third dungeon, he will send us 800 gils. In second dungeon, the Mushroom Forest, I need to farm a bunch of money to get early Warrior's Weapon, which increase my strength by 10. Also, like most of the dungeons, I manipulate the bonus conditions to get enough points for a good strength artifact. Strength artifacts are the only ones picked this run.

]div
[div class=p 
	"In Tida (fifth dungeon), I only have to pick up one worm antennae, for a value of 500 gils. This is because, this time, in my route, I take the remaining money in the seventh dungeon, Mushroom Forest cycle 2, where I also drop the Master's Weapon scroll used to forge the weapon. The reason it's worth is I want to get to 135 points to get a +3 artifact. I get 1 point per ennemy killed and per item/gil collected. It looks long, and almost eat all my timesave, but it's because it replaces Tida's worm antennaes farm. Also, this will help us get to 75 strength at Vellenge (last dungeon), which will make the last bosses extremely faster. The other drops of myrrh goes like my precedent TASes.

	"I use many meats in my run. They give +2 strength and help getting to the multiples of 5 (5, 10, 15, 20, etc) to make me deal more damage. I use a total of 6 meats (or fishes), but I only start with 3. I drop some for free in Cathuridge Mine, Veo Lu Sluice cycle 1 and Veo Lu Sluice cycle 2 (respectively dungeons 3, 6 and 14). For Meteor parasite, third to last boss, I found out Warrior's Weapon is faster despite of it being 5 strength less, so I switch weapon, which saves a lot of time too.

	"This time, not that much! Obviously there is RNG, with godlike/impossible RNG I could save at most like 5 seconds. There is no known mistake in this run, and I'm very happy of the result. The only way to possibly beat it would be to find skips. But unfortunately, this game is pretty well programmed and not much useful has been found.
