	"Greetings, fellow TAS lovers. It takes you 2 years to finish probably the GREATEST SMB RUN EVER, which is the improvement of 209 frames (3.48 seconds) over my previous SMB warpless TAS you're seeing at the moment.

		]b
		": This special glitch was found by me while TASing -2 stage of my "-3 stage" run, and made the main improvement of this movie. Manipulating the right fish was truly a disaster, and if it weren't for Mars's help, I don't know how long I could carry on for.
		[br

		[br 
		]br
		"Cheap Cheep-cheeps flying around the screen with barely any law to be followed through the whole level can make anyone crazy, not to mention that I had to complete the stage as entertaining as possible. Luckily the perfect fish in stage 2-3 can be got without slowing down, and I was able to manipulate the same fish using several completely different combinations of killing, which is strange because the randomness of this level was more regular than I thought. Unfortunately, the situation in 7-3 was much worse due to Koopa Troopas. Just before I was celebrating the great completion of 7-3, another improvement in 7-1 came up to me, saving 42 frames from which didn't make me happy at all.
		[br 
		]br
		" 
		[br 
		]br
		"The only problem left is: is there any chance to save 105 frames using this glitch. After hundreds of times of self practicing, my answer is: hardly. Supposing that there really were such absolutely perfect fish, they should conform to the following properies: 1. possibilities to manipulate without slowing down; 2. max X speeds; 3. highest flying altitudes; 4. abilities for usage. Fish of those properties would be so rare like meeting aliens at daytime. Maybe we could build up some kinds of functions about movements of all Cheep-cheeps, or use powerful machines to strictly prove whether there are possibilities to save 21 more frames. But I don't consider it worthwhile to do that, for I'm more willing to believe that it's impossible, and that's it I guess.

			"New route using Buzzy Beetle shell glitch in 7-1, 42 frames were saved
		]b
		": It's a strange idea tested before I was making warpless TASv3, I remember clearly that it was almost as fast as using flagpole glitch and bullet glitch, so it has been discarded. During the two years I've been retesting lots of crazy ideas, and turned out this one worked like a charm.
		[br

		" 
		[br 
		]br
		"The Buzzy Beetle shell glitch is a lot like the shell glitch used in 3-1, except the beetle is 1 block closer to downstairs, which requires further anti-screen-scrolling. Well there's no vine in 7-1, how could you deliver yourself to the right edge of the screen? Through pipe crossing. Pipes, the best and only solution, since there's no wall and no straight cut to the ground. It takes a player two pipe crossing and one cannon crossing to successfully reach the beetle on time, and it saved 42 frames with only 2 frames ahead of the frame rule. I'm glad to see the shell glitch I invented put into use not only in 3-1 but also in 7-1. Even though it does seem kind of sad to loose the joy of continuously stomping the Buzzy Beetle while awaiting the Bullet Bill, I still expect you to accept this improvement for another big step to speed limit.

			"Going through the floor in 1-3 and 5-3, 0 frame was saved

		": Another highly difficult movement considered impossible was achieved by me this time, by extremely precisely jumping. Bouncing on a red Koopa Troopa is similar to using a green one in 3-2 for example, except memory watching and calculating is necessary, owing to the lack of speed. It's a pity that the new route cannot save time (usally 1 frame slower the instant time counting to 000), but it did add a lot of entertainment to the run. By the way, the glitch was well put in use in Mars's SMB warpless walkathon, having saved lots of time, but he forgot to give me credit for opening up this special route.

		": I had been really unlucky, because every time I arrived at 6-4 there were always lag frames waiting for me. Bowser must be so mad for my skipping castles so often, so this time, he threw out a large quantity of hammers as a welcome gift, and I can't even avoid one lag frame in a distance. Thanks to this glitch, I'm able to reduce the number of lag frames from 7 to 3, which is the best I can do but unfortunally still 2 more than my last run. Although the mad bowser could be killed with 3 fireballs instead of 4 shown in this run technically, there's no chance for any one of the 2 fireballs fired before seeing that guy to hit him with double firepower (thousands of times proved by myself), otherwise the lag frames can be cut down to one or two.
