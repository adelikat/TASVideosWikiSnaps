[p 
	"The game uses some animation-cycle-based speed table instead of real subpixels for walking, jumping and falling. 
	$LF
	"By combining with them when going forward, sometimes even with intentional stops in-between, Francesca can advance faster than just walking forward. 
	$LF
	"The optimization is complex and has to be tested according to the ambient circumstance.

]dl
[p 
	"The game handles horizontal movements with the Broom differently when the screen is scrolling or not.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When the screen is scrolling, riding on the broom will always scroll the screen at the constant speed 1 pixel-per-frame (ppf), 
	$LF
	"which is slower in most areas except underwater (everywhere in Act 3 except the first one) where Francesca can only walk in the same slow speed.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When the screen is not scrolling, the speed of Francesca and the speed of the Broom are accumulated, and this way to move is faster than most of any others.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The game tries to make riding easier by zipping Francecsa up onto the Broom, but if she is still ascending when landing on the Brrom, the Broom will instantly disappear and she will stsrts to fall down. 
	$LF
	"This mechanism poses both a chance to short-circuit a jump near the ground as well as a challenge to set up the right height for a riding.

[p 
	"In Act 2 the physics is modified to simulate a slippery feeling on icy surface, which actually applies everywhere.

]p
[p 
	"Sliding on the ground is faster than optimized walk/jump loops, and even faster than zipping in narrow with the Broom when going to the right but not to the left.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Sliding also make it possible to continueously getting ejected to the direction inside walls, aka. the famous "wall zipping".

[p 
	"The game eject Francesca horizontally at 8-pixel boundaries inside walls. 
	$LF
	"The direction is mostly decided by the last presses on the D-pad as well as her falling/landing states according to the tiles surrounding her, which is quite complex. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Generally, the game tries to eject Francesca backward if a press on the D-pad was made previously in her "landing" state, 
	$LF
	"whereas it's still much free to zip to the left other than to the right as the game checks for tile collisions from the left to the right for every row. 
	$LF
	"The latter is usually by blocked by the need to press Right on the D-pad in order to move past the 8-pixel boundary to the right, 
	$LF
	"but by opening up the weapon selection menu, one frame of the D-pad press may be ignored and Francesca can then zip to the right for one frame.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There is also a complex to enter upper-right corners 8-pixel to the right direction with tricks involving alternating the falling/landing states as shown many times in Act 2.

[p 
	"In the underwater part of Act 3, she can simply zip without the Broom in narrow passages thanks to the modified jumping physics.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In most areas this trick won't save time compared to optimized walk/jump loops due to the requirement for jumps to position the Broom at the right place and the and the slow starting afterward.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"However, since the game developers never intended for the wrapping, they didn't put any real tiles in the out-of-bound rows, 
	$LF
	"whilst the game still tries to calculate collisions there misinterpreting the wrong data as tiles. 
	$LF
	"The resulted outcome is that there are invisible "holes" and "spikes" in such rows,
