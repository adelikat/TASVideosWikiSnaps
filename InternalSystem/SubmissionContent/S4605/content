	"Hi everyone,
	$LF
	"This is a TAS of the first loop of the NES video game Zunou Senkan Galg (J). Very simple run of destruction using warp. I hope you like it. The run is stopped at the end of the normal warp (the first loop in this game)

	"Happy pixel to you

	": First off this run does not complete the game, as there is a way to reach a final boss and then the end credits. Secondely, the execution was poorly made, most looks like it was probably done in real time. A lot of missed shots, not killing all enemies that you can and you take unneccesarly long time to grab the warps. I will therefor reject this.
