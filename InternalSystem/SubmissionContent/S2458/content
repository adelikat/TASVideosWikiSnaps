While the grappling hook is being thrown and the hero on the elevator of course, it is possible to move the elevator upward or downward and thus makes it possible that the grappling hook is fixed farther on the roof for a better swing or for just a simple swing at all, since there are some places where the hero were just walking in previous movie.
