	"Assignment: Ada, also known as Ada the Spy in some Japan, is a non-canon minigame featured in Resident Evil 4 unlocked after completing the game. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The minigame's plot involves Ada collecting a number of plaga samples as ordered by Albert Wesker (as opposed to collecting the single control plaga sample like in the main game). Ada does so and then reports back to Wesker that the mission was completed. She also states that Krauser was killed despite the implication that he had actually survived.

	"Although the plot is non-canon, it is interesting to note the ending scene has one of the biggest allusions to Resident Evil 5 in that Albert Wesker talks about "Significant changes in our world".

	"The game begins at the beginning of the island at Wharf A and ends at the Communications tower. The item layout on the map has been reworked for the minigame and pesetas and treasures are not found or used at all. The player must find the five samples of the Las Plagas parasite which are marked on the player's map. The only enemies featured are Ganado militia, Gatling Men (aka J.J), and Jack Krauser as the "boss" in the final area the player must defeat to get the last Plaga Sample.

[div class=p 
	"The minigame is relatively short and is meant to be completed in one play-through as there are no save points during it. Ada starts the game with 6 & 2/4 Bars of health and has a slightly faster movement speed than Leon. The Plaga Samples Ada must collect take up space in the inventory instead of the Keys & Treasures menu.
