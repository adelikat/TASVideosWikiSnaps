	"I managed to improve this again pretty much. Thanks to Mr. Kelly R and Blechy for pointing out some mistakes I did. My previous version was nearly perfected but back then I didn´t knew that select (!!) could move the cursor around the screen at an incredible speed.

	"Also, if anyone cares, the re-record counter is wrong. Back at my parents place I managed to get the re-recordings from my old version into this right in the beginning of the movie. This happend when I was comparing my previous version with this. But then I already had done some stuffs in the game I din´t wanna redo. I think the correct re-record number in this version is ~2000 less or something. Just wanted to point that out ;) It doesn´t make any difference really.
