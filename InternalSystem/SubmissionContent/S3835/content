	"This run was the result of a PM + several other people who unintentionally motivated me to investigate further for more improvements. Every part of the run excluding the demo has been improved, and as a result, the TAS resembles almost nothing like a normal run.

	"Remember in the previous run, I go to the next room to corrupt the save? That was because if I did it in the first room, I would go OoB and the game would respawn me back to the beginning. Well, this time, I managed to strike moe without getting respawned, saving 189 frames compared to the published run. Given the length of this movie's input, that's quite alot.

	"2 frames were saved due to better positioning, allowing me to strike the boss 1 frame earlier for botth first two attacks. I also discovered a way to keep the boss still, so the last 3 hits were easier to do.

	"In the current TAS, I proceed to reset the game following the first hit. In this run, I hit him twice before doing so. Why twice? Well, after the 2nd hit, he'll go off screen and shoot fire at you, wasting frames. Oh, and hitting him like this is faster than resetting 4 times.
