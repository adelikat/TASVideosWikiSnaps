	"In this Game Boy Color adaption of the second game of the LEGO Island trilogy, Pepper must travel to different Islands in an RPG-like fashion, to find and capture The Brickster. Throughout the game you may encounter a few boss battles, and even stealth segments. This game is also known as "Bad RNG Island 2" especially for those who casually collect the trading cards in the game.
