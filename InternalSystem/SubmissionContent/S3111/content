	"When playing back this movie, be sure to go into the Mupen Save folder, and delete the ROM's .EEP file (aka Mupen's version of RAM) or else you will get a desynch. From what I now, this version of mupen may cause crashes on Linux, since the reset command doesn't work. Of note: This version of mupen resets the emulator itself, rather than just the ROM. If you see Mupen shut down and reload, be calm.
