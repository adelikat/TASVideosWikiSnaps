	"CD-MAN is a DOS game created by Creative Dimensions in 1989 and updated in 1992.  It would have been just your basic run-of-the-mill Pac Man clone, except for one  aspect: you could choose your game speed.  The options ranged from the mind-numbingly slow "Zzzzz..." to the literally impossible "Warp".  In fact, they made "Warp" so fast, that it is safe to argue that no one in history has ever beaten even the first level at that speed.  This TAS makes history by finally beating not just the first level, but all five levels, twice each.  And all in less than 2.5 seconds of actual gameplay.

I'm sure a couple frames could be saved on better route planning, especially on the first couple levels where I was still getting the hang of things.  I do think I did a pretty decent job overall, and I'm satisfied with the result.  If anyone wants to start a frame war over this, they're welcome to it.  I won't be responding, as the amount of manual work to TAS this game isn't worth the few frames of savings for me.

	"The Warp speed setting used in this TAS is absurdly fast at JPC-RR's default settings; in games like 
	(__wikiLink|/2247M|2247M)
	", even a high speed remains watchable and does not alter gameplay under TAS conditions. The speed is so fast that movement is significantly restricted and affects strategy in the TAS; TASing it on a slower emulated system would have more freedom of movement, while a faster system would limit movement even more. This makes TASes done on slower/faster emulated systems and different speed not directly comparable.
	$LF

[p 
	"To avoid these issues for future movies of this game, TASes of CD-Man should use a system speed setting that is equal or slower than JPC-RR's defaults; the default setting is CPU Frequency Divider = 50.
