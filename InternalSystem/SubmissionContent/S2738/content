	"Hook is a licensed NES game that is based on the movie of the same name. In this game you control Peter Pan and you have to go from stage to stage collecting items. It is a somewhat non-linear game as there are divided paths on the map screen. The map screen setup only enabled me to skip one level and that was a flying stage. You have to collect a certain number of items in order to complete a stage. You also have to collect four special items (clock, magic sword, horn, and a tooth) in order to advance to the next path on the map screen.

	"There is a glitch where if you land on the ground at the same time you get hit by an enemy or projectile, you can actually fall through the floor. Another way to do this is by standing near a wall and face the pirate while he's stabbing you. You don't even need to do anything (you can do this in real time too) and you will end up going into the wall and falling through the floor.
