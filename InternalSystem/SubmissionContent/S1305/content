[div class=p 
	"The cross is meant to hit strong enemies (such as bosses)once then pass through them. Funny thing about the cross is that by hitting two enemies on top of one another, it is actually possible to make the cross hit three or more times in one pass. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"This technique is used on that knight enemy at the start of level 2, the bone dragon in level 4, the mummies and on Dracula. In the example of the knight, the cross hits the knight first, then the cross hits the bat, then the knight again. Once the cross hits a second target (bat),it can hit the first target (knight) again so long as the cross is still inside the knight’s hit box. It is as if the cross has been reset to yield damage to a target it previously hit one or two frames ago, but the programmers neglected this error.

[div class=p 
	"The mummies both have a lot of HP, so throwing a cross at them once they are close together makes each mummy reset the cross’ strike on the other mummy over and over and over again. This tactic yields massive damage in a very small amount of frames. Hence, the mummies can be killed solely with 2 crosses because they take 2 damage (from their collective HP address) each and every frame that the cross is inside both their hit boxes. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"It was possible to throw crosses at the mummies before I did, but each frame that a cross hits a mummy, it prevents the mummy from moving along his course for one frame thus preventing the mummies from moving together at the first possible moment. Also, both mummies need the same amount of HP in order to die at the same time using only the cross. One would have to hit the last mummy for the same amount of HP as the difference of the mummies' HP once one mummy dies.
