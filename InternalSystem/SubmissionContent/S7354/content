	"This is an improvement to the current publication by Arc by beating the final boss faster. If you collide with the boss, you will stop moving to the left, this will make the boss out of reach after you punch him, so you will lose your punch power. However, it turns out you can move to the right in between punches, so that you can start punching him earlier and moving him towards the wall without getting stuck. This movie is about 40 frames slower getting up to the boss due to RNG differences, but is console verified.
