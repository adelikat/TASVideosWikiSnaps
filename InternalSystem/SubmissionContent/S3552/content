Therefore it was a balance of finding the combination that would finish the quickest with the correct group of people selected as the character.  It turned out that Scarlet accusing herself was the quickest, though Mr. Green accusing her was very close.

This like Monopoly tries to aim for the fastest ending. However unlike Monopoly, the run isn't as entertaining where we get to see the computer force itself to defeat with amazing luck manipulation.
