	"The people/weapon/place are determined based on the frame number alone, no matter what order i pick my characters or which characters I use, the correct things will always be the same if I click "Start Game" on the same frame.  Therefore it was a balance of finding the combination that would finish the quickest with the correct group of people selected as the character.  It turned out that Scarlet accusing herself was the quickest, though Mr. Green accusing her was very close.

	": This game still isn't that great nor all that interesting. However it's not even half a minute long, and therefore doesn't need much to keep an audience captivated. This like Monopoly tries to aim for the fastest ending. However unlike Monopoly, the run isn't as entertaining where we get to see the computer force itself to defeat with amazing luck manipulation.

[p 
	"All this being said, this run is well planned and luck optimized in aiming to force the fastest ending, and after several submissions this one is quite optimal. Since the audience response is quite good, and the murderer starts of with a funny admission, I'll accept this.
