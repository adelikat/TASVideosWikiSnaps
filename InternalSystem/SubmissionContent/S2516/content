	"Questions you guys might ask is why take damage on ninjas, ninja always can hit batman before he can hit ninja. They also deflect batarangs. Another question might be why did I wait for second stage boss to move to left side of screen, trying to hit him without getting hurt is very hard to do so I didn't have enough health to start attacking him right away. You might also ask why I used batclaw up against nothingness, I use it whenever I get chance to, because they prevent decreasing movement speed in air.
