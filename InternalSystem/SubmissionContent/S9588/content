	"FractalFusion worked on this level, so I'll let them give a more detailed explanation in the submission thread, but the main thing you need to know is that many of the starting seeds result in an infinite loop that never beats the level (presumably because of a coding error or oversight). By exiting and starting the level at different frames, we can alter the starting seed and end input early, beating the level after 64 attempts and 8 more minutes of repeatedly dying and waiting.
