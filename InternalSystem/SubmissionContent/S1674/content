	":  This is an entertaining movie that got nice voting results.  However, it is has too many improvements to justify publication.  You have stated that 1-2 minutes could be saved and mmbossman seems to be confirming it.  However, I do "accept" the game as suitable for TASing.  I look forward to an improved version.
