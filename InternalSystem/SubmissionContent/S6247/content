	"It's simple flying game where you control a warplane. Your objective is to destroy all existing rockets, cross a small wavy maze and reach the exit ("END" line).
	$LF
	"There are 4 skills (referred to as difficulties). The higher skill you choose, the more aggressive environment you face. Outside the maze, your only enemies are hot-air balloons. If you stay for too long, they will "try" to fly into you. Inside the maze, you face a dripping blob, sparks (or stars, or flashes) and balls. They act by their patterns.
	$LF
	"Everything you touch destroys the plane.

	"It seem to be an infinite game. There are 3 flights shown in the TAS on Skill 4. After 3rd flight nothing changes, so I would say it's the maximum possible difficulty in the game. You can just copy the input of Flight #3 and complete further levels.

	"Since the game is not that complex, there is a trick that allows to destroy 2 rockets in the furthest place from your starting point without destroying walls that protect them. Normally the unbreakable walls absorb your bullets if they touch them, but there are spaces that don't do that. 
	$LF
	"The mechanic of shooting uses your warplane as a starting point and then scrolls flying bullets to the edge of the screen (the distance is limited, of course). That means that, by accelerating your plane and shooting at right moments, you can shot through the unbreakable walls.

	"Unfortunately, I can't use this trick to destroy the middle rocket because of a small building next to it that makes the distance too long for my projectiles. Also, it doesn't work with red walls you have to break because they have bigger hitboxes and catch projectiles when they are close.
