	"There are 2 parts to this game.  The penguin and the joker.  Both are independent from each other and either can be picked from the start.  This TAS completes the penguin version.

	"I picked the disk version of this game instead of the tape version.  Mostly because the tape version load times are several minutes slower (and the disk is already several minutes of load times).  I used a cracked version of this game because, well, that's what you do with Commodore 64.  Uncracked versions aren't easily used because of copy protections, and are hard to find. The common disks out in the wild seem to be cracked ones.  The only effect this has on this TAS is that you see a bit of black screen where I skip the cracked game screen.

	"I get the minimum items necessary to beat the game.  The most annoying to skip is the flashlight since Penguins Mansion is completely black without it. In addition to route planning, the main consideration is luck manipulation.  The one main enemy that keeps chasing you (sadly I don't know his name, I just call him the asshole) randomly shows up in rooms and in random places.  Frames are the only way to manipulate this it seems.  Often you spend more frames waiting than you do simply taking damage and moving on.  Also, punching him can be faster than taking a hit in the right circumstances.

	": This run uses the cracked version of the ROM. For the Commodore 64, we allow this, since it's not easy to acquire an uncracked version. The game and goal look good for Vault. Accepting to Vault as a fastest completion.
