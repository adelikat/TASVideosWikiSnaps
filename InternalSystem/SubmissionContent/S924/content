	"Aims: View the credits as quickly as possible, making sure that the second secret level is also unlocked. This requires beating every level up to and including the first secret level without taking any damage (which, in turn, requires that all keys be collected), and also requires beating every minigame (to unlock the first secret level).

	"In Kururin Paradise, the sequel to Kuru Kuru Kururin, the player guides a rotating propellor-like ship through a series of mazes. Unlike Kuru Kuru Kururin, however, this game allows you to speed up the rotation (using the R button), the world map is less linear, and there are minigames that must be completed in order to access the secret levels.

	"To make this movie, I went through the levels sequentially, developing strategies to get through each one extremely quickly. Sometimes it was possible to use, or slightly improve, strategies that I had already developed for use in realtime playing; others required new approaches. The later levels were more difficult to create workable strategies for, as the moving objects meant that I had to adjust my strategies for the position of the objects (which is determined solely by how long the player has been in the level for, and has nothing to do with luck). This should be an entertaining movie because it puts together many amazing and difficult shortcuts.
