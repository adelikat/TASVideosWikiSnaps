	"This part, while seems incredibly easy to do, was one of the most annoying parts of the run because while I could've simply killed everything as early as possible for 99 points (max score btw), that would be boring, so I planned it and manipulated the game to get 99 points at the last enemy.

	[a class=intlink href=/2557S 
		"Duck Hunt
	]a
	" TAS along with many other games without endings like 
	[a class=intlink href=/1407M
