	"After clearing Dragon's Den and coming back to New Bark Town, I must go to the Ecruteak Dance Theater (AKA the Kimono House) to fight the Kimono Girls so I can prove myself. After defeating them, I go to look for the box art legendary of game version I am playing. In HeartGold, you go through Bell Tower to find Ho-Oh, which is really close to the Kimono House, but the problem is that you can only walk while inside Bell Tower, and it has lots of floors, and you also need more repels to be able to advance, which takes time. In SoulSilver, I Fly to Cianwood City and Surf to get to Whirl Islands, but I can actually use the bike while inside of the Whirl Island caves to get to Lugia much faster, and I don't use extra repels. This is ~20 seconds faster.

Before I free the Legendary Beasts, I must do something called

		"In Pokémon HGSS, the outcome of the battles will always be determined when the screen fades to black. It also uses the same RNG formula as before, but because there are lag frames every other frame, I can only look for different battles every 2 frames to manipulate for high damage rolls or critical hits. Even though you can't manipulate the battles like you can do in other games such as Pokémon Emerald, you can pick different kinds of moves in order to manipulate the RNG mid-battle, this can be a non-100 accurate move, a move that can deal a status condition, a non-damaging move, a move with priority, etc. I do this to manipulate some of the fights in my favor. For example, I use Leer on Rival 1 to manipulate a critical hit so I can end the fight in 3 turns. This also means that I can only hit odd or even seeds.
