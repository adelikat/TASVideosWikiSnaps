[p 
	"Countdown control: The cube's number can be manipulated to an extent. By mashing A or B, or possibly holding them, the counting speed can be　manipulated. To decide the first number, by pressing start button in battle setup, it is decided when the battle starts.

	"Double hit bug: In some cases, at least 2 kinds of attack can hit at the same time. It is possible, while avoiding decrease of damage (depending on combo),　the value at which the endurance meter decreases is unusual. Originally, it is possible to avoid the endurance meter becoming 0. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Bomb attack: By using the double hit bug, which is easy to do, the technique does lots of damage. In RAY01's body type, after firing bombs, if the attack is timed well, they can hit at the same time.

		""Despite the amount of efforts you put into this and votes in favor of publishing this movie, I feel the need to reject it. Being labeled as a "playaround", this TAS fails to entertain for its lenght. It is repetitive and doesn't feel like a superplay in many levels. It seems like you first went for an any%, but decided to switch your goals halfway in. You could've switched parts, used more various attacks, wandered around in a funny way while controlling the human character, played around in the credits, etc.
