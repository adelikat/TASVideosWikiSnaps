	"Feasel got me into this game because he was speedrunning this and needed assistance understanding the game mechanics.  So I started researching various mechanics using memory watching and cheats, and the more I studied and understood the mechanics, the more I appreciated the game.  This game is largely misunderstood because it was created in 1984 and uses ideas from that era, but is compared to games made in 1989 because of the late release in the US.  Because I am an old gamer (and I am submitting this on my birthday because it worked out that way) I grew up playing old games, so I appreciate the older game mechanics.  I first worked on the easter egg TAS because feasel found the TAS and I knew it could be improved, but also because it would be easier to TAS than this one.  It was still very difficult, but it was good training for this TAS.  Feasel and I worked on route planning for both the TAS and speedrun, which use different routes, but that is great because it caused many ideas to be considered.  It took over a year, off and on, to get this TAS completed.

I try to distribute the waiting as much as possible so that there are not long waiting periods.  This is done by stutter stepping (a few delays after every step, but on grass only for health recovery).

There are 3 memory locations that are set when loading a game: the tree for fairy 1, the tree monster for fairy 2, and the chest for the key.  I am only interested in fairy 1 and the key since the position for the fairy 2 tree is set when that screen loads.  The best place for the save reload is in the underground since there are fewer sceen loading frames on the reload.  In the sword cave, reloading also resets the wisp positions, which can be useful.  Unfortunately, there were no RNG values that I wanted in that cave, so I ended up using the key cave.  But getting the RNG value from it is tricky and had to be botted.

This is important because it is a useful way to manipulate RNG when grinding, and is the reason I use the 4 corners area of the lake for eel grinding.  If there is a bad spawn, I can clear it by visiting 2 other screens.  It is also why hyper grinding with only 2 screens is difficult.

Since the remainder is not cleared, it means that gaining the level from as close to 99 experience as possible is recommended, especially when the experience for the monster is reduced in the next level.  So obtaining 46-49 experience before the eels is best since they give 50 on level 1 and 2.  This means that the experience is 46-49 when level 3 is obtained (was 96-99 before leveling), so only 6 eels are needed at level 3 instead of 10 (they give 10 experience at that level), which saves time.  The same is true entering level 5, which starts at 6-9 experience, which cuts another eel out (they give 5 experience at that level).  I will explain my leveling choices in the section comments.

So I used the results from the bot testing to manually test getting back outside.  I needed to kill only 2 wisps for 14 experience, and I found an interesting path.  Jim is in attack mode to get to the sword, but when attacking the wisp which happens immediately after (no input done inbetween), it uses the sword damage calculation, which shows the order of operation.  The second wisp's position was also perfect, so the only frames "lost" were the attacking frames for the wisps, so I consider this section perfect.
