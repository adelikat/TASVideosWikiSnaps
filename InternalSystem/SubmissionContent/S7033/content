	"Fushigi no Dungeon: Fuurai no Shiren GB2: Sabaku no Majou, translated as Mystery Dungeon: Shiren the Wanderer: Demon Castle of the Desert, is a roguelike game developed and published by Chunsoft, released back in 6/19/2001. The game follows Shiren the Wanderer, and his talking weasel Koppa. The game was also remade on the DS. It was also only released in Japan, and information is scarce about this game, with whatever out there likely being in Japanese. Luckily, there was 1 RTA run I was able to find of this game, which helped immensely with general strategy.

[div class=p 
	"It's shit. And I don't mean due to a lack of effort, I mean this game is really hard to manipulate luck. The dungeon generation has a separate seed from general RNG, and only advances when needed. So dungeon patterns can only be manipulated by delaying the entry to the dungeon, and since the seed only advances when needed, that means I am manipulating the entire dungeon from the start, rather than being able to manipulate each floor separately. General RNG is also self contained for each dungeon floor, meaning actions in a previous floor will not affect the RNG in the next floor. And you can also expect that, surprise surprise, general RNG also only advances when needed. Thus it's often hard/takes time to manipulate favorable outcomes, and sometimes it's just faster to just accept less favorable outcomes like misses. I also don't really understand how the RNG works in general (it's two separate 32 bit seeds for the Gameboy, these devs really went overboard here), so for testing dungeons, I have to manually test a ton of dungeon seeds until I find one with a decent (and eventually just survivable) outcome. I also realized something; while manipulating for stairs next to me with needed items/enemies (for boss fights) would be fastest, it would take an insane amount of time to find (if possible), and would end of being a little less entertaining than the seeds chosen for this movie, due to the lack of actually playing around enemies and such, along with a long wait before actually getting into the dungeon, so I guess I can consider this slightly a speed/entertainment(/sanity) tradeoff.

[div class=p 
	"I am not kidding you there is an Easter Island rock and it has a password system attached. It so happens that this game decided to have some Easter Island rock in some house that gives items based on some passwords you can give it. How does one obtain these passwords? Some are reportedly in the game, one would be in a Strategy Guide, but the vast majority would be obtained by cards that were packaged with promotional Shiren GB2 potato chips. No I'm not joking they had promotional Shiren GB2 potato chips and they slapped cards with passwords on them. Not like it matters so much anyways. This system can only be used once per dungeon visit. So this effectively limits use of this system for 4 times max, 3 of which are used in this movie. The first time gets a wand which transforms an enemy into a Shiren clone, which other enemies can attack, and the one who defeats this clone gets "leveled up." This is useful for leveling up some enemies which give a ton of exp leveled up (and thus a ton of levels). The second usage just gets some OP Sword, not much to say about this. The third usage gets some strange meat... I sure wonder how this will be useful ;)

[div class=p 
	"The first dungeon of the game happens to just be a tutorial essentially. Run to the stairs, where the RNG is replaced with annoying tutorial textboxes. However, given the obscurity of this game, this is rather nice to figure out and understand the movement, along with other mechanics. Movement is best described as a ping pong table. You can hold B to go fast, but in this faster state you can't stop/turn until you hit a wall or an intersection (or an item or trap on the floor). This leads to rather interesting movement optimization, and sometimes extra steps are taken just due to the mechanics of going fast forcing me to take them. Should also note if you want to keep going the direction you were zooming towards after getting stopped by some item/trap/intersection, you can press another button to re-apply the input. Soon, I also get to understand the general mechanics of text. It's actually rather simple: when text prints, the game doesn't poll input (so you see lag frames), and once the game starts polling input, it waits for 1 frame of no input at all before accepting an A/B/Dpad press to close a textbox. Somewhat annoying as you can't just get auto-fire to handle textboxes... and oh there's a lot of cutscenes in this game, I probably should mention that eh?

[div class=p 
	"You might however notice for the first room the ping pong movement I mentioned doesn't seem to apply? And when I get to town, it doesn't apply either? Well, this ping pong movement is only enforced when in the dungeon (the first room I'm in is technically before the dungeon proper, and the main town isn't a dungeon obviously), outside of a dungeon you can change directions at any time in a dash.

After the first rat is defeated, I take a few extra steps on my way to the stairs, this to manipulate the enemy pattern to be more favorable towards me, and thus only fight 1 more enemy to get to the stairs rather than 2 more.

This is a minor graphical glitch that occurs due to the game keeping the timer interrupt enabled during its check for VRAM accessibility. If the timer interrupt fires after the check passes but before the tile is written, it could cause the tile to be written at a time when VRAM is locked, and it will keep the tile from before.

I let the green blob attack the Shiren clone so it "levels up." This thing pretty much kills me instantly, so I need something to kill it before it can kill me. Conveniently, there are 2 scrolls that are able to do so. Only 1 is needed for this specific instance, but I will be doing this technique again in the next dungeon, so I might as well grab the other one.

This causes some turns of sleep. Once he wakes up, I need to use the wand again. But it has 0 uses, right? Well, remember when I said you can throw items? You can do that with wands too, and it will inflict its effect even with 0 uses left! Assuming it doesn't miss anyways. This miss chance is actually interesting anyways, since this causes an RNG advancement before the random effect is done, so I get a potentially different effect compared to just using the wand typically.
