The federal government, which is the foundation of capitalism and modern civilization, has become nothing less than an insidious idea that corrupts the foundations of society itself.

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Jumping is done via the use of the Jump (2) button. The height is the same no matter how long you hold Jump. Jumping has the unique property to retain Osman's full speed (no other move can do this in the game.) Jumping will also increase your speed if you are not at top speed. There are two types of jump: a standstill jump, and a directional jump. A standstill jump is done by not holding a position while in the first frame of the jump, while a directional jump is the opposite. A standstill jump has the advantage to make Osman's hitbox much smaller, allowing him to enter some walls; this is esssential to some tricks in the run.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Sliding is done by pressing 2 + Down. Sliding starts at a very high speed (almost max) but gradually reduces over time. It is possible to interrupt sliding in two ways: hitting the end of the ground Osman is currently sliding on, or attacking twice while Osman is sliding. The first attack will do a slide attack; the second time will execute a kick; this is known as the carryover kick. If you hold Down while doing the second attack, Osman will do a slide attack reset and reset the slide combo counter (more under "Combo system.")
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The carryover kick has an interesting propriety: during the first frame, it will carry over all (!) of the slide's speed, before going to its intended speed reduction, about 30% of the slide's original speed reduction per second. If you jump during the first frame of a carryover kick, all the speed of the slide will be carried over. This is called an hyperslide and is the best way to get to max speed from a standstill. If you slide again after a carryover kick, a new slide will be initiated with max speed. This is chainsliding, and is the best way to move for either short distances or when an hyperslide is impossible to execute. Note that Osman is also able to change direction very quickly with chainsliding, as the new slide initiated from the carryover kick can be in either direction, irrelevant of the direction of the previous slide.

	$LF

Based on Osman's current combo, he is able to execute stronger moves based on the counter once he presses the Attack button.. Air moves have an independant combo counter, that counts up to 3 before rolling over, however it still increments the normal combo counter. (thus incrementing both at the same time.) While air moves are based on the air combo counter, once Osman lands, the air combo counter resets and he instead relies on the normal combo counter.

To circuvent this, a number of tricks are used to optimise, and it works very well: the game is incredibly optimised, and there is not even a single frame of lag in the entire game, no matter how hard you try to generate it. One of the most notable tricks Osman used for optimisation is using loading points: rather than loading sections of levels at a time, using things like doors or transitions, it loads the entire level, then loads necessary elements at key points; cleverly hidden loading zones in the design itself, leading to a flawless flow of gameplay. These are the loading zones of Osman; when a loading zone is passed, the game doens't load all the elements at once, but rather progressively.
