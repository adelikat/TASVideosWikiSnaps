	"Dark Arena is a Doom-style FPS built from levels submitted by members of the doomworld.com community in 2001. Our protagonist Angelina Bradshaw receives a distress signal from a space station and decides to investigate. She quickly determines that her best chance of survival is to skip everything and go straight to the end, ignoring all enemies and solid walls along the way.

	"The game will crash if you run farther in one direction than the farthest level element in that direction (i.e. once you clip out of bounds, you are stuck in the "quadrant" of the level where you clipped). With all this in mind, the general approach is to find a clip with a fast setup that's as close as possible to the optimal, straight-line path from start to finish. Sometimes multiple clips are required to get into the right quadrant or to cut corners (Stages 3, 14).

	"The final stage is unique because it ends when the final boss is dead, not when hitting the level end pad. The boss takes 100 hits from the energy cannon and is killed from far out of bounds to prevent his AI from activating. This is the only required enemy in the game, aside from the stage 5 boss which is meant to be required but is skipped.

	"This is a redo of a cancelled Dark Arena TAS I attempted several years ago. The game is constantly lagging, and every input changes that lag and RNG in a way that causes the rest of the movie to desync. If you find a faster way to complete a stage, the entire rest of the TAS must be redone from that point. This very quickly becomes very annoying.

	"Optimizing 3D movement is quite difficult, and I am admittedly a novice. There are definitely more frames to shave off some of the levels. However, this game also has features like turn speed acceleration/deceleration and inconsistent lag that often make doing the theoretically optimal movement not possible. Some of the clips require enough precision that strange things must be done to wrestle your character into the right spot with the right angle and speed.
