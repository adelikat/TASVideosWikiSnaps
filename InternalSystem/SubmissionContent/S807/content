	"This is the working version of my Jurassic Park speed run.  I used your snes9x-143-WIP1 emulator to do it and used the Jurassic Park(V1.0) (U) ROM.  I tried other versions of both the emulator and ROM and neither worked, this combination however did.  My objective was to play through the game as fast as I possibly could, completing it 100%.  I used no programming errors or glitches to beat the game, nor did I use warps or passwords.  The game has no password function or save function and must be played from start to finish without turning the system or you'll have to start all over again.  I took damage to save time and in some places I used death to save time.  When inside buildings if you die you are taken out of the building and placed at the entrance.  All of the things you did inside the building are saved, so I used this to my advantage to save time.  This helped greatly in the Raptor Nest.  This run wasn't too hard to make.  Once you memorize your path and the locations of the Raptor eggs it can be done with ease.

	"In this game you play as Alan Grant and are stuck on Jurassic Park.  The comuters are down and dinosaurs are running amok all over the place and it's up to you to right things.  You must survive the island while doing the various tasks that are set for you.  Throughout the game you will be notified by other people on the island of your tasks and other tidbits of information.  You must stop Raptors from breeding, stop Raptors from getting into the Visitor's Center, etc. etc.  Once you have completed the tedious tasks you can call for your helicopter to come get you off the island.  In my opinion the most annoying place is the Raptor Nest, as for it's one gigantic maze.  No matter how much planning I did I could not navigate it without getting lost.  Thankfully I was able to die once I set the Nerve Gas container in the eggs so it would take me out. The ship was annoying too, but not as much as the Raptor Nest because the ship isn't a maze.

	"This run can definately be beaten, especially if you can successfully navigate the Raptor Nest.  The reason why it takes so long to beat this game is because of all the backtracking you have to do.  You have to pick up ID cards to access certain areas and sometimes you have to trek all the way across the island to get a card.  Eliminating as much backtracking as possible would really decrease the time.  I think people will be pleased with the result.  You may notice I bumped into walls and things while indoors, that's because it's so hard to manuver indoors that it is easier to bump into things and move on than to avoid it in some cases.

	": Rejected because of obvious sub-standard playing. Especially the pathing in the top-view could be improved a lot. The FPS parts needs to be made more interesting if this run is going to last for the length it is now. Other improvements have been suggested as well.
