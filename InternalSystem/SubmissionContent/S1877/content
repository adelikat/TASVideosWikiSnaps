	"Here is my improvement to Walker Boh's NES Faxanadu run.  Final time is 23:24, which is 27424 frames, or 7 minutes and 37 seconds faster.  What changed?  The

	":  I die 4 times vs once in the existing run.  The 
	[b 
		"unlimited invincible flying
	]b
	": helps, but only accounts for maybe 60-70s.  The game is long and confusing, so I include a brief plot synopsis, route description, then summarize the time-saving tricks I use.  I tried to add some entertainment by killing monsters at very close quarters and flying/jumping in unexpected ways, but didn't sacrifice any time to do so.  I don't put much stock in re-record counts, but for what it's worth, the count was actually much higher due to splicing and use of separate movie files to optimize individual screens.

	"Many people call this game the best ever put out for the NES.  I wouldn't go that far, but it is one of the most underappreciated having, for 1987, a huge map, lots of secrets to discover, and an extensive storyline combined with excellent graphics, sound and music.

	"World of Trunk:  The Quest of the Springs
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Interesting run where the first thing the player does is die, right?  This is done to refill magic/hp efficiently.  Initial purchasing is exactly like in Walker Boh's run.  I kill everything in my path to maximize gold collection early on.  Even when I have to wait for the jumping cyclopses to fall from the ceiling, it's worth it because I need 2800 golds to buy the wing boots later.  I have to shift screens in the Tower of Trunk to get the secret mattock to appear; this saves about 100s vs going up the tower, but requires replacing the gold acquired there.  Part of this is achieved by skipping the Long Sword; the rest by farming just before town.  My route restarting the springs is markedly faster because I get wing boots from the bees -- a screen I need to visit anyway -- and abuse death.  After dying, I use the wings and obtain the invincibility potion (I shift screens twice to get the latter).  Now, using a trick described later, I can 
	[b 
		"fly invincibly
	]b
	" until I abuse death again at the end of the Mist World.  I harvest 5 wyverns while getting the Ring of Ruby because they give 720 golds apiece and very little experience (letting me avoid the 5s delay of talking a title later).  On the way to the fountain I shift screens once to set up a pair of wing boots in the Mist World.

[h3 
	"World of Mist:  Get the Black Onyx/Ace Key
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This world blows by because I'm invincible and can fly almost the entire time.  I kill a few enemies with very little delay to get up to 4500 golds for the 3 K keys I need.  There; having spent over 10% of the run to this point talking to annoying, repetitive storekeepers, from this point on, money is of no value.  Even though I control its timer, I let the ointment expire just before the boss so I can take damage and die to avoid backtracking.        
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"World of Branch:  Get Battle Suit/Dworf Ring
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Ok; no invincibility ointment for the first part because it's too short and I want to die after getting the Battle Suit to avoid a long backtrack.  I pretty much just run through, avoiding or boosting off of monsters and only killing a few for life.  The spot where I fall down a hole and glide to the right is actually very delicate; to set up the wings I get before the Battle Suit, I need to exit this screen at the bottom right.  This lower route has the advantage of dodgable enemies so it is also faster.  After getting the Battle Suit, I just need to die, but I shift screens twice vertically to set up the ointment for my next life.  I end this life with 1 spell left I had no use for so I defiantly shoot it at the monster which kills me.  After dying, things are simple again; use the wings, get the ointment, and fly invincibly out of the Branch World!
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"World of Evil:  Get the Dragon Slayer and kill the Evil One  
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The final world is simple; I only kill 2 monsters!  They're big ones, though -- my dagger does 5 points of damage, and the last 2 bosses each have 250 hp.  I use my wings to take a big shortcut en route to the first boss (going right to his tower door instead of up and around), saving about 30s over the existing run.  King Grieve, the flying boss, has the annoying property of resetting the ointment counter to zero when you enter his screen.  This, combined with the unbelievable fact that the item timers continue to run during the end scene where the hero greets the King, means that, alas, the ointment expires during this final scene; the annoying message costs me over 3s.

	"Secret items
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Items appear on screen in 3 different varieties.  Some always appear; others appear when the mod 4 counter at $43a is 0.  This second group I call "secret" items; they can show up either when you enter the screen or, more commonly, after you kill all the monsters onscreen.  The counter increments by 1 each time any screen with a secret item is entered.  I take advantage of this, going back and forth to increment the counter in various places via the faster vertical or town screen transitions (35-40 frames vs 85 for horizontal), even when I'm interested in an item on a screen far ahead.  
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Prolong wing boots/ointment time
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The four timed items -- wing boots, ointment, glove and hourglass -- each has its own timer, in seconds.  If the timer reads 255, the item is inactive; if it goes below 0, the item expires.  The timing works by decrementing the counters each time the frame counter at $1a (mod 256) reaches a multiple of 64.  By either pausing or being in a screen transition or menu when these multiples are reached, it is possible to prolong the effects of these items indefinitely.  For example, pause when the counter reads 62 and unpause when it reads 64; only 2 frames need be lost.  Alas, as noted above, some bosses set the ointment counter to 0 while the player does not have control.  While this doesn't immediately expire the ointment (because it can still be kept at 0!), it does mean that as of now it is impossible to kill King Grieve and the Evil One without having the ointment expire when the player meets the King afterwards.  Finally, this trick has an annoying effect on the music in places, especially the guru screens.

	"Battle helmet skip
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Not much to say here.  The Battle Helmet and Battle Suit are both necessary to wield the Dragon Slayer.  However, 
	[b 
		"only
	]b
	" the Battle Suit is required to get the ring required to exit the world of Branch.  AND, to get the ring required to reach the Evil Fortress and beat the game, the game only checks that you HAVE the Dragon Slayer.  So...the Battle Helmet may be skipped, saving about a minute, as long as you don't mind not being able to wield the Dragon Slayer or Battle Suit.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Much more subtle, this was a late discovery of mine.  If you jump above a ladder in a place where either the ceiling obstructs your full leap or there is an enemy you can swing at, the game lets you "fall" part way down the ladder much faster than you can climb down.  This is best demonstrated at the end of Branch and in the Final World (there aren't many down ladders prior to this on my route!)

However, on the last frame of the swing, it is possible to cast a spell in the opposite direction without starting a new swing.  This allows the player to simultaneously attack enemies on both sides, which I use to kill 2 wraiths in Branch.
