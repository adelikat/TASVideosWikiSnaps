	"This is my third attempt at Looney Tunes. I had canceled the first run due to my finding several improvements, specifically in Tweety Stage. The second run improved the old one by 412 frames, but was canceled. In this third attempt, I was able to get through the Speedy Gonzalies Stage without the invincible. I also had the best Bugs Bunny run of the three attempts. I killed a lot of bad guys which caused the same amount of lag as not killing bad guys. I had a perfect run through the mini boss section, and my Elmer Fudd fight was excellent. The Bugs level is the most impressive looking level of the run. this third run saved 319 frames over my second run.

	"As in my first run, I get hit by the baseball to get the speed boost. I discovered that by landing on Sylvester for a brief moment, Tweety gets a brief speed boost. This is used throughout the whole level. Keeping Sylvester with me the whole time was very tricky.
