	"In this Atari 7800 and Atari Lynx title, a boy named Louie is shot in the head and his dog is kidnapped. Furious, Louie travels through a few small portals until he ends up in the Arctic, slays the local abominable snowman, and proceeds to ransack the dog-napper's castle and shoots him plus several henchmen to bits with a gun along the way.
