	"It's clear that a lot of work went into optimizing this run. The standout here was the luck manipulation and how tight and precise it was, but things like the glitched wharf and the route planning were also very nicely done. The game's a bit slow-paced and hard to understand if you're not familiar with it, and the posts in the thread seem to reflect that, so I'm going to hesitantly accept this to the Vault, though I believe it has a very good chance of being promoted to Moons post-publication.
