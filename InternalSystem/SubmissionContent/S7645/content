	"YuYuMD is a 2.5D fighting game featuring a cast of 11 different characters comprised of most of the shows leading characters leading up to the end of the Sensui arc, with a "lane-changing" mechanic similar to fighting games like Real Bout Fatal Fury Special, or platformers like Shantae. Its gameplay style and presentation would largely serve as a base for other fighting games developed by Treasure: sharing extremely noticeable similarities with Guardian Heroes, as well as Bleach: Dark Souls. While a majority of competitive players gather around the 1v1 aspect, an extremely notable feature of YuYuMD was its 4-player Tag-Battle and Battle Royale modes. With very little slowdown during battles, it was touted as an impressive feat for the Mega Drive at the time of its release. During some game festivals, Japanese players will still meet and organize 4-player Battle Royale and Tag-Battle tournaments to this day!

	"If a playaround is not entertaining enough for Moons, it's still tricky to judge its technical quality and whether it's still well-done and can go to 
	(__wikiLink|href=/Playground|implicitdisplaytext=Playground)
	". Arguably, if some variety is still there, and effort behind it can be noticed, it's not so bad. Thought it still doesn't mean that a playaround is meant to generally present the game itself, with dialogs and cutscenes, like a longplay. Speed may not be the main focus, but it shouldn't be outright ignored either. Things that are not related to main gameplay still need to be decently optimized. A lot of advises are given on our 
	(__wikiLink|href=/Guidelines|implicitdisplaytext=Guidelines)
	" page. As mentioned by Spikestuff in the post I linked above, optimality in this movie is still very questionable, in places where entertainment is not a factor.
