	"Since the previous (and first) TAS of this game was made, there have been a few real-time speedruns posted. The current #1 on the leaderboard uses a different route than the published TAS. It collects the magnet before the first visit to the moon. This seemed like an interesting enough idea and it wasn't immediately obvious if it was faster than the published TAS route or not (which only collects up to the scissors). A concept TAS was therefore created based on the RTA route. While it saved time at first, it was incompatible with the lift rides near the end. As a result, the initial time save and then some was lost by having to walk all the way to Wally's bedroom instead of using the lift to skip many of the rooms on the way.

	"The idea of collecting more items before the first lift ride still managed to spark the interest in putting in a new effort to look for possible route improvements. Another (and basically the only remaining) possibility was to collect the box key before the first visit to the moon, but leave the magnet until between the two moon visits. This turned out to optimize the item collecting, while also allowing all necessary lift rides to be taken.
