[p 
	"Released for the Super Famicom in 1996, Front Mission Series: Gun Hazard is the second installment of the Front Mission series. Unlike the numbered titles in the series, which are isometric tactical RPGs, Gun Hazard is a side-scrolling shooter which takes place in a completely separate universe. The game was never given an offical English release, but there is a high quality fan translation made by Aeon Genesis.

	" Plot
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Following a series of wars in the early 2000s caused by competition for dwindling natural resources, the warring nations eventually banded together to invest in a means of procuring space-based energy via the construction of the orbital elevator, Atlas. Before its completion, the Atlas project was scrapped due to a breakthrough in a more cost-effective resource in the form of miniature fusion reactor technology. What was supposed to stand as a pinnacle of human achievement and a symbol of unity, Atlas instead became a symbol of wasted investment and failed dreams as involved nations regressed back into prior conflicts.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Set in the year 2064, the story follows Albert Grabner, a lieutenant of the Bergen(geographically equivalent to Norway and/or Sweden) military. In the midst of a coup d'état spearheaded by Colonel Ark Hellbrand to overthrow the government led by President Moss Orwen, Albert is sent to escort President Orwen out of the country. After being captured by Hellbrand and separated from the president, Albert manages to escape with another prisoner named Brenda Lockheart. Branded as public enemy #1, Albert is left with no other option but to team up with Lockheart and join a New York-based mercenary group known as the Kernlight Association, to assist with different civil conflicts over the world and eventually gather enough forces to stop the Bergen coup d'état. Over the course of his employment as a mercenary, Albert begins to notice links between these civil conflicts, including the coup of his home country, and a mysterious organization called "The Society".

	" About the run
	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"As both a side-scrolling platformer and a long RPG, creating a TAS of Gun Hazard entails the more difficult aspects of both genres of games. It has all of the long-term routing decision making and abundance of RNG manipulation typically found in RPGs, as well as intricate movement and fighting mechanics of platformers.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Routing
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"By far the most daunting aspect of tackling a Gun Hazard TAS was having to route everything in the run, since there are several aspects of the routing which needed to be taken into account and all have an effect on eachother. I would narrow the primary routing components to shop trip route, pilot experience, weapon experience, upgrades, money, enemy spawns, ammo constraints, resupply route, and score tally screens.
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" Shop trip route: The shop trip route is essentially the backbone of the routing in the game which shapes how the other components are routed. There is usually some major bottleneck present that mandates when shop trips are taken in the form of ammo constraints, money constraints, upgrade availability, etc...
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Pilot experience: Stronger upgrades are made available as Albert reaches higher levels, so you generally want to farm as much experience as possible without wasting time. Gaining excess experience sometimes leads to extra time on score tally screens, so there are certain missions where experience is avoided.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Weapon experience: Weapons in this game level up as you hit things that have actual hp with them. Their stats increase incrementally from 0-100%, and there is an additional threshold beyond 100% at 120% with no incremental gains in between. Each weapon has three stats that increase as they level up, one of which is always attack power. The other two are either magazine capacity, attack range, shot interval, or reload time depending on the type of weapon. Each weapon in the game also has 5 tiers that correspond to 5 armor values of enemies that you encounter in the game. If you are using a weapon to attack an enemy with an armor value that is 1 level higher it will deal 50% reduced damage, and 75% reduced damage if the armor value is 2 levels higher. Generally, each subsequent tier of weapons have twice the damage at relative XP levels as their predecessors, with other stats being increased slightly.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"There are two classifications of weapons in this game: primary weapons and special weapons. Primary weapons typically have lower dps, full screen-length attack range, omnidirectional aiming, infinite ammo, and only one can be carried on your wanzer at a time. Special weapons, on the other hand, typically have higher dps, more niche applications in terms of aiming/attack range restrictions, finite ammo which needs to be purchased at shops and resupplied between missions, and the amount which can be carried on your wanzer at a given time is equal to the tier of wanzer you are piloting.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In short, you want to farm as much weapon experience as possible in order to maximize DPS on bosses, but weapon experience must also be farmed with respect to sharing experience between a primary weapon as well as one or more special weapons, special weapon ammo constraints relative to the shop trip route, and consolidating resupplies between missions.
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" Upgrades: In addition to primary and special weapons, there are also different wanzers, vernier units, dash units, shield units, and pilot gear. Each upgrade in the game has five tiers with the exception of shield and dash units, which only have four.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Enemy spawns: Nearly every enemy in this game can be manipulated in one of three ways: enemy type, spawn location, and action, which usually need to be manipulated in a way that is conducive to the weapon and pilot experience routes.

In a TAS setting, you can simply press shoot for 1 frame each time it comes off cooldown to allow it to refill on all other frames in between. Because of its quick fire rate and auto-refilling, the Vulcan Gun is a very effective RNG manipulation tool.

I also delay bringing Ark to 0 hp by a few frames to force him to walk into his post fight-dialogue position during the fight rather than after.

I change message speed to very fast which saves a ton of time over the whole run, arm speed to very fast so I can change my aim more quickly, arm mode to B which makes it so left/right directional inputs have no effect on my aim allowing me to freely aim up/down while moving left/right(arm mode A is really the only way to go for real-time play; it's like they put arm mode B in specifically for TASing), alarm mode off so there's no alarm going off when I'm at critical hp(this saves no time but I was able to turn it off without wasting any frames since I was going by it anyway), and control scheme to B. There are a lot of inputs in this game, so much that not all of them can fit on a single control scheme. Control scheme A has no dash button so you have to double tap dash everywhere, and control scheme C has no special weapon swap so you have to go into the menus to swap weapons, leaving B as the only option. B gets around the button limit by putting aim lock and fire on the same button, which is no problem for a TAS since you can get around that simply pressing shoot for 1 frame each time it comes off cooldown.

		" With the addition of the first dash unit, movement becomes much more complicated than chaining full length jumps. The way dash movement works is that once it finishes accelerating to its max velocity, it begins to decelerate until it reaches a certain value, then goes back up to its top speed again. Whenever you end a dash by jumping or falling off a ledge, you want to be at the highest possible value on the final frame of your dash, since your speed will start to decrement from there. Optimizing this entails a lot of trial and error of letting go of directional inputs on specific frames near the end of the dash to reach that value on the final frame. If a dash is ended with a jump or a straight drop off, then you usually only need to let go of the directional input for 1-3 frames with random spacing in between, but dashing off a slope can require more. This is because even though dashing down slopes causes you to fly off them, you actually move faster during the time that you are connected with them so traveling at slower speeds initially can allow you to stay on the ground longer for more acceleration. There didn't really seem to be any rhyme or reason to which frames I let go of directional inputs, so each dash just took copious trial and error to optimize.

	[li 
		" Now that I have the a special weapon that is worth putting experience into, I have to balance my experience between two weapons. Since the Upward Vulcan deals significantly more damage to bosses than the Vulcan Gun, it is generally prioritized. The route I ended up going with involved using one full clip of UVG ammo before the final Cenktrich mission and one full clip during it, so that I only have two resupplies in between the first two shop trips. There were other routes which I tested, but I'll touch on those later.

		" This mission has the first enemy meter encounter of the game. This one is a bit different from the others in the game since it is in such closed quarters and has such a fast minimum spawn time, but the concept is still the same. The encounter itself has a "health bar" in the upper right hand corner of the screen that is displayed whenever you are not currently attacking any enemies, and it depletes at a rate relative to the amount of XP each kill yields. Enemy spawn times are random and all have to be manipulated, and enemies spawn off screen relative to your camera position. The speed at which you kill enemies does not affect the timing of subsequent spawns, but only 2 enemies can be on screen at a time. As such, the only enemy that has to be killed as quickly as possible is the last one. To accomplish this, I slowly kill the second to last enemy with my Vulcan from afar, and back up into the last enemy and kill him with 2 Upward Vulcan shots. Since enemies spawn relative to camera position, dashing backwards brings that side of the camera(and also the enemy spawn) closer to Albert than if you are dashing forwards.

The vernier will activate if you are holding jump in the air and either reach 0 y-speed or are already descending. You don't instantly start to go down after letting go of jump in this game like most other platformers, but you merely start to decelerate at a quicker rate. Because of these two factors, as well as the initial jumping velocity of the first-tier wanzer, you always activate the vernier quickly as possible by repressing jump exactly 24 frames after your initial jump input(the interval becomes 1 frame larger at each successive wanzer tier). Note that this interval is tied to when you press jump; not when you release it. If your initial jump has to be held out longer to reach a higher ledge, you will activate the vernier later than otherwise, but it will still be activated earliest by pressing jump again 24f after the initial input. Since the boost of the first vernier unit is so high, you generally want to make your initial jump as short as possible and use as much vernier as possible for each jump.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Further expanding on vertical movement, and this applies to both normal jumps as well as vernier movement, you can re-input jump after releasing it to cause your vertical speed to decrement at the slower jumping rate once again. This is key to optimizing every landing after a jump. Typically you want to extend your jump just long enough to reach the platform, then detach the final frame of the jump and move it as late as possible while still reaching the ledge you are jumping to.

		" Getting an optimal miniboss fight in this stage was rather difficult to manipulate. Enemy explosions in this game not only damage Albert, but can be used to damage other enemies as well. As such, I needed to weaken the last enemy before the miniboss to 1 hit from dead, bait him to be right next to the miniboss, kill him before the miniboss loses his plot armor, and manipulate the miniboss to walk not only into the explosion, but closer to the camera lock as well. Since I had to kill the miniboss with Upward Vulcan, I dashed into him to get a damage boost as I killed him. Since damage boost direction is based on which direction your initial momentum is going in, it is only useful in a handful of instances. You can't damage boost in any sort of a continuous fashion since it takes so long to get your momentum moving in the opposite direction to get the damage boost in the direction you would want it. Damage boosting, or taking damage in general has to be done with regards to whether or not it saves enough time to offset the extra time you'll spend refilling it on your next resupply. The speed at which hp/ammo refills during resupplies is based on thresholds of missing hp/ammo. The more you are missing, the more units it refills each frame until it eventually slows down to 1 unit/frame for the final 15 frames. This does not apply to resupplies that coincide with situations where you have to go down into the menus to change wanzer parts/weapons, since you can simply de-equip/re-equip your wanzer or weapons to instantly refill all health/ammo while you are in the menus.

The upcoming boss fights before the next shop trip are all fairly short, so it's very unlikely that the slight dps increase from the SG-01 would offset the time spent equipping it and the time wasted using tier-1 hand grenades.

Since the boss moves very quickly and you move very slowly while changing directions, this sort of strat isn't even remotely possible in a real-time situation, since being even a frame late on a turn around can cause the boss to get away from you.

Since the sand dunes have pretty gentle gradients, you have more opportunity to pick up speed going down them by letting go of directional inputs on random frames before getting forced off. Earlier operations' rural areas could be approached fairly methodically in the way I optimized the ends of my dashes, but optimizing these sand dunes was seemingly more random than reducing lag. On the plus side though, it's a lot easier to kill enemies without slowing down on sand dunes since you can jump if you are going up hill to start walking before them, and are typically not on the ground while going down hill.

I had to redo the mission again once I realized I had done the missions in the wrong order in terms of minimal map movement, which also worked out in my favor because I hit a higher threshold of shotgun XP that allowed me to kill the power generators in 1 point blank shot. The fastest way to take out the long brown ships is by going over the top of them, then jumping in the water and doubling back to get the ones underneath. You can kill the one on the left up top without even landing on the ship at all, which has less back tracking, but much more underwater movement so it ends up being slower. I had to redo the stage once again once I realized I did the first ship the wrong way.

The pilots can spawn pretty much anywhere on the ground and even in the air ducts with you. Health management was also a large factor in the patterns I was able to take from the purple wanzers and where I could damage boost.

Just before killing the 4th sphere droid, I fly as low as I can without missing any shotgun to get as much momentum as possible after finishing the fight.
