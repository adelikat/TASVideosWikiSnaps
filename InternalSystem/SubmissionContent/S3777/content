[p 
	"The game is about collect falling, unmanipulatable things. The only things that can be manipulated: skulls route and Brutus AI. Catching collectables on higher rows gives more points (500 on highest, 50 on lowest).

	" So what have you done?
	$LF
	[a id=heading-1220

]h3
[p 
	"I figured out that Brutus has a limited number of strategies that depends on the RNG and the actual position. Using this I can make Brutus do whatever I want. The only thing I need to do is when his specific action is ended, I roll the RNG with either L, R or using A (which punches and holds you for some frames) with additional A's (doesn't do anything just rolls RNG).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"To make the run more entertaining, I aimed to get as high score as possible by abusing the AI. On Level 1 for example I manipulated him to be able to start the bottle spamming on the right side of the level to reduce the spawn time of skulls (by killing them earlier).

[p 
	"I won't detail it. I've tested various routes and compared my scores and compiled the best ones into one (and making it as entertaining and perfect (improving) as possible). It was easy once I had full knowledge of the game mechanics and "seeing the future" of the falling collectibles.

I did the same with all my "improved vault" runs, but since this time I couldn't make it shorter (it's impossible), I've just added the entertainment (big scores and gameplay that impossible to do in realtime (rolling the rng for example to spam the bottles).
