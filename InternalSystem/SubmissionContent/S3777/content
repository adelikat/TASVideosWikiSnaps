	"I figured out that Brutus has a limited number of strategies that depends on the RNG and the actual position. Using this I can make Brutus do whatever I want. The only thing I need to do is when his specific action is ended, I roll the RNG with either L, R or using A (which punches and holds you for some frames) with additional A's (doesn't do anything just rolls RNG).
