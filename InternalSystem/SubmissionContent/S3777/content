	"I figured out that Brutus has a limited number of strategies that depends on the RNG and the actual position. Using this I can make Brutus do whatever I want. The only thing I need to do is when his specific action is ended, I roll the RNG with either L, R or using A (which punches and holds you for some frames) with additional A's (doesn't do anything just rolls RNG).

	"To make the run more entertaining, I aimed to get as high score as possible by abusing the AI. On Level 1 for example I manipulated him to be able to start the bottle spamming on the right side of the level to reduce the spawn time of skulls (by killing them earlier).
