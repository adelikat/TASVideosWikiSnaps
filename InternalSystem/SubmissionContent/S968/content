	"I manage to avoid the flying creature, so no shield is needed. That saves about one minute. The rest of the improvement comes from better route planning and more precise movement. Also, a bug is abused: I jump through some stairs. Total improvement is about 1 minute 38 seconds (5879 frames). I did not need to manipulate luck, because the monsters did not come on the way too much. No monsters were harmed, so I guess this qualifies as a pacifist run. It's a very short movie now, so I hope to see some competition!
