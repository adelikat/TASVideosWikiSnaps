	"Super Monkey Ball is a physics based arcade-“platformer” released in 2001 for Nintendo GameCube. The game features 3 difficulties, Beginner, Advanced and Expert, each with their own set of levels greatly varying in difficulty. The difficulty chosen for this TAS is expert, also considered as the main category of this game, covering the largest amount of content out of any difficulty. The game engine has no real glitches, rendering the TAS to be purely about optimizing the movement to beat the floors as quickly as possible.

[div class=p 
	"The previous TAS of this category aimed for the fastest completion time. We have since decided that in-game time is the timing method that matters most in Super Monkey Ball TASing, in terms of measuring quality and how optimal the TAS is. It also translates well between different emulator versions with varying loading times; for example, the newer versions have loading times more accurate compared to original hardware, making them longer. The in-game time is measured by converting the completion time of each level into the number of frames, then converting the total framecount back to normal time, each frame representing 0.01666… (1/60) seconds. We would also like to point out that a run being optimal in in-game time is 
	[b 
		"not

[h3 id=Boosting 
	"Boosting
	$LF
]h3
[div class=p 
	"Boosting is a movement technique used to accelerate the monkey on flat surfaces. It is performed by alternating between the two up-diagonal inputs (up-left, up-right) on varying paces. It is most commonly used right when a floor starts, being much faster than simply holding straight up. Boosting on ground is useful all the way until your speed is around 51 mph or more. At that point just following the shortest possible route is faster. Boosting is also especially helpful in most upward slopes.

[h3 id=Clipping 
	"Clipping
	$LF
]h3
[div class=p 
	"In mid-air, the monkey accelerates much faster than when rolling on the ground. Clipping is used to gain this precious air time. However, clipping too high up slows you down more than it helps so it’s mostly useful when you clip in angles such low that you stay barely above ground. Clipping is also used to launch the monkey into the air to pull off shortcuts in some floors. Clips can be performed from many kind of edges, corners and bumps.

[div class=p 
	"In order to cross over certain curvy bridges while also preserving a high velocity, you can perform a grind on the inner edge of the curve. This technique is usually very hard to perform but saves a nice amount of time. Grinding does not save time if the radius of the curve is so big you could cross the bridge full speed anyway.

	"I have TASed Monkey Ball 1 and 2 since summer 2013. I’ve done countless individual level TASes and six full TAS runs of the games prior to this project. The previous TAS of this category from spring 2014 was a big success, and at the time it was made, it was considered near-perfect. However, by finishing 4 more TAS runs (beginner and advanced for SMB1 and 2) I realized I have gained even more experience in TASing this game. In November 2014, I decided to start an improvement project for this category, without any idea that more than one second could be saved over the first TAS.

Byrz brought me onto this project in January of 2015, and after working with him for a while, I realised how difficult it was to keep up with his ridiculous standards of optimization, since his understanding of the original Super Monkey Ball engine is much deeper than mine. This whole TAS project has been a really rewarding experience, between bouncing ideas off of each other and random discoveries of inexplicable, yet helpful collisions. I’m very happy to be able to say that I was able to help with this project, because the end result is absolutely astounding.

	]a
	". To fix the sync issues, we had to delay few level transitions by 1-5 frames (another way would be redoing months of work). To get around the input drop glitch, we had to visit the pause menu for 3 frames to force the input drop not happen during gameplay, which would have cost movement velocity. The glitch happened twice during the TAS (floors E9 and E46). These frame losses did not cost any in-game time, so it doesn’t affect the gameplay quality of the TAS.
