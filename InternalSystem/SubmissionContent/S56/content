	"Hey everyone! This is my first tool-assisted speedrun. It is 15:27 long and has 5904 rerecords. Most of it was played at 16% speed. Some of the rerecords are from learning how this worked, some are from mistakes, but most are from optimization and various experimentation.

	"Kid Chameleon has some features which makes it interesting for speed running - there are a lot of paths to take, and helmets to chose from, and what helmet you choose earlier can greatly influence how you handle the next level, you can gain speed by jumping on enemies and falling off ledges and so on.

	"I use the warp in Under Skull Mountain 1, instead of the one in Blue Lake Woods 2. This is since the one in BLW2 relies on a secret button combination rather than a game element, as in getting 1,000,000 points in USM1.

	"This movie focuses on game timeunits, mainly because it would be silly to try to get hurt, pick up a diamond in every level and slowing down to not get the bonuses at the end of the level. Time units are as follows:

	$LF
	"many seconds can I estimate it can be improved, but there were
	$LF
	"some jumps that could have been done better. I didn't record an AVI
	$LF
