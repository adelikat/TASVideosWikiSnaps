	"Here is a fast-paced two-player game that follows after the classics. Usually they are simple in concept, yet universal in appeal, and general enough to be translated for almost any computer. Some examples are Pong, The granddaddy of all videogames. Breakout, Lunar Lander, and the venerable Space Invaders. For legal reasons they may be disguised by different names, but there probably isn't a home computer or videogame machine anywhere for which some version of these all-time favorites isn't available.

	"Here, another classic game is Blockade. Again, it goes by different names (sometimes Surround), but the basic concept remains the same...where two players square off against each other by steering a moving line around the screen, trying to head off the other player by forcing a crash.

	"I remember this game very well. At first, I had no idea how to type this one in, since it was one of the early machine language games for entry. After I found out how, I quickly got to it and played this game over and over with friends. During that play, I was amazed at how well it ran. Unlike the B.A.S.I.C written games, this style of coding was incredible and took away all the sluggishness that BASIC couldn't perform. It's fast and clean operating.

	"This was simple enough to TAS. The only challenge I had was trying to draw some interesting images. I tried some complex ones, but I could hever time the ending of each round to get the maximum score of 436. So, I ended up making patterns that were mostly mirror images...if split down the middle or horizontally. Some of them are a bit off center and weird, but I got my 436 on all 10 lives.
