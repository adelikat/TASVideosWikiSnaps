	"I've watched the run a couple times and tried out a few things. There is definitely a lot of room for improvement in the first level you did (which is actually Mission 2).

	"- Keep jumps as short as possible. Just by tapping B for one frame, the character does a short jump. The less you press B, the shorter the jump.

	"- You can take damage to speed things up so you don't have to slow down for everything. I noticed you end the level with a lot of health.

	"- Try not to let things slow you down. Shoot enemies quickly, or avoid them, maybe by jumping over them. Take short routes if you can.

	"If you can somehow get this level down to 6 minutes (rather than 8), then I'd project the final time to be more like 30 minutes as opposed to 40, and I guarantee the level which you did here will look a lot better. There isn't any point to doing one level only as a submission because it simply isn't complete, so the whole thing should be done before it is submitted.

	"Anyway, Snes9x v1.52-rr and v1.53 aren't tested well, since most people use either v1.43 or v1.51. I suggest using v1.51, but you can do whatever you like.
