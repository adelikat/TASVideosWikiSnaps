	": Honestly, this game has the same kind of results from all the BOTing. Thankfully the core is fast enough for you to perform such Brute Forcing in a reasonable time.  My comments will be the same as 
	(__wikiLink|href=/9719S|implicitdisplaytext=9719S)
	", so I would just hold to them instead. BUT! I'm glad to see that this game is being clinched across multiple consoles. Congrats!
