Over the past games in the series Spyro has grown tired of having to collect countless items to even get a chance at kicking the bad guys’ butts, so has decided to skip all that nonsense and confront Red and his henchmen right away.

	"This TAS is a massive improvement to a previous one I made a few years ago. It was so bad that I didn't even bother submitting to TASVideos. It had lots of missing strats and terrible optimization, to the point that the world record RTA run was actually faster at certain points. Plus, it was super boring to watch. This new TAS aims to rectify all the issues of the old one, making it both faster and more entertaining. There is probably still room for improvement (especially in those darn swimming sections, those are a nightmare to TAS), but I'm still very pleased with the final result.

This all ended up with this new TAS saving roughly 2.5 minutes over the old one.

Still, I tried to outdo anything that’s been done before. Perhaps most of the time making this TAS was spent making it fun to look at - there’s a lot of downtime, especially in the bosses. The hardest part to TAS was probably the section right before the third boss. Not just because of the hard to optimize platforming, but because of the menu storage necessary to execute a cutscene skip in that section, which forced me to juggle between moving and jumping around and keeping a menu on screen at the same time.

	"This game features 4 hub-worlds or "realms" to explore, and you must defeat the boss in each realm to progress, the game ending upon defeating realm 4’s boss. The first 3 realms start the player very close to the boss entrance, but it's blocked off until the player has destroyed enough Dark Gems in the realm. As it turns out though, you can relatively easily skip past these barriers and just go directly to the boss from the start of the Realm. The fourth realm works a little differently, as it's essentially a linear gauntlet of levels from the start of the realm to the final boss, and it pretty much makes up half of the run because of this. Still, using several glitches, you can skip past most of these levels.

[div class=p

If you hold the left analogue stick neutral while this short charging period ends, there's a single frame where Spyro can jump, if the wall allows for it. Holding down the jump button before this frame will buffer the jump input, making this trick much easier to pull off RTA (and much easier to TAS, as well!).

	"Sometimes, it helps to do a little "flick" just before charging to increase the chance of a successful wall grind, especially if you can't use double jump. A "flick" is done by charging while facing away from the wall, then immediately facing toward the wall again. If timed correctly, Spyro will do a very sharp turn while in the air, which (for a reason I don't understand), can make for a much better wall grind than if you had just faced the wall the entire time. This flicking technique is used for the infamous "double jump skip" trick in the beginning of RTA runs.

This cutscene is triggered in a very weird way however, that allows for it to start well before you actually reach the cave's exit. The trigger appears to be spherical, emitting from the teleporter, which means it leaks through the wall slightly. By jumping at a specific point on the wall and making sure to stay inside this sphere for long enough, we can activate this cutscene slightly faster.

If you charge, Spyro will enter his underwater state. If Spyro exits the water hitbox from the sides or bottom while in his surface water state, he will just fall out. However, if he's in his underwater state, he will not fall out and just keep swimming. The devs likely did this to prevent Spyro exiting the water in unintended areas, but it allows for Spyro to simply swim wherever he wants if you manage to get out of bounds.

	"During certain animations where Spyro is expected to be grounded, he will not interact with water. One of these animations is the "breath attack while standing still" animation (abbreviated to "breath from standstill"). By doing some fancy movement, you can perform this animation while Spyro is falling into the water, which makes him fall straight through it. We then utilize the rising platform during the laser attack, to carry Spyro back up. The breath from standstill animation doesn't last long enough to cover the whole distance however, but that's no problem. As long as the platform is moving upward while Spyro is standing on it, he won't get hit by the water! Why? I don't actually know, but I have a theory: Since the platform is constantly lifting Spyro's position up, the surface of the platform might be slightly above his position the whole time, meaning it cancels the water hitbox (as mentioned before when describing the swim in air glitch). I could be wrong about that, though.

The goal is to have Spyro bonk his head while in his "diving out of the water" state. If this is done with the right positioning and timing at the corner, he will clip right through. This typically allows us to swim in air right afterwards, since most water surfaces leak out of bounds. Good thing the game developers often overcompensated with the water in this game!

[div class=p

We then immediately exit one of them (in this case the teleporter menu). This makes the game unpause, but still leaves the other menu on-screen (in this case the pause menu). This makes it considerably more difficult to get to where we want, since we now have to juggle moving around and making sure we don't accidentally exit out of the menu at the same time. Luckily, the "Quit" option has an "Are you sure?" menu if you select it, which lets us pretty safely use it along with jumping.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Here comes the clever part, and the entire reason we create a save file on the memory card from the start (unlike my last TAS, where I simply continue without saving). You see: whether or not a cutscene has been triggered already is saved onto the memory card. This means that if we save the game right after a cutscene has triggered, then quit and reload the save, the cutscene will not play again! Normally this is impossible because you can't pause during cutscenes. However, using this pause glitch, we can! Since we still have to wait for saving and loading and all that jazz, it doesn't save an incredible amount of time, but it's undoubtedly one of the coolest cutscene skips in the TAS.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"But can this be used on any other cutscenes? Well... technically yes, but the Red cutscene is the only one that actually saves time. For Gnasty Gnorc, you cannot open the teleporter menu, meaning you have to trigger the glitch using a shop pad, which simply takes far too long to get to. And for Ineptune... well, we already skip that cutscene, as explained earlier. You'd think it could be used for the final boss cutscene, but I simply couldn't get this to work for whatever reason. It's very strange and unfortunate, but I'm personally pretty happy that I managed to utilize this glitch at all in the TAS.

However, between the icy floor and the spikes, there's a tiny sliver of non-icy ground that you can stand on. You're prevented from double jumping or charging while on ice, so using this small bit of floor, we can do some stylin while we wait for Red to do his business.
