	"Looks like my real time playing skills are getting worse by the minute, that's why this TAS was done; I was playing some first person shooter games with my nephews, but I suck big time playing in real time, so, before I get my ass kicked again by one of my ten year old nephews, I think it's better to do another TAS :)

[p 
	"The full amount of time that a story cutscene is being played directional inputs and other persistent inputs (gun) can be buffered just by holding them. You can also buffer non-persistent inputs (jumping) by pressing them on the last frame before the game stops accepting inputs.

[p 
	"Landing on enemies/objects will shift you one direction or the other. This is important because the effect is instant, and the camera scrolls at a constant rate. Overscrolling past the screen boundaries preserves the stage layout, but most enemies and platforms/elevators do not spawn.

[p 
	"A really short stage, it's possible to fall trough the elevator's floor by jumping as soon as you can get below the uper platform. That bomb used was not meant to reduce lag, but to kill a turret that was on my way.

	"The first stage that is possible to stay ahead of the camera. There's lots of lag at the end that may be reduced using a bomb, but using the bomb where I used is faster overall.

	"Conveyor belts in this stage switch every time a 0 occurs in the RNG sequence. I don't know how to manipulate the RGN other than wait a few frames for it to change by itself. So, this stage is now 200 frames slower.

[p 
	"I was estimating to save ~300 frames restarting the run, but as explained on Super Scroll stage, I lost ~200 frames there. The run is still faster than the old one, 92 frames, but if you can find a way to manipulate the RNG, or if you are luckier than me, there's some frames to be saved in this stage.
