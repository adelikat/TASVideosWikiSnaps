	"Pac 'n Roll Remix is a recreation of the original Pac 'n Roll for the DS that is featured exclusively in Namco Museum Remix and Namco Museum Megamix. The remixed version features a new world, a missing world, adjusted physics, and lots of other gameplay changes. As far as I'm aware, there are no noticeable gameplay differences between the Remix and Megamix versions. The goal for Any% is to beat Pac 'n Roll Remix by defeating Golvis and reaching the end credits as quickly as possible. Exiting to a different subgame within the collection is obviously not allowed but other skips and glitches are okay.

	"I decided to update my previously existing Pac 'n roll TAS due to the discovery of a couple of new strategies, most notably 4-1 and 4-4 skips that save a combined 20 seconds. In addition, I took the time to clean up some of my movement as there were a good amount of small routing improvements.

	$LF
]h3
[div class=p 
	"Golvis gates act as barriers blocking progression through a level unless you collect and deposit enough Pac-dots in order to pass. Most Golvis gates are unskippable, meaning that the TAS has to find the fastest route to collect enough Pac-dots within the level in order to complete it. However, you can sometimes go around gates by either jumping around them or finding a way to reach the goal that isn't blocked by one. The game keeps track of which Golvis gate you're supposed to be depositing Pac-dots into and won't let you deposit Pac-dots into any other gates. This means that if you skip a gate in a level, you have to skip all the rest of them as well. Luckily, this has not posed an issue for TAS so far but it does prevent the viability of making certain gate skips RTA viable. For example, skipping the 2nd to last gate of 4-2 is much easier than skipping the last gate but both are required so both are unviable RTA.

[div class=p 
	"This isnâ€™t a particular action on its own but rather the behavior of some surfaces. If Pac-man has a specific align and boosts while near another surface, Pac-man will sometimes "snap" onto the new surface, despite Pac-man's previous speed. How specific the alignment has to be varies based on how much two pieces overlap with each other. Being able to dash AND take a more direct route saves a lot of time compared to RTA where the trick just isn't feasible.

	"By moving parallel to the bottom of certain ramps and then tapping towards the ramp, you can clip into it and propel yourself forward slightly. This is faster than just holding straight in a direction by actually quite a surprising amount although I'm not entirely sure how this happens. Since the last TAS, I've discovered more places where this is possible. The most notable places where this happen is the beginning of 2-2 and 4-4
