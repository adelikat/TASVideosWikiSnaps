	"This is 1,734 frames (29 seconds) faster than the currently published run. Most of this time was gained from precise frame optimizations, and slightly better luck manipulation. The actually strategy remains the same as the old run.

	"The goal in this game is to turn 1,000 dollars in 10,000,000 as quickly as possible. This is done by playing a mere 4 quick games. The run consists of 2 games of limit roulette, followed by 2 games of no-limit craps. The only way to play at the no-limit tables it to accumulate 100,000 dollars, which is achieved at the roulette table.

	"I did massive testing to try and find a quicker strategy, but to no avail. My initial intention was to play the slot machine at the fixed limit casino, and turn 1,000 into 100,000 with just 1 pull instead of 2 roulette games. The stupid AI in this game would not allow me to pull a "777" on the slot machine, which pays 200 to 1. There are 255 different pulls that can result, and I actually spent hours trying every single one. The "777" simply would not occur. That is why I needed to use the same strategy as in the published run.
