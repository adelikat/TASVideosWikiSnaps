If you just collect all coins, there's no proof that the speedups added by this hack will make it look different enough from the "120 stars" TAS. If skipping some coins is more optimal, then the speed benefit added by this hack becomes iffy in itself, in which case, one might instead just watch a vanilla game TAS.
