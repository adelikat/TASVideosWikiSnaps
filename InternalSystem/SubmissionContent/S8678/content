	"Level 9 isn't so trivial, because this is where we have to end input as fast as we can. I discovered that when you lose a life in these survival-esque minigames, you'll start exactly where you left off, meaning you can lose a few lives before beating a level. This trick saves around 16 seconds over not losing any lives.

Ending input earlier than normal was played off nicely, while accepting damage and lose of life...to make a "plus".
