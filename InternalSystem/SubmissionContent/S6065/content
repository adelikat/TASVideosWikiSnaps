		"Castlevania: Spectral Interlude
	]em
	" is a Castlevania fangame for the ZX Spectrum, developed by Rewind and released in 2015. It mostly pays homage to the classic Castlevania games of the NES era, particularly Simon's Quest, but also takes on elements from later "Metroidvania"-style titles in the series.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Regarding the plot/timeline, the game is set in the early 1800s, a few decades after 
	[em 
		"Symphony of the Night
	]em
	", with the plot aiming to explain the disappearance of Richter Belmont and the Belmont clan after said game. The protagonist of the game is Richter's son, Simon Belmont (named after his ancestor of classic Castlevania fame), who with the help of sorcerer Joseph aims to remove Dracula's evil influence on the world by collecting demonic altar pieces, summoning Dracula, and whipping him to death as usual. However, some things don't go exactly as planned...

	$LF
]h4
[ul 
	[li 
		" The game handles lag, or laggy situations, in a quite interesting way. Instead of slowing down the whole game, the game instead just drops visual frames while the game loop is kept up at the same pace as normal. In extreme situations, the game loop may even be run multiple times per frame. Because of this, even during intensive gameplay situations with many enemies or a tricky boss battle, there is no slowdown, although the visuals may become quite choppy.

	$LF
]h4
[ul 
	[li 
		" There's a lot of it.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" The RNG is updated whenever a random action calls for it (enemy AI, loot drop, etc). On update, it does some calculations involving the 
		[a class=extlink href=https://www.worldofspectrum.org/faq/reference/z80reference.htm#RRegister rel=nofollow 
			"R Register
		]a
		", which increments on every CPU instruction run. Therefore, the RNG can be manipulated by changing the instruction flow of the CPU, and in practice this can be done by feeding any input that is recognized or processed by the game in some way - this includes the 0 key (which opens the minimap) and H key, which resets to the main menu. Both keys do not have their actual effect as long as another key is held, but they do add instructions, and therefore change the R register, and change the RNG by extension. (The same thing can be done with the 1 and 2 keys, which cycle subweapons, when no subweapons are obtained yet). So, in practice, luck is manipulated with relative freedom by adding random 0 or H presses prior to luck-based events.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" RNG manipulation is primarily used to manipulate random drops from enemies. In particular, gold bags with 50 coins are very rare drops early on (1/64 chance, from memory), but a dozen of them are already manipulated even before the first town visit (so the shrine warp upgrade and several subweapons can already be bought immediately). Later on in the run, many big heart drops from candles or certain enemies are another 1/32 drop at best, yet are manipulated by the dozens.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" It should be noted that drop table logic varies depending on a few factors, like if the player has visited the same room before (which makes drops much less likely, and makes some bigger drops impossible), what altars have been triggered, whether or not the player is capped on hearts, or the type of enemy (or candle) destroyed.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Some boss patterns also can be manipulated by luck. Most notably Grant (randomly climbs along the ceiling) and Medusa (teleport randomly to one of three locations, and move around for a random amount of time) had to be manipulated in order to remain optimally hittable without getting out of reach or intangible while invincibility ends.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[h4 
	" Boss notes
	$LF
]h4
[ul 
	[li 
		" Bosses have 135 frames of invincibility on hit (7 frames of hit freeze, then another 128 frames of plain invincibility). Therefore, saving hits on bosses is important wherever possible.
		$LF

]ul
[h4 
	" Damage boost
	$LF
]h4
[ul 
	[li 
		" It's possible to pick up items while taking damage, and taking damage elevates Belmont briefly for about a half tile. This is barely enough to allow Belmont to collect an item that normally would be too high to reach, by taking damage.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" It's also possible to reach a higher platform by taking damage at the apex of a jump.

	" Teleporting tricks
	$LF
]h4
[ul 
	[li 
		" After starting a teleport, the next teleport can be buffered immediately by pressing the input while the first teleport is underway. This makes it easy to chain teleports at optimal speeds, but also puts a clear limit on the maximum speed of teleporting.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Belmont is fully invincible while teleporting, and remains constantly invincible when chaining teleports.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Teleports shift Belmont by 64 pixels left or right.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" It is possible to whip right before teleporting, and the whip will come out during/after the teleport. This is useful for hitting enemies quickly from long range, or for hitting candles while teleporting around.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" When teleporting from the ground onto the air, it's possible to buffer a jump directly after the teleport. This jump will count as a ground jump, and it will still be possible to do a double jump after.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Teleporting into stairs will elevate Belmont by one tile any time a stair block is touched. This translates to a full 45 degree angle teleport upwards when teleporting directly up a set of stairs.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Platform teleport: Teleporting into a platform that can be passed vertically will allow Belmont to land on the platform, provided he's less than half a tile below the platform. This effectively allows Belmont to reach platforms a half-tile higher than his combined double-jump height. This saves time in some vertical sections. This is made easier by the fact that teleporting inside a platform doesn't enable horizontal movement (platforms are considered like solid blocks for teleporting purposes).
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[h4 
	" Dialogue skip
	$LF
]h4
[ul 
	[li 
		" Multi-page dialogue can be skipped after the first page can be closed by pressing the H key. This has a side effect of making some text in-game appear rather nonsensical as dialogue ends abruptly and some context is omitted entirely. In other words, don't try to follow the plot too much just by watching this movie, as it skips out on quite a bit of text without the viewer being able to realize it.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" There are a few rare events where two separate sets of dialogue are displayed in succession, so multiple pages appear even when H is pressed. In these cases, H still reduces the total amount of pages visible.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[h4 
	" Spike jump glitch
	$LF
]h4
[ul 
	[li 
		" With frame perfection, it's possible to walk off a ledge, land on a spike tile and jump from it without taking damage (which resets the scene), while also still keeping the double jump. This can only be done once on a strip of spike tiles (although with double jump, two jumps can be done in total). This allows reaching a few items early that normally would require the teleport ability.
		$LF
	]li

[h4 
	" Teleport event graphics glitch
	$LF
]h4
[ul 
	[li 
		" No practical utility besides visual quirks, but triggering an event or room transition by teleporting as soon as a new area is loaded (a room is entered, or new location is entered - not by regular scrolling room transitions) will cause the event to trigger before the new area is even visible, and delay or skip its visual loading. This does not affect anything ingame, and the new room graphics will be made visible anyway after the event is passed.
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" This is done when entering the top part of Dracula's Castle from the main part - teleporting left instantly there will trigger the room transition before the new area is loaded yet, resulting in a glitchy looking screen scroll.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				" This is also triggered a few more times when entering the White Altar room, when leaving it, and when entering Richter's house all during the Death sequence. The latter one has the interesting effect of showing the boss door closing before the room is even visible.

	" Event-skip tile glitch
	$LF
]h4
[ul 
	[li 
		" Skipping certain events, or otherwise passing them quicker than should be possible, can corrupt on-screen tiles resulting in odd effects. There are two known instances of this:
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" Entering the White Altar house mid-teleport and then directly teleporting into the dialogue event trigger. Just the direct teleport is fine (even if it triggers the teleport event graphics glitch), but the mid-teleport house entry is not.

			[li 
				" Skipping the Dracula pre-battle dialogue by whipping him instantly after the Altar is activated.
				$LF
			]li

		" The result of this glitch is that certain on-screen tiles will glitch out and change graphics or properties. This will happen along the bottom two rows of the screen, and effects include tiles becoming a plain blue or water graphic, becoming solid/standable, becoming slippery, or becoming possible to drop through.
		$LF

			[li 
				" The White Altar instance is deliberately avoided, as the glitched tiles would hinder coming down in the next section and lose time.

	]li
	[li 
		" Also along the way, another damage boost is used to reach the hidden entrance to Dracula's Castle early. This is used to get a whip upgrade and heart upgrade in these areas. The main reason this is done is that because the whip upgrade needs to be applied in town, this means town must be visited some time after reaching this area with this item for the first time. This area won't be visited otherwise until the end of the game, and by then it's too late to get the whip upgrade, so it's visited now that there is an opportunity for it.

They are essentially designed to be frustrating; if the player is too close, or is facing in their direction (while being on their half of the screen), the dragon won't appear, or will try to hide as soon as possible (which only can't be done while they're firing projectiles). Also, the floor is slippery. Belmont stands on specific positions to be in whipping range of the dragons, while not preventing them from appearing.

	": Before everything else, it must be noted that unofficial games need to be high quality and notable in order for movies made with them to be acceptable. This is clearly not a problem in this case, since this homebrew game showcases gorgeous graphics and music, while featuring a very extensive gameplay and diversity for a ZX Spectrum game.

	"This game doesn't seem to inform the player when an upgrade is maxed out, nor does show beforehand what the maximum achievable is; the same can be said for collecting all items. The only way to ultimately confirm the limits would be to reverse-engineer the game code, which has nothing to do with playing the game normally and thus doesn't work as a full completion yardstick.

	"It could be argued that the map could be confirmed to be completed, thanks to the second map upgrade showing undisclosed rooms nearby to the player position; however this can be debatable since it requires the player to walk through the whole world looking for the existence of any undisclosed room, which also means that this feature will work for all cases.

	"Full completion is usually recognized by the fact that a game features optional challenges or requirements, and that clearing them results in the game awarding the player with a different ending cutscene, a different ending message, or simply by displaying a full percentage gauge. The only clear and obvious full completion scenario applicable for this game is reaching the hidden/true ending, as it requires the player to beat the optional boss, Death; all the other goals of this movie aren't clear or obvious, as explained in the previous paragraph.

	"Since the goal chosen for this movie doesn't fall under either fastest completion or full completion, it's considered as an additional branch and thus needs to be considered accordingly. I think this is a great choice for an abitrary goal, since it allows to showcase much more contents compared to the two main branches, while the ruleset is well defined and sensible: getting everything that can be obtained in the game. It could be argued that this goal should include killing all enemies and maxing out the money income, but this is not applicable since any non-boss enemy will spawn again after re-visiting the same room, and the money drops still happen even after maxing out the player income.

	"As a side note, I have to note that the branch label "100%" is not perfectly indicative of the movie goal, as the game doesn't feature any percentage value and the game does require just the Death fight as a full completion requirement. For this reason, in accordance with feos, I'm renaming the branch label to "completionist", as it's more accurate.

	": After heated discussion we agreed that when the full completion goal for a game is decided by the community to consist of maximizing several independent units, each on its own, we can't deduce such labels to "all X". If the game does not use the term "100%" for something special, compound full completion can be labeled as "100%". When "100%" means something different in the game, there should be a new iteration of discussion to come up with a name that's not "100%" and still represents full completion.

	"So we consider the "100%" label iconic and use it when we have to, when we can. Changed the branch back.
