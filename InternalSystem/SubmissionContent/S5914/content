	"This is the competition that DK had to get all the medals back from K. Rool for. So now it's finally time to see who's the best in the jungle!

	"My goal for each set of stages is slightly different. For Climbing Race and Obstacle race, my goal is to minimize ingame time. For most of these, the fastest character is actually Funky Kong. This is because his initial speed is actually the highest of all the characters. Additionally, by alternating L and R every other frame, you can keep your initial speed, as if gravity doesn't affect you. When doing this, the screen actually moves up faster than you, and if you get too far behind, the game will softlock. Also, it can be difficult to control, and you can veer off to one side. I haven't completely figured out how to control that yet, but by manipulating which position I start the race in, I can eliminate that issue. For Obstacle Race 3, I choose Wrinkly Kong, because she is the lightest character, and most affected by getting hit. Likewise, I manipulated it so that I start right next to Funky Kong, as he is the heaviest. I tested this strat in Obstacle Race 1 too, but it turned out to be slower there.

	"For the rest, since they all have set times, my goal was entertainment. For the Attack Battles, my goal was to get as high a score as possible, while making sure none of the CPU players got any. This was pretty tricky to actually pull off at times, as it's difficult to manipulate three CPU opponents at once.

	"After the Attack Battles, K. Rool comes to crash the party! K. Rool has the farthest attack in the game, and is the only character who can reach the second row from the ground. I use this to my advantage here to win both Barrel Blasts without ever using the pegboards! I also stop playing as soon as possible, much earlier than you might think I'd be able to.

	"For Color Capture, I start playing as late as possible to still win. Before starting this TAS, I knew I'd be able to start pretty late, but I had no idea HOW late!

	": Beating the Jungle Jams results in advancement of the in-game completion gauge, thus this submission is arbitrarily skipping the rest of the full completion (in-game 200%), which is a goal applicable for the Vault tier. For this reason, this run is considered as an incomplete version of a full completion run.

	"Also, this movie starts from SaveRAM in order to have all Jungle Jams unlocked right away. For this reason, the movie must meet the entertainment requirement for the Moons tier, which is not the case since the minigames resulted relatively plain and motionless. The audience reception was also mediocre.
