	"Why SNES9X 1.51? The SNES emulation on emulators like Bizhawk, Lsnes and Bsnes is very slow. This will make the whole progress very tedious for me to make and far from enjoyable. Redoing with one of these emulators will be 3-5 frames slower, which I didn't think it was worth it because of the pain it gives me from TASing with them. So as long as 9X 1.51 is allowed, I prefer to use it.

	" Tricks & Glitches
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	[b 
		"Wobbling
	]b
	" - When walking left and up, you can alter holding left/up and pressing right/down every second frame to increase your movement speed from 2-1-2-1 pixels/frame, to 2-2-2-2. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Pixelporting
	]b
	" - When Link is in narrow paths with walls on his left and right, you can face the wall and press left+right+down/up, depending on the direction you are going, to boost up to 6 pixels.  
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Diagonal wall clip
	]b
	" - At certain pixels of a diagonal wall, Link is able to clip in 1 or 2 pixel into the wall. When you have clipped enough pixels, and push downleft (In the case of the wall used in this TAS), Link can teleport upwards a set amount of pixels. It's also possible to do a downward teleport, though it won't take you as far and has no use in this run. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Superjump/hyperjump/moonjump
	]b
	" - When Link has clipped through the wall he can also use it to perform a cliff jump. If there is a wall where Link is about to land, he'll jump further. And there is a fence, rocks, tree (Not sure if the tree matters though) and the Hyrule Castle wall that blocks Link's path, which means he'll land on the top of the wall at the castle. Which is the fastest method of entering.

[p 
	[b 
		"Stairs Glitch
	]b
	" - Stairs are normally supposed to take you between the lower and upper floor of a room. But if you walk down by pressing left+right+up/down, you'll bypass the "layer trigger" and stay in the same layer the whole time. As walking down stairs is very slow, it saves a lot of time even though you have to jump back into the right layer. 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Glitchy Doorway
	]b
	" - By holding left+right when going through a doorway, you can avoid being moved into the next room. This is a method that can be used to enter the Exploration Glitch mode, which is walking in the wrong background layer as also done with the Stairs Glitch. You can normally not reach Ganon by walking to the left from the room where the glitch is done, even though that is actually the case in the game's map: http://www.escaprism.com/media/img/eg-map.png topleft corner. And the glitch used makes it possible reach Ganon's room and reach the Triforce Faster.
