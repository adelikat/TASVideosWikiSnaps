	"Contra: Hard Corps is the only game of the Contra series released on the Genesis / Mega Drive console. In this game, you get to choose between four characters, each with different abilities and weapons.

	"This game has four completely different final stages, each with a different ending, depending on the choices you make earlier.

	"The Japanese version was chosen because, for some reason, it gives the players a health bar, allowing them to take some damage without dying.

	"Fang is used due to a glitch that allows him to deliver fully charged D weapon shots, without taking time to charge it.

	"This speedrun is 263frames faster than adelikat’s!!! The place mainly saved time was the doctor boss in stage 5. I used the D shoot 5 times, once more than adelikat’s. And I was at the right not left. So boss turned the third action straightly. Saved about 5 seconds.
	$LF
	"Other place I saved the time is in stage 4, before the big boss, there was a door. I used down+C once less than adelikat’s. Saved some time.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"However, I wasted some time in some places. Such as the big boss in stage 1. I did the same as adelikat’s. But I was slower than his 2 frames. I don’t know why. So these places was a pity…
