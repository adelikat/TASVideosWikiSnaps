	"I completed this game without collecting any instroments!  The only Item I collect is the L-1 sword.  The method for beating this game seems to be well known, and am shocked that I don't see a time attack for it.  Thanks to David Wonn for his well known glitches. ( http://kontek.net/davidwonn/ ).  The only difference between what he features and what I did was that when warping to the level 8 in-game warp: You do not have to restart the game then, rather falling on the right hole will warp you straight to that warp!  That saves a lot of time.  This game was hard because luck manipulation was very random it seemed.  I wasn't fighting the game to create just a good path, I was fighting the game to glitch right as well.  When I am fighting the Aghanims it appears that I waste time by missing the first set of balls.  You cannot hit him then, you are only fighting the "invisible" one there are two).  I don't see where this time could improve very much.  I have everything down to the frame...considering I did this run one time before and didn't realize that the game wasn't recording.   Well, live and learn.
