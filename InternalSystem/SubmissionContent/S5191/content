	"This movie utilized a common bug in SMB1 in which Mario's state goes into a mess when he hits the ax and Bowser at the same time a the end of a castle. This allows the movie to display strange stage effects. I used the "short Fire Mario" state in this run to perform things not usually seen in regular runs.

	"This movie utilized a common bug in SMB1 in which Mario's state goes into a mess when he hits the ax and Bowser at the same time a the end of a castle. This allows the movie to display strange stage effects. I used the "short Fire Mario" state in this run to perform things not usually seen in regular runs. Glicthes like no flag pull (found by klmz), walking through the wall and warp bugs are used to save some time. Since I need to complete at least one castle, I didn't use the warp in 1-2.

	"Categories such as this are judged more strictly than more standardized categories. If the audience doesn't like it, then we can't accept it, and well... I don't really think the audience at large liked this. You made a few strange decisions with the routing, there are some noticeably suboptimal sections, and the glitch itself doesn't really lend itself to an interesting full-game run.

	"You mentioned you've been working on the any% run, so I would suggest keeping at that. Beating HappyLee's 4:57.31 time would be one of the most impressive achievements in site history in my eyes, so I wish you luck on that. As for this category, though, I have to reject it for not meeting our entertainment standard.
