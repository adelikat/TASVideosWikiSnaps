	"In this TAS, I use no savefile to complete challenge mode. When the game is completed in Story mode, an even harder version is available, but the harder version of it is actually easier if you take into account the fact you can use stronger characters. It's just LEVEL1 characters in this TAS! Beating the 3 egyptian gods in a row is easier than this LOL.

	"In RTA, it's still theorized how this challenge could actually be completed. Think Reallyjoel'dad level of difficulty. Challenge mode is basically the pokemon stadium version of the game since it's just battles and many items given away to use in the challenge. It doesn't have all monster available and doesn't use the game mechanics for story mode like traversing maps, changing terrains. recruiting new monsters, conquering cities and others war or map strategic gameplay that the Story mode has.

	"Here we manipulate enemies into missing, guarding and using their action points incorrectly in general. The wait command is very useful to manip without spending our last action points, since we would lose control of the RNG if we're no longer in our own turn. Fights end because of bigger score and lack of APs to proceed. They end "ugly" because we need to manipulate a better turn start for the next fight since almost 100% outspeed our own characters. The goal is to remove heavy damage dealers with lower HP, monster that can fuse with each other and outstall us and other nuisances.

	"The Fusion monster are also an interesting way of stalling out fights and gaining more actions and health points while still auto healing. The supreme dragon can attack normally with 1 AP or all enemies with 2 APs but it seems harder to crit as the enemies do not get critted in the exact same frame when using 2 APs. Guard reduces damage unless it's broken, which happens often for our weak blue eyes dragons but not for enemies. Guarding would make this TAS a lot easier if only characters didn't have such low AP and didn't get their guards broken so easily. In the ending fights, the difference is so huge wait commands are used to not do anything but still manip enemy into burning some APs here and there.
