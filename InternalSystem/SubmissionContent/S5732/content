	"In order to access certain rooms you need a special weapon which can destroy the coloured box blocking the room. The first box blocks access the the first boss. In order to get there we need the boxing glove which is found in the lower level. Using the stars is the fastest way to break these types of crates.

	"The first boss is the King. While using the boxing glove it is possible to switch to another weapon after a few frames allowing both to be fired at no extra cost to the energy bar. Also being used is the lock ability which allows Mash to move around whilst still facing the direction which was locked in.

	"After beating the boss we get the flamethrower which allows us to proceed to the next stage. In the room after the boss fight it isn't possible to exit the way we entered due to the height and distance it is from the other platforms.

	"The next boss consists of attacking its main body first then being able to attack the face to defeat it. The flamethrower is used first as it deals more damage when trying to get on the higher platform, then switching to the stars to hit between 3-5 body parts per shot. Throughout the fight I manipulate the direction the boss moves by either firing a flame or moving at certain times, this allows the boss to keep moving during the fight instead of stopping to attack. Towards the end the flamethrower is used again since it deals greater damage to single body parts and consumes less energy which allows the use of the boxing glove for the final hit, which saves a few frames.

	"This is the first of two shooting autoscrollers. The fight is fairly straightfoward, taking damage in front of the boss allows Mash to attack the boss much earlier than if I were to dodge the attack and wait to get in front of the boss again. Also by being on either the left or right of the boss results in it moving in that direction after firing its attack.

	"This stage unlike any other stage spawns the moving enemies in random spots, so to manipulate this I fire the flamethrower to change the positions. This also applies to the boss. The boss can begin the fight either flying away, shooting fire or shooting missiles. The ideal outcome is the missiles as the boss remains still for enough time to get a quick kill and to get in position to bring up the next text box quicker.

[p 
	"For some reason getting up close during the first phase of the boss results in it remaining still and firing away. I use the boxing glove to finish off the first phase since it saves more time than in the second. The second phase consists of dodging the shot and making it jump instead of using its stronger attack.
