	" is a Neo Geo Pocket Color port/compilation of the two Mega Man arcade games, Mega Man: The Power Battle and Mega Man: The Power Fighters. It was developed and published by Capcom and released in 2000 in Japan. While video and audio are brought down significantly to go down from the CPS arcade systems to the dinky Neo Geo Pocket handheld, the gameplay is largely converted pretty faithfully, and the character sprites even in their 8-bit-esque glory retain pretty fluid animation.

[div class=p 
	"As in the arcade games, there are no stages in this game - Mega Man (and Proto Man, and Bass, and Duo in Power Fighters) decided those are a waste of time, so they'll just face the Robot Masters directly instead. Each episode contains 6 Robot Masters, a penultimate boss stage, and a final boss stage where the player faces off against Dr. Wily as usual. Both games have three episodes each - this TAS plays through all three episodes of the second game, Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters.

	[li 
		" After every boss battle, the boss explodes in a shower of score pickups, as well as a pickup that contains the boss' weapon. If the player does not collect it before the victory jingle, they will not receive the weapon, which also means no "get weapon" prompt after the stage fadeout. This means that if a weapon is not going to save more than a second, it actually saves time to not get the weapon at all. This is done to skip some useless weapons.

[h3 id=Characterchoice

	$LF
]h3
[div class=p 
	"In Power Fighters, there are four playable characters - Mega Man, Proto Man, Bass, and Duo. The first three characters are basically the same as their incarnations in Power Battle, but Duo is a new character with a few differences. Instead of firing a buster shot, his standard weapon has him extend his fist, and his dash is a shoulder tackle that does 4 damage but cannot be cancelled at all except by hitting a wall.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The characters do have a few other differences compared to Power Fighters - most notably, they don't have a super jump anymore (except for an upgrade in the third episode), and they all have a new special move, performed by fully charging the buster and holding up while releasing. Mega Man will do a Shoryuken, Proto Man will shoot a short-ranged fireball, Bass will do a Flash Kick, and Duo will perform an uppercut. However, all of these actions are pretty slow (especially considering the charge time), so they're not really worth using over regular charged attacks.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Those things aren't really important though, what's important is the addition of Duo's shoulder tackle dash. It does 4 damage, equal to a mid charge shot, and can be used while charging his buster. Furthermore, it can be used with some special weapons to do multi-hits for extra damage, saving hits on some bosses. This makes Duo a good deal better at damage-dealing than the other characters for battles without special weapons, so he wins out for each of the episodes.

[div class=p 
	"In this game, when a boss is hit by multiple projectiles or hitboxes on the same frame, he takes damage from all of them before triggering mercy invincibility (which is 9 frames for most bosses, or significantly more if they're stunned). This is important for saving hits and in general just increasing damage output.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"How many hits it is possible to do at once depends on the weapon the player is using. Mega Man's and Bass' busters allow up to 3 projectiles at once, so if all of them hit an enemy on the same frame they can do 3 damage (or 6 if one of the shots was partially charged). Then for example with a weapon like Cut Man's, you can have 3 projectiles that can do 3 damage each for 9 damage at once, which becomes 18 damage at once if they're weak to the weapon.

If their stun rate exceeds their threshold, their stun gets reset to 0 and they get knocked back, being invincible for the duration (the duration depends on the strength of the attack, if they're weak to the weapon, and whether they're in mid-air or not). Since this knockback obviously costs time, it's important to aim to minimize it as much as possible, which means managing stun in an as optimal as possible manner.

So I kill Gemini Man's clone the instant the other Gemini Man is off the ground, giving me the remainder of his jump time to deal further damage while he's unstunnable. With Air Shooters and then Super Arm double hits and single hits, I can get him down to 11 health before he hits the ground.
