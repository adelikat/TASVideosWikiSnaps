	" Video Game Systems were cheap plug and play systems featuring compilations of what I like to call "demastered" Intellivision games, and were actually licensed by Intellivision themselves. I don't know why they decided to go this route instead of just re-releasing some of the originals like they did later with the Intellivision Flashback. Too expensive at the time? Anyway, the systems consists of some stripped-down NES hardware, otherwise known as "Famiclone" or "NES-on-a-chip", all contained within the controller. Many of the games in these collections are believed to have been made by Nice Code Software.

	"Here's a funny bug: the walls of the trench have no collision! While moving up or down while inside the walls leads to instant death, you can still be forced down by bombs from the enemy spacecraft. Be forced down far enough below the screen and you'll wrap back up to the top! What's nice about this is that you can wrap up to a higher position on the screen than what is normally accessible (or be clipped further up into the ceiling, if you will). By releasing the final bomb ever-so-slightly higher than normal, I was able to end input 2 frames earlier.

	": At first, you don't really know what is going on. Seems like you are supposed to fight enemies, but the primary goal is to bomb those silos. After I saw that, I realized that your ending was clever on ending input early. Good job.
