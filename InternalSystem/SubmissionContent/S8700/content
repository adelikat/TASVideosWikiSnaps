	"This is a 100% TAS of Bomberman Hero. What consists of 100%? The goal is to get a score of 5 in every level while unlocking the true final level and boss by collecting purple orbs called Adok Bombs. Typically you would need to collect all items and defeat all enemies in a level in order to get a 5, but there are some levels where that is not necessary as they can give you more than what is needed. One final thing to note is the version of the game. The North American and Japanese version of Bomberman Hero are very different. I chose the USA version because it is considered harder than the Japanese version. The USA version has more items, enemies, and bosses have more HP. Some levels require explanation, so below is a description of each level in the game:

[div class=p 
	"Here is the first level where defeating all the enemies and collecting all the items will overshoot your goal of getting a 5/5. If you do everything, you get 50 more points than you need. Since killing enemies gives you 100 points, you need to skip an item. There were two items at the beginning that I could’ve skipped. Choosing between the crystal on the static field, or the bomb upgrade next to an enemy, I tested both routes and decided getting the crystal was VERY slightly faster.

Near the end though, I had to defeat all the spiked enemies using the minimum amount of bombs I could. The first throw I did can take out 3 out of 4, but I had to move in a little closer to the enemies so that one of them walks into the blast radius. That saved some frames.

I had to use a lot of heavy enemy movement manipulation to kill them at the right times. The reason is because if I hit an enemy once and go far enough away from them, their health will regenerate.

Also, you will notice that the last winged-enemy I threw a bomb instead of dropping one on the way. This is because the enemy is so high up the ramp, not only will I miss the opportunity to defeat it by dropping a bomb, but if I wait until later to do so, it will drop to the lower level, which will waste a big amount of time.

The second thing to mention is that he is a chore to manipulate his movements.
