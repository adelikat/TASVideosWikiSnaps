	": So the optimization seems good even though it supposedly uses a suboptimal character and uses only 2 players instead of 3. I never quite got a clear answer as to how one of the characters is suboptimal and why only two players were used. The suboptimal character usage is an artistic choice anyways. Regarding the amount of players, I cannot find out how quick or entertaining 3 player would be without spending a significant amount of effort re-TASing the game myself. I would encourage future submissions to better explain the characters used and why that amount, but the lack of such explanation is far from worthy of rejection.

	"The run itself was very entertaining. The game moves extremely quickly for a beat-em-up with quick movement and fast combat reminiscent of TMNT4, another Konami entry in the genre. The audience also really liked the run as well.
