	"The plot in this game is simple. Montana Max has kidnapped Buns Bunny and is planning to steal the secret treasure. Not that exciting.

[div class=p 
	"Improvements from the previous movie come mainly from a new way of accelerating. At the start of every level, the speed is 1, however it is easily altered to 2 by doing a small 1-frame jump on the second frame of movement. When your speed reaches 5 (which takes about 2 seconds in-game time), I discovered you can use the sliding move followed by a jump for at least 3 frames, rocketing your speed to 7, which is the maximum speed.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"However the biggest improvement is found in the water level after facing Montana Max the first time (ship level). Due to the accelerating method described above, I managed to jump over all the small bodies of water, only stopping to get hurt by the sledges (no way to avoid these, they are on a global timer).

]div
[div class=p 
	"Other improvements are optimised movement in some places, avoiding more carrots (each carrot you collect slows the score screen at the end of each level down by 2 frames) and better boss manipulation, most noticeable at the first boss. I must admit though, GManiac did a terrific job at optimising the previous movie, making it hard to beat his time by any significant amount.
