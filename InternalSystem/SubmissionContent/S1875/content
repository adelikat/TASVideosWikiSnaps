	"The plot in this game is simple. Montana Max has kidnapped Buns Bunny and is planning to steal the secret treasure. Not that exciting.

	"Improvements from the previous movie come mainly from a new way of accelerating. At the start of every level, the speed is 1, however it is easily altered to 2 by doing a small 1-frame jump on the second frame of movement. When your speed reaches 5 (which takes about 2 seconds in-game time), I discovered you can use the sliding move followed by a jump for at least 3 frames, rocketing your speed to 7, which is the maximum speed.
	$LF

[p 
	"However the biggest improvement is found in the water level after facing Montana Max the first time (ship level). Due to the accelerating method described above, I managed to jump over all the small bodies of water, only stopping to get hurt by the sledges (no way to avoid these, they are on a global timer).
	$LF

[p 
	"Other improvements are optimised movement in some places, avoiding more carrots (each carrot you collect slows the score screen at the end of each level down by 2 frames) and better boss manipulation, most noticeable at the first boss. I must admit though, GManiac did a terrific job at optimising the previous movie, making it hard to beat his time by any significant amount.
