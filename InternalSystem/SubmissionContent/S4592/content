	"As it is enhanced re-release that adds new content that is emulated accurately, running this ROM in a NES emulator is a valid game choice for submission. Most VC re-releases only contain minor changes (if any) that are inconsequential for a TAS; the vast majority of them would have no notable differences from the original releases. In the case of N64, inaccurate emulation with Mupen is also a concern. Donkey Kong: Original Edition is highly exceptional in this, and accepting TASing the ROM on a NES emulator does not set a precedent for TASing Virtual Console games in general.

This TAS represents a superset of NES Donkey Kong's content - levels 1, 3, and 4 are identical and equally fast to their DK NES counterparts.
