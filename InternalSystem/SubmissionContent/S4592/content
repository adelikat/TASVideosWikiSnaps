	"As it is enhanced re-release that adds new content that is emulated accurately, running this ROM in a NES emulator is a valid game choice for submission. Most VC re-releases only contain minor changes (if any) that are inconsequential for a TAS; the vast majority of them would have no notable differences from the original releases. In the case of N64, inaccurate emulation with Mupen is also a concern. Donkey Kong: Original Edition is highly exceptional in this, and accepting TASing the ROM on a NES emulator does not set a precedent for TASing Virtual Console games in general.

	"Content-wise, Donkey Kong: Original edition adds the second level from the arcade version and an animation of Donkey Kong climbing up the ladder while carrying Pauline - the original NES Donkey Kong lacks these. This TAS represents a superset of NES Donkey Kong's content - levels 1, 3, and 4 are identical and equally fast to their DK NES counterparts.

	"On the other hand, DKOE is highly obscure and narrowly released compared to NES Donkey Kong, which is the most famous port of the game - DKOE was initially only available in promotional tie-ins for four years since its initial release in 2010 with a Wii bundle, until 2014 when it was released on 3DS Virtual Console in Europe (
