	", or Mokou's Kitchen as it's more commonly known as, is a Touhou Project fangame for Flash created by yu-ki in 2012. It stars everyone's favorite never aging, youkai killing, "genuine" yakitori stand owner and #1 Kaguya hater, Fujiwara no Mokou in an attempt to demonstrate her cooking skills in what appears to be her own cooking show.

Everything is done by mashing and timing everything frame perfectly. The buttering up segment is done by dragging the block of butter with the mouse. I try my best to drag it around the required rectangular area as much as I could.
