I truly have no idea what's going on. I think warmCabin was the first person ever talking about this. You can grab ladders offscreen and it's possible to gain vertical boost by pressing down while you grab on ladders and press up on the next screen. Boost is usually around 16 pixels but it's possible to get that even higher. I still think that there are anime girls lurking offscreen preventing my work. It's also important to do some wiggling so you gain access to higher Y position sooner. There is a timer that reduces every time you do wiggling. Crashman is a good example when you look at that ladder section. It might look like some ADHD-spam movement but it's actually more deeper than that.

It's also possible to shift frame rules by adding lag before DelayScrolls. This happens because lag affects frame rules' behavior but it won't affect music code at all. This needs to be adjusted correctly, too minimal or too large amount of lag will have a negative effect. This is mostly trial and error because of other surroundings and rules.

I finished several different, yet full movies before this version. One of them was 72 frames faster compared to the published one. I used them as a reference material to understand frame rules and other places better. I still had motivation to go further on with this game and I'm glad that bizarre things just kept popping up. I also set myself in a mode where I wanted to understand the whole picture better. I haven't needed both FinalFighter's and pirohiko's help for quite a while and they've encouraged me because I have learnt to perform their magic tricks by myself. There are still a few people who are interested in these two first games in general and they also motivated me to finish this project.

This didn't help me to gain anything but I found a way to use those frames to eliminate one lag frame off the stage which was satisfying enough for me. I've also tried to find a constant way to manipulate Heatman's vulnerability timer without success. I know that RTA people tend to get close to him but that's fully understandable because you need to react. If you're interested to see how Heatman behaves, look at $B2 value.

Item 1 values were not allowed to go wild and manipulating them was getting harder and harder every step I took. I can say that the cloud area was the most evil of them all. I needed a correct amount of lag before DelayRightScroll to make proper frame rule shifting. As a bonus I needed Item 1 values that worked with my zip method at the end of the stage. I found a method to use a pause buffer with Item 1s to make even faster initialization for the zip. I also wait for one frame to manipulate 'perfect' values for Crashman's stage. I was well inside a frame rule so I didn't break anything. This new gate zip trick won't work on many values.

My frame counter value was inside a range where I lost a lot of time. I was getting frustrated which was pretty rare for me when TASing this game. I was quite happy that at some point I found a way to perform DelayDownScroll with Item 2 instead and that meant I didn't have to pick that poopy (shitty) refill anymore. Later I also found a way to perform DelayLadderTech from the right side of the screen. It wasn't so easy to do because after performing that glitch you'd have to position yourself correctly while you drop offscreen. In the next screen after that a shot was required so you could continue climbing inside walls. It's possible to jump on Item 2 and reach the correct Y position to enter the screen with gate(s). This is not possible with Item 1 because it keeps rising. After performing DelayDownScroll I wanted to perform a trick to allow zipping at the fight. That attempt was successful and it reminded me about old runs. I also manipulated Item 1 values for Quickman beforehand.

The value I have for first Item 1 at the beginning allows me to perform leftward zip even faster. At the black area there are some movement tweaks to gain actual frames and a quarter of a pixel that RTA runner fastatcc found out. I gotta thank both paosidufygth and warmCabin for these movement changes as well. At the final long room and after entering the door; I also did some manipulation for Metalman beforehand.

I did a large amount of testing and manipulation back from both Crashman and Quickman to reach this conclusion where I'm actually getting best outcomes out of the box without losing any time. To define a best outcome; I've had manually test different setups for everything I do. Item 1 height script allows you to cheat on that a bit because you can change values. It's a good tool to have around. That was the main key to beat 2*8 frame rules. I also did the second last zip differently but with same timing to allow gate zip to work properly. I also had to use correct RNG seed manipulation back from Heatman's stage for this. Boss fight contains movement tweaks that allows me to eliminate that one pesky lag frame off the charts! Oddly enough I found out that if I do an extra jump in this stage, final dog scroll would fail again at the end of Woodman. I'm certain that there's a bank for sprite processing order because there are other things already tied to the frame parity mess.

	"At the beginning I found a new method to start a zip faster. You need a good amount of luck (correct Item 1 manipulation). I'll tell you how it works; you need to be able to jump from first Item 1 so your isn't one pixel too high. When you jump on the second one, you must make manipulation so you get on that third one without falling off. Then there's a bit of waiting until one of those Item 1s explodes, when that animation is gone you shoot another Item 1 to initiate zip faster. This saved a bunch of frames (5 if my memory serves right) and it allowed me not to wait for so long at DelayDownScroll section anymore. Actually I was able to perform DelayDownScroll 40 frames faster this time. I had to be careful how I shoot Metal Blades around because they seem to make first and last DelayScrolls to fail at Woodman. This had something to do with frame parity, first Item 1 speed and pixel processing. I noticed this with my previous run but I had this haunting me all day long this time. I think it's worth to note that if I change some shots back from Flashman, they will make the last doge scroll fail as well. I've seen some cases where DelayLadderTech wouldn't even work at Crashman after doing such cosmetic changes. This also limits the manipulation pool I'm playing with.

	"Time to get wild. Dying at high Y position and off-screen at a previous battle makes this setup possible. Now I need to gather one frame of lag for frame rule shifting purposes, make Battos and Robbit to be in sync with their movements. DelayUpScroll here relies heavily on Robbit's carrot launch animation. I also need to make sure that both Batto's opens their wings at the same frame. And last, I need to generate/mix sound by using jumps. I need to aim for a certain Y range to succeed. Those bats don't like to cooperate most of the time because only one of them opens and the other one sleeps. After performing that trick I did a lot of different lag setups but this was the best outcome I've found so far. Because there are many DelayDownScrolls involved. I gathered some lag before them for frame rule counter shifting and checked if the next DelayDownScroll even works after my changes. I also noticed that some of my changes beforehand locked certain X/subpixels values being used for DelayDownScroll. I had to make sure I can reach X=40.XXX instead of X=39.XXX at the final DelayDownScroll. Sometimes it did not work so I played at random to change it. Before the boss fight I do some manipulation for Wily 1 stage. Time savings comes purely from different lag handling so frame rule shifting is heavily involved.

Also, my strategy is to be as minimal as possible because picking up refills are deadly for two reasons: they do take an unnecessary amount of time, they will mess your $1C timings and if $1C value is in a bad range; you'll get further penalties. This stage doesn't offer any major changes other than I refuse to use one Item 1 at the tower. This loses around 20 frames in that section but after beating the stage I'm only 8 frames slower. This is because I abused $1C's behavior. I need to kill Mecha Dragon at multiple of 16 frame value to bypass some waiting and my gameplay was perfect for that. So it was totally worth not to use that Item 1 at all for greater good. I need to make $1C to align later on as well and this was a good start for it.

One of the oldest cooperative persons around since 2005 or so.

		": He likes to fiddle on different routes which looks pretty random to me at times. Poked me many times that I should watch paosidufygth’s PSX Rockman 2 TAS for possible strategies and that was a good thing for him to do. It helped. This person is more focused on the zipless route but there are things that might apply to my work as well. Being talkative is a good trait for sure. Filled with passion, I guess? He likes to write useful scripts as a bonus.
