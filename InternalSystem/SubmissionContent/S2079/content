	"This is my improvement over JXQ's 100% Super Metroid run, it is 2 minutes and 34 seconds faster than his version in realtime, or 9249 frames, and ~1 minute and 51 seconds faster ingame, or 6636 frames. Ingame clock stands at 00:36:03:43, yes I know, ouch :(

[div class=p 
	"The 3 main improvements here are the torizo skip (21+ seconds) the mother brain stand up glitch (~15 seconds) and the routechange. Don't really know how much it saved though, due to trouble with comparing the routes completely, but it has 6 less doors and less backtracking, so maybe 10-15 seconds in realitime. The rest of the time is largely due to a lot of new room strategies, general optimization, and for realtime, minimizing door scrolling (without this I would actually have reached 00:35 quite easily...).

	"As many probably know this started out as a team project between me and hero of the day. However, as he gained less and less time to work on the run I gained more, and in the end I did virtually all the work on the actual run, though hero still suggested ideas of improvements and new tricks, and the finial time would have been seconds higher without him. Thus he thought it would have been unfair to include him as an author of the run when submitting.

[div class=p 
	"Yes that is right, this run does not have any input animations, which I guess will gain me some no votes, but I had my reasons for not using them.
	$LF
	"I think the main reason they where so awesome in JXQ's run (besides him being an extraordinary comedian) was that the whole concept was new, it was the first run to use anything like that, naturally this run could not top that no matter what I would have animated. And since JXQ is a very funny guy I would have had little chance doing so anyway, and I think anything not as good as his work would simply be seen as redundant to the movie, and perhaps even as a bad attempt to copy his idea. Naturally I was not very eager to spend hours upon hours doing something that I predicted would be seen as mediocre, but I did actually start to add some input a bit into the run (some of which you can still see the bottom line of), and had a few thousand frames covered. It ended up in the trash bin though as I never really got very satisfied with them.
