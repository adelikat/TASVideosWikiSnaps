	"Star Control is a game hybrid borrowing elements from Asteroids and Archon. The game mode in this run is called melee. In the melee mode the goal is to destroy all spacecraft of the enemy faction. There are two factions, Hierarchy and Alliance. Both factions have 7 unique spacecraft. Each spaceraft has a normal attack and a special attack. Each ship also has unique rules for fuel consumption and fuel regeneration.

We can also time our shots to connect just when the enemy runs out of fuel and there is a short gap when the shield is offline. First shot and launched fighters are decoys to deplete his fuel faster.
