	"My run essentially replaces the contents of Pokemon Yellow's RAM with the data necessary to play the entire end-of-game sequence from GBC Link's Awakening, i.e. beginning immediately after the wind fish fade-out and continuing all the way to "The End".  Not surprisingly, it takes a substantial amount of time to write all of that data; the total payload is about 690kB, and as we're only able to do 1 byte per frame, 690kB / (60 B/s) = just over three hours.
