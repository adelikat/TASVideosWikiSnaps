	"There was a bit of a kerfuffle over the level of optimization in the original GEG submission, as there were some (at the time) minor improvements found in it. While the Judges were all on board with accepting the run anyway, since the initial found improvements were quite small, it sparked some looking into this game to see exactly HOW much could be saved over the submission. The main thing the submission did wrong was copying the 56 minute run by DaJaWi a little too closely: It collects a star that's slightly out of the way, because in the full run these stars are needed, but in the GEG run they're not, so the collected star in the GEG run wastes a handful of frames.

[div class=p 
	"Spike provided the majority of input for this movie, going through from the beginning to see if there were any other GEG-specific improvements lying in wait. Their work (which originally ended just before the enemies and the out-of-the-way star) was passed over to EZGames, who optimized that section and continued to the end, bringing the total amount of found improvement to 41 frames. This became 53 frames with a faster implementation of the cutscene trigger. On a whim, and because I have a personal vendetta against JK Rowling and her stupid dumb book series that's complete garbage, I decided to mess around and see what I could find. Granted, all four of us have a personal vendetta against JK "wizards teleport their poop out of their butts, oh and also I received high honors for how much I hate trans people" Rowling, but that's besides the point. I managed to save a cast of Flipendo on the barrel at the beginning of the trial by finding a way to clip through the edge of it (this is done in the movie). Thinking that there could be more to this, I decided to try a few things. On a second, more lucrative whim, I pushed said barrel backwards as far as it could go, thinking I could pull some literal magic and maybe find a way to trigger the ending earlier...

	"As you can tell from the fact that this submission is here and I was strong-armed into taking top credit for it, I did. Oh and then EZGames improved the GEG by two frames and got input back into the movie after I cut out literally everything he did in the original improvement with the new clip. Oh and then CasualPokePlayer saved 4 more frames.

	"I'm personally calling it the Trans Rights Clip, because I know it would piss off JK Rowling if she ever cared about anything but denying the existence of trans people, but names more appropriate for communities that also suck as much as JK Rowling include Barrel Clip and Clipendo (which is much more my style but not as much as the Trans Rights Clip). There's a weird quirk with that barrel where the hitbox is maybe a little too accurate to how a barrel is shaped, at the detriment of allowing for some weirdness with clipping and ejection and other fun 8 letter words. My original find, as I said, was the first clip through the barrel to get past it without needing another Flipendo cast. This was achieved by simply running at the thing while slightly inside the left-hand wall. Gary Otter or whatever his name is "corrects" himself eventually if you push against a corner, and when he starts moving again he will be closer to the wall than he normally would be if you'd just pressed against it normally. This same "correction" behavior is what causes the clip to work, as he gets "corrected" on the barrel, allowing him to slip through.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"That also leads into the actual wall clip as well, as you need to be "in" the wall for it to work. Pushing down into the barrel from above while "in" the wall will constantly try and have Jerry "Welcome Back" Kotter correct off to the side, which he can't because there's this dang wall in the way. Flipendo comes in handy here, as it allows Mary Rotter to clip into the wall for some reason. The barrel needs to be all the way at the bottom because Flipendo will still hit it and cause it to move away. One cast isn't enough, you get halfway into the wall like that and can't keep going, so two are required to clip far enough in to be able to escape out the other side. Afterward, since we're right next to what triggers the GEG, all that Larry Daughter has to do is run downward and throw his hands out slightly in order to end the game with a glitch. Long story short, Perry Saturn casts a spell at the griffin door and gets the Sauciest Bone or whatever. Ron "The Truth" Weasley and Hermione "Why Did JK Rowling Start My Name With Herm When She Hates Trans People So Much" Granger also appear in this film. Stay tuned for the TED talk about the BDSM elves. Dobby? More like "dom me".

Since you're still in the tutorial section, the game hasn't actually updated what cutscene gets triggered, and it happens to be initialized to the very last cutscene leading into the ending credits, proving once and for all that video games are art and The Life of Pablo Honey isn't.
