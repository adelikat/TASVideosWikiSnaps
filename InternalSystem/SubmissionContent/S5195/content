	"Two other major timesavers where found during the creation of the run. First I found a way to extend the Ice Glitch found in the previus run that I'll refer to this as the Extended Ice Glitch. Secondly I found how to increase your jumping height in the water level that I'll refer to this as the Water Glitch.

	"Maximum damage can normally only be dealt by charging the club to maximum "Power". With this glitch however you only need to chrage it once. After the first blow just push B as the first frame where the game allows you to start another blow, and the second blow will deal as much damage as the first one. This can then be repeated as many times as one like.

	"Instead of (as in the old run) continuously holding right throughout the glitch abuse, and thus having to reset the speed everytime it surpasses a certain value - 112 to be exact, you can let go of that button after you hit a high enough speed and from that point on only push it every 4th frame. That way you'll neither increase nor drop in speed, though you're still limited by the maximum speed that the screen can scroll (4 pixels / frame) as you can't outrun it.

	"When you jump under water your vertical speed only decreases every 4th frame. If you attack on this specific frame your speed won't decrease. The character will stop for a frame everytime you attack so it should only be abused when absolutely needed.
