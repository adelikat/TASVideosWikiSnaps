Instead I'm using a different way to make bombs explode faster (Which isn't always faster if you have to travel wtih the bomb). And that is to throw the bomb as soon as you pick it up. It's about 30 frames faster but takes longer to set up compared to the roll-lift.

	"- As the glitch is still active, I'm able to walk on the holes. Remember that I can't roll at this point, as it will make me fall. You have to make a little trick when you jump down the fence, because you can't get down with the glitch activated, and that is to roll after you have jumped. When you land you have to make sure the platform is below you, or the hole eats your soul. I was happy to see that I didn't have to wait for the platform at all, didn't expect that.

	"- I'm far from satisfied with the double darknut fight... Fighting one is usually pretty easy, but it gets complicated with another one. You can only slash them on the sides or the back (With the exception of them making a specific attack) and with each hit both you and the darknut will be pushed away. There's no way this fight is optimised, but I simply couldn't do it any better. Anyone is free to give it a shot!

	"- Finally having all keys, it's time to get the big key, which was actually harder than I thought. The reason to this is that the pots often contain a green rupee. As I haven't picked up any green rupees in the game, I'm getting a message if I grab one. 3 frames were lost to manipulate them to not appear.

	"- Last three rooms before the boss. First one wasn't too bad. With more health it would probably be faster to get hit by him. Having no health, I used my sword to give me a boost.

	"For the next room there are 10 enemies in your way while you have take your 3 clones with you to the buttons. Having all them out of your path isn't realistic (But probably do able with huge luck manipulation). I think I did well enough to only slashing them once.

	"This darknut fight almost made me quit the run, even though I'm just before the boss. I didn't touch the run for like 2 weeks. I just couldn't get a good fight which I could be satisfied with. One darknut is easy to task, two are crazy hard but three... that's just impossible to do right.

	"- Vaati #2: Same as with the boss in Palace of Winds, if you hit all the eyes quickly enough you don't have to use clones. You have to manipulate the eyes to be on the fastest side to shoot them, as well as manipulation where Vaati is heading. This wasn't all that difficult, just annoying. It sucks that only two hits were needed the last round, nothing I could do about it.

	"- Vaati #3: It's the final boss time! And as always, you have to manipulate his attacks and movement. First you need to get rid of his arms. If you make it appear in front of the "shrinking thing", you can be pushed inside as soon as you become Minish.

	"For the last phase, I could have killed my clones to roll and slash him earlier (As I did for the final blow), it isn't any faster however. You'll be able to slash more, but not to more damage. Also, you can't stand any closer when hitting the balls the eyes shoot. If you hit the eyes with them too early, they won't die.
