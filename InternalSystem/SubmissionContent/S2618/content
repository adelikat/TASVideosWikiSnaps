	"I don't understand this game, but I've been told that it's really funny for Japanese people. What is funny for the rest of us is that there is an emulator bug where the game stops receiving input for several seconds. See if you can find this bug!

	":  We usually prefer a high % of yes votes to be considered a strong viewer response so this was kind of borderline.  Having said that, the response was good enough, and a number of people seem to be enthusiastic about this TAS (for whatever reason).  I'll accept it.
