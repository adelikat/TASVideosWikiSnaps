	"Dodgem Arena is a futuristic racing game that takes place in 2049 AD. In this racing sports game four players are controlling so-called "Dodgems" that hover in huge bowl-shaped arenas. An ice hockey puck can be picked up from a dispenser, said puck can be shot into a goal that moves around the arena.

The first round starts with four pucks, the second with three, the third with two, until one is left in the final round. Three opponents battle against you in each arena.

	"This TAS took me by surprise. The more I watched and understood what was happening the more enjoyable the TAS became.  Technically proficient with a lot of subtle movements and tricks weaved throughout, this is quite impressive.  Particularly enjoyed the speed of a lot of sections here and how even during those sections there are precise tricks being performed.  A playaround for this game changing out vehicles with only one round being available for each level was the right way to go. This gives a good mix of change without things becoming stale.  Happy to accept this playaround TAS!
