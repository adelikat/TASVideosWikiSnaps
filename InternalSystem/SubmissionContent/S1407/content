Canceling out the long fall drop and canceling out the attack animation are definitely apparent and abused throughout this run.  Also Alucard can do the attack animation canceling trick that Grant can do, the one coming up from the ducking position.  Enough of what to come, I shall now go into somewhat depth of the run's details.  Patronizing will occur as well as words repeated from the movie text from both the Grant Path and Sypha Path.

The second part of the area reveals that the bat's use is very helpful.  Getting into one-block height crevices is very difficult as it has to be very precise for smooth motion.  The very last part before Frankenstein, that crevice is weird, it requires movement at such an odd angle in order to get into it.  Frankenstein isn't too big of a deal but this one is stronger (as I've mentioned) so it takes longer to kill.

Now this is the craziest part, I have Alucard continually jump and fire his weapon like crazy, be sure check that out.  Trevor fights the boss and I believe this is the fastest manner of defeating them.  Before I pick the orb up you'll here the sound of Trevor firing his whip at 30 hertz but with no attack animation, it sounds like thick water flowing but water shouldn't be that thick.

Besides I'm not sure it saved much time since you have to go back and catch up with the falling bridge and change to Trevor anyway.
