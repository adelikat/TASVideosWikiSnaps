		"Reverse wall jumps - Pressing Left+Right the frame before jumping off a right wall will cause X to face away from the wall during the wall jump. This can be used to remove travel time back to the wall during the wall jump as well as more readily clear the top corners of some walls with awkward heights by already having X's speed directed towards it when reaching the top, regardless of the point you are at in the jump.

		"Instant 5-damage pink shot - Interrupting the release of the first shot from a first-tier pink charge with a wall tap will cause it to come out as a 2-damage blue shot instead of a 1-damage green shot. This usually requires the player to wait an extra 60 frames after reaching their pink charge as the pink charge has two tiers. This is optimally done off of a right wall as the trick can be done out of a reverse wall jump. It can also be done on left walls, but your first charge shot will be released into the wall as X cannot turn around for the release of it. This version is only used once during the run during the first Stag fight when Stag is directly on top of you on the left wall.

This wouldn't be so bad alone, but when you pick up an ammo drop while on buster, Sonic Slicer fills first, requiring you to farm even more than you would otherwise have to. Also, minor variations in movement or inputs can randomly cause lag frames, and you barely have enough time to kill him before he goes into his move where he disappears and spawns right on top of you. In fact, the wall dust sprite I kicked up at the very end of the fight manipulated a different pattern from that which bought me just enough time to kill him.

However, this version of the fight is even harder to manipulate mid-fight than the original (you can only do optimal glitched pink shots off of a right wall, which can be very far from the wall of the room in this fight, as well as not being able to kick up wall dust sprites while firing them as glitched pink shots are done out of a reverse wall jump instead of wall sliding), basically meaning I would have to re-do the fight from the beginning an indefinite number of times if that pattern was too far away in the RNG sequence, which it was in this case. It is already hard enough to get RNG that allows you to even start the fight, so I decided it wasn't worth it to manipulate RNG that carried through to the end with little mid-fight manipulation for the sake of 4 frames. I did try a few times though.
