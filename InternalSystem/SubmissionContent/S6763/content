	"5000 points are required in order to enter the Super Rollerblade Challenge. Finishing with 10000, 15000, and 20000 gets you 3rd, 2nd, and 1st place respectively. You do still see a credits screen for finishing as low as 3rd place. Initially I ended with fewer thank 20000 points and intended to make 1st place a part of the goal choice, but when I went back to improve the score I also found improvements that allowed me to reach 20000 points without losing time.

	"The basic strategy is pretty straight forward, get to the max speed (896 in a 2-byte value at 0x4AE) and keep it. Achieving the required score means doing a lot of jumping, and you do lose some speed each time you land. Generally your speed goes down to 888 and then back up to 896, and it seems this is high enough to avoid losing time.

[div class=p 
	"Normally jumping at full speed (backscratcher jump) nets you 75 points, but we can get a big head start on points in the Neighborhood stage by doing helicopter jumps. The idea behind the helicopter jump is that it takes more air time to execute and therefore must be done over a curb or stairs. The Neighborhood curb is the only curb that seems to work, but it also only checks if you cross over, so we can jump up, down, or even just out over the curb and back. Since the helicopter jump is good for 300 points this gets us a good start. The other main sources of points are from jumping over barrels and for time remaining on the clock at the end of a stage.
