		"Lufia: The Legend Returns

	" is the third entry in the Lufia game series, hence its frequent referencing by 
	[em 
		"Lufia 3
	]em
	". Released in 2000 for the Game Boy Color, it kept many of the things that made its two SNES prequels awesome, such as the music, Sinistrals, humor. It also changed many things that may have contributed to the game being not as appreciated, such as the absence of puzzles and procedurally generated dungeons. That's right: aside from the bosses and overworld encounters, enemies can only be fought on randomized floors à-la Ancient Cave. Like Lufia 2, the enemies are visible outside of battle, move only as you do and you only fight them when moving next to them. Add in a bunch of typos and many uses of what Nintendo probably considered a bad word then, and you've got yourself a classic.

	"Greetings! I'm juef, and this is my first TAS attempt at this game. I have wanted to TAS this game for a very long time, because it is definitely overlooked, but mostly because of its incredible TAS potential due to the tremendous amount of random stuff. I delayed the production a lot because I didn't feel adequate enough to try it, but lately I finally felt like it was time. While I expected a bigger time difference compared to the RTA run, I am extremely satisfied with this TAS, considering most of the actual game is advancing textboxes in the numerous cutscenes, or waiting for the floors to be generated while navigating dungeons. Please note that I have not looked into save corruption: this is a glitchless, saveless run.

	": Ok there are a lot of details to this run. From the moment I started analyzing this movie (side-by-side with the WR), I noticed a few odd things that I thought were missed. Looks like these occurrences are explained mostly in your submission. One that I particularly relate to is how you change the layout of floors (in the dungeons) to get the optimal layout for your needs. Frame delays/advancements are usually the only options, when RNG can't be forced any other way. Because of these situations, it is clear why this TAS totally destroys the WR by roughly 2 hours. Great job on the amazing time!
