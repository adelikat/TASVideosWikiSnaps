The player is supposed to progress through dungeons and seal lairs in order to reconstruct the towns and release the people. Each world has one or more dungeons and is concluded by a boss fight. In the first six worlds, beating the boss releases a main character who gives you a magic stone. Stones are the main plot items in this game: getting all six of them will grant you access to the last world, the World of Evil.
	$LF
	"The player starts the game in the Master's Shrine, which acts like a "hub" for the game. You can go there for a health refill, to save your game, or to travel to another world you've unlocked. In each world, the Master's Shrine can have up to three teleporters: one leads to the town, and the other two are intended to be shortcuts into the dungeons (they have to be unlocked by sealing the appropriate monster lairs).

So, basically, you are forced to move by chunks of 8 pixels, unless you hit a corner or use slopes or conveyor belts, which can offset you by some pixels. It can be useful sometimes to be offset to trigger spawns early, but most of the time, being offset is a nuisance because you can't activate monster lair buttons (you need to stand pixel-perfectly on the monster lair tile).

	"With the exception of the Phoenix at the end of the game, all the magic you cast comes out of the Magician's Orb circling around the hero. Fireballs for instance will be cast in the direction the hero is facing. There is some delay between pressing Y to trigger magic and the moment when the fireball is actually cast, so it is possible to change directions in the meantime to redirect the fireball. Crab-walking fixes the direction the hero is facing, making it more convenient to use magic and send it the correct way.
	$LF
	"The Magician's Orb will always rotate counter-clockwise, and nothing can alter that. But you have some control on the center of that rotation. The center of rotation will generally be the hero, but there are some ways to change that:
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		" If you move towards a wall or a solid object, your character won't move but the center of rotation will. You can use that to send the Orb further away, generally to kill some enemies early. Note that you can move towards a wall while facing any other direction, thanks to crab-walking.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" The hero receives movement instructions by chunks of 4 frames (see Movement above), but every single frame counts for the movement of the Magician's Orb. For example, if you only input movement once every 4 frames, your character will move normally but the center of rotation of the Orb will only move once every four frames. It's a way to "leave behind" the Orb; however, there is a maximal allowed distance between you and the Orb. Another example: if you have to move a certain way, but you want the Orb to move another, you can input 1 out of 4 frames the direction you want to go, and fill the rest of the 3 frames with directions you want the Orb to go. Note that the direction hierarchy (described above in Movement) matters a lot when doing this. For instance, if you input a continuous diagonal Up+Right, the hero will move right but the Orb will move up-right. If you want the hero to move up instead, the best you can do is to hold Up, and only hold Right 23 frames out of 24, to prevent the directional priority from taking effect. To sum up, you can control the Magician's Orb to some extent, but there are some strong limitations, the biggest one being the rotation itself which you can't prevent.

But when an enemy is spawned, it doesn't need to be visible on the screen to be loaded, meaning that it can still wear off its initial invincibility frames while off-screen. It is a very intersting property when dealing with several monster lairs at once: you can get close to a lair to spawn an enemy, and then go back and deal with something else because you have to wait for the enemy's 93 frames of invincibility anyway.

Bear in mind that any type of screen warp counts as leaving the room, especially, sealing a monster lair which releases something in the town. Indeed, when doing so, the game warps you to the location of the thing or person you released, and then warps you back; that really counts as a screen transition, and any active lairs will be reset.

Therefore, you can manipulate RNG by waiting for a certain number of frames before entering a room, or before skipping through the textboxes when releasing something or someone in the town. RNG values are used mostly for gem drops, but also for random enemy or boss decisions. There's relatviely few enemies in the game which make random decisions, so the biggest interest in manipulating RNG is to trigger good gem drops.
	$LF
	"There's three kinds of gems: small (worth 1 gem), medium (worth 5) and large (worth 10). The probability of getting medium and large gems is very small in the first world, but it increases as you progress through worlds. In the last world, you can only get medium and large gems! As explained above, you can impact the list of RNG values used in a certain room, but not every single value, making it impossible to manipulate every single gem drop. The idea is to try entering rooms at different frames and predict the RNG values you will get (I have a Lua script for that), then pick the one which seems better, without sacrificing too many frames of course.

You are forced to backtrack to the town for the elevator and to speak to Lisa, so I use deathwarps for that. In Leo's Painting, the torch room in the beginning is really fast to do with a lot of gems, and looks pretty sweet. I have some fun with the armored enemies when I have time to spare between spawns, or when I am dealing with a multi-spawn lair (because only the last kill needs to be optimised in that case).

	"This act is much harder to optimise than the first act, mostly because of the required gem manipulation to kill all the enemies as efficiently as possible. I had to make concessions about gem usage though, to keep most of them for the Light Shrine where I can make the best use of them. Bushes are annoying: they move randomly (which potentially "uses up" an RNG value for a good gem drop), and they require 2 hits from fireballs to be killed. The best way is to kill them from bottom to top so that the same fireball can hit twice. There's another trick to defeat those disappearing lizardmen: spawn one, then leave the screen and wait some frames. Then shoot magic and put the lizardman on screen again. If done correctly, you can shoot him with magic without him disappearing. That is why I get the 100-gem chest in Fire Shrine, so I can do this trick on a lot of them for maximum timesave. I also need to conserve a decent amount of gems for the beginning of the next act.

	"The Zombie Lair Seal glitch has been used twice to save one hit for deathwarps. I don't save a full 32 frames though because manipulating gorillas into throwing rocks takes a few extra frames. The general plan for Act 3 is to manage to trigger level 9 just after getting the Critical Sword in Durean (the volcano island) and before the last monster lair, where I need to walk on lava. To achieve this, I try to kill a lot of un-necessary enemies without losing time, to build up EXP points. The whole point of that strategy is to skip the herb in Rockbird (the island before Durean), which saves several seconds. In the second half of Act 3, I demonstrate the awesome power of the Critical Sword, notably by one-shotting crabs, which normally take a long time to kill. I also get the Strength Bracelet which doubles my attack power; it's useful for all bosses and all the enemies I can't kill with crits or magic, such as the metal enemies of Leo's Lab, or the ghosts in Magridd Castle.

Act 4 is probably the biggest act in terms of monster lair multi-tasking, so I had to come up with a lot of clever solutions, making the run hopefully more interesting. I sometimes use crits to kill bats and sometimes don't, because crits are not always faster than using magic. Indeed, even if it takes 9 frames to kill a bat with magic, it might still be faster than waiting for the correct frame to get a critical hit (it happens every 16 frames). The room with the Lucky Blade is by far the most difficult to optimise because there are so many possible routes through it. The one I ended up using was the best one in terms of multi-tasking and crit abuse. At the end of the act, rescuing the grandmas is required to get Phoenix at the end of the game. Curiously, it's not the Mountain King who gives you the 4th stone, but Nome, the snail.

Damage management was not easy to plan, but I think I made the most with all the damage I could take. This also demonstrates that getting the herb in Act 4 is probably a good idea. After the first deathwarp, I don't re-equip the Magic Armor immediately in order to save one menu access. I re-equip it after the second Model Town, at the same menu where I switch back to the Zantetsu Sword. The Zantetsu Sword is necessary to kill the boss, Tin Doll, which is made of metal.

I didn't find a way to predict where and when they reappear after disappearing, so the best way was to try my best to have them not disappear. I still have a few of them disappear, but only when it's not an issue (they reappear before the last ghost is killed). A lot of trial and error was involved for ghost lairs. I also kill a lot of un-necessary enemies for EXP because it really starts mattering in Act 6. Snakes give 600 EXP, mimics give 1000 EXP, etc. It is a great way to already save time in the big grind to level 24, which comes up in the last act. I get a Strange Bottle to save a lot of gems especially for the first room of the Left Tower, where I use a lot of magic to multi-task lairs and kill enemies in advance. The bird boss has two possible patterns but I want one of them specifically, so fortunately I managed to manipulate it by only sacrificing one frame before the fight. After beating this boss, you could go to the house where the Queen was in order to get the Super Bracelet, but even if it's not too out of the way it wouldn't save any time for a TAS, so I skip it.

After getting the Soul Blade, I choose to go back to do the grinding now instead of later, because it involves less travel and makes better use of the time spent killing the flies. I had to make some EXP calculations to know exactly how much EXP was needed, so I'm glad I needed almost exactly a whole number of 3-brick kill cycles (worth 12000 EXP each). Fun fact: it looks like it would be faster to only kill 2 bricks per cycle instead of 3, but that's wrong. It's almost true though: 3 cycles of 2 are only 4 frames slower than 2 cycles of 3!

In US, there is a conveyor belt in the middle (going down), and the ones on the sides go up. The strategy is to go to one side, tap down to stay at the same altitude to make sure you hit the boss constantly and don't get hit by his body. It's much more difficult in real-time.

	"It was definitely possible to use Zombie Lair Seal for the two lairs before the first two deathwarps, but unfortunately I didn't think of that back then (even though I was aware that the glitch existed). It would have probably saved 32 frames on the first deathwarp (if you can get a blue slime to kill you on the lair), but probably less than that on the second deathwarp because you might need to wait until a torch or the last lair enemy shoots at you. Before the first deathwarp, I also had enough gems to kill one more enemy with magic and save 8 frames, but it's difficult to plan gems ahead with all the RNG uncertainties thrown in. In Leo's Paintings, I could have saved a frame when opening the Medical Herb chest if I were crab-walking facing north instead of turning north in front of the chest. Also, the orb's position was terrible before the block enemies so I had to walk into them to get the orb aligned properly. Maybe this could have been avoided if I thought about shooting one "useless" fireball to freeze the orb for a moment. I couldn't solve that situation only with regular orb movement manipulation.

The first room before Water Shrine could definitely be faster with better RNG, but the result I got was the best through all the possibilities I tested (unfortunately, I don't want to spend months testing every single possibility). Also, I chose to backtrack to the teleporter after finishing Fire Shrine, instead of revealing the teleporter sooner, get the Strange Bottle, and deathwarp. I'm pretty sure my route is faster for the US version but it might not be so in JP (I didn't formally test it). Death in JP is less costly because the Master's text is much faster. Though, even if my route is slower, it is definitely not by a huge amount. The waiting in the Fire Shrine before the second upward bridge was awful, but here again, I didn't find any way to counter the bad orb positioning. Getting the 100-gem chest is a good investment but costs time, and I wonder if one could manipulate enough gems to remain efficient in Light Shrine without getting the chest. It is hard to tell. Finally, there's one lizardman I didn't kill with magic in the dark room of the Light Shrine, but maybe I could have. I would have had only 27 gems for Southerta but that might have been enough actually.

	"At the beginning of the seabed, the first jellyfish kill is far from optimal, but that was in order to get excellent gem drops from these first fights. There's often tradeoffs between pure efficiency and being conservative for gems. At the end of Rockbird, I'm not certain if it was really necessary to remove my armor to optimise the deathwarp, but I couldn't find any faster way to take damage. And unfortunately, my plan to get level 9 in Durean pretty much imposed level 8 a bit before dying in Rockbird, making things more difficult in that area. Although, we're talking more about frames than seconds. Durean was quite hard on gem manipulation, so I had to stop for a bit to get a big gem from one of the rock enemies. Also, after rewatching my TAS, I discovered that I missed a way to die faster at the end of Durean: if I had taken one more damage from gorillas, I wouldn't have needed to do that little waiting on the lava before the lair, and saved 29 frames.

So I didn't go with the RTA strat and chose my second-best strat, which features more multi-tasking and eventually generates more gems. You can consider that a speed-entertainment tradeoff of about 20 to 30 frames. In the first room of Lune, I also sacrificed 3 frames to get the red wizard gems just before they disappeared. But as I finished Act 4 with 30 gems, those extra few gems were probably not necessary. The room before the boss fight also has so many possibilities that I didn't test all of them, so again, I'm certain there has to be some other slightly better way. Also, I had to wait a few frames to crit a wizard at some point, so there's that at least.
