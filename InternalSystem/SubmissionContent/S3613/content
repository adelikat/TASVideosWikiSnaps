	"I mix everything up for the most part to avoid move being repeated too often. Sometimes I have a special ready, but I don't use it to avoid predictability of the run. I studied a bit of SDR's runs of SFII:HE to see how he does it. Mainly I saw that he gives the fighters a chance to hit and throws them to the other side.

	": I'll reject this. The viewer feedback is quite poor, and additionally, despite the TAS not being very long, it manages to be quite repetitive, repeating the same combo's many times over again. The run doesn't have much to offer other than repeated, quickly done target combo's and occasional perfect parrying. It doesn't show much of what the Street Fighter 3 series is capable of; for that purpose, a Third Strike run with the character Twelve would probably be the best way to go for a publishable TAS of the Street Fighter 3 series as a whole.

	" displays that there is a lot more potential in New Generation Dudley that wasn't shown in the TAS, showing that it could've been quite better entertainment-wise. But at this point it isn't good enough or received well enough, and because of that, I'll reject this TAS.
