	"Street Fighter III: New Generation is the amazing sequel of Street Fighter II, and the beginning that spawned the more famous titles of 2nd Impact and Third Strike. This one wasn't as well recieved as the others for the lack of SFII characters other than Ryu or Ken.

	"I chose to do a TAS of Dudley as I found the ones on YouTube didn't display proper combos such as the 5 hit combo or any of the other target combos. Juggling is cool for the first couple rounds but they seem to drag it on too long.

	"In this run I show how a real Dudley player would do it, and not do silly one trick pony shows.

	"I picked New Generation also because there is only 7 people to go through, so it doesn't drag on too like some of the Third Strike gruefood on here. Not to mention New Generation/2nd Impact ending for Dudley is the same, so why not pick the faster way to get it.

	"For all the fighters on here I try to parry or trick the AI into letting me hit them to initiate a combo/special/super.

	"I mix everything up for the most part to avoid move being repeated too often. Sometimes I have a special ready, but I don't use it to avoid predictability of the run. I studied a bit of SDR's runs of SFII:HE to see how he does it. Mainly I saw that he gives the fighters a chance to hit and throws them to the other side.

	"Overall this run went fairly fast even though it wasn't intentional. I tried to keep some of the fighters alive as much as I could to get enough combos in.

	"I rerecord openings numerous times to get the best target combo. Not just to undo from getting hit or blocked.

	"There was originally a plan to do a 2P with Dudley vs Elena with the healing special to get a long combo fest in from both. However it seemed to drag on too slow and didn't look impressive.

The run doesn't have much to offer other than repeated, quickly done target combo's and occasional perfect parrying. It doesn't show much of what the Street Fighter 3 series is capable of; for that purpose, a Third Strike run with the character Twelve would probably be the best way to go for a publishable TAS of the Street Fighter 3 series as a whole.

	" displays that there is a lot more potential in New Generation Dudley that wasn't shown in the TAS, showing that it could've been quite better entertainment-wise. But at this point it isn't good enough or received well enough, and because of that, I'll reject this TAS.
