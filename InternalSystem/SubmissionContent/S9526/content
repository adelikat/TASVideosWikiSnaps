	"Yet another of my childhood favourites. Although I played this on DOS, this port plays exactly the same as that one. This game is the official English league translation of 
	[a href=https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga_Manager#Bundesliga_Manager_Professional rel=noopener external nofollow 
		"Bundesliga Manager Professional
	]a
	" (BMP), a soccer management game. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"BMP was way better than all other managers at the time thanks to its intuitive interface, engaging gameplay and hilarious animations. Funny fact, the version I actually used to play was a bootleg version of this game where player and team names were changed to fit the Argentinian league at the time. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Although the game can be played on 'Continuous' mode, in this movie I decided play the single-season, hardest difficulty (5) game mode to provide a clear ending. The single-season mode restricts some decisions like sponsor management that tends to offer multi-year contracts. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"I decided to go for the 'win all games' goal to provide a more satisfying experience to the viewers. Although it is possible to reach the end of the season by losing the tournaments early (saving a lot of frames), that would be a questionable decision. Instead, I kept it simple and enjoyable by forcing myself to win everything.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The movie includes some following entertainment / speed tradeoffs. For example, I decided to leave animations on. Although this is a huge waste of frames, animations are the soul of the game and it would be a huge disservice not to provide them. By disabling animations you get a much quicker yet blander "Goal / No Goal" image.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Another e/s tradeoff is the match I had against Arsenal at 44:00. Although I could have manipulated it to end sooner, it was a thrilling event and didn't want to take it away from the viewers.

[div class=p 
	"Immediately after starting, I take a 1 millon quid loan from the bank that I never intend to repay. I also put some of my surplus players at sale to get even more quick money. I then use the money to pay the loan interests and continuously send my players to training camps (they last ~2 weeks) where their stats increase much faster than otherwise. By doing this I quickly become the best team in the league.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"For training, I reduce intensity to prevent exhaustion and assign the most balls to goalkeeping and forward. This increases the chance of better outcomes for defending/attacking opportunities, respectively. By reducing midfield and defense balls I tend to reduce the number of overall opportunities, which saves frames.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"During matches I manipulate luck by making timely substitutions. Although the main goal is to affect the final score, I sometimes make them to prevent red cars (multi-week suspensions), match injuries, and even ulterior training injuries. Besides substitutions, you can also manipulate RNG by changing the "Struggle" setting, which I guess indicates how rough the players will be in fighting for the ball.
