	"The run, naturally, is very well done. Entertaining, full of both normal swag and hashtag swag, and still incredibly hard to follow with Lara's usual reality warping powers. There are a couple of technical things I'd like to go over, though, as they're pretty important!
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"First, this run does not 
	[em 
		"actually
	]em
	" collect all secrets because a programming error in the game prevents that from being possible. In The Great Pyramid (the final area, for those like me who aren't super familiar with Tomb Raider), two different secrets trigger the same flag. More specifically, the "first" and "third" secrets both set the flag for the first secret. This means that if one is triggered, the other one cannot be, making it completely impossible to actually collect 3 out of 3 secrets in this area. Therefore, despite 
	[em 
		"technically
	]em
	" not accomplishing the goal by the metrics of the stat screen, this run does accomplish its goal of collecting all obtainable secrets.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Secondly, on the note of the stat screen, I'd like to make a note about full completion for this game. The RTA community defines full completion as collecting all secrets (except the impossible one), killing all enemies, and collecting all pickups, as these three things are all shown on the post-level stat screen. I don't quite agree with that definition for one main reason: Secrets are the only thing that has a defined amount per area. Kills and pickups are tracked, yes, but the stat screen doesn't show precisely how many 
	[em 
		"possible
	]em
	" kills and pickups there are. While there are, in theory, finite amounts of enemies and pickups, the fact that they're not explicitly tracked as such means it isn't easy to determine whether or not 100% has actually been achieved without putting in the effort to double check.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"On top of that, the fastest 100% RTA run of this game is well over twice as long as this TAS, and that's on the PC version which I imagine is significantly faster. The fastest 100% run on Playstation, while glitchless, is over 
	[em 
		"four times
	]em
	" the length of this run. It's clear that adding in pickups and kills completely breaks the pacing of the run. The TAS would still be much faster than the RTA runs, naturally, but I can't imagine that the extra "content" would make for an exciting watch. On top of THAT, pickups include consumable items, which I really don't think should ever be considered in a 100% definition unless, again, they're explicitly tracked and given a finite number to collect in the stat screen. So, for right now, I'm comfortable calling this full completion for this game. I don't know if a true 100% run would obsolete this or not, but I'm still going to set the comparison here since... I can do that. Part of the job and all.
