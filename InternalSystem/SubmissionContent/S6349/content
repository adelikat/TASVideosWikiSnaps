	"It is known that trying to do the SMW equivalent of the 
	[a class=intlink href=/2676M 
		"SMB walkathon
	]a
	" is impossible. Not pressing either of the run buttons (X and Y) also means you can't hold or throw items, such as the Mechakoopa to defeat Bowser. There was this 
	[a class=intlink href=/1502S 
		"one submission
	]a
	" precisely 12 years ago trying to get around it by never 
	[em 
		"running
	]em
	" (run button + direction). It was rejected for being a somewhat arbitrary goal, because the run button was still used, just not in certain scenarios.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"So then I had the idea for this run. It turns out limiting the player to only a single button per frame is a very effective way to create a similar effect. In SMW, you have to press the run button while pressing a direction to get higher speeds. Since this is prohibited, you have to get creative when trying to be fast.

	"Of course, you're able to defeat Bowser. It's possible to hold items, and it's also possible to throw them in any direction. On the first frame you 
	[em 
		"don't
