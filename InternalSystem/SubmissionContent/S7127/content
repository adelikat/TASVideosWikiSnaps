However, besides the minor timeloss for more HP being lost/sliding down, this will end up dropping Totodile to yellow bar after Falkner. Apparently, being in red/yellow bar entering a battle will cause 5 frames of lag, so maintaining green bar is optimal to avoid this lag.

This is mainly due to Mud-Slap being used, as its accuracy drop has a 1/256 chance to not happen, which is faster due to less text.

However, due to how close the 2 RNG rolls are (with only 1 unrelated RNG call in between) and due to requiring the same value returned for a 1/39 damage roll and 1/256 roll for no accuracy drop, it would require VERY specific RNG with VERY specific rDIV values, and possibly not even worth finding.

Unfortunately, the detour is quite long and requires fighting an optional trainer since I am unable to use Surf without Morty's badge, and eats up a very big chunk of the timesave Rat gets.
