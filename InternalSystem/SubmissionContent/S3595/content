	"Suggested Description:
	$LF
	"Lethal Weapon for the Super Nintendo is one of many ports Ocean Software has done. Among an NES/DOS version. This game certainly seems to be based of Duke Nukem and Commander Keen Style Platformers. Overall the main plot of this game follows just taking down major criminals and arresting Jack Travis.
