It's more many minor improvements than any new major findings. It would be a fairly long list to mention all of them, so I will just call this an update of this category that implements the knowledge about this game that has accumulated over the years up to this point.

	"SpaceColonizer created a complete concept wip last year for this category, but didn't finalize it. After having worked on the any% and the best ending of the U-version, I had the game mechanics fresh in memory and we agreed that I would finalize the J best ending wip. While I worked alone on giving this TAS the final touch in terms of optimization and the latest room solutions (71f in total), the bulk of inputs come from SpaceColonizer (who I believe to some extent based the wip on hisatoki's TAS). Hence the co-authorship.
