		" The Weight-lifting Room: Door trick used at the very start. I gained some time by killing the 2nd weight-lifting eyeball quicker. I later found a very small frame improvement, however when I tried to implement it, it caused horrible luck throughout the next few rooms. I could not manage to save any more frames here due to this. :(
		$LF
	]li

[ul

		" The Crawl Space: I gained a few frames because I managed to jump more times with the Spring Shoes. Each jump with these saves 1 frame, hence the excessive jumping.

	[li 
		" The Air Ducts: Door trick used right when entering here. I gained ~1.5 seconds because I zipped partially through the ceiling right before the door that leads to the basement.

		" The Final Boss: I actually lose 1 frame here just because of the boss' position when entering the room. Had the boss been in the same place, using the same maneuvers, I think I would have gained 10 frames or so. This boss was very difficult to optimize because of the double-hit trick. I don't think this could be faster much at all if any.
