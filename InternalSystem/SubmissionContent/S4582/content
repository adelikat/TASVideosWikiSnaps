	"After the conclusion of 
	[a class=intlink href=/Forum/T/16044 
		"Dream Team Contest 5
	]a
	", the best routes for each rooms amongst the competitors were combined and resynced (primarily by MESHUGGAH) to create the ultimate run of this game, saving 65 frames total over the DTC5 winner's (Team AAA's Aglar, Anty-Lemon, Aqfaq) submission.

[h3 id=Movement 
	" Movement
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The game does not have any subpixels. All movements are done in whole pixels. For horizontal speed, the game keeps a counter which cycles seven values: 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2. This works out as 10 pixels over 7 frames or ~1.43 pixels per frame. (Why the designers didn't just make it alternate between 1 and 2 for a mean speed of 1.5 is anyone's guess, but everyone who participated in the DTC hated them for it.)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The speed counter advances for every frame the player walks, and every frame the player is in the air, regardless if moving horizontally or not. The speed counter also advances when pressing against a wall on the ground, even if no actual horizontal movement is made. The speed counter pauses when standing still or climbing a ladder. The speed counter resets every mission.

[p 
	"If you pause on the frame you touch the trigger for a scrolling transition, the

	"game will load the data associated with it (camera bounds, new transitions, etc)
	$LF
	"without actually starting the scrolling itself. This is only useful for one-way
	$LF
	"transitions, however, as two-way transitions actually consist of two transitions,
	$LF
	"and touching the last one will cause the old room exits to be loaded, preventing
	$LF

	" Speed cycle advancing
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Similar to the scrolling skip, pausing when triggering a black transition has
	$LF
	"strange effects. In this case, pausing and immediately unpausing the game does
	$LF
	"not delay the next room load. It does, however, allow the game to advance one
	$LF
	"more frame before entering the next room. In the TAS, this is used to advance

	$LF

]h4
[p 
	"You can grab onto ladders when you're 16 pixels away from their centre. Due to
	$LF
	"this, it is often faster to grab onto a ladder and let go immediately, as this
	$LF

[h4 id=Lowladdergrabs

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"When approaching a ladder going down from the floor you are on, you can grab it a few pixels lower than you would by just walking up to it. To do this, jump before the ladder, and land on the ground on the same frame as you grab the ladder. The downward speed will be applied once before grabbing the ladder. It is better to be as close as possible (1 pixel above) the ground on the frame before grabbing. For this reason, some jump heights are better than others, and 8 and 11 are best when possible.

	"This run got good feedback, however, I feel that must be discounted, because so many people worked on this game, and see the quality compared to their own work. Just because people familiar with the game like it, it doesn't mean the run itself is good when compared to other TASs.
	$LF

[p 
	"On reviewing the game itself, this game doesn't seem much different than some of the second tier NES games. The TAS of it also looks marvelous. This run contains many close calls, tricky yet precise movements, item management and more, that it's really a solid TAS on all accounts. The various teams and MESHUGGAH who put it all together did a terrific job, and I enjoyed watching it, even though my familiarity of the game is low. I wouldn't necessarily rank this run favorably against Super Mario Bros. and Mega Man, but I would against many of the lesser NES games that were well received in the past. Accepting to moons.
