	"Also known as "Cat Mario", Syobon Action is an extremely difficult mario-clone platformer that usually takes many tries to complete. This run aims to do so in the fastest possible time.

	"First of all, I would like to thank my friend Hu, who have provided me with many technical supports, so I can create this movie. Also, I would like to thank jlun2, because he came up with an important suggestion - the Lags in this game, which helped me saved more than 100 frames. Last, all my thanks go to the website and the warm-hearted staffs.

	"Secondly, the reason why I used the "4 stage" version instead of an extended one is because the "official" site only has this version. Also, a source claims that Syobon Action only has 4 stages, implying that the extended version is a fan-game.

	"With enough horizontal velocity, you can clip slightly into a wall if you turn around for ~1 frame. Then simply hold onto the jump button ("Z" or "UP") to jump again once inside the wall. (If you are lucky, you can jmup on the wall at full speed! )

	$LF

[p 
	"To turn quickly, bump into a wall for 1 frame then immediately turn around. It's faster than turning without bumping into a wall. Used once in stage 1 - 1.

	" Quick Decelerate
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"When you're on the ground and you are fast forward, don't hold onto any button for 1 frame, then you will slow down more quickly than hold onto the back button in the air. Used once in stage 1 - 2.
