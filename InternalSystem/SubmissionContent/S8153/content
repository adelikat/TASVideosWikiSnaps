	"In this wave, the "CHAOS" bar gets filled. This can turn you into 1 of 2 things: a tree or a Tetris block. The tree has 32 frame shooting intervals and can take down a fighter in 3 hits. The Tetris block has 8 frame shooting intervals in sets of 4 and can take down a fighter in 4 hits. The Tetris block is overall faster to use, so with some simple luck manipulation, my fighter becomes a Tetris block. This is much faster than your plain old fighter jet.
