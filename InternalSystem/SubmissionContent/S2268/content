	"In this game, pressing R allows to speed up the Helirin's rotation. Since I don't need to wait so much when I go through a narrow passage without bumping, I chose a run that takes no damage instead of a brute-forced run. This run does not aim for in-game time because I have to collect keys to unlock almost all levels. Therefore, my records are slower than qqwref's one on 1-2, 2-2, and 2-4 but his timer just starts later than mine at the stages. So, this run is faster than his one on every stage in real time. After I clear a stage, I always reset the game to save time. However, I don't reset the game at the end of several mini games because there is no motion of walking after I finished the mini games and it is not help me save time. On the mini game of mowing the lawn, saving starts very quickly after finishing the game. Thus, reset helps me save time even though there is no motion of walking at the end of the mini game. The order of completing levels is different from previous run made by qqwref because the number of frames when I am going to the final stage is same, no matter where I finished all mini games.

	": Another interesting take on the puzzle genre, and I enjoyed this one more than the similar previous submission. The minigames broke up the stages nicely, and it looked very well planned. Accepting for publication.
