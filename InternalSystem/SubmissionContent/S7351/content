	[em 
		"Makeruna! Makend≈ç

	" and in other circles as "hey isn't that the game that Ferret Warlord TASed like 15 years ago that nobody had ever heard of?", was released in 1993. Wikipedia claims the game was developed by Affect Co, who would earlier go on to develop Nolan Ryan's Baseball, known in one circle as "Flyin' Ryan's Big Bat Bonanza". Wikipedia also claims the game was created by Datam Polystar, though. You can remember their name easily by remembering that "Datam" is the plural of "Data", and "Polystar" is what I'm known by in some circles. I'll leave it up to you to decide which creator is correct. The Wikipedia article does need citations at time of writing! In America, this game had no reason to be localized, but it sure was! Wikipedia describes the gameplay as "It is a 2D action side scrolling game." That's it. That's all you get from Wikipedia. The heckin' notice asking for citations has more words than that. In a turn of events that nobody saw coming and, more importantly, probably don't care about anyway, this game has an OVA and two sequels. Neither of those sequels are platformers. The plot of the version that had no reason to be localized follows Josephine, an American girl, because good localization hadn't been invented yet. The kendo part of the title comes from her being a kendo student in Japan, and the rage part comes from the fact that the second half of this game made me want to die.

	"For the purpose of this TAS, PSY effectively determines the power of Jo's attacks. PSY is capped at 64, regenerating at 1 every 4 frames. A value of 0-31 will return the lowest power attack, 32-63 will give a medium power attack, 64 gives the highest power attack. Each normal attack will reduce PSY to 0.

[div class=p 
	"You'd think that PSY management would be extra important over the course of the run, but it isn't. From 0, it takes over 2 seconds to build up enough PSY to give the equivalent of 2 normal hits, and Jo can attack much faster than that, about 3 times per second. Boss invulnerability is 25 frames, so there really isn't any reason to try and manage PSY outside of the first hit on a boss. There are a couple cases where you can manage PSY within a fight, but you're still only talking one saved hit or so.

	[em

The catch is that when she's on flat ground, she will decelerate back down to that normal cap. The second catch is that no acceleration or deceleration occurs in midair, which is abused all throughout the run to maintain slope speed.

From full health, you are able to use 4 dashes. The primary use for dashing in the run is to significantly shorten boss fights: Dashes are equivalent to three normal attacks with the Green orb, meaning each one saves, at least, 50 frames.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The interesting thing about dashes though is that they last exactly as long as a boss is invulnerable, meaning that it is just barely possible to hit twice with one dash. This means that, under perfect circumstances, you can hit a boss 8 times with 4 dashes, which combines to 400 frames of timesave over a fight that is otherwise pure base damage. Obviously, that's significant.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Apart from the health drain, dashing's other caveat is how it affects Jo's speed. Her speed is set to 288 for the duration of the dash, slightly faster than her normal max, but this speed is immediately lost upon coming out of it.

The published run jumps in such a way to go past the normal level boundary, avoiding part of the level, but the problem with that glitch is that it resets Jo's speed due to how long she spends falling. It's actually significantly faster in the long run to go through that part of the level, resetting Jo's fall distance in order to maintain her speed, which is carried all the way through to the boss.

Snow slows Jo down, but she accelerates at the same rate, so I use a mixture of staying grounded for the acceleration early on and jumping for the speed going into the slopes, hitting max speed by the long straight section into the cave. After dashing through the snow without a sleigh or some jingly bells, I control Jo's speed in a way that allows me to make a jump that would otherwise reset her speed to 0. It takes going backwards for a couple frames in order to build up slightly more speed going into the jump, but it saves far more as a result. The enemies at the end are positioned in a way where I can't hit the slope any earlier, and attacking them would mean losing PSY, but the part leading into the boss is short enough that a higher speed would hardly save time.

Anyway, this stage left me feeling a bit crabby, to be honest. Jose-fin moves at basically minimum speed in the water. She can't build speed here, so other speed-type methods are needed in order to do a good move fast. Lobster.

I found that the early health refill meant I could use some dashes to save time in the stage itself, and a later health refill (we'll talk about that one) meant I could dash attack this miniboss. Since the boss dies so much quicker with dash attacks, I didn't notice until much later that it has less health on Normal difficulty.
