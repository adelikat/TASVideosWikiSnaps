	"This a tool-assisted speedrun of Mega Man X4 playing as the red hunter Zero, in which he tries to collect every collectible item in every stage listed as Heart Tanks, Sub Tanks and EX item that gives an extra two lives. Currently, this is the fastest run for this category, it was done on the USA version of the game, and it is faster than the JPN version, and that is due to the text but that is rare since usually the JPN version is faster by considering the text. The JPN ver was used in a great run played by zeroblaze777 on 2011 in 37:10, however, it is not slower by text only but also in action, someone can do a comparison video to verify. This was done on PCSX 0.1.3 on September 2014 which means before that BizHawk support PSX. It took 2 years to decide it's submission on TASVideos because I wasn't sure about it, I also provided an encode one year ago which can be seen above.

	"This run is only few seconds slower than the any% one done by Bernka since it doesn't include a single revisit to a certain stage to collect something unlike the X 100% run, or wasting time for getting an item like fighting or so but it includes good tricks like the the Iceless jump that can be seen in Dragoon stage 2nd area for taking the heart or in Walrus to get the EX item. It is called iceless because in Kuwanger in X1, the heart can only be picked up by using Boomerang Cutter or Charged Shot Gun Ice, and thanks to TAS, none of those things are needed anymore, which is same thing here as well as X3 to get the Sub Tank in Buffalo Stage. Most of tricks used was inspired from Bernka's run, the most useful is SDC that allows to kill bosses pretty fast and save a lot of time, watch Dragoon's fight for this.

		"This run is very similar to
