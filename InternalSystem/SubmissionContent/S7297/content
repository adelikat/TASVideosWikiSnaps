	"Since I know about TAS and speedrun, I have wonder why noone try make this run, it need much skills. Longtime ago, at childhood, me and myfriends like make competition on this mode, like as speedrun, faster is winner. Few years ago, I had tried make this run, but this mode can done with many ways, it make me have much confuses, it makes me don't want to do anymore. But now, I think I must complete it, for my memories.
