	"As you can see, the framerate of this movie is 300 frames per second, which is 10 times the original speed. Since this is mainly a mouse game, the speed of which you can complete certain questions is tied to how fast you can move your mouse (at 30fps, some sections were actually slower than RTA). This makes it so that I can pretty much click 5 times per frame. However, this wouldn't be enough of a reason to change the framerate, I increased the speed because it actually causes a change in the route.

		"the current RTA WR by Benbenq99

	", you'll see that they skip a different question from me, that being question 47, the reason why runners do this is because the question requires you to stroke to pole until the tesla coil zaps the dogs chewing on the pole, which takes about 10 seconds to do RTA, but with TAS at 300fps, it takes about 2 seconds, which means there are other question that could be faster to skip. When I first tried making this TAS, I was expecting it to be faster to skip question 14, which has a pretty long wait time of about 4 seconds, however, skipping question 42 turned out to be faster, this is because even though it relies on inputs, those inputs are keyboard inputs, which in this game do not become faster.

In the future, it'd be hard to consider even higher framerate an improvement unless it also helps to optimize the route itself. At the same time, faster clicking itself looks legitimate because
