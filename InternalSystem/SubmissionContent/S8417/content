	"Metal Head is a 3D mech piloting game on the Sega 32X released in 1995. In this game, you control the mech named Metal Head, a type of mech used for peacekeeping by the World Federation. An unnamed terrorist organization have taken over an entire country with their own mechs and it's your job to take them out and restore peace.

[div class=p 
	"This mech action game has a usually consistent frame rate of around 12-15 FPS and can be played in first or third person view. The game is pretty fun and works for what it wants to be: a very arcade-y mech game that doesn't overstay its welcome. A shame that it's an exclusive to the 32X during a time when it was dying even harder. I'm talking "advertised in Sega Saturn Magazine in Japan" kind of late. I TASed this game not because it's incredibly neat but also a good way to learn how to TAS games in a proper 3D space.
