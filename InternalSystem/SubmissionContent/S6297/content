	"This game depends a lot on Pac-Man's mood. If he is sad or angry he may not want to do certain actions which becomes troublesome if you want him to do as expected.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In this run we manipulate Pac-Man's mood by having him interact with different objects or by shooting directly at him. Some moods will cause him to ignore objects, saving a lot of time as these animations can get quite long.

	"To complete the game you need to find 3 ID cards hidden around the game. There are also bonus cartridges that contains the original Pac-Man games but those are not collected in this run.

	"This is the hardest chapter of the game as it contains a difficult minecart section as well as a hangglider section. These sections are usually "run-enders" when playing the game in real time.

	$LF

[p 
	"The strategies and tricks used are a mix of optimizations found during the making of this TAS, the SDA 2007 speedrun and all the current speedrunners of this game.
