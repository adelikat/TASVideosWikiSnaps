It was a big hit on Coolmath Games when it was first uploaded, and has remained a staple of our website ever since. Beating all 33 levels of Bloxorz is a rite of passage for devout fans of logic games on our site.

	"Bloxorz was a Flash game released in 2007 by Damien Clarke and was published to Miniclip.com and Coolmath Games. It is a puzzle game where you control a 2x1 rectangular prism with the arrow keys, occasionally switching to an alternate mode called "split mode" where you control two parts of the prism individually. The game is to navigate the rectangular prism to the hole to bring you to the next stage. You will also need to hit switches which will open and close paths to make your way to the exit hole. Make sure to not fall off the edge! (don't worry, the TAS doesn't.) Speedruns for this game are mainly building muscle-memory of all 33 stages to complete them as efficiently and quickly as possible. The flash version, as far as I know, only contains one version of the game. Most people will speedrun the HTML5 version running on Chrome as all the rectangular prisms animations are one frame faster in that version, meaning that generally, the flash version plays a bit slower, which is why this TAS cannot outdue the RTA world record as it plays on the HTML5 Chrome version. If you would like to see more information about this, visit yujene's Bloxorz RTA world record YouTube video where in the description, there is a link to a GitHub guide that mentions these differences in greater detail. The TAS mainly improves on the movement on stages that contain split mode since it uses a trick called "fast toggling" as efficient as possible, which is extremely diffiicult to pull off well in RTA runs. Fast toggling allows you to control both blocks in split mode as fast as possible by toggling really fast between them. Stage by stage comments will not be provided as it is nearly identical to the RTA WR besides some improved maneuvering in split mode.

	" Spikestuff posted, there may be some slight suboptimality because this takes 4 more moves, but I just don't think it's enough to reject over. The movement, especially the split mode movement, is really impressive and I think the audience will appreciate this movie.
