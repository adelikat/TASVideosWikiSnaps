	"One really cool (and useful) glitch: Every level, and every area inside each level, starts you in mid-air causing you to drop straight down. If you hold B before the level starts, it treats the first frame as if you're on solid ground, and can jump off of it. This has a number of uses. First, it allows you to avoid the straight drop (which is a waste of time) and second, it can allow you to reach areas you're not supposed to (easily) reach.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"When you jump, you travel about the same speed as running, however, there's a landing animation of around 12 frames, during which you're effectively frozen in place. Also, if you jump high enough, there's only so far you can jump at once, after which you run out of momentum and drop straight down. In many places it's advantageous to have shorter jumps in order to avoid such a drop.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Swinging on web is the fastest when the web is fully extended. A smaller length of web means that you don't get much momentum. Not only does it take longer to fully swing from one side to the other, a smaller web also means less distance travelled. I try to keep the maximum web-slinging distance at all times. This often means slinging web at the first possible frame while jumping up, or on the last possible frame when falling.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Holding B before you reach the end of a web swing causes you to immediately sling web and continue the swing. A major benefit of this is that unlike slinging web from a normal jump, the web hits its target instantaneously, so you don't need to wait for it to find its target. If it's possible to do so, after a jump, I will sling web so that I can continue moving forward without having to wait the extra frames from a landing animation.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Pressing A while swinging on a web causes you to drop. Often, this will launch you forward much faster than any other mode of travel. The only downside is that, once again the landing animation can cause it to only be useful under certain circumstances. For instance, it would not be faster to continually sling web and drop all throughout every level, but when already swinging, it's the fastest way to clear a lot of distance before landing. In some cases, you have to press A at the right frame to use the momentum of the swing to take you further. Too early and you don't get enough distance. Too late and you've already slowed down too much. One aspect of this is that unlike jumps, the movement is automatic. You can't slow down or speed up.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Slinging web while in midair causes you to halt forward movement when you're moving forward, and causes you to move slightly forward when you're falling straight down. The former is useful when you drop from a web (there's no other way to slow down) and need to land at a very specific point. The latter is useful for when straight drops are unavoidable. So at some points in the run where it appears to be a failed attempt to websling, there actually is a purpose to it.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Collecting those small flashing white containers gives you web pellets. These are fired whenever you punch, or if you tap A while jumping. There are only ten shots per web cartridge, so these should be reserved for when they're important. Pressing A to punch, then A again before the punch animation finishes (to do a jumpkick) will prevent the pellet from being fired. Thus, you can still attack without using ammo.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"In some cases, holding A to maintain a constant punch can deal multiple hits. This is especially useful for bosses. Jumpkicks usually deal more than one hit if you stay "on top" of your target as you kick. Web pellets always count as only one hit, giving them limited usefulness. They're more effective at taking down weaker foes from a distance, or hitting airborne bosses (three of the six are airborne) who may be impossible to hit with a standing punch.

	"A Boss' HP is usually stored at x0415. This is useful to know because the health bar on screen doesn't show the full health, and often you'll want to use a multiple-hit punch, and know the exact frame to start holding A, and the exact frame to let go.

	"Whenever I need to drop from a ledge, simply running off of it is often the fastest way to get down. However, in some points (such as stairs) I would need to drop and land on several platforms, and have to undergo a landing animation for each one. Slinging a web from a jump or jumpkick and then immediately dropping often allows me to fall forward and pass by several of these.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"A straight jump (IE, a jump from a standing position) is about as fast as a flip (a jump while running) if you move in one direction the whole time. Usually a flip is preferable only because you don't have to stop moving first. However, straight jumps can allow you to grab a climbable object in mid-air. Jumping and then grabbing onto a ladder or the side of a wall (this is Spider-Man, remember) is always faster than simply climbing from the bottom.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Also, doing a straight jump, then grabbing onto a climbable object, and then immediately jumping off gives you the benefit of doing a double-jump. You can clear more distance before landing this way.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"If you press A while dropping from a web, you do a jumpkick. But unlike a standing jumpkick, the kick stays extended, meaning you can use this to attack something far away without losing any momentum. This is especially useful on bosses, as a well-timed kick can actually deal multiple hits at once while passing through them. Sometimes, if timed well, a dropping jumpkick can be done even if the web doesn't actually hit anything.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Stopping on a dime is not easily done. If you hold down to duck (to pick up an item for instance) while running, it often forces you to continue running for a while before stopping. This can be avoided by stopping a frame before pressing down. This also happens if you try to change direction while running. Stopping one frame before running the opposite direction fixes this.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Changing directions costs some frames with a "turning around" animation. However, you can avoid most of this animation by quickly jumping in the new direction just as the animation begins. The landing animation is around the same number of frames as the turning animation, so this is only useful if you need to jump or drop from a ledge anyway.

	"At one point, I double-jump off a wall and immediately sling a very short web. The reason for this is because the second half of the double jump would otherwise drop me straight down. Slinging the short web and dropping from it allows me to fall forward instead of straight down.

[div class=p 
	"I drop early from a web to avoid getting hit by a bullet. This was because originally I was going to do a no-damage run. I kept it because the bullet causes me to drop from the web anyway, and no frames are lost from the early drop (I land in the same spot on the same frame anyway). Only difference is it looks cooler that I miss the bullet (in my opinion).
