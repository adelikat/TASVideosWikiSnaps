	" You can make the boss appear two frames faster, by pressing left, in the ‘window of opportunity’. I didn’t know this at this stage in the game (I did use it at all other bosses, where it saved time). However, not doing this for starman “didn’t lose me any time”, since I did some tests, and megaman does charge his weapon during there two frames. My weapon wasn’t fully charged yet, so even if I had done this, the frame of releasing my first shot would be the same anyway. I shoot a charged shot every 82 frames. You can start charging your weapon, right after releasing the shot, so the shots won’t hit periodically, but I do shoot periodically. The boss has 28 hp, so 9 charged shots, and 1 uncharged shot are needed. It’s best to shoot the uncharged shot from a large distance, relative to the distance you shoot your charged shot before from. This is to give the uncharged shot more travel time, which will give you the possibility of charging your next shot earlier. Also note that I shoot the boss pretty close to the corner. In Mega Man 5, the best spot to kill a boss is at the corner, for reducing lag. It doesn’t matter that the explosion is not out of the screen, since the animation of megaman getting powered up is triggered after a certain amount of time, and not by the explosion being out of the screen. At the end of the battle, I walk megaman to the middle of the room, this is done manually… so no time lost here.

	" I did some testing on it, and I came to the conclusion it was definitely not faster to use super arrow for the first part of the level. The reasons for this is that the rooms are very short, there are no stairs to climb, and “megaman can’t stand on the super arrow when gravity is reversed”.

	" It was pretty hard, getting the jump right where gravity is reversed the second time, without hitting the edge. Shooting the enemies is faster than jumping over them, even when a charged shot is needed for this. When gravity is reversed, the fastest way to handle it, is to jump the frame before megaman would be upside down. The last enemy of this room is shot by megaman running. Since the time of invulnerability is very big, sliding would be useless, since I would have reached the enemy before it died, and would have to wait right before it and shoot it… doing it this way was equally fast. Jumping over the last enemy would have been slower.

	" Enter super arrow. It’s a great room for first time using the super arrow. Just standing on the super arrow costs 1 hp every 5 frames. This is A LOT. It also costs hp when sliding on the arrow, but it won’t cost any when jumping in the air. Since super arrow is so fast, the only possibility to jump, is jumping only one frame, when megaman is somewhere at the front of the arrow. After a jump, where megaman is jumping forward, he’ll be at the back of the arrow. To make another jump, megaman slides to the front, Which causes a funny, slide, jump, slide, jump etc. I actually stopped speedrunning this game for quite a while after this room, since it seemed to hard to me to optimize the usage of the super arrow, but finally I started working on it again, since doing it right would probably give a nice result.

Calculating and testing how many super arrow hp will be needed, and where to get powerups is very time taking. You can stand on a super arrow infinitely after the super arrow hp has run out, but not that you won’t be able to shoot any new arrows. Shooting an arrow costs 2 hp.

	" It was suggested just now that entering the boss room might be faster. I tested it, and it was actually four frames faster than just sliding like I do in this run (It's a real pity, but I never expected my movie to be perfect. It's only four frames we are talking about here.). You are free to move when falling down, so I already activate a star crusher. When it’s activated, you can shoot it away anytime you want, even when the bosses health is still charging, which is what I’m doing. The boss follows a set pattern, so not much to manipulate here. You can’t hit the boss when he’s at the other side from the room, only when gravity is reversed. You can hit him during his first small jump, and you can’t hit him during his second. Strange for some reason, but true. Since the path of the boss isn’t manipulatable, I have to kill him near the centre.

This is not a technique that really works at other rooms for some reason, since you do need to run (or slide) to the front of the arrow again. I get off the super arrow before the end of the room, in order to perform a glitch. The glitch enables megaman to make the screen scroll, instead of fade out, which is faster by itself, and is faster for room7.

		"About the glitch: I wanted to test if using charged shots on chargeman was faster than using stonemans weapon on him. I was playing the chargeman level normally, at 100% speed, when I discovered the glitch. Unfortunately, I was not recording, but I did have a save where the screen was already scrolling. I wasn’t able to reproduce the glitch, and I couldn’t see what I did before the jump (since I didn’t record it). This is why I asked Bisqwit if he was able to reproduce it. Also when Bisqbot tried, the glitch wasn’t reproduced yet, so Bisqwit asked FinalFighter. It appeared that FinalFighter had found out this glitch aswell, independently of me… and didn’t know of a consistent way of doing it either. After a while FinalFighter did find what caused the glitch to work.
	]tt
	" The key to performing this glitch was taking damage, and pressing right while megaman was being damaged. There are a lot of things that will make the glitch fail even after taking damage, so my movements after being damaged might seem strange sometimes. I wasn’t allowed to shoot the enemy I was being damaged by right away. You may not make the screen scroll to the left. I wasn’t allowed to slide until the screen stopped scrolling, and some other stuff. Because of these restrictions, I shot the enemies and there projectiles with normal shots to avoid lag.

Another great feature of the glitch is not only the possibility to charge my weapon before the battle, but also fire it at the first frame of the battle. This is possible because I fall down into the room, and am positioned farther to the right. If you enter the room, stand at the left side, and shoot at the first frame, the bullet will bounce off, since chargeman will have begun doing his charge attack. Also notice the fact chargeman doesn’t do his rage attack, where he turns all red. You would have been unable to hit him for some time, if he did this attack.

If you stand on the super arrow, or on the ground, close enough to the boat you will lose control and megaman will enter it. If you slide, right before this spot, you will lose control later.

	" This trick enables you to walk over the water, instead of having to ride the boat. This has some advantages. For one, this terrible long autoscroller will be a lot more entertaining. All enemies on the water can only be hit by the buster weapon (the octopuss also) so I'm switching to that. You will notice that shots to the right will travel a lot slower than normally, and shots to the left will travel a lot faster. This enables something quite funny, that will probably he hard to notice, without knowing. You are actually able to shoot a normal bullet to the right, charge your weapon, and let go of the B button, before the first shot has left the screen. This unique, for as far as I know, since it's only possible at these autoscrolling rooms, with the glitch. You can see it, since the music of megaman being charged it still playing, but megaman hasn't fired a charged shot and is in his normal state (uncharged). It might be hard to notice, since I'm jumping rapidly at this point. You will note that I jump alot in this room, and not run or slide at all. This is since it gives instant lag, since there is alot of movement in the screen, at the front, aswell as the background. Fortunately, you are able to move horozontally by moving during a jump. The jumping fishes will always cause a frame of lag, if megaman is also on the screen. Luckily megaman is able to move to the far left or right of the screen which will make megaman both invisible as invincible. This prevents all lag from the fishes.

This battle gives a good idea about the time of invulnerability of enemies in this game. There is a small time, where the octo moves to high, and to low to hit him. I take damage when he is to low, and shoot him backwards when killing him. It is actually possible to not go onscreen at all, between the two rooms, but this would be slightly slower.

Waveman follows a set pattern of: creating water, shooting harpoon, making either a small or a big jump. In this movie, you'll only see him do small jumps, since I can't hit him with chargekick when he's up in the air. With two small jumps, the time I'm unable to hit him is minimized. At the end of the battle, I deplete my chargekick hp.

I had to think off a fast way to kill them and move around over the top. I'm pleased with the strategy I found for it. I'm also able to obtain an M box here. Didn't know whether if I'd use it later on, but collecting it was the fastest way. It turned out very usefull at the first Protoman level. An M box refills all health, and all weapon hp. Unfortunately, if refills one weapon after the other. The super arrowing the last part of this room proved more difficult than it seemed, since I had to save one hp, which was hard somehow without losing frames.

Megaman is positioned too high when standing on the arrow for the bombs to detonate, so the super arrow would hit the first bomb. This can be avoided by walking to the front of the arrow. Megaman will make a falling movement and the bomb will go down. This is also done at the end of the room, in order to hit the last bomb of the screen. If I would be standing below the rock platform this last bomb would also detonate, which is why I slide a bit to the left and right, so the last bomb won't sink in. Getting a refill from this bomb is alot faster than taking it from the Eddie in the next room, since you would have to take damage from the chopper otherwise, which would take longer.
