	"The game itself: Ring King is an old arcade classic in terms of boxing games. While the NES port is much harder than the arcade version (ie: your punches MUST be well-timed if you wish to be successful), it still is enjoyable for 8-bit nostalgics, such as yours truly. :)

		" I did not go for ringouts for all three of my opponents because it would obviously make the movie boring. Yes, it would make it faster, but still boring, nontheless.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" I noticed that other than the running uppercut (hold D-Pad in the desired direction, then press B), countering a running punch/uppercut from an opponent dishes quite a considerable amount of damage. So I used that to my advantage.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" If any of you attempt to outdo this run, you'll notice that the boxers, sometimes, fall way too fast, without enough energy lost. And the ref counting only to have the boxer getting up is an obvious waste of time. Your opponent must have 3/4 of his energy bar drained in order to stay for the count. While sometimes a knockdown is inevitable, try to make them occur as rarely as possible.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" In between the matches, I tampered with the timing system in order to get opponents with low stamina values. This seems to increase damage you deal to an opponent.
		$LF

	[li 
		" I tried to make this movie balanced between the two main aspects of superplays: entertainment and speed. Hope you guys like it!
		$LF

	[li 
		" Sometimes I may move back very slightly while moving towards my opponent. I do this in order to influence timings and change my opponent's "pattern" (Example: so he would charge at me)
