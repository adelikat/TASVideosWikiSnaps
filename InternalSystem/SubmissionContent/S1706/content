	"Jackal is a classic NES game in Konami,wo call it "赤色要塞".Two players fight with enemy bu two jeeps.I thing jeep in this game is so lovely,Do you think?We can fire(press"B")and bomb(press"A").I thing it's more wonderful if jeep can jump^_^There are four level in bomb.The highest level is very terrible-you can attack all directions.
	$LF
	"I think the game comes from a MAME game.I play Jackal in MAME,it is so hard.It has been improved when it comes NES.First,you can only fire ahead,and it makes you play more easily.
	$LF
	"The first BOSS is four tanks,so easy.The second BOSS is four head,so easy but it looks cool.The third BOSS is a ship,so easy.The fourth BOSS is a helicopter,so easy.The fifth BOSS is a door,so easy,The last BOSS is castle and a big tank,there is a little difficult.

	"I want to create a timeattack for the NES classic Jackal.I think TheAxeMan's speedrun is good.But he is one player.So I have improved this game 47 seconds by taking advantage of two player.Thanks TheAxeMan's speedrun.

	"Lag
	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"There are two reason will occur lag.First,the count of enemy and enemy's bullet.The second reason is your attack.The way to reduce lag is kill enemy,but when you attack enemy,it will occur new lag.So it is hard to select.We must try to debug by rerecord.Sometimes we must bear lag,because it can't be solved.

[p 
	"There is usually big randomness in this STG game. You can meet different situation every time.
	$LF
	"Logo-When you finish a stage,there will be a short logo.But this logo is not un unchangable,we can reduce it by operation.
