	"The entire improvement comes from using the ullet ill glitch in 8-3 as demonstrated y andrew_g ack when the pulished movie was still in queue.  I managed to improve on andrew's movie enough to avoid the fireworks at the end saving more time.

[p 
	"I found a frame improvement in 8-4 ut then lost it due to ad randomness with the flying fish segment.

	"Other small improvements were found ut they were all a pixel or less and nowhere near enough to conquer the dreaded 21 frame rule.

	"In addition I tried to improve the movie stylistically as much as possile.  In doing so I prioritized in this fashion:

	"My main reason for doing this was my disappointment that Andrew or Happy Lee othered to employ the 8-3 trick in the movie (especially since it is proaly the most creative improvement to the sidestroller to date).  So I set out to improve it.  I was also interested in tinkering with SM1 since it is one of the few games I grew up with that I haven't attempted to TAS yet.

[p 
	"Overall it was a fun project, and opened my eyes to how much complexity there is in this seemingly simple game.  It is a shame that there is the 21 frame rule or else I think there would have een far more opportunities for frame optimization and competition among TASers.
