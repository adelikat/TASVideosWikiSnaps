	"There isn't much to say about this game, the levels are pretty short and straightforward, and most of the bosses (except for the third) don't have quick kill strats (at least I didn't find any). I've ended the movie after the credits to enter my name for the scores.

	": Hi, Mephistus & Really_Tall.  All in all, this was a nice platformer run that kept up a pretty decent pace, throughout.  The Sylvester boss fights, especially, were enjoyable (along with the little movements included, for added amusement).  Good, solid work from you two!
