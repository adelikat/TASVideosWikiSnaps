	"This is the Master System version of the Cheese Cat-astrophe game, also avaiable on the Genesis and Game Gear. The gameplay is fast paced and the game has some interesting mechanics (such as swimming, rope climbing, etc).

	"You have to find a key and rescue your friend before proceeding to the end of every level, then face a boss after every 3 levels.

	"There isn't much to say about this game, the levels are pretty short and straightforward, and most of the bosses (except for the third) don't have quick kill strats (at least I didn't find any). I've ended the movie after the credits to enter my name for the scores.

	": Hi, Mephistus & Really_Tall.  All in all, this was a nice platformer run that kept up a pretty decent pace, throughout.  The Sylvester boss fights, especially, were enjoyable (along with the little movements included, for added amusement).  Good, solid work from you two!
