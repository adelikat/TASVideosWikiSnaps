	"Bay Route is an arcade run and gun released by Sega and Sunsoft in 1989. Two players can control a boy and a girl to kill terrorists and help the boy find his girlfriend (I wonder who the girl is supposed to be)

		"When both of the players shoot boss/enemy that takes over 2 hits to kill, it takes double damage if both of the shots collide at the same time. This is used to kill off bossess very fast!

	[li 
		"The flamethrower does the most damage if you can get it to hit for over 26 frames.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"I didn't take any damage because it doesn't save very much time (probably 2 seconds) and looks ugly, plus it's more fun to shoot stuff. Also, anyone who has played this game probably knows it's a very hard one.
