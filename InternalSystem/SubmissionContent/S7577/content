	"The main gist of this game is that there are 12 rooms, each named after a zodiac symbol. There are various items within these rooms, and the game tasks you to figure out how to unlock each of the 11 clues using the hints therein. When you uncover a clue, it is just a couple numbers. The game came with a comic book initially and that was the key to decoding the clues, like "37 5" could mean the 5th panel on page 37.

	"To unlock a clue, the correct items must be in the correct locations for the clue that you're on. You cannot unlock clues out of order, but you certainly can prepare future rooms ahead of time for efficiency purposes which I do a lot of in this TAS. Rooms can contain items used in different clues as well so depending on what you need and when you can stash stuff away for a while. You can hold up to 6 items at once, some of which have special powers themselves. Here are a few important ones.
