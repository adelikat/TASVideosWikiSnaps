	"A user gave word that it is possible to defeat Muzh at the Under-Island cave without using a shield.  To me, not only I was able to do that, but I was also able to defeat Muzh on a lower level.  Last time, I took care of Muzh on LV 5.  Here, it's LV 4.

[p 
	"Strategy was the key not only to get as close to 31350 ex. as possible, but also to obtain 100 MP as well.  I kill 8 zombies in a room that is simply one screen west of the main entrance.  The reason is that (1) I wanted to avoid lodging at any cost.  And (2) because according to my calculation, it takes 150 MP altogether to complete the entire Nockmaar scene before finally getting down to business with Queen Bavmorda.

Kael's room after defeating him (130), and 20 to call Ocarina straight to the Tavern en route to Fin Raziel's hideout (150).
