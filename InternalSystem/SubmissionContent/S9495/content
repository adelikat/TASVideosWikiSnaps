		""Prince of Persia: Special Edition" is an Adobe Flash game created by Ubisoft that was meant as a promotional game for the upcoming 3D title from the time "Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time". This game only contains one level with a boss fight (Jaffar). The physics and visuals of this game are practically the same as the

It has a small level and a boss fight. Due to its unresponsive controls, it is exceptionally difficult for casual gameplay. However, Rxser here dominates it with ease, including a nice gate skip. The run looks pretty optimized and is an fast and entertaining watch.
