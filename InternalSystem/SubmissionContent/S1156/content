	"This is version 2 of my Golgo13 TAS.  It is 4:19 faster than version 1 (cancelled submission), mostly due to the fact that I discovered a glitch that allows Duke to swim through rocks and avoid all underwater ambush attacks.  Some of the other smaller timesavers include different attack strategies in some ambush attacks, a slightly different route in the Fangbacks maze, and frame-by-frame precision in all mazes and ambush attacks.  I also discovered that part of the cut scene before the jungle can be skipped.

	"The final battle is 7 seconds faster than the previous version due to a little luck and the discovery that you can manipulate the number of hits required to kill the clone generators based on the first frame you attack them.  There is a 20 frame delay between shots.

[div class=p 
	"This run also takes less damage and has 100% kills in the autoscroller levels.  An occasional extra bullet needed to be fired to manipulate the appearance place of the jets.  There is also much less extraneous input than in version 1.

	"Golgo 13 is insanely powerful.  He can fly a helicopter almost as fast as a plane.  He has a vertical jump that is 3 times his height.  His sniper accuracy is nothing short of legendary.  If you shoot at him, he will kick the bullet away.  If he kicks you, you will explode.  He does all of this while wearing a suit and tie.
