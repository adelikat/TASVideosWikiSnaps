	"This is a very rough run and I do hope someone will beat this. I have not decided whether running up to the goons and killing them or jumping over them is better, because you have to stop running to avoid doing the long jump. I apply both methods throughout. Also, I think long jumping over all the stationary, gun-toting goons is very possible but I only discovered that about halfway through the game. This jump is not possible during the train stages as it seems the height of the long jump is different. There may also be ways to reach the main bombs faster. Finally, I have not worked out the optimal money pickup. Ideally, I would like minimal food recharge ending with zero meter before the train stage. This will mean that I must avoid some of the money.
