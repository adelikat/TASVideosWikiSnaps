	"Dokapon Monster Hunter is an RPG based on the premise of Rock-Paper-Scissors. Both attacking and defending have a standard type, a rock type, a scissors type and a paper type. The main character, Hero, has finally turned 11 years old and is now about to become an adventurer! An adventure far greater than anyone could imagine...

	"Normally, you have to find the stairs to the next level for each dungeon. Thankfully, Hero won't have to look far as all stairs are manipulated to be close by. As well, Hero doesn't have to worry about any of those scary looking monsters in the dungeons... none of them ever get close enough to fight!

		" Stealing from the shop early is done to create guards in town. Normally, guards will kill you extremely quickly but in this case they're a massive amount of experience. Over half of the game's leveling up is from the first guard killed.

		" BossMole is manipulated into dropping IronCraw, a weapon powerful enough that I can kill both bosses in Forest in one attack

		" Barrel is picked up on the last floor of Circus. This allows me to kill the Circus boss in one hit

		" Mask-S is picked up in the second visit to Forest. Although cursed, the curse never effects Hero and the Fallback ability proves invaluable!
