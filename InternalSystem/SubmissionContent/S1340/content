	"To explain the "warp" concept (which might be new for a Mega Man game), Mega Man Zero (MMZ) is mission-based. If you fail one specific mission (where the army is building up in the desert) you will trigger the base invasion that marks the start of the final four stages. Cancelling a mission counts as failing, thus by cancelling only two missions (the Shuttle mission to unluck the other desert missions, the Army Massing mission) you can go straight to the final stages and skip all the other stages.

	"The warp run does provide some challenges a non-warp run wouldn't face, namely in weapon leveling. Because the run is so short, it is borderline impractical to even try leveling the Z-Sabre to acquire the "charge" skill since each Z-Sabre strike causes four frames of lag (translating into possibly half a minute of extra lag.) Instead, the buster is primarily focused on with the intention of making up for the lack of a charging Z-Sabre by simply using the Z-Buster.

				"Like most of the later Mega Man games, bosses have an invincibility period where they're flashing white. If standing still and slashing with the Z-Sabre, the attack will cause the boss to have an incredibly short invincibility period. This is caused by the "triple slash" ; basically, the first hit only causes a short flashing period so that you can hit him with the second slash, even if you don't have it yet. Naturally, this means the second slash also has the same effect
