	"Street Fighter Zero 2 Arcade mode completed on Normal difficulty with Gen. Time is assumed to be maximized but I aim to entertain the viewer where possible, although the movie can get somewhat repetitive because SFZ2 doesn't have as many impressive combos as the others do. Many fights are ended with a Super Combo to get the score bonus, even though that loses time (because of the "Super Combo Finish" message). All fights are Perfect (no damage), naturally.

	"I played on Normal because many of Gen's attacks are not particularly fast, so to take no damage on Hard mode, the fights would have had to have used only the fastest, weakest moves in his arsenal, which would've made the movie much longer.

	"Gen is unique because he has two stances (movesets): the Crane stance and the Mantis stance. In the first level (vs. Ryu), round 1 shows off the Crane stance exclusively and round 2 shows off the Mantis stance exclusively; after that I switch freely between the two whenever I think it'll be faster or just look cool. The Mantis stance is almost never used for a Super Combo (only in level 1 round 2) because both of its Super Combos rely on the opponent not doing anything to stop it (both are quite easy to avoid/block), and they are also very long.

	"In Round 2 vs. Sakura, a glitch causes the game to incorrectly register that I completed the round with a Level 3 2-hit Super Combo, even though I finished it with a Fierce. I did perform a Level 3 Super Combo earlier in the fight, but that scored 6 hits. Not that I'm complaining about the extra points or anything, it's just noteworthily odd.

	"The game pits you against a "NEW CHALLENGER" on levels 5 and 8 if you complete the preceding levels in a certain amount of time. Obviously I do. Unfortunately you still have to complete the normal fighter afterwards, but additional fights give me more time to show off Gen's abilities. Oddly enough though, the new challenger for Level 8 is the same as the normal boss for Level 8 (Gouki for the Gen route), and after beating him as a challenger I still had to fight him again as the normal final boss afterwards. It probably makes sense if you can read the dialogue.
