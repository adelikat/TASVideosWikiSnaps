		"When running down a slope at an angle, you'll accelerate to a speed much greater than what you can normally achieve on flat ground.  You’ll slow down again once you start running on flat ground for a while though.  Simple solution to that, just jump!  It takes more time to slow you down in air than it does on dry land, but it doesn’t last forever.  This is a great way of preserving both horizontal and vertical momentum.  Can't run up the U-Shaped valley?  No problem, simply jump up before the game has the chance to slow you down instead!  
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		"Jumping off angled slopes won't send you vertically upwards; it'll send you off at an angle as well.  Useful for clearing gaps, taking shortcuts and miniature speed boosts. 
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		"Most items in the game can be stood on and jumped off.  Grab an item, jump, and with a bit of good timing you can drop them so that you end up landing on them in mid air for a few frames.  You can then jump off them right now, giving you much easier access to higher areas.  This is very easy to perform in real time.
		$LF

]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		"Hit the underside of a floating block and it'll be activated.  Hit the edge and you'll just stop whack into it and stop dead.  Jump on the right frame however and you’ll hit the bottom corner and Pond will pass straight through it instead.  This made it easy to collect the enclosed Minimap on Wensleydale Wastelands, rather than needing to bother with destroying the rocks first.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		"Pond uses 2 types of explosives in the game: Bombs and Dynamite.  Picking up a bomb has no immediate effect, but releasing it will start the countdown.  Nothing can stop it now other than leaving the bomb so far behind that it gets wiped out of memory.  Picking up a dynamite stick will instantly start the fuse countdown though, but unlike the bomb this one can be stopped simply by chucking it off screen.  Doing this repeatedly makes it easier to transport the explosive a great distance, allowing me to use it in areas it was not originally intended for.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"When hit, both Pond and enemies will be given temporary invincibility, allowing Pond to pass through them without taking damage.  Pond has this luxury at the beginning of each level, very useful indeed.  Items can be thrown at enemies to make them take damage; luckily holding items doesn’t affect your speed.

Jumping and grabbing the rocket at the same time will send you upwards with the speed of your jump, but coupled with effect of the low gravity; causing you to ascend faster than what the rocket propulsion can usually achieve.  Even works without any fuel.
