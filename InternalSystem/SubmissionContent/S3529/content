	"After watching the current run of family feud I noticed a few places that needed severe improvements.  I have since made this movie to really show what this game is made of.  This movie beats the current run by 10924 frames.  Thats just more than 3 minutes!  In addition I changed the name of the other family as the computer types Booth a lot faster than the name in the previous version.  I also changed their race as I wanted to dispel the stereotype that all asians are smart.  I think this is my best run to date.
