	"My first NES run ever. I liked Gumshoe when I was a kid.
	$LF
	"Never managed to run it through however. This game is SO hard.

[p 
	"Throughout the run you will probably notice that I don't manage to kill some of the enemies. This is because the hit box is out of range.

	"Mr. Stevenson is an ex-FBI agent turned detective. He receives a ransom note from Mafia boss, King Dom, who has kidnapped Stevenson's daughter, Jennifer. Stevenson must collect the five Black Panther Diamonds within 24 hours in order to see his daughter again.

	"Game play:

[p 
	"This is a semi auto-scroller. Stevenson is always moving to the right unless he bumps into something, he then faces left until he lands on the ground, or if you push the trigger to shoot him again.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Shooting is the way to make him jump.

	"I also find a cool glitch while making this run. Don't read ahead if you don't want the spoiler.
	$LF

[p 
	"I found that one can travel through solid walls. I haven't experimented much with it at all. I don't even know if it saves time. It just looked cool so I left it in the movie for entertainment.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I do admit that the final boss could have been smoother, and also some movement improvement is likely possible.

[p 
	"Anyways. Hope you like this run anyways.
