	"This game is one of the few that features the ability to show more than 8 sprites, which is the limit to the Commodore 64. In this case, the method used is to turn a set of 8 sprites on and off in different locations to simulate the ability of 16 individual stars. A previous TAS that I've done, 
	(__wikiLink|href=/8245S|implicitdisplaytext=8245S)
	" also used this same technique. You'll notice in both cases that all the sprites 'flicker' with a transparency. For those who are interested...just use the frame advance to see them alternate back and forward.

[div class=p 
	"One of the troublesome factors was RNG. This game doesn't have the same kind of random generation that I have found in other Commodore 64 games. Here, RNG was controlled by a frame rule. So delays were used to help in some cases. At the completion of this TAS, I still don't understand it very well.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Another factor that really made this game hard, was the avoidance of lag. On the first dragon, I was able to fire shots on just about every other frame. As the motion increased on the screen, input lag started to become an issue. So my work ended up checking every "fire button" press to confirm that a shot was actually produced. This became very tedious and aggravating towards the end. After completing this TAS, on a first effort, I went back to try my knowledge again and was able to cut an additional 809 frames. Because of this outcome, I tried for a 3rd round and failed...as I kept landing on different frame rules and loosing lots of frames and gaining small amounts through out the first few levels.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"One last factor that hindered production, was getting the "Next Stage Dragon" to be within reach so that shot delays were minimized. It was an exercise in balancing out shot delays, lag reduction, and taking advantage of positioning the game's weapon...in the limited time before the death of each dragon.
