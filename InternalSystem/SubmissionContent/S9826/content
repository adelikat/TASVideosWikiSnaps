	"Compared the two runs, the frame count is different between PCEjin and Bizhawk. Bizhawk has longer black screen when some scene changed. And more lag farmes, the lag frame in Bizhawk is odd, some normal frames counted as lag. The old run kept a long animation after stage 5, which does not affect the percent and ending, I think it meanless so skipped it. So I can't say exactly how many time I saved, I estimate it's about 40 seconds.

	"Roll through enemy: you can do this after Maria attacked enemy at proper frame, this makes she kept rolling instead of jumping over them. This trick doesn't work on some enemy, in that case I took damage in crouching position to kept rolling that only lost several frames, still faster than jumping.
