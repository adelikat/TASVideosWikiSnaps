	""In the near future, the destruction of nature by mankind had resulted in grave consequences. Now nature has begun to take it's revenge!" is how the game's manual introduces Godzilla 2. This game, as TASVideos' own EZGames69 described it on Discord: "is the weirdest game of advanced wars I've ever seen". Released in North America in February 1992, this game, having very little to do with its predecessor, features a war between humans and Godzilla-universe monsters, and has gotten quite expensive lately given its rarity and late release.

	"Greetings! I'm juef, and this is my first TAS attempt at this game. There is no actual ending to Godzilla 2, as the game is split into 12 scenarios which can be completed in any order, and nothing happens even when they are all completed in a single sitting. There is no saving system and no password. Most of the scenarios' mechanics are fairly straightforward, but here's a quick rundown for those unfamiliar with the game.

		" Units take one turn to be launched from a base, but special units from laboratories can take more time.
		$LF

		" Queued units are always launched in the order they're initially listed in. If you want them in a different order, you have to queue them in more than one turn.

		" You cannot move to a tile that's adjacent to a monster and keep moving: you have to attack it, or stand by.

		" When the player's units attack the monsters, they strike first. The opposite is true as well, and this TAS takes advantage of this on a few occasions.
		$LF

	[li 
		" The battles consist of selecting a weapon and playing a slots game. The game's manual provides some information about the significance of the slots' symbols, but they are of no importance for this TAS as we always get a jackpot (i.e. three identical items). A jackpot makes your unit invincible, very powerful and 100% accurate.

		" Some monsters have an 'F' on their map icon. This indicates they are flying, and affects the player's weapons accuracy and damage dealt.

		" If one of the player's units occupies a tile where a monster should be appearing, it will simply appear on an adjacent square.

		" Since some monsters appear on the map after a few turns, we're often able to save a lot of time by killing all visible enemies before those appear.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" The cursor's movement has no effect on the RNG, but we still move it in the fastest way possible. Sometimes, we move it towards the monsters before ending the player's turn: when the player moves it, there is an acceleration, unlike when the monsters control it. Furthermore, it appears that any horizontal or vertical movement of more than 4 tiles is faster when done by the player. This saves up to around 20 frames per turn.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" The RNG in this game is mostly about two things: the monster's movement and actions on the map, and their choice of attack in battle. The latter rarely matters since we're invincible because of the slots, but the former is extremely important to manipulate. It appears to depend on some (maybe uninitialized?) RAM value, as well as the player's units positions on the map, and the units' hit points. Therefore, in this TAS, when the player's units' movement seems odd, it is done so in order to manipulate the monsters.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Enemy movement on the map is a bit faster than the player's, so when possible, it is better to let the monsters come to you rather than the opposite.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" The weapons have different animation lengths, and it takes a few frames to select any other than the first. So when either weapon deals enough damage and/or manipulates the enemies in the desired way, the fastest one is chosen.

Moving onto these particular places on the map and attacking it with bombs was the best way I found to have it attack us on its turn so we could kill it before wasting another turn (and eventually having another monster appear). It would have been nice to have it not fly, but when I manipulated it so, it seemed attacking it then made it fly away before I could kill it. Also, this way of attacking it provided favorable RNG for the next scenario and was very well worth it.

Unfortunately, all my attempts at having this happen didn't work out and/or save time in this scenario. Also, while the Super X2's missile attack is stronger against Ghidora and has a faster animation, it would have it teleport away on its turn because of its lower LP, so we sacrifice a dozen of frames or so to be able to kill it on its next turn.

As examples, some other things I tried were killing everything with just a Super X2, or the Super X2 and an attacker, or the Super X2 and the Maser (which is a very strong unit that takes a few turns to launch). Ultimately, Mothra ended up being the best choice, given its incredible strength, good movement abilities and the fact that the egg was quick to discover with the radar. Also, moving the Super X2 one tile down was done to manipulate Ghidora into later attacking it with its laser, therefore making the one-battle kill possible.
