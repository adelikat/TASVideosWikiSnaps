	"Shadowgate time! I actually got a request of doing this and 
	$LF
	"after concidering it I decided to see if I could improve 
	$LF
	"CaithSith2's run. Apparently I could. This version is not 
	$LF
	"only 5 seconds as someone thought but 5 minutes and 8 
	$LF
	"seconds (if I calculated it right) faster!!
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"How could I improve it so much then? That is with very 
	$LF
	"precise cursor movements, no mistakes made and with faster 
	$LF
	"menu-handlings. I also tries to stay in the menues as much 
	$LF
	"as possible since it´s much faster then to scroll around 
	$LF
	"the screen. Also the controls are slower then in Uninvited 
	$LF
	"and Deja Vu, but it´s hardly even spotted.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I got 2 suggestions of how to improve this run. First was 
	$LF
	"to not pick up a stone for the sling. This didn´t work 
	$LF
	"unfortunately. Second was to not pay the fare at the raft. 
	$LF
	"That didn´t work either =/
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Also, I used the exact same route as CaithSith, used his 
	$LF
	"previous version as the best FAQ ever. I changed a few 
	$LF
	"things though to make it even faster. Also I used the same 
	$LF
	"item (Horseshoe) at the Sphinx cus it was the fastest. I 
	$LF
	"didn´t even had to manipulate him.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"And last, I had to end the movie later (!) then in the 
	$LF
	"previous version, this is because the text keeps scrolling 
	$LF
	"even after the Behemoth is defeated. So user input was still 
	$LF
	"needed.
	$LF

[p 
	"Also, thanks CaithSith2 for "helping".
	$LF

[p 
	"Well, enjoy this one! One of favourite games ever! The 
	$LF
	"music is awesome and so is the game.
