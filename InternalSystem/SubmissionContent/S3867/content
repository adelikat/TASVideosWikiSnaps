	"The 
	[a class=intlink href=/Forum/T/10219 
		"Dream Team Contest #3
	]a
	" used this game for the competition. The contest would have players sign up and work together as teams in order to produce the fastest movie within a time limit of a few weeks. I was part of one of the teams in there, Team 5, and things were a bit hectic. We would start by analyzing the game swiftly, produce a 
	[a class=intlink href=/Forum/P/266945#266945 
		"particularly useful script
	]a
	", then start crushing each stage we dash through. I still recall the reaction from a teammate when I had already implemented rescaling the hitbox display when asked to find a way to show offscreen enemies.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"It would appear that we had a good strategy and did a very good job at figuring out the tricks to the game. Not really one to brag, but the fact remains, the team I was part of was the winning team. I knew there were better ways to get through the game, so I had started working on improvements. Shouldn't take too long.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Over two years later (possibly why DTC #4 requires the winning team to submit their movie), I finally complete this run. Part of the reason it took so darn long is due to having lost and regained interest over time, and various life stuff. This run never left my mind, not for very long. When things stabilized for a bit and I finally came back to my TASing computer, I finally got the finishing touches needed to get through 3-3 and 3-4.

	"About the game
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"You control some sort of yellow alien with a gun. For whatever reason, he also has very Earth-like grenades with Earth-like explosions. He collides with some sort of satellite around Earth and crash-lands right in front of the FBI, who then runs off with his spacecraft and somehow forgets that bright yellow alien thing in clear sight. If you're looking for story, this isn't the game, as it just gives an excuse why you're doing these things.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The game play is similar to Metal Slug from what I hear. You have a gun, you will knife things standing next to you, you can throw grenades, there are vehicles to enter, and there are different weapons to pick up. But while the core game has similarities, there's plenty enough differences between the two. This one being a fair amount simpler, but your yellow alien can dig into the ground or latch onto the heads of some of his enemies.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Simple doesn't necessarily mean easy, though. In hard mode, most attacks kill you outright, and you have 5 spare lives per credit. It's pretty easy to end up catching a stray bullet or losing yourself in the action. But this TAS just runs right through the game with little worry from the various hazards the game would throw at you.

	"My strategy was basically search a bunch of RNGs and see which one gives me the fastest rush to the first helicopter. Helicopters try to escape the player diagonally, but by moving back and forth around one of X or Y axis of a helicopter, it will keep accelerating around zero speed for one axis, thus making the copter somewhat slower. This saves plenty of frames off the DTC3 runs.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The first helicopter gives you your weapon. A front-firing 11 damage shot. As you can't attack until then, the game provides a squad of helpful kids already smashing the helicopter in 300 frames for you, but they'll only start smashing after they're within a certain distance, so I manipulate the helicopter to be in sight as soon as I can.

	"The second helicopter gives you armor, setting your ship's HP to 20 instead of the initial 5 you begin with. As worthless as this may be in a TAS, the game forces you to pick it up -- It won't even spawn the next helicopter until you get the power-ups in order. So, naturally, I have no choice and must pick it up anyway.
	$LF

[p 
	"The third helicopter gives you a rocket, speeding you up greatly. This uses a fuel meter to give you the extra burst. However, after one accelerates to maximum speed, one can alternate pressing and releasing R in order to maintain near-top speed without losing any of the fuel meter. Naturally, it is quite abused in order to avoid slowing down to basic speed. Speaking of which, using the slower engine instantly slows you down if you're at the boosted speed.

	$LF

The hitboxes for these things are extremely wide, in that you can fit like five of these things' graphics side by side, and you'd approximate the hitbox pretty well then. The Y-hitbox size is more sensible, but still a touch larger than intuition would tell you. Despite the insane hitbox, 2 damage isn't much compared to your other weaponry.

I also noted that the boss may take longer to die if multiple segments are above ground, so I actually delay a moment to minimize this wait. Seems the tail tip takes 19 less frames to finish exploding compared to the head.

So, normal methods it is.

	"Scratch that. I miscounted frames. I did kill the boss faster. I believe it's from more efficient use of the CloudStacking glitch.

Still, what I have is better than my attempted improvement's RNG, where I would only have access to two decent drops at best.

[p 
	"The game is very sync-stable, if you can line up the RNG. When Mugg found a way to save frames at the 1-2 boss, I checked it out, and have indeed saved those frames. I was working at 3-1 or 3-2 at the time, so I was hoping I don't have to redo 1-3 all the way back to where I was at. I made sure to tweak the RNG to keep what I had for 1-3, then copied the rest of my movie in place, and sure enough, nothing broke. I was able to save those 50 frames without redoing large portions of my run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Even so, most of this run should be pretty optimal. There is a spawn timer that is used to determine when new agents show up, and there are limits depending on the scene as to how many of these agents can exist. In many cases, I kill the last agent necessary at the earliest possible moment, using a weapon with the shortest death animation. Due to the spawn timer working as a 31-frame rule, improvements are generally unlikely to take place in such scenes.
