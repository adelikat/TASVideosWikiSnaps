	"Kitana: Very easy for the first round then its like she took some angry pills =)
	$LF

[p 
	"Nightwolf: Truthfully I hate having to fight Nightwolf. Throw/shoot any projectile and he sends it back and it gets pretty annoying unless you know how to use it.
	$LF

	"Reptile: The first round is an animation glitch. Second round is a little bit of Stryker's Infinite.

	"Endurance (Jax and Nightwolf): Jax is a huge character so doing big combos and setting yourself up for big combos is quite easy. Nightwolf for some reason wanted to change clothes half way through the match.
