	". Regarding TASing, horizontal and downward acceleration are very slow, only upward acceleration is fast using super-flap (up+flap). Only two super flaps are required to gain the capped velocity (super flaps can be pressed every other frame, no double binding shenanigans). So, the general rule is that to go toward a direction, it is faster to go upward, and toward a wall to bounce to the desirable direction.

	"It is possible to clip through barriers without touching them (used against pink barriers in several stages). The game checks collision on every frame, so by going fast enough, we can go from one side on the previous frame to the other side on the next frame. It is not possible to achieve the necessary speed when the barrier is not moving, it is only possible when the barrier is going toward us, to get a high relative speed.

	": Updated movie to contain more accurate annotations. Required game version still can't be downloaded directly via Steam, but we've mirrored the 3rd party app that still can do it (see the thread). Hard to tell if it always continues to work, but looks like it's our only solution at this point.

	": I watched a full human playthrough of this game to understand the mechanics in all the levels, and then also a human speedrun record, and this run is awesome. But it's really hard to comprehend that if you don't know the game. The levels are tiny and you don't have enough time to understand what just happened, and there's constant fullscreen flashing between all the levels that makes you forget what you just saw. Probably a slowed down encode would be easier to absorb. There's been no feedback despite of me asking for it in chats, and the votes aren't great, so I'm accepting this run to Vault.
