	"Boxxle is a Game Boy adaptation of Thinking Rabbit's puzzle game Sokoban. There already exists a TAS for Sokoban DS and I wanted to do some for other releases. The puzzles used in Boxxle and Boxxle II appear in several other Thinking Rabbit releases, such as Shove It for Genesis, so the solution sets for those puzzles can easily be reused to TAS other games in the future.
