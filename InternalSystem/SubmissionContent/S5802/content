	""Grazing" is the act of having a bullet pass near one's hitbox. The graze counter will increase at a slow rate for as long as the player remains near the bullet. If one continues to graze a bullet for a short time, the bullet will release a graze item, which adds 5 graze to the counter.

It's a post-game completion category, beating the hardest level on hardest difficulty. The verification movie successfully created a save game which this run syncs from. After the stage is beaten, the movie creates an internal replay file and goes to the main menu. All that has been verified.
