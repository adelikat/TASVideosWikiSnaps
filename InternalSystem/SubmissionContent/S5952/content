	]em
	" is a 1982 video game published by Imagic, developed for Atari 2600, Intellivision, Commodore 64, Apple II, ZX Spectrum, ColecoVision and more. The objective of the game is for the player to run over a castle drawbridge while avoiding fireballs and other obstacles, and then grab treasures guarded by a dragon who spits more fireballs at the player. Leave the room, rinse and repeat until lives run out. Other obstacles include a moving drawbridge, an archer firing arrows at the player, and a troll inhabiting the treasure room.

		" At any level, in the bridge section, fireballs go from the left to the right side of the screen - one high one, and one low one. The high one must be ducked under, and the low one must be jumped over. The high fireballs move faster than the low ones, and two fireballs always appear immediately at the start - therefore, the player always must first duck under one fireball and then jump over another. In the treasure rooms, the dragon lies at the bottom of the screen, firing fireballs in random upwards angles. The delay between dragon fireballs slowly decreases every level. Only two dragon fireballs may be on screen at a time.

Collision is very vague however, and it often is still possible to just walk over thin air to proceed. Also, in the treasure room section, a troll starts to appear. Hitting the troll's sword is death, but otherwise touching the troll defeats it.

	"The bridge sections have little variety in them; duck under first fireball, run a few frames and jump over the second, run over the drawbridge (regardless of whether it's actually opened or not; it's pretty buggy), and onto the next area. There are only a few caveats; one, if an archer is present, he must be luck-manipulated not to shoot an arrow to the left side (this would block player progress). Second, in later levels, the second upper fireball spawns soon enough that the player cannot reach the exit before it appears, so he needs to duck a second time.

	"The treasure room areas are more interesting. Treasure positions are completely randomized. The RNG for this only changes once every approx. 5 frames (depending on tick rates), which means that room compositions are relatively limited without spending excess time on luck manipulation. This means that "perfect" room compositions are effectively impossible to manipulate, so I just have to manipulate the best layout that can be gotten quickly enough, making every room quite unique. Besides getting a favorable treasure layout, collecting each treasure while getting past the dragon fireballs, arrows, and sometimes the troll also makes routing each room interesting. There are a lot of different possibilities in every room, so lots of testing different room layouts and routing was required.

For instance, generally the player can run for 3 frames after ducking under the first high fireball in a bridge section, but sometimes it can be a frame more or less.
