	"This game is one of the best known and well received Mortal Kombats. There are many different versions of it - in the arcade version the gameplay is smoother, but overall UMK3 SNES remains the best one because in comparison it has more fighters, brutalities, improved special move lists (for example Stryker's machine gun is not in the SNES MK3), more modes and the fake mercy glitch.

The memory of the game was manipulated while doing them and the game could sometimes crash a lot or a random game over could happen. Here's an example:

Both runs do the glitchy fighting very well, but this new run adds many interesting level and background glitches that are not shown in the previous run and so, among other things, fulfills the entertainment goal better.
