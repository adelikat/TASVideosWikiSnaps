	"This game is one of the best known and well received Mortal Kombats. There are many different versions of it - in the arcade version the gameplay is smoother, but overall UMK3 SNES remains the best one because in comparison it has more fighters, brutalities, improved special move lists (for example Stryker's machine gun is not in the SNES MK3), more modes and the fake mercy glitch.

And again we were devising a complete route, and looking for new tricks and glitches... In this TAS we put in more matches to show all our knowledge about this game.

	"We were having a of lot desyncs, mainly me (SDR), and I think the biggest problems in the run were caused by Palette, Eruption, fan Tug and bomb/web/teleport glitches. The memory of the game was manipulated while doing them and the game could sometimes crash a lot or a random game over could happen. Here's an example:

	(__wikiLink|1333M|the currently published UMK3 playaround)
	". We do not need two playarounds of the same game, especially as many of the glitches are shared between both runs. Both runs do the glitchy fighting very well, but this new run adds many interesting level and background glitches that are not shown in the previous run and so, among other things, fulfills the entertainment goal better.
