	"This game is about Jake and Elwood, fanatic for blues music, they felt into a wacky adventure. The real game name is "The Blues Brothers: Jukebox Adventure", but for some reason the SNES version got title changed. This game has 35 stages, no bosses, you can either choose Jake or Elwood, by pressing slect at the character screen.

	"For example at the start of stage 6, you jump up some platforms, but even though you are going right later you dont keep on the right side of them. In the first basement level when climbing chains, you don't jump up them, you only climb, even though i can see in the rest of the movie that this is possible. You don't keep very close when following the spiked balls in stage 8. You bump into several corners and lose your momentum etc. Taking all this together it seems a bit sloppy.

	"I will reject this movie, but do try again. The game is a uneventful but I think it could be made interesting to watch. 2 player might be a good idea, if it doesn't slow the action down too much. It seems 2-player plays different stages also...
