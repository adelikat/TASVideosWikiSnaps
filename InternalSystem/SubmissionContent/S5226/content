	"This TAS improves 
	[a class=intlink href=/2582M 
		"the current any% warpless Zelda II run
	]a
	" by 407 frames. Although 7 seconds may not seem large for a 45-minute run, every frame saved was hard-earned. The previous movie was well-optimized and well-planned, and this run visits all of the same screens. (Although I certainly spent a long time researching potential route ideas.) Improvements required unforgiving precision, extremely long-term planning, and investigation of the game mechanics. The project took me about 250 hours over the course of 3.5 months. This chart shows the frames saved over the course of the run:

	"Before I get into it, let me take a paragraph to praise Inzult. First, while comparing my version with his while creating the movie, I appreciated the high level of technical skill that he demonstrated. Second, whenever I posted in the Zelda II thread, Inzult was always around to post some useful feedback. He provided notes, tips, tools, and whatever else he could. Inzult is a real man and worthy of much respect. Also, although Rising Tempest did not directly participate in this TAS, I give him a legacy credit.

	"I put in extra effort to make the run look more aesthetically pleasing, and so here are some entertainment notes before I get into the improvements. When Link has some free time, he enjoys dancing to the music. When Link walks through towns, he avoids running into anybody, if possible. Most importantly, Link visits Zelda 9 times during the run, and he does a different form of "training" each time to prepare himself for the upcoming section:

				"Real interesting one here. You can manipulate the enemies that appear on the island overworld by delaying Link's exit from the 'fairy required' room. But, at first, it all seems to balance out. Delaying 1 frame in the fairy room means waiting 11 frames on the overworld for the enemies to get out of the way, for 12 frames total. Likewise, delaying 6 frames in the fairy room means waiting 6 frames on the overworld, for 12 frames total again. Every delay between 1-6 frames ends up being 12 frames total. But, when you delay 7 frames, you get fairies on the overworld instead of enemies. And you don't have to wait at all for them. So the net result is 12-7= 5 frames faster.

But, there's a glitch that causes all enemies that should give 300 experience to actually give 301. I had trouble finding any radical ways to improve the Rebonack fight. It's a 3-part fight. Phase 1 is getting him off the hoverhorse. I didn't see any alternative to the 'ride the dragon' method of maintaining the downstab until he starts to turn around. Then jackhammer him. Any change in movement ruined the jackhammer. Phase 2 is the race to the bottom right corner. I stayed a pixel lower, but any change to the fighting style failed in the long run. Phase 3 is getting him to move left for the finishing blows. The slight improvement came here.

				"The first trap of the Valley of Death (Trap 18) is the most dreaded part of the game, because it depends on luck that is mostly unmanipulable. See the map for trap references at http://i.imgur.com/Q2G8xHr.png Like any trap square, you need overworld enemies to run into Link as he is walking onto the trap square in order to overwrite the forced encounter with a shorter random encounter. You need the same thing at Trap 17, but that one is easier to manipulate. You can keep creating extra delay frames during the walk from Trap 16 to Trap 15 in order to change the random enemies that appear in the graveyard between Trap 15 and Trap 17. Eventually, you get a result that works. The result that I got lost 2 frames compared to the current movie. However, here's why the Valley of Death between Trap 17 and Trap 18 is so notorious. You have to deal with 3 sets in a row of 3 enemies that you cannot change with overworld movement delays. And you get only one step down to avoid an enemy that appears in front of Link. But I found that you don't have to completely accept the 3 sets of 3 enemies that you're handed. You can create delays at Trap 15 and Trap 17 to change the timing. But, it's limited. In my case, I was limited to only 6 possible combinations. Any additional delay at Trap 15 changed the enemies in the graveyard to an unusable grouping. If you get a set of enemies that surround Link, you can pretty much forget about using that option at all. So I narrowed it down to 2 options that actually had a chance of working. The first option decided to throw in yet another degree of difficulty by not letting enemies rise up from below Link. And nothing is coming from the left, leaving the top as the only possibility. Nothing worked. Fortunately, after many hours, I found that there was one way to make the second option work without an ugly winding path. It still lost 27 frames. But, if that last option hadn't worked, I would have been faced with much greater losses, probably in the 60-90 frame range. So, despite losing 29 frames total here, it's the best possibility of a bad situation.

				"My goal was to improve the movie by 400 frames. I had thought that I had fallen just short of the goal. But then Inzult found a way to get better X-axis positioning from the fall. It goes in increments of 16. In this case, we needed to get it from 80 to 96. I gave up when I was getting only 91 or so, but Inzult demonstrated a precise combination that boosts it all the way beyond the required 96 threshold.
