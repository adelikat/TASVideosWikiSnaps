This run was started shortly after my Metal Slug 4 run, when Bizhawk 2.9.1 was still the newest version. I was already through the first few missions when 2.10 was released.

	"While turnaround cancel only became a thing from Metal Slug 3 and onward, we have a similar trick we can still use in the earlier entries. Unlike later games where you could cancel by turning around while crouching, in this game, the canceling is down by simply crouching if you're standing and vice versa. The improved firing rate is still the same, once every 4 frames and with melee attacks, you must wait 2 frames before crouching/standing to cancel the attack animation. However, since you're facing the same direction, this can be used to quickly alternate between using your weapon and grenades against an enemy you're facing (e.g. use a grenade while standing -> crouch while using weapon -> repeat) and do a lot of damage. If you have 0 grenades, this trick can also be using to fire upwards or while standing by alternating between firing (while standing) and the grenade throwing animation (while crouching). These applications make this version of canceling arguably better than turnaround cancel.

However, at the end of each round or when canceled using crouch canceling, the laser lingers for 6 frames and does an additional 24 damage for a total of 88 damage (different from later MS games where the laser only lingers for 16 damage). This means that you get 24 damage for free without using any L bullets. This can be abused by pressing fire at specific timings to save bullets while still doing continuous damage. This makes L effectively have 275 bullets, rather than 200 as shown in the screen. The easiest way to do this is to simply press fire on the first frame where L will do an additional 88 damage. Pressing too early will cause the laser to only do an additional 72 damage.

They require 3 or 4 turns to unlock, but it's possible to cancel the delay between each turn by pressing down at the right time. What's interesting is that the ideal cancel timing is different for Marco/Tarma and Eri/Fio. For Marco/Tarma, it's best to cancel after every single turn, but for Eri/Fio, it's actually better to cancel after every 
	[em

However, Eri/Fio can initiate the second turn normally much faster than Marco/Tarma and can cancel immediately after it. Ultimately, for cranks that require 3 turns, there's no difference, but for cranks that require 4 turns, Eri/Fio actually end up being faster.

	"While not as bad as Metal Slug 2, this game unfortunately has large amounts of lag. While there are areas where lag is guaranteed and unavoidable, there are many other spots where it will randomly occur, as if it's determined by RNG, adding to the difficulty of TAS'ing this game. There are various ways of reducing lag: killing certain enemies, getting sprites off screen, or different inputs. Even something simple as holding down while standing still will sometimes get rid of lag frames that occasionally appear for no explainable reason. You'll see me do seemingly random actions throughout the run (holding down during jumps, fire random shots), this is often to reduce lag or manipulate luck. In the Metal Slug games, there is a RAM address that tracks the in-game time and only increments on actionable frames. I was able to use it to mark lag frames in TAStudio with a

The second phase is initiated when its HP hits 4000, where it lifts itself to use the flamethrower. It gains a brief period of invincibility after revealing the turret can only be destroyed after this period ends. During its invincibility period, it can still be damaged till it has 10 HP, but attacking it again will cause it recover back to 20 HP (so it will alternate between 10 and 20 HP during its invincibility period if you manage to deal enough damage during it). Because of this, the strategy here is to frontload our damage to trigger the second phase immediately and start the clock for the invincibility period. With Marco, I get off the slug beforehand and use crouch canceling to use big R + grenades simultaneously while with Tarma, I throw grenades from the Metal Slug while using vulcan. Even though I had 6 grenades with Tarma, I found that throwing 5 and using 2 cannon shots to triggered the second phase a bit faster and it was better to throw the last grenade later.

Destroying it any later would cause the boss fire a third projectile during its destruction animation, losing about 30 frames.

I use grenades on the first two to destroy them faster, but I make sure to throw them at times where I don't lose damage (excess damage doesn't carry over to the next block). I don't use any grenades on the 3rd gate because I'm able to do enough damage with Tarma in the time it takes Marco to unlock the big F. Using the big L a little bit more after unlocking the big F crank should've been better, but it loses more time to lag. I also lose 12 frames from having to use Marco to unlock the big F crank, Eri/Fio are able to unlock it faster, but Marco is necessary to help reduce lag over the entire run.

				" on Bilibili). Each hitbox starts off with an "armor" of 350 HP, damaging this armor still counts toward the total HP. When this armor is destroyed (indicated visually) the hitbox will have a 100 HP block (same mechanic seen in Metal Slug 4 bosses). Any excess damage to the armor or the block will not carry over to the next block. Because of this, when I start the fight with the Slug Noid, I fire a cannon at the hitbox where the hatch is before slightly moving to the left to crash it to damage the hitbox with the fins. This way, I'm able to deal 450 damage with the Slug Noid before I use F.

However, there is only one hitbox that can be hit with F and because of the 100 HP block mechanic, some damage is lost when I hit it with 2 players. I adjusted the timing of firing F with one player to reduce the damage lost, but it wasn't completely avoidable. It was also better to throw grenades as I'm using F instead of throwing them all before using F like in previous TAS'es. Because of the armor mechanic, one of the grenades will only do 50 damage, but the damage loss is worth it.

At the same time, using too much I starts to cause lag. Previous TAS'es opted to just use crouch canceled melee attacks to kill Allen on the top platform. However, one thing I discovered was that if you kill Allen as he jumps down, he will fall into the lake much faster and allow you to move again earlier. It's possible to manipulate him to jump down immediately when the fight starts, but we aren't able to deal enough damage to kill him. So the strategy is to get him to do his melee attack sequence once and then jump down. This requires us to be in front of Allen at a distance (but close enough so that we can easily switch between using our weapons and melee attacks) because if we're too close (overlapping with him like previous TAS'es), he will just continue to use melee attacks instead of jumping down. Since we're in front of Allen now, we also need to back away briefly to dodge his melee attack before going back in to deal more damage. By weaving in a few shots of I with our melee attacks, we're able to do enough damage so that we can kill Allen as soon as he starts to jump down to trigger the faster death animation.

One important detail to account for is the death animation of the Martians. When killed they will either disintegrate and disappear fast or spill green blood and disappear slowly. Certain weapons will only cause one type of death animation, while others will cause either one, so this has to be manipulated. When using C or I to kill a Martian, only the main hit is able to cause the fast animation, killing with the smoke will only cause the slow animation. Killing a Martian while it's in the air will always result in the fast animation. Ideally we want the former animation, but not all Martians need to be killed that way. Knowing which ones need to have the fast death animation is key to saving time in this section. Using F to kill them will always result in a different burning animation, but this is the slowest animation so we avoid it (except for one case).

For some of the Martians, using weapons allows me to hit them a few frames earlier than using grenades or melee attacks. For the final wave, it's better to use a grenade to kill the Cabre Martian on the left, but it only saved 6 frames so I used C + knife instead.
