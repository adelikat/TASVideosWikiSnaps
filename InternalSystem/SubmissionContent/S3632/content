The dificulty was mainly on bosses, they have 'random' invincibility frames, and don't do the same actions when i was recording and when i played the movie. I improve that for the 1st boss with a weapon and manipulate the second one to be sure to have spikes balls ( 3 damages instead of 2 ) and no desync problems. An other problem was to know when i had to save my 3 lifes for taking damages on the way to save time ( death abusing/taking shortcuts). In an other hand, i tried to make some funny/impressive things ( by jumping on enemy, running or jumping on plateforms i was forced to wait) but this game is not the best for that...
