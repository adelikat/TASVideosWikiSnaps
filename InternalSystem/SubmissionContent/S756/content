It's best to just watch the cutscene at the beginning of the game, but basically, the mayor bans skateboarding in your town because you accidentally kill his wife's dog by running over it while "street shredding".  And thus begins your "adventure".

While I'm waiting, I collect some items that are around, so that later I will be able to afford the fastest board.

These board are automatically equipped as I buy them.  And yes, you buy them with tacos, fries, tapes, and CDs.  Wow.  Luck is manipulated here to make Rodney's leaving phrase "Groovy" rather than "Skate straight" because it saves four frames each time.

I meet him a couple times when possible in order to get to a specific store faster, and luck is manipulated to make sure he puts me in the right spot.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In this same segment, I also manipulate two enemies - one to get a CD (which I need for buying the fastest board in the third level), and one to get the security guard to turn around, so my second encounter will be faster.  It may look like I could shoot that person faster, but the guard

They cannot be grabbed in mid-breeze, and of course, when and where the wind picks up is completely random.

]p
[p 
	"First of all, the acceleration at the beginning is slightly slow in order to manipulate luck with the paper.  Same with the acceleration after getting the fastest board.  There is also a lot of screen pushing, which enables me to meet Rodney before you can really even see him.  I collect the papers that I can on the way to him, and turn around once I reach Rodney and get the fastest board.

	"On the ride back to the left to collect the remaining pieces, I must wait at certain intervals so that the papers are accessible.  I tried so many combinations of this entire level and this was definitely the fastest I could find.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I also take a hit around 15400.  This technically doesn't conflict with the "avoid damage when possible", because I had to move to the top of the ramp to shoot the skater in the distance, otherwise she is impassable on the following ramp.  Manipulating luck at this point to move the crab also changed the layout of the papers for the worse.  Still bummed me out though, but taking the hit doesn't slow me down.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I tried to keep this level interesting without losing speed by getting the enemies to shoot at me a lot, but miss.  In some situations I sacrificed a frame or two in order to not be hit.  Although this is inconsistent with my behavior in the previous level, this level has essentially no luck manipulation, and is in dire need of something entertaining.  Altogether, I could do this level 10 frames faster if I didn't care about being hit.  I figured it was worth the trade-off.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I exploit a glitch on the final boss.  As long as you are in the shooting animation, his charge will not harm you.  Due to the laggy controls, this requires me to hold the shooting buttons so long that I fire extra shots that do not harm him.  This is why I said "Accurate shooting 
	[em 
		"as possible
	]em
	"".  I also made sure in the previous levels that I ended up with a full clip, because it takes 14 shots to beat this boss, and I use two extra shots via the method above.  Since there are sixteen in a clip, I don't have any reload lag.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The input stops on frame 37683, and the final boss is defeated on frame 37728.  It is possible to defeat the boss on frame 37725 by beginning a forward motion before firing the last shots (so that your last shot will not have as far to travel).  However, for this three frame improvement, input must be continued to frame 37702, which is nineteen more than the original.  I decided the trade off was not worth it.  However, I do have that movie file ready as well if the majority of people feel that would make a better movie.
