	": Mini-game-based games are generally like sports titles, unless something absolutely amazing happens, they won't make for a very entertaining or impressive TAS. Games like Brain Age are the exception more than the rule. Even though you did well, this is pretty much considered a bad game choice. If you'd like help picking a better game, please talk to us in the forums!

	": WarioWare does not lend itself to speedrun records. All regular microgames go on a fixed timer and are therefore always the same speed. The boss games are always either also time-independent or simple and trivial to do, and are also in a significant minority compared to the other microgames. Because of these factors, I don't consider this speedrun as standing out from unassisted play of the game, which goes against the Vault standards. Therefore, rejecting.
