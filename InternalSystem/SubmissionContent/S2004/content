]h3
[p 
	"All of the tricks listed on 
	[a href=/GameResources/SNES/SuperMarioWorld 
		"Super Mario World tricks
	]a
	" are used. A few new tricks are performed in this TAS:
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		""Turnaround" trick, or "stutter-run". When accelerating from a stop, Mario's speed increases in this sequence: 0 1 3 4 6 7 9 and continues. If you go the opposite direction first (for 1 frame), Mario's speed increases in this sequence instead: 0 -2 3 5 6 8 9 and continues (this is because Mario decelerates faster than he accelerates, so the "extra" deceleration pushes Mario forward a little bit). The second sequence sometimes saves a frame (but not always). This trick can be performed any time you need to accelerate from a stop, except in icy levels. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"“Item Throw” trick. When Mario cape-spins or spinjumps with an item, the item spins with Mario. Normally, if you throw the item away during this spinning, it will be sent away from Mario from whichever side it happened to be during the throw. However, there is one frame where the item will be sent in the wrong direction, e.g. the item will start on the left side of Mario but will be thrown to the right. This turns out to be extremely convenient because you can then jump or bounce off the item without having to alter Mario’s horizontal speed. This is one of my favorite tricks because it looks cool and has great utility at the same time. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Cape-stalling. Right after pressing backwards to do a cape swoop, you can press forwards for a frame to cancel the swoop. This changes Mario’s horizontal speed away from the optimal value, but it halts Mario’s vertical speed briefly, slowing down Mario’s descent. This is useful for places where I need to approach a narrow passageway at a shallower angle than usual, but it’s usually better to approach in a different way without losing speed. I also perform several cape-stalls in a row during autoscrollers for fun in order to make the cape sound stack on itself repeatedly.

	" A note about random lag
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"There are two basic types of lag in this game, and I dealt with each separately. 
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		""Fadeout lag". This lag when the circle (or keyhole) is closing around Mario at the end of levels, and seems to be dependent on Mario's score (a more detailed description is given in 
		[a href=/GameResources/SNES/SuperMarioWorld 
			"Super Mario World tricks
		]a
		"). This kind of lag is completely ignored in this run, because manipulating Mario's score for one particular level might ruin the setup for the next level, so the score would have to be planned out for the entire TAS. This is a nearly impossible task for a run of this length, and time has shown that new tricks, rather than fadeout lag reduction, tend to be the reason for time saved in long Mario World TAS's. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		""In-level lag". This is lag that generally occurs when too many sprites are on the screen at once, so the game slows down. Unlike fadeout lag, the amount of lag is dependant on many factors, including the frame you enter a level, score, and actions such as cape-spinning. This kind of lag can usually be reduced by taking different actions during a level, but sometimes there will be extra lag simply because you entered the level on a different frame. As a result, I have aimed to reduce in-level lag as much as possible, ignoring the component caused by score and entrance time.

I had discovered long ago that entering the waterfalls doesn't slow Mario to 0 speed if you enter them while moving upward; I do this on all but one waterfall (the positioning made it impossible) to prevent my horizontal speed from being canceled. Also, I found out that it's possible to do the second Yoshi-springboard glitch much earlier than before. Mario can get a block into the ceiling while riding Yoshi and hitting the springboard at the right spot, and this gave enough extra height to make the Yoshi-springboard glitch possible. Mario actually ends up standing one block into the floor when he stops rising. Finally, I hit the silver p-switch earlier to reduce lag at the end.
