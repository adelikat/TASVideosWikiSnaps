	" is a 2009 Sega Genesis / Mega Drive homebrew platformer about... well, Pringles. It has 9 levels, which are split into 3 worlds, no music and only 3 sound effects. You play as the pre-simplicity era Pringles mascot who has to bounce on Pringles to reach the goal in every level.

[div class=p 
	"I found 2 new tricks to optimise BP 1. Near the end of the level, there's a vertical section of Pringles heading south-west. My old TAS from June bounced on the Pringles one by one, but I discovered that it was actually faster to bounce on the bottom 2 Pringles first and then land on the top one. I also improved the last vertical section with more precise weaving, with lag being reduced further by Tompa.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Tompa made a couple of very precise manoeuvres to save chunks of time on BP 3. Input was ended much earlier on this level - it turns out that after getting the perfect combo required for an A, you can bounce as many times as you like. This enabled me to hold R for 1 frame less than the current publication. Then Tompa found a strategy I missed - building up speed from the left of the stack of Pringles, which allowed even earlier input end.
