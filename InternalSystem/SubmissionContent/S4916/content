	"I started getting into TASing Knuckles in Sonic Advance 2 sometime in early 2012. I began with TASing random levels to get a feel of the game's physics, while comparing my run times to those on 
	[a class=extlink href=http://www.soniccenter.org/rankings/sonic_advance_2/times rel=nofollow 
		"The Sonic Center
	]a
	". When I first worked on this run, most of my individual level timings were just a second or two away from the real-time records. This prompted me to contact Mukki (author of the amazing 
	[a class=intlink href=/3426S 
		"currently published Sonic run

	"Knuckles is quite an interesting character to TAS. Unlike Sonic, he doesn't have airdash, which limits his speed considerably. His signature moves, gliding and climbing up walls (which require cancelling boost mode), are almost useless in this game, as he is almost always better off running and jumping while in boost mode. Nevertheless, Knuckles has instant-stop capability from nearly anywhere (thanks to his glide and his Down+B attack), allowing him to do ninja-like spindash spamming (which I show off in some boss levels) and also allowing him to use a stop-spindash to defeat bosses quickly.

		" Spin dash: it only takes 1 rev (or 2 frames) to perform a full speed spin dash. I use this move a lot when not in boost mode, and occasionally, in boost mode (therefore cancelling boost mode) to gain immediate horizontal momentum. I also rely on the spin dash a lot in the side-scrolling boss stages, because it is the only way to gain horizontal distance quickly in such stages.

		" Glide: By pressing A in the middle of a jump, Knuckles starts gliding forward at a very low speed, and gradually gains speed as the glide continues. This is generally useless for gaining speed as Knuckles would be better off running normally in boost mode, but it is very useful for coming to an immediate stop.

		" Punch: Pressing B when not in boost mode lets Knuckles launch a punch forward, damaging enemies. I only use this move once in the final boss of XX  Zone, not to do damage, but to gain immediate forward momentum.

		" Corkscrew spin: Pressing B while running in boost mode activates a drill-like attack forward which damages enemies and loses a considerable amount of speed. I do not use this move at all in the run, as rolling into enemies is usually faster.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Downward spin: Pressing B in mid air makes Knuckles slowly spin toward the ground, losing all horizontal speed. This would be completely useless if not for a minor bug - where pressing B very near ground will skip the entire animation, making Knuckles come to a stop immediately. This allows for immediate spindashes, and its utility has been described above in the first point.

However, using this move close enough to a platform skips the animation and prevents Knuckles from rolling, making this move quite useful at times.
