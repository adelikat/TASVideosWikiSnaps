[div class=p 
	"Due to this common fault of the Action 52 series, we can approach the red boxer and then spam punch as fast as the game allows (once every 30 frames) for some quick victories. And because the CPU never does anything or the physics are never changed - unlike Armor Battle, where the bullet's movement is changed for some reason - we can essentially copy and paste the inputs for all 9 rounds.
