	"In this game, after all the cards in every foundation have been revealed and the deck/pile is empty, the game proceeds to automatically place the remainder of the cards. By the typical TAS timing method of "final input", I was able to find a solution in 2241 frames (
	(__wikiLink|href=/Userfiles/Info/71423838930932281|implicitdisplaytext=Userfiles/Info/71423838930932281)
	"). However, including the time it takes for the game to place the remainder of the cards, the final card is placed significantly later (~100 frames) than the published TAS. Despite it having an earlier final input I did not feel it was appropriate to call this "faster" since from the POV of a viewer they'd have to wait longer for the final win message.

	"So I went back and adjusted my heuristic to search for a better solution with this metric & found a solution which places the final card 25 frames sooner than the published TAS at the cost of a later final input.

	". This movie makes the game end 34 frames sooner than the existing publication. It arguably aims for in-game time, except there's no such thing in this game, and the global timer at address $0006 simply increments always. If we only count by when the game ends, this can only go in one direction. But counting by movie length can lead to movies becoming shorter while the game ends later and later, so it would be tricky to clearly compare and obsolete.
