	"Hello, this is my first TAS. I was lurking here with no account for a bit over a year and I finally decided make one and try to publish it. So why this game? Its a pretty obscure game that I had when I was a kid, and I didn't want to start with a game too complicated. I was lucky, this game seem easy to TAS from what I've done.

	"Gameplay-wise, your dinosaur is quite annoying. Everytime he land, either from a jump or from falling, he has landing lag, so I tried to avoid landing as much as possible. He also has turning lag on the ground, turning around is quite slow, except in the air where its frame perfect (you can do a dinocopter if you want), so I try turning around in the air before landing when I need to be turned the other side once on the ground. I do take damage to save time in a couple of spots.

	"From my calculation, I beat the WR by 5-ish minutes. I think improvements are possible: there might be a useless jump in level 1 and I think the balloon boss could be improvable in the future, but I think its pretty solid overall and I'm pretty happy with the attempt I made. I don't have suggested screeshots, I'll let the publisher choose one if it get accepted.
