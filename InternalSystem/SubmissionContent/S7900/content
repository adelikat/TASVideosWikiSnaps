	"Unlike the previous run, RNG manipulation is achieved by intentionally allowing the game to decrement a random number generation counter, that counts from 0x270 to 0x1. After 0x1, it goes back to 0x270. This is called the "RNG counter". The lottery ticket prize generation is determined by another value associated with the RNG counter, called the "determinant". It helps to guarantee the lottery ticket prize generation to be unique, after every cycle, rather than being predetermined by the RNG counter that loops between 0x270 and 0x1.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"In this run, RNG manipulation is used to obtain consecutive prizes using Lotto Tix (in-game lottery tickets) in order to have enough money to buy stats-boosting items, as well as manipulating the store stock refresh item listings. For this run, RNG manipulation is used to buy a higher Lotto Tix prize (3rd prize), and to manipulate the store item stocks to get a special item, Skaterz.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"For every couple of frames, the game calculates what random action the enemies will take, such as jumping, running, moving up/down/left/right, attacking, or running away, subtracting from the RNG counter. There is much to learn from the mechanics of the RNG counter and how it affects the CPU enemies' responses to player actions, and enemy types throughout the areas. You may see me do weird behaviors that priorizes RNG manipulation over speed, for this reason.

[div class=p 
	"The first one is about manipulating lottery tickets faster. This can be done, but you would never have any idea of what potential improvements you will get, unless you can efficiently defeat the gang types in MOOSE and ROCKO areas, and get to Merlin's Secret as close to 0x1 or 0x270 as much as possible. In this run, I tried to get the maximum value possible, 0x1E3. There are cases where, even if you get the same RNG counter values, the determinant values can increment more than one time within a single frame. Therefore, it's not guaranteed you will get the fastest 3rd Prize winnings, but it's more probable to start from the extreme ends of the RNG counter.

	"The second one, I had the chance of trying this out on IVAN. Unfortunately, when bosses recover by jumping into the air, they have a ton of invincibility frames until they land on the ground. These invincibility frames can also trigger when they are hit by a large weapon 1 time, including being kicked towards them. This does not have any potentials for improvement.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The third one is the best item in the game for speedrunning. In Merlin's Secrets, there is an item called "Skaterz", which allows you to warp to your enemies' back when you initiate an attack action. Attack action is when you do any of the combinations of buttons that will trigger a special technique, including techniques belonging to someone else when you obtained the Custom Char scroll item. However, you require to turn this technique off for the final boss fight, as you cannot guarantee to force the bosses out-of-bounds without being able to toss them behind your back, and warping away from the ideal position to pull this off.

[div class=p 
	"The latter effect is more pronounced when hitting IVAN and DRAGON TWIN. "Standing stunlocks" is a finite state machine game mechanic in River City Ransom EX where if the enemy lands on the ground just before it transitions to an "On Ground" state, it first checks if there are any hitbox collisions first before it begins the transition. Otherwise, it will transition to the "Stun / Knockback" state, where the enemy would slide backwards as they get hit. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"I take full use of this game mechanic by pitting the enemy against the wall while performing a standing stunlock, so that when they are stunned, they do not slide outside of my attack range from my chain attacks. With strong attack stats + standing stunlock, the next attack will cause them to get knocked up into the air. If they hit a wall, they will perform a rolling animation, which will "reset" their finite state to "Mid-air" state, which will then allow the game to perform the "On Ground" state conditional checks. Rinse and repeat. This "standing stunlocking" attack effectively allows the player to attack the NPC enemies while skipping any invincibility frames (i-frames for short) on the enemies.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"I have also tested and verified that the special technique, Acro Circus, in the game is much weaker than Grand Slam. This is because of the stat-boosting item, Excalibur, only applies the largest boost to WEAPON, PUNCH, KICK, STRENGTH, and WILLPOWER stats. Grand Slam utilizes the WEAPON stat, while the default Dragon Kick technique utilizes the KICK stat. Acro Circus uses the THROW stat, so there are no changes to this.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Using Grand Slam with Chains have a special property in the game: Allows tall, diagonal hitboxes to deal damage to enemies high in the sky and low on the ground simultaneously. This is thus far, the fastest and strongest way to deal enemies when fighting against bosses. The second, best weapon is the Metal Pipe and Wooden Stick, but I didn't use it since the weapon doesn't have an extended hitbox frame on the initial attack frame unlike the Chains.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"There is a point in the game where I begin manipulating gravity, when fighting against IVAN and DRAGON TWIN. Both bosses have high recovery stats (High WILLPOWER), so they will recover mid-air. By increasing the gravity, the bosses will fall to the ground faster than when the gravity is set to Default. Doing so will allow me to deal hits without encountering their invincibility frames, which can happen when they recover while in mid-air. Using Grand Slam with Chains on boss enemies have the tendency for the boss enemies to recover mid-air, preventing me from dealing damage. This is most likely a game-balancing preventive measure, to prevent the player from spamming techniques and dealing cheap shots.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"You may be wondering, "Why couldn't you manipulate the gravity right at the beginning, when you were changing the gameplay properties near the start?". The gravity property will affect how I defeat TURK and MOJO bosses. Both bosses have the right recovery stats, that's enough to knock them off their feet while allowing me to pound them with chains as they land at the right times.
