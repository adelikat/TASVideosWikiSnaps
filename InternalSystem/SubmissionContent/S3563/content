	"This Tool Assisted Speedrun was played by me (TylerArtrip) aims to beat the game The Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past as little time as possible, mostly about this run is where i do a glitch that makes Link go kind of fast and Link Glitches through the floor and it allows me to beat the game much quicker, skip every item, and skip every dungeon in the game. The next TAS i will do for A Link to the Past is beating all Dungeons which i will do for the GBA Version of this game.

	"The things that would be cool to see in this run is the glitch that i do in this TAS where i clip through the floor and how i speed Links up with the "Allow Left+Right Up+Down" Setting, it's only done on Emulator only.

	"There might be a couple of improvements in this run where at the title screen, i can use the settings for Link's Speed which i had it on medium when i could'v put it on high, the game probably could'v been beaten a lot faster.
