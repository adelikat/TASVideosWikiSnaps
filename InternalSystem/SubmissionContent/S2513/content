	"We used the "anti-lag" feature from 9.4+, yet, its still some 133 seconds slower than the 
	[a href=/1437M 
		"published movie
	]a
	", and 48 seconds slower than the 
	[a href=/1293M 
		"old publication
	]a
	"(DeSmuME 9.2, with lags), both using the "original" route.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"Theres not much comments to add to this movie, it was speculated for long it would be faster than getting Holy Claymore, the route is pretty simple.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"Reach as fast as possible Castle Keep trought 
	[a href=/2255S#SuspendGlitchSg 
		"warping glitch
	]a
	", drop the Final Sword, then (epic!) fight with Dracula.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"Note that it is necessary to trigger the dialog at Castle Keep in order to remove the barrier in the previous room, or else access is blocked on the way back from Final Sword (if say, you warp directly in Final Guard room), the 
	[a href=/2255S#PartnerDoubleJump 
		"partner extra jump glitch
	]a
	" is also needed to reach high plateforms.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"It might be possible to get a higher level within a short time span, but, the bosses and ennemy in this game are not rewarding much experience, thus anyway you'll loose time on gathering more levels, overall its seem pretty unlikely to beat the "original" route, Dracula is having too high buff against Non-Holy weapons (see the damage difference between Death/True Dracula).
