	"It might be possible to get a higher level within a short time span, but, the bosses and ennemy in this game are not rewarding much experience, thus anyway you'll loose time on gathering more levels, overall its seem pretty unlikely to beat the "original" route, Dracula is having too high buff against Non-Holy weapons (see the damage difference between Death/True Dracula).
