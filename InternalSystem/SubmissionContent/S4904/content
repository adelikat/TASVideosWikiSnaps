	"Jumping from Gens 11b to BizHawk to make this movie was somewhat of a nightmare. I had previously completed this TAS on Gens months prior and importing the movie over, cause an immediate desync. Thankfully, re-doing the entire thing allowed me to find more time saves everywhere, so I see it as a blessing in disguise. As such, the re-record count on the BizHawk file is small. Combined with all the old movies and this one, I am well over 15K re-records

	"I originally started working on a TAS for Jim 2 back in 2013, but quickly lost interest after only finishing the first level, Anything but tangerines. Fast forward 2 years, and I got hit with a sudden drive to complete it and I completed it shortly after. Fast forward again, I get in contact with Athens, a known Jim speedrunner on twitch, and he and Falasion, another user on twitch, and I made new discoveries on both Jim 1 and 2. Later on, I completely re-do my old TAS and brought the time down more with new tricks and optimizations. The jump to Bizhawk allowed us to find more skips and clips, along with more optimizations, and brought down the time even more.

	"The very first thing you see, is Jim snot swinging from a snot trail up above. This is not normally possible as Jim's jump height isn't enough to reach up there. Using a double jump gives you enough height to reach up there. Another double jump is used to skip grabbing a pig to get rid of Bob and Number Four. There is one frame when Jim is falling off while falling from a hanging state, where he can jump, thus allowing a snot swing to save time. At the end of the level, you notice that Jim stops before Bob's fight scene, this is due to what we call, the Bob Despawn. Found by Athens by complete accident, having two squids on screen and shooting at the same time, causes Bob to not spawn when entering his cutscene trigger and ends the level immediately.

	"The soil has weird properties in this game. You can jump through them, ledge grab, land on certain clumps even though it seems like you can't, and can even soft lock you by trapping you in unshootable dirt. With shooting the dirt on the right side of the screen and a well placed jump, you can avoid going down the opening and having to shoot away soil to get back up. Here's our first clip, using the snot swing, allows you to grab onto soil from below and skip going around. On Genesis, it's sometimes faster to mash shoot the dirt to avoid lag from occurring, which is big help during certain sections. Using another double jump, allows us to grab the chip butty faster and doing a snot swing ledge grab, skips shooting soil. The next ledge grab is what we call, the hard jump, due to being very easy to miss. If you jump and try to grab onto the ledge, it doesn't work. You have to be in a falling state for a ledge grab to occur. Another snot swing ledge grab, more double jumping, and we are at Pedro, the boss of this level. This is the hardest thing to do on difficult, due to how much damage Pedro can do and how shooting his larva is a task on it's own. The fight is mostly getting Pedro to go where I want him to and taking enough damage to survive the following levels.

The following rounds are just RNG manipulation to get the best patterns possible.

Manipulating the next set of sheep to clip again, allows us to skip the quiz and make our way to the end of the level.

Doing two double jumps in the section above, where the worm flag is, allows Jim to go past the barrier of the first milking barn, which extends really high up. Doing so, allows Jim to skip collecting all the cows and walk to the end of the level. Because you do not collect the first cow, the game does not load the next cow, which is needed for the barn gate to be lowered.

One section of fan blades is spinning clockwise, which sends Jim right at a high rate of speed, letting him skip the falling walls or destroy them before they fall down. Because of weird hitboxes, you can jump in and out of the final fan blades without being damaged. Shooting the red oscillating balls, stops them in place for a short time, letting Jim collect the 'J' orb for a boost of acceleration. One last snot swing and a few jumps and once again, Psycrow has been thwarted.

	"In Tangerines, if you can somehow get enough height from a double jump, it's theoretically possible to skip the entire level. All three Puppy Loves are improvable if you can get consistent fast starts. Fast starts are when the game lags enough and psycrows feathers come out in a certain way after being hit with the bomb, if this happens, the next round text will show immediately and the next round begins. Every single round has the possibility of this happening, but we haven't figured out how to make it consistent. A possible better Pedro fight without taking as much damage to save time later. If you can somehow despawn the first cow in Udderly or go past the first gate without having the need to go from above, that would save a bit of time.
