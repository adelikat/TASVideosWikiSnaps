	"Simple 1500 Series Vol. 63 - The Gun Shooting 2 is a PlayStation game from the Simple Series line of games by D3 Publisher and developed by Amusement & Multimedia Studio. This is a Guncon lightgun compatible game done in the style of the Point Blank games where there are short challenges with quotas to meet. This game has a story mode where each chapter has a selection of 3 challenges where one has to be passed to advance forward. The goal of this TAS is to complete the Story Mode as fast as possible.

[div class=p 
	"Intermittently there's pockets of input polling that prevents shooting as fast as possible. While there can be a shooting input queued up during that pocket, it comes out after that. The problem is that the game still runs everything during that time so there's very noticeable spots where shooting just stops for a bit in a way out of my control. Sometimes hitting something with a shot from that pocket causes another smaller pocket that eats rapid inputs right after with the same conditions. Otherwise the game doesn't lag at all which considering the scope of the game makes sense.

]div
[div class=p 
	"As a note the game spaces lightgun inputs 4 frames between them. This means the fastest shooting speed without loss of input polling is 15 shots for every 60 frames, or about 15 shots per second.

The other minigames technically have a player healthbar where every shot depletes it. The first goldfish scoop game depletes it faster if a goldfish is missed. However, the second goldfish scoop game always has that faster rate for each scoop regardless of success. Either way they're both slower as Goldfish scoop 2 is slower by 87 frames. Technically it could be greater but that's dependent on the movement RNG in Goldfish scoop 3.

The RNG is kind enough to give me a quick pattern for 3 of them, enough to reach quota, and intentionally failing the other 2 opponents to finish quickly. This ended up faster than the other two gunman games since those have long forced waits between rounds that can't be skipped.

The middle game, coin purse, may seem like it can be faster than the timed game with the quick rounds but it ended up slower even with the quota only needing 1 coin to reach. The right game, coin break, is another 20 second timer game based around destroying coins rather than juggling them. Coin shot required a little less shooting.
