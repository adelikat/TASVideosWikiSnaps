	"This is my second tas this game,I posted the first only in the forum, because I used the Cody and Guy, I found that with Haggar and Cody would be much better for it
	$LF
	"I decided to do with Haggar and Cody and really I was right, the only advantage the guy is that he moves fast, had only advantage to him in the second bonus which had a gain of 37 frames relative to Haggar, now in defeat enemies the Haggar It is much higher than the guy and it made much difference.

	": Hi, CReTiNo.  This was a good, fast-paced run.  As stated in the submission text, I especially noticed how you saved time in certain parts by rushing past groups of enemies (and presumably letting them despawn, off-screen).  It was also nice to read that you posted first in the forums and found a faster team combination with Cody and Haggar.  Thread feedback was also favorable, expressing that this was a fun watch (and manly, too!).
