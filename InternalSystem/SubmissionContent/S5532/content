[p 
	"-why choose to play on GAME BOY?
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Because I think then levels are some little different of the NES version, have some glitches only possible in this version and i want suggest a new vision of this TAS because for me it's as entertaining as to watch the NES TAS.

[p 
	"-Why choose to play in japanese?
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Because enter in the levels is more faster than the US version and than  speak with a PNJ is more fast.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF

[p 
	"-What are difference between easy, normal and hard difficulty?
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"In easy, you have 4 health points, in normal or hard difficulty you have just 3 points.In easy and normal difficulty; when you take health, you win 2 points, else in hard mode you win just one health point.

	"-Fast rope glitch:
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"When you climb to the rope for reach the next window, you have an inevitable loading before continue to climbing.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"If you jump and hold the up direction, one frame before the loading start, you create an confusion of the loading speed on the character for a climbing faster. ( don't hold the "up" direction after than the loading is started; this input stop the glitch!).

[p 
	"-Touch the hitbox perfectly:
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Some bosses, like boss n°1, have a hitbox problem when you touch them at the first frame, indeed, they die immediately, not dropped the treasure and block the character in the room!
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"It's possible, with a perfect position into the enemy hitbox, to take damage and touch directly the boss to have an optimal fight and not have the boss glitch.
