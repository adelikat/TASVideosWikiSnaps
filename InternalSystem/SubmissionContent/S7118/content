Starting out in development with generic fighting game characters in its relatively unique platform fighting format with up to four players, it was then spiced up with the idea of putting various famous Nintendo characters up to the fight. The game became a commercial success, spawning various sequels on future Nintendo consoles, a few of which (in particular

[div class=p 
	"Other mechanics which have substantial differences:
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		" Hit stun in this game is very high, compared to later Smash games. Because of this, and the lack of DI as mentioned above, combos are enormously potent, and in high level play it is common for players to die from a single hit, leading into a combo that leads to death or to an edgeguard. Naturally, in a TAS setting this also makes comboing enormously powerful, with plenty of ways to convert a move into creative ways to KO the enemy with few methods of escaping.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Shield stun is also very high. This means that if a character hits a shield, it quite commonly is possible for some characters to keep hitting the shield until it breaks, without the shielding player being able to release. This ironically makes shielding notoriously dangerous. Top-level Smash 64 play typically has players space very carefully around their opponents because any sort of touch can lead to a stock loss.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Fast falling can not be performed if a character is performing an aerial - if a player wants a fast-falling aerial, they must do the fast fall first, and then perform the aerial. This makes the typical SHFFL (short hop-fast fall-lag cancel) impossible in most cases. Additionally, fast falling incurs extra landing lag (8 frames instead of 4), even when Z-cancelling.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" It is possible to grab characters that are knocked down on the ground (as long as they are not in a tech or getup animation).

	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"In Smash 64, tap jump actually has a varying jump height depending on how far the stick is pressed (unlike all later Smash games, which only have two jump heights - short hop and full hop). This allows a lot more control (using TAS-level precision) with jump trajectories, which is very useful for movement in general.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The jump buttons have their own jump trajectories for short hop and full hop, with the short hop being shorter than any possible analog tap jump.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"As an additional note, short hops have varying height of their own, depending on the horizontal movement of the character while jumping. A short hop straight upwards goes higher than a short hop that goes forward or backward. This also has many varieties depending on how far left or right is held.
	$LF
]div
[h4 id=ZCancel 
	" Z-Cancel
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"Pressing Z shortly before landing on the ground with an aerial move will remove the aerial landing lag animation, instead replacing it with the standard landing (which can be 0 frames for a no-impact land, 4 for a default landing, or 8 for fast-fall landing).
	$LF
]div
[h4 id=EdgeCancel 
	" Edge cancel
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"Another way to cancel landing lag is by landing right on the edge of a platform, with enough momentum that the character would slide off the platform just after landing.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"How this exactly works depends on the direction the character faces compared to the edge:
	$LF
]div
[ul

		" if the character is facing towards the platform (sliding backwards off the platform), they will slide off and end up in the air. At this point it's possible to perform any aerial move or action.

		" if the character is facing away from the platform (sliding forwards), the landing animation will be cancelled with their teetering animation - this is known as a teeter cancel. This can be cancelled immediately by any ground move or action.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[div class=p 
	"With optimal application, this effectively reduces landing lag to 1 frame, even from a fast-fall. This is very often used because of the quick follow-ups it enables.

[h4 id=NoImpactLand 
	" No-impact land
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"On some occasions, it is possible to land on a platform without having any sort of landing, thereby having 0 frames of landing lag. This is known as a no-impact land, or NIL. This requires the character to have a very low vertical speed when landing, effectively clipping onto the platform rather than landing on it properly.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p

	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li

	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"Taunting off a dash can be cancelled if the character slides into a platform ledge, resulting in a teeter cancel. This technique is quite famous in Smash 64 for allowing repeated taunt sounds with many characters. Unfortunately, Fox is not one of those characters, but the technique is still useful at times if it is needed to reach an edge fast without jumping or falling off.
	$LF
]div
[h4 id=Pivot 
	" Pivot
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"Unlike all later Smash games, when pressing back while standing on the ground, the character will not change direction immediately - instead, they first enter a 6-frame long pivot animation before dashing off.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"When pressing back during an initial dash, the character also goes through their pivot animation. If the direction is still held, the character will dash off again, or otherwise, they will be actionable after the pivot. Because the pivot animation is not immediate, it is not possible to dash-dance like the later games.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The only way to turn around without having to go through the pivot animation, besides using certain special moves, is to use forward smash in the opposite direction. One application of this is to get some extra range on forward smash by dashing, then pivoting, and then forward smashing.
	$LF
]div
[h4 id=ShieldDrop 
	" Shield drop
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"Pressing down while shielding on a platform will cause the character to immediately drop through the platform, skipping the brief animation of dropping through the platform normally. Unlike in Melee, where the technique also exists but requires specific stick angles, this is trivial to perform in 64 because there is no risk of spot dodging.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"This also allows dropping through platforms while dashing, although it can't be done in the first few dash frames because then the input would buffer a roll. This is used a few times to continue combos off a platform.

[h4 id=ShieldPushOff 
	" Shield push off
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"The insane shield stun off of getting hit while in shield can be cancelled if the character is pushed off a platform. If this happens, the character is immediately actionable in the air, allowing for a way to quickly retaliate. This is used in the few occasions in the run where attacks are actually shielded instead of otherwise dodged.
	$LF
]div
[h4 id=SlidingForwardSmash 
	" Sliding forward smash
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"The first four frames of dash can be cancelled with a forward smash by pressing A.

[div class=p 
	"Specific to a few characters (including Fox, Samus, and Jigglypuff), cancelling a dash turnaround exactly 3 frames into the animation (e.g. by jumping) gives a significant brief burst of speed to the character. This can be used for instance with extended jump-canceled up smashes.

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Notably, due to how short hop height works (see analog jumps above), it is not possible to short hop laser if the player presses full left or right on the analog stick, because the jump will be too short. To be precise, short hop double laser is possible if the analog stick X position is between -70 and 70 during the jump.

[div class=p

[h4 id=ShineCancel

	[em 
		"Melee
	]em
	", it cannot be jumped out of - instead, it is cancelled by landing on the ground instead. This can be exploited by short hopping and immediately performing the shine on the first airborne frame, which resets vertical momentum and causes Fox to land nearly instantly, making him immediately actionable. This opens up a lot of combo opportunities.
	$LF
]div
[h4 id=MultiShine 
	" Multi shine
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"Because of how fast shine cancel is and its complete lack of lag afterwards, it is possible to chain multiple shines into each other, which is known as multi-shining. This can be used to pressure shields, to show off, or in some cases chain multiple shine hits into each other. The latter is quite rare because shine sends at a slight downward angle and the enemy would usually hit the ground first. It often only works with specific DI from the enemy.

]h4
[div class=p 
	"Inputting shine just before landing (typically from a fast-fall) with the proper vertical positioning will cause the shine to come out very briefly before landing on the ground, skipping any landing lag.
