	"This run was started and completed about a month ago, with the submission text being written immediately after completion, as I had intended to submit it then. Recently, during a horrible moment of self-loathing, I decided to look for improvements in the latter part of the run, and ended up finding a much better (and more entertaining) path through one of the levels that saved over a second. After re-syncing the rest of the run and saving more time due to better enemy patterns, here's the version I'm happy with. The submission comments are mostly unchanged from what I wrote a month ago, just with updated numbers and a bit of added info in the latter portion.

	"Whoops, I meant game. Wayne's World was released in 1993, developed by Radical Entertainment, published by THQ, and deemed unworthy by everyone who ever played it. Everything about it is pretty bad, with some parts being incredibly bad and some being just bad enough to be slightly enjoyable. It exists. It may or may not have a plot. That's about all I can say. You can play as both Garth and Wayne, though you can't switch between them at any point. The characters differ in one major way: Garth has a gun, while Wayne is incompetent.
	$LF

[p 
	"There's an AVGN review on the game, so you know it's bad from the start. Wikipedia's article states that Flux magazine called it the 19th worst video game of all time, though to be fair it could be referring to any of the Wayne's World games. I'd like to think it refers specifically to this one.

[p 
	"This is a 1064 frame improvement to the recently published movie by Cooljay, which is 1064 less frames of this game on the site. You're welcome. I started this after the original run got accepted, because I'm the kind of jerk who notices potential improvements and tests them almost immediately. Unfortunately, karma decided to bite me for being that kind of jerk, and it motivated me to actually finish the run relatively quickly and painfully. The run was made entirely in TAS Editor, because there's no way in hell I'm ever actually going to physically control this game in real time.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Over half of the improvement comes in the final Wayne section of the game, however there are a couple new tricks I found that speed things up a bit for Garth... which means that my good name will henceforth be mildly associated with a bad game. Lovely.

[p 
	[b 
		"Sprite Overload:
	]b
	" I'm not entirely sure how this works (which seems to be a trend in my TASes), but from what I can understand, the game stops registering a lot of things when there are too many sprites on screen. Movement becomes noticeably choppy, input is polled about half as often, and some things just stop applying sometimes. Namely, the landing animation. This is most noticeable in the Garth stages, when I rapid-fire the gun to cause enough "lag" to allow Garth to jump sooner. For the most part, this saves a frame per use, however in some cases jumping earlier can give me better positioning for later. Wayne can do this too, but only in the donut-filled bonus stages. Fall damage can actually be cancelled this way too, and there are a few times in the run where I do exactly that.
	$LF

[p 
	[b 
		"Earlier Spawn:
	]b
	" Sometimes, the game just doesn't spawn Wayne or Garth right at the beginning of the stage. Pressing A will let them spawn earlier, in mid-air, allowing for a (rather slow) head start.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Jump-Cancelling:
	]b
	" Because the engine isn't bad enough already. Firing the gun or kicking in the air normally locks Garth or Wayne's sprite in whatever position it happens to be in. I do this a bit for entertainment purposes, because it looks ridiculous. However, pressing A again while in this state puts you back into the jumping animation. This is useless for Garth, since you can fire whenever you want, but it allows Wayne to kick again in the air.

I don't do it all the time, for two very simple reasons. One is that sometimes it just doesn't work, and two is that occasionally it takes 6-7 shots to work, which usually slows down the game too much and negates the frame I would have saved.

I get a different enemy pattern here, forcing me to change up the route a bit at first, which is slower at first but the better positioning means I walk less overall, and I end up saving some time. For the most part, though, it's a lot of jumping. The records at the end were done a bit quicker, and I take damage to keep myself close to the door, allowing for a quicker exit. 62 frames were saved in this section.

The minor speed/entertainment tradeoffs I mentioned earlier are all in these stages, and it basically means that sometimes I go through the stages with slightly different jumping, which costs a little bit of time! Wow! I don't think I lose more than 10-15 frames across all the bonus stages. Feel free to check for yourselves if you want. I'd do it, but the more I look at this game, the more I want to vomit.

The slightly less main thing of note here is that there are different spawns and spawn positions compared to the published movie. Odd. 4 frames saved here.

We get to pass by the Fasworks sign in this section, which is exciting since I could have sworn it was the Gasworks, but otherwise there's not much improvement. This is where I found out that attacking while ducking ends up saving a frame over attacking while standing, so... 4 frames saved in that section. I tried implementing this in the previous screen, but it ended up throwing off enemy spawns on the next stage, costing far more time than the 5 or 6 frames I would've saved. And then, inexplicably, I lost a frame in the last section. Probably an emulator difference, I'm not sure. Overall, 25 frames were saved throughout Wayne's part of the stage.

Second off, the floating screens. The Screens From Hell. They're nearly impossible to hit with Wayne's ineffectual joke of a kick, and having to do it fast just makes it far worse than it needs to be. Not to mention there are, once again, different spawns in the stage that make me have to redo the route in places. I decide to take some damage in this stage, because not only is it faster, but it makes me happy to see Wayne in pain. Instead of waiting for the screens to come to me, I kite them through most of the stage, kicking them as they get close. Near the end, I use the jump-cancelling trick to attack twice in the air. Look at that graphical glitch, too. That's pretty interesting.

This section actually went surprisingly well, in that obstacle spawns actually worked in my favor. Hooray! Kicking the second cop into submission was also a sizable improvement, as I didn't have to move backwards to enter the door. Overall, this part was 70 frames faster. The section after that... Basically the same thing, to be honest. Better spawns, better cop killa, c-c-c-cop killa at the end, and 44 frames of improvement.

What the game fails to tell you is that there's mysterious cosmic forces (i.e, wind) that push Wayne to the right. Or rather, he moves faster when jumping right and slower when jumping left. Walking and jumping to the left are pretty much the same speed, so I don't bother jumping while heading left. Walking looks faster, but I tested both ways and I exited on the same frame. 32 frames saved on the first screen. Yep.
