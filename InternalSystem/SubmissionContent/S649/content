	"This is actually my very first timeattack movie! There are some pretty huge glitches in the game (for instance the "warp" glitch, where you have to take a hit from a particular enemy in such a way that you "leave" the level and warp instanteneously to another section). But I found these glitches to be boring / not entertaining to watch. It took a while to plan the route and I THINK I've got it about right :) Anyhow I am pretty satisfied with the result.
