	$LF
	"Aria of Sorrow is (in my opinion) the best of the 3 Castlevania episodes released for the GBA. It seems to be the real successor of Symphony of The Night. The character design is excellent and the animation is very smooth. You have tons of different weapons, such as knifes, swords, axes, spears, fist attachments and even some guns!
	$LF
	"And besides that, there are more than 100 enemy souls to collect, and each one has it's unique effect. To finish this game description, the game has (like SoTN) some glitches that allow the player to warp to faraway places and surpass the normal map completion limit.

	$LF
	"It's really hard to make the enemies drop the items and souls you

	"the game thinks it's needed, so, in certain places, no matter how
	$LF
	"many times you use frame search you'll always have the same result.
	$LF
	"In these occasions, you must force the number generation. There are
	$LF
	"many ways to do that, like backdashing, attacking, hitting something,

	"It's fast, of course, but my main goal was diversion, not speed.

	"A keen viewer might notice some minor mistakes in the first minutes of the run,
