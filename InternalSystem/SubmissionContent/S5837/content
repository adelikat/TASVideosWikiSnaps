	": We don't have an example movie yet, but this run will have to be redone from scratch using a different game mode, which would allow for more optimal Quotle kills. The important difference is that in this game, the TAS goal is reaching a specific score after which it stops getting harder and changing gameplay, because it doesn't have an ending. Hardest mode allows to gain higher score faster and doesn't require beating a defined amount of levels like this run does.

	"Note that this branch is not 100%, it's a regular fastest any% completion. There's nothing to collect for a 100% branch, no hidden levels or endings. It was suggested that "fastest easter egg" is any% for this game, but it doesn't make sense to consider such a movie something serious, as easter egg can be achieved right in the first level, and it doesn't give any sort of special ending (like Contra Hard Corps does), it simply stops your game after a special hidden screen. I'd even argue that such a run would be too trivial as a TAS.
