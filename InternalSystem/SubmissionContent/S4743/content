	": This is quite a well built TAS, I must say. Although there is the issue of the 3 mini-games, 2-3: Limbo Dance, 3-5: Teetering Towers, and 9-4: Knock Block Tower. Especially when there are 2 TASes that were made of this... One belonging to RattleMan and the other belonging to DennisBalow. If compared to Dennis's TAS, it is faster in all areas and has better Mini-Game pattern management than the TAS made by Dennis. When if compared to RattleMan's old 2008 TAS, however, it is shown to be slower in just those 3 Mini-Games. Despite that, the main run overall holds up long enough that it can still be accepted onto the site considering that the improvements can't be simply spliced in without destroying the entire movie.
