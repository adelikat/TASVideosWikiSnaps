	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"1-Combo Glitch: This can only be performed in two players mode. To perform this, both players must surround two o more enemies and hit them in a kind-of simultaneous way, if it is done in the right way, the enemies will receive a lot of damage dying in most cases or just getting fatally wounded. This is only recommended to use when at least two enemies have long bars or when there are bunches of minor-health enemies. The main hitting ways to perform the Combo Glitch are:
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Punch-Punch

	$LF
	"Punch-Elbow Drop

	$LF
	"Elbow Drop-Elbow Drop
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The Punch-Punch way is apparently the most powerful Combo Glitch, however, after performing this, one or both characters can sometines freeze, and to regain movement, they must be hit by enemies or by themselves. It is convenient to use it with long bars enemies.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The Elbow Drop-Elbow Drop way is very useful to annihilate crowds.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"The Stage 6 is filled with Combo Glitches.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"2-Extended Combo: Not as powerful or quick as the Combo Glitch, but can be useful in some cases. To perform this you need a enemy (Galsias or Donovans especially) or your own companion, hit you while you perform the last moves of the regular combo, this will result in a quick barrage of punches that can annihilate enemies in a jiffy. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"See the Stage 1 Knifer and the Stage 2 Boss.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"3-Block Glitch: Only compatible with Barbons or Zamzas. To perform this, you must attack them with the Thunder Tackle and make them block. With his trick you can remove bars quickly. The enemy sometimes can be knocked down, to avoid this, your companion should intervene and hit the enemy in a way that forces him to keep standing up.

		" It uses a cheat code to play the same character. This is not OK with the rules. If it was used for entertainment, for a limited period of time, that could be alright - see for example the Mortal Kombat 3 run. (We have an explicit section in the rules to allow codes which makes the game harder, so that one is OK. It is also given by the game.)
