	"A tool-assisted superplay on Worms for SEGA Mega Drive: on classic and primeval Worms in all its beauty! This superplay shows the fight between 4 teams in 2 rounds to win (TA vs TA vs TA vs TA). All teams were controlled by me!

	"Found some, but didn't decide to use any! I haven't found any damage manipulations, all depends on how close are worms and bombs/rockets! Weapon box fell once after I threw a granade into the sky (90 degrees), but I wouldn't take it anyway in the run. There are no manipulations of wind and map!

	"I started from warm up! In this round I often made accurated shots using the suitable weapons, tried to not damage teammate worms! Uzi used for diversity and also for moving the worm. Kamikaze used for bumping (there was no other way, worms were blocked).

	"In this round firstly I decided to make the fight against one team to make the fight more energetic! I couldn't use the shotgun as in 1st round and kamikaze used for fast go (there were not many ways to start the fight greater)!

	"In some cases I needed the names of worms in each team, so I wrote down them =)! Some shots weren't precise to make some worms to live longer!
