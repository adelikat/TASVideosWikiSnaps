	"Blu the Airmail Delivery Bird is a game wherein the player must deliver mail while avoiding enemies along a route of seven areas. Pressing A will fire a bullet, and holding B will start an aiming cursor a la Yoshi's Island on Hasty mode. It's not very exciting, but my God, the lag was horrible. Way more than it had any right to be.

	"One big issue is that it aims to the NORTHeast when you first start holding B, so getting up close to the mailboxes is the best way to save time. But at the same time, the game practically falls apart when even a single enemy appears, so I also need to try and get rid of them as quickly as possible. I wasn't able to do that on a few occasions, and you can see just how badly it chugs. The game also lags further if you move, so I had to limit my movement during those parts.

	"There are four enemies. The most common ones are drones and firework crabs. The drones fly straight toward you and drop a bomb when they reach your horizontal position (which doesn't explode, for some reason.) The firework crabs start out in the ground, then launch upwards and explode into five spiked projectiles. Obviously, letting them explode isn't ideal.

	"The other two only appear in level six: jellies and pufferfish. Jellies are the worst offender of lag in the entire game, moving up and down while shooting four bolts of lightning every time they reach the middle of the screen vertically. Again, one was placed in a way such that I couldn't kill it immediately. The pufferfish simply inflate after a few seconds, so they can be killed without TOO much hassle... if there wasn't a glitch where killing them before they reach a certain point on-screen will destroy the pufferfish sprite, but not its hitbox.

	"After level seven, your performance is evaluated. The game has three criteria it checks for: mail delivered, enemies defeated and lives lost. If the majority of mail is delivered, the majority of enemies are defeated, and no lives were lost, you get a "Great!" rank and get to take on the final boss, which I took a hit on to skip most of its death sequence. The lives are shown in the upper-left as three... white and pink thingies? Envelopes? I don't know, but in any case, you only ever get three.
