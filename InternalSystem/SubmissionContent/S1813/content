		"In Dream Land, dreams always flowed from the wonderful Fountain of Dreams.
		$LF
		"The Fountain of Dreams collected the hopes and dreams of all living things.
		$LF
		"It was also responsible for the sweet dreams and rest that come from deep sleep.
		$LF
		"But one day, everyone in Dream Land lost the ability to dream!
		$LF
		"King DeDeDe was bathing in the Fountain of Dreams!
		$LF
		"He had even taken the Star Rod - the source of the fountain's power -
		$LF
		"and broken it into pieces that he gave to his underlings.
		$LF
		"Now, Kirby must embark on an adventure...
		$LF

	"(which can be used as an attack), the character can slide, eat enemies, and if

	" About the run
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"I mainly used the wheel ability in the run as it has the most horizontal speed.
	$LF
	"The game could have been beaten in ~20min if there had been the possibility 
	$LF
	"to jump while being a wheel. This was firstly possible in the game's sequel 
	$LF
	"Kirby And the Amazing Mirror.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In mini-boss fights, I tried to deal damage without getting hit.
	$LF
	"This turned out to be easy but there were some situations that made be angry.
	$LF
	"Some bosses like Phan-Phan or Bugzzy have a big grab range so I had to leave 
	$LF
	"much space between me and the enemy.
	$LF
	"If bosses are standing directly next to a wall, I can't turn/getting normal.
	$LF
	"So I had to jump and turn back in midair, so I could drive back. 
	$LF
	"This however cost a lot of time (but was still the fastest possibility I think).
	$LF
	"While I'm at it: The physics of the wheel ability differ MUCH between 
	$LF
	"Kirby Amazing Mirror and this game, so it was sometimes difficult to 
	$LF
	"handle certain situations.
	$LF

[p 
	"Other than in KAM, enemies have no energy bars and cannot be juggled through the air.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Sometimes, when facing Metaknight's horde it's often better to lose the current ability and use 
	$LF
	"a suck-in-blow-out strategy.
	$LF
	"I did so, if in the part afterwards were 2 special enemies to mix a wheel from.
	$LF
	"I lost abilities in order to be faster at main boss fights as well.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This was originally intended to be a shitty and sloppy testrun.
	$LF
	"But I somehow managed to make it look clean. The run now just has a low optimization level 
	$LF
	"(the rerecord count speaks for itself), so I'm losing frames here and there but there 
	$LF
	"are no real major flaws. Now why I made a testrun? I didn't want to optimize a run of KNID if
	$LF
	"it might get rejected afterwards. I may work on a more optimized version if there is
