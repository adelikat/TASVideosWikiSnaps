	"This turned out to be easy but there were some situations that made be angry.
	$LF
	"Some bosses like Phan-Phan or Bugzzy have a big grab range so I had to leave 
	$LF
	"much space between me and the enemy.
	$LF
	"If bosses are standing directly next to a wall, I can't turn/getting normal.
	$LF
	"So I had to jump and turn back in midair, so I could drive back.

	"This however cost a lot of time (but was still the fastest possibility I think).
	$LF
	"While I'm at it: The physics of the wheel ability differ MUCH between

	"Kirby Amazing Mirror and this game, so it was sometimes difficult to
