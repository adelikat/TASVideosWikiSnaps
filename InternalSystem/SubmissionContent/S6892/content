	"Well, I could play in easy, which is the game is even shorter playing in this difficulty. The Hard not much changes, only the bosses that take longer to die, so not worth much worth.

	$LF
	"The answer is simple. They are the quickest to get 300 dollars, since if I choose other jobs, I would have to do 3 jobs to get the necessary amount, with the second job giving 180$ and the fourth job giving 120$.

	"The gameplay of the game is very strange, the fact that WR played without TAS, implies that he played a lot of that game, several of the movements I made in TAS, would be almost impossible to be done without making mistakes.
