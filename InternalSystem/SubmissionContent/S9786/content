	"For years, I was wondering if anyone was gonna submit a "Richter, all bosses" movie to TASVideos. ForgoneMoose made his own 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=back in 2015|href=/Forum/Posts/412938)
	" but he decided not to submit it due to considering his movie "suboptimal" and not much different from the RTA speedruns at the time. Times have changed now, and many recent movies have followed RTA routes with no one complaining. But it's still been 10 years since that movie was made and nobody else has made another one since. If no one else is gonna do it, I might as well do it myself.

	(__wikiLink|displaytext=incomplete WIP run|href=/UserFiles/Info/15856174109749186)
	". The rest either takes a lot of the strategies from a

		"video of the completed TAS

	" or this 
	[a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DI3AQRUZ-RI rel=noopener external nofollow 
		"RTA WR video
	]a
	". This is why ForgoneMoose gets co-author credit. Now I can't just copy the inputs wholesale from the WIP movie file because they were made for PSXjin, which emulates the game differently from BizHawk. There's differing load times, lag, and RNG seeds to take into account. So when I mean "flatout copied", I more mean adapted to fit into Bizhawk.

	"There's more to this than getting to that platform just mere feet away after blade dashing. Normally, if Richter blade dashes after jumping, he falls like a rock; you can't change his direction or move him in either way. To make it so he doesn't fall like that, you have to either do a flying uppercut or a midair jump in-between blade dashes. The latter is usually preferred since it doesn't take too much time or space and can be worked into many routes that you really don't want Richter to fall straight down.

	"Holding the whip while mid-air does maintain your horizontal momentum and shorten landing animations, but when to have Richter retract the whip is important. If Richter is still holding the whip when he lands, he can't slide until he gets up and retracts the whip, which can take a couple frames. To prevent this, its important for Richter to retract the whip just mere frames before he lands so he can slide at the moment he lands.

In times when the distance you have to travel to get to a certain point is shorter than half a slide or if Richter is in the right state, it would be better to run than slide. Richter runs slower up inclines than down slopes, but he can circumvent that by jumping while running.

	"Richter is very limited in his ability to manipulate the RNG to his advantage compared to Alucard. He can only do so by either whipping, head banging into a ceiling during an uppercut, or opening the map. The first two really aren't an option in Richter's use cases for RNG manipulation, which is getting critical hits on enemies and bosses and manipulating what items enemies drop when defeated, which is usually hearts. Most of the time, it's for critical hits as damage has to be maximized in as short of a time as possible for bosses with large amounts of health like Galamoth when using the Knife Item Crash.

]div
[div class=p 
	"The door glitch is strange and requires timing and positioning. To start off, Richter has to be a certain distance away from the Scylla while fighting her. Any closer and the glitch will not work. Then after defeating the boss, Richter must then wait a certain amount of time, then get to the hole the boss was blocking to find the rock barrier no longer there. Then Richter has to wait a certain amount of time near that hole for a window of opportunity to properly perform the glitch. Once in that window, Richter must go through the hole and immediately blade dash back, in which weird screen transitions happen and Richter finds himself in the flooded room below the Scylla. If you are outside that window of opportunity, the flooded room will be blocked off and the game will softlock. A visual hint on when to go through the door is the rising water after the Scylla gets defeated. Once it rises a certain level, it's safe to go through. However, I never quite tested this enough as performing the glitch was a frustrating experience.

To expose the core of the boss, Richter has to be in the middle of the boss as it is rising and perform his Axe Item Crash so all those spinning axes destroy the layers protecting the core and the core itself as fast possible. This takes advantage of the mercy invincibility you get after being hurt, but Richter has to be standing while he's hurt or he'll suffer knockback.
