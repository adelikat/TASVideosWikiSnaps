	"Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee is a 2D side scrolling platform game released in 1997 for the PS1 and PC. This movie beats the previous movie by 10 seconds - 82 frames thanks to some new discoveries found in RuptureFarms, Stockyards, a small improvement in the Monsaic Lines with the second Slingshot Mudokon and some optimizations in Zulag 4.

[div class=p 
	"Often abbreviated as DDG it makes Abe invisible and can corrupt his sprite and eventually become invisible at some point allowing him to get past things that would kill him. Abe will die if he falls of a ledge or gets zapped. A video made by Sligfantry can show you how this glitch works:

	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"This glitch works by standing on the edge of the ledge and pressing the down button quickly and run towards a spot where you would like to hoist down. You will need to press either 'left/down' or 'right/down' depending on which direction Abe was facing.

	" Stop Turn and Backwards Jump
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"By timing this glitch perfectly you can make Abe stop and turn. To set it up, Abe needs to be standing near a ledge (pressing up whilst tunring arround) you will be able to make Abe do a backwards jump. Notice that when you press the opposite direction to where Abe is standing at the incorrect frame, Abe will just jump up and stand. But if you time it perfectly, Abe will jump backwards and possibly jump to another screen. This will allow you to jump backwards to areas and skip Zulags. In a 100% run it will allow you to get to secret areas quicker and it skips a section of StockYards Escape after finishing the secret area. Sligfantry's video can show you how this glitch works:

Hopefully I'll be able to TAS the PC version of Exoddus in the future as there are some interesting glitches in it including a relocation glitch on which Abe can teleport from one place to another and in a 100% run - it can lead to skipping larger parts in the game like the trials of Mudanchee and Mudomo.
