	(__wikiLink|/6260S|6260S)
	" in a lot of ways. The screen scrolls at constant speed if you're not extraordinary slow, there are also explicit autoscroller levels, and then there are bosses that you need to shoot (mostly).
	$LF

[p 
	"During levels, this movie is not 
	[em 
		"extraordinary
	]em
	" slow, so the screen just keeps scrolling, however there is still lack of precision in whatever needs to be done. I haven't noticed much lag, unlike in Mystic Warriors (MAME-RR can't detect lag automatically), probably because enemies don't run at you in endless hordes in this game. But still managing enemies looks pretty much like decently skilled 
	[em 
		"unassisted
	]em
	" play rather than a TAS.

	"Like in the Mystic Warriors submission, there's no explanation why these characters were used, how characters differ, or why only 2 out of 4 were used.
	$LF

[p 
	"But the biggest problem with this movie is boss fights. 
	[em 
		"Every
	]em
	" boss fight has 
	[em 
		"tons
	]em
	" of missed shots and imprecise positioning. While the levels just look lazy, boss fights completely destroy any impression of superplay. It looks so sloppy that I won't even try to improve this. I am sure it's just as low-effort as 
	(__wikiLink|/6260S|6260S)
	" that I rejected after trying to TAS it myself and easily saving a few hundred frames.on a 1 minute segment.

		"The post by Spikestuff
	]a
	" points out everything that looks wrong with this run, none of the points were duly explained or addressed by the author, and I can say that a TAS that's worth publishing shouldn't have that many visible problems.
