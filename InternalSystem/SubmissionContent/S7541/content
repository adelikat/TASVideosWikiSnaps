	"The Tower of Turmoil is a 2018 NES homebrew in which the player takes control of a swordsman called Takemaru Kurumana in a world in which hundreds of people have gone missing. He sense a large amount of dark energy within a mysterious tower that's only just risen. This TAS aims to speed its way through the tower's many levels and defeat the source of the evil in a under 5 minutes.

	"By taking damage while jumping on or around the same frame as taking damage, the vertical speed gained can be added and converted to the vertical speed of the jump resulting in a large jump boost. There aren't many spots where this is possible but is used as much as possible.

	"It turns out that pressing B to kill enemies halts the player's movement for a single frame. Therefore, all instances of a B press that can be removed have and are replaced with a down slash or whatever its called. Speaking of down slashes, the walls with swords can be jumped over using down slashes without taking damage.

[div class=p 
	"This is more of a fun visual glitch that only adds to the entertainment value rather than speed (it doesn't lose any thankfully) and is done by taking damage on or around the same frame as dealing damage to an enemy. Doing this can produce some very strange results. What's shown in this TAS barely scratches the surface of what's possible. For example, while doing the boss fights, I managed to get the player's health to five, the boss' to zero but have three health icons randomly spawn to the left of 'BOSS'. Another, possibly even stranger result I came across, while working on the heart, I was able to get a health icon (not collectable) spawn inside the left side of the heart. Useless, I know, but entertaining nonetheless.

It's possible to destroy the first half without being pushed off by the laser but the second half requires the player to dodge it. Thankfully, a hit is dealt just before it goes off so no time is lost there.

	"After beating this boss and skipping through the credits, a new mode becomes available: the Blackout. This is almost identical to the base mode except everything is dark and the stages are in reverse so it wouldn't have been any more entertaining, probably less so, to play through it. If it would be better to show this as well, I'd be more than happy to.
