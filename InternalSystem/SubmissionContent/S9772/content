	": Hello Zain thank you for your submission.  To accept a movie it needs to be well optimized and faster than any other existing movies for that game on the site.  With this movie that are lots of noticeable areas that could be improved.  Particularly noticeable unoptimized sections are where you wait longer than is necessary in a lot of areas like piranha plants, and not clipping into walls.  This tas also fails to beat the existing published
