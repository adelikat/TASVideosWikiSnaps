	"A Nightmare On Elm Street is a somewhat original platformer. There are 7 levels in this game, 5 houses, 1 cemetary and one conjunkyard. After each level there is a boss that you have to beat. Each house also consists of a few rooms. In order to complete a room, you need to collect all the bones in it. You can see how many bones I have left to collect in that room on the interface at the top of the screen. If you get to the end of the level without having collected all the bones, you can't proceed. This makes this game less straightforward, and not as trivial to TAS, since you have to plan how you should pick up all the bones.

[div class=p 
	"You can also transform into a "Dream Warrior" on bosses, that you meet at the end of each level. There are three Dream Warriors in the game: The acrobat, the Ninja and the Magician. Only the Acrobat was used in this rn. Transforming into a Dream Warrioron bosses makes the fight a whole lot faster. In order to be able to transform to one of these "Dream Warriors", you first need to have picked up an "upgrade stone." These are gray and can be found here and there on the levels. For example, the grey stone with a wizard hat on allows you to transform into the magician.

		"This is the only real glitch that I've found in this game: If you enter a new area through a hole in the ground, the game thinks you're still on ground during the first frames on this level. This allows me to jump while in air, and passing through the roof. This is used in the third room in house 3, for example. It will become obvious when you see it. This saves around 10 frames or so each time, so it's not a huge timesaver, but it's a nice trick none the less.
