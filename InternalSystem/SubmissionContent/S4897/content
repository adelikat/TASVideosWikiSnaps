	"This is a Powerpuff Girls game for the Nintendo 64. It is a fighting game, and a really, really bad one at that, competing with Superman 64 for worst game on the console.
	$LF
	"Basically, this is a broken game. The story mode is a joke, and the characters are all the same, possibly excluding special moves. The gameplay is extremely repetitive, the hit detection is awful (which is abused heavily in the run) and THAT music loop that annoys you so much.
	$LF
	"It doesn't matter what character you use, or what control layout you use (honestly the analogue stick is worse to control in this game), it only relies on spamming jump kicks in the end, which is what this game is all about.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The D-pad is used in this run because it's surprisingly more responsive and easier to use than the analogue stick, which is not recommended at all for this game, since it's broken... literally, you can't use it properly since the up and right doesn't even work, it's not an emulator issue or anything, that's quite literally how it was programmed... yeah, this game sucks that bad.

	"There's absolutely no difference between each story, nor any character difference between all 3 girls, so Blossom is used since it's my first choice.
	$LF

[p 
	"This run heavily abuses a jump kick move (aka. a large exploit) which involves using Z+A. You can do this move while hitting opponents continually, killing them in a matter of seconds. Ironically, this move is also the fastest way to move around.
	$LF

[p 
	"I originally wanted to make a 100% run with all 3 stories to defeat HIM, but after thinking it over, I realized that goal was a bit too arbitrary. You're technically doing Blossom's story 2 more times, just to get an extra battle, and so that goal in itself being worthless if the stories are all the exact same, and after beating HIM, there's no credits... that basically wastes my and the viewers time... even more.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Since the hit detection is so bad, when I jump to the desk I have to delay my jump to hit the kick on the ground instead of the desk or falling slower.
	$LF
	"I also got to delay a jump kick for approx. 10 frames to avoid getting hit, since getting hit is much slower when maintaining the combo momentum.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This required a different strategy. That girl always grabs that toy box at you, no matter what you do. The only way I found to avoid getting hit by the toy box that was faster, it was by throwing a chair at her at a specific angle, letting me hit her early because she dropped the box. Since the damage taken by the chair is different from a regular jump kick, I do an instant punch as the last hit after the final jump kick.

	" 4th Fight
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This guy is more of a coward than anything. He runs all over the place, so manipulating his movement was a bit harder. He also tries to hit you more than usual, and that with the running around forces me to delay more often than usual.
	$LF

[h4 
	" 5th Fight
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This guy's strategy is to immediately run away from you, however, thanks to the jump kicking strats I hit him and manage to corner him. He also tries to hit you more often than usual, but thanks to my angles on hitting him, it doesn't slow me down, regardless he damages me.

	" Mojo Fight
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Mojo pulls the same strat off as the third fight, trying to throw an object at you. Actually manipulating him was a bit more difficult, since he either can jump, punch you or defend his hitbox by grabbing other objects.
	$LF
	"Luckily, after some trial and error, I managed to improve few frames from my previous TAS.
