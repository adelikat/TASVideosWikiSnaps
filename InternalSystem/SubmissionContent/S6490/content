	"Bonk 3: Bonk's Big Adventure is the final Bonk game to be released for the PC Engine/Turbografx16. This one adds a new twist with candy powerups that allow Bonk to change size to become tiny or big. The plot of the game is quite simple: King Drool, villain of the first two games, decided to steal the top half of the moon. AGAIN. Maybe he ran out of ideas or really liked that specific half of the moon.

	"I first played the game back in january when I was in between projects. I felt it was mostly pretty good but unfortunately it ended with a rather buggy final boss. However, I noted that the game actually ran on Bonk's Adventure's engine rather than Bonk's Revenge's engine. Speed worked exactly like it did in Bonk 1. Hovering was made a bit weaker from Bonk which initially turned me off from the game aside from a quick first level test.

	"Fast forward to March, I still really hadn't found a project that interested me, so I decided to try the second screen of this game. This second screen resulted in me totally falling in love with this game and its mechanics.

[h3 id=MechanicsAndTricks 
	" Mechanics and tricks
	$LF
]h3
[ul 
	[li 
		" Hovering: Spamming the attack button in midair results in your vertical speed being repeatedly reset to a lower value. Works pretty much like it did in Bonk 1, except it doesn't accept the inputs if they're entered as quickly. Sometimes I need to deliberately space out my inputs even further in order to gain a pixel or two off a hover without adding additional rotations. This is probably where a ton of my rerecords came from. Unfortunately it interacts with slopes in a dumb way. If you do a hover and then land on a slope, you will land on your head even if you were facing up, unless it's an ice slope.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Flower Boosting: Also works pretty much how it did in Bonk 1. Attacking a flower from the side will result in you moving at speed 7 which you can then extend by jumping and then hovering and hopefully bouncing off enemies. Unfortunately, just like in the first game, you can only actually successfully bounce off a flower every other frame for some reason. If you do an attack on the wrong frame you just miss. I try to get a little extra distance from the flower if trying to attack it the first frame possible would result in a miss.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Bouncing: Hitting an enemy from above with a midair Bonk will cause you to bounce off the enemy and deals double damage to it. Very useful since...
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Damage Boosting: Still gives a ton of height BUT doesn't allow you to maintain horizontal speed in this game unlike in bonk 1. The other reason this is not used often has to do with size mechanics.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Large meat (or eating two small meats consecutively) will make you temporarily invincible, allow you to build up to 6 speed by running/jumping and allows you to jump higher. Any form past no meat power up will change up the timing for hovering. Butthead Bonk breathes fire while on the ground instead of headbutting so he cannot do flower boosts. Bonk slowly reverts back to normal over time but will instantly drop a form if he takes damage unless he is big or small.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Size: if you are either big or small you will return to normal size if you take damage. However, your meat powerup level is not affected if this occurs. Additionally, if you collect a meat while small/big, the powerup animation will not play, saving a considerable amount of time every time you need to collect a meat. Size status is maintained between screens.
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" Small: Has same hovering mechanics as regular sized bonk but cannot jump as high. It is used for the majority of the TAS due to the meat canceling ability and exiting out of it costs time.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				" Big: Hover inputs are incredibly slow, meaning hovering is almost worthless as big. Not used very often, except for a shortcut near the end.
				$LF
			]li
		]ul
	]li
	[li 
		" Walking off a ledge will reset Bonk's horizontal speed to 0 so it would NORMALLY be preferable to jump off instead if possible BUUUUUUUUUUUUUT...
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Wall jumping: Sets Bonk to 5 speed and gives a good amount of height. Note that normal walking speed is 4. That means if you are not abusing a flower boost or a meat powerup, this can be used to move slightly faster. It combines quite well with the walking off ledges speed reset and is part of why I fell in love with the game. It's often most optimal to perform the wall jump from as far away from the wall as possible.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Meat Flower Trampoline glitch: Normally only the yellow flowers are supposed to let you jump off of them like a trampoline, but if you press jump within 5 frames of entering the air after bouncing off an orange flower, you will rocket into the air. This doesn't hold true for other colors.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Swimming: still annoying to optimize
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Grabbing this sapling powerup with two leaves will cause a flower to grow on top of bonk's head. This will allow him to swim through midair if you press up. It can be cancelled by performing an attack. Taking damage loses the powerup and it is automatically lost in between screens. Can be useful for shortcuts.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Landing on ice after doing any midair flips (even if you cancel the attack and land on your feet) will cause you to slip along the ice at speed 5 and you will not stop unless you press the opposite direction and jump which will freeze you in place for a while or simply slide off a ledge or into a slope. Combines quite well with the walk off ledge speed reset and wall jumps.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" The longer you slide down an ice slope, the more speed builds up.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" If you are moving up an ice slope, repeatedly tapping the jump button will maintain your current speed no matter what it is.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Glitched ice slide: If you perform a flower boost while on ice, the game tries to slow Bonk down after a certain amount of time. However, even though the RAM address I use says Bonk is at speed 3, for whatever reason, he is actually continuing to move at speed 7. If you let it hit 2, then he will actually slow down, but it's possible to maintain this state by repeatedly jumping. You need enough space to do this though so it's only applicable in one spot.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Waterfall jumping: Exiting a waterfall from the side will cause Bonk to jump. You can perform this repeatedly to scale waterfalls quickly.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Boss triple hit: Kinda. So if you land on a boss from above you deal double damage. However there is an additional hitbox that appears briefly after you press the attack button in midair that will hit an enemy in front of bonk for 1 damage. If you attack a boss at the corner of its hitbox you can deal 1 damage from attacking it from the side and then deal 2 damage by bouncing off of it. Typically the setup for this is slightly slower than simply bouncing off the boss but the extra point of damage is worth it most the time.
