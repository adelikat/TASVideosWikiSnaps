	"This is a playaround of the game RBI Baseball where I play a game against the CPU.  RBI is probably the most popular of the classic old school baseball games.  It is also known for having a number of quirks and bugs.  This run attempts to show off bugs, silly play, and manipulation of poor AI.  Most importantly, I play an absurd game of baseball and try to entertain the crowd.  And don't worry, this is only 1 inning.  This game is set up so that the game is over if a team is 10pts or more ahead at the end of an inning.

	"The Houston Astros are considered the worst team in this game and the National league is the best.  So it is only natural I pick the worst team and play against the best.

	"I show that with runners on 2nd and 3rd you can get a run in if you sacrifice an out.  It takes frame perfect precision, however.

	"Apparently, if you substitute a pinch hitter quick enough you glitch out the pitcher!  He is on the wrong part of the screen.  I certainly have a little fun with this ^^
