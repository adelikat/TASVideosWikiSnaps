	"This is a playaround of the game RBI Baseball where I play a game against the CPU.  RBI is probably the most popular of the classic old school baseball games.  It is also known for having a number of quirks and bugs.  This run attempts to show off bugs, silly play, and manipulation of poor AI.  Most importantly, I play an absurd game of baseball and try to entertain the crowd.  And don't worry, this is only 1 inning.  This game is set up so that the game is over if a team is 10pts or more ahead at the end of an inning.
