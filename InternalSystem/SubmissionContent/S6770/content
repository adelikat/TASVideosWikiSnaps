	"When I first picked this game up and started looking at the win condition it looked like 0x4B was the stage counter and it looked like the game would soft lock after 255 stages. After putting more time into it however I discovered that 0x4B is the number of foxes on the stage. There is no actual level counter, the number of bombs in the stage (0x4D) starts at 10 and increases by 10 each stage up to 60. The other difficulty parameters are derived from this. Stage 6 has 60 bombs and is the most difficult. This 6th stage with 60 bombs repeats indefinitely. It was a bit hard to test because they stored the score directly in the nametable, but the score just wraps if you max it out and it doesn't break anything.

	"The RNG (0x55) in this game is pretty well done. The function that advances the rng does 0x55 RNG next = (previous << 2) + previous + 0x11, but this is not just called every frame, it is also called in the wait loop at the end of each frame. Since the outcome after each from depends on how much other code executes that frame this means it is difficult to manipulate the RNG for a specific value, but easy to influence it. Just pressing some buttons influences the execution, even if you aren't actually hitting anything. This is used frequently to try to spawn the bombs as quickly as possible.

		" You have to wait for the bomb crumble animation anyway, but I tried to make the wait time between animations as small as possible. In some cases all of the foxes are between bombs and it takes a few frames for one to come in range. It may be possible to spawn in a different order in some places to reduce this slightly, or possibly allow multiple bombs to spawn before crushing them. I think there could be a few frames shaved by spending a bunch of time messing with it, but probably not too many.
