		" 1 less turtle change in level 3 - I end level 2 with Raphael instead of Mike.  This saves 1 less turtle change when dying in level 3.  This saved 60ish frames.  Thanks to Spider-Waffle for pointing that out.

		" better rope scene in level 4.  I used a new strategy to skip the 2 ropes.  It saved 60 frames, and looks much more polished.
		$LF

	[li 
		" better technodrome fight.  I manipulated the technodrome to open its eye immediately and to last long enough for two hits.  Also, I manipulated the up+down glitch so that the blinking pattern is in sync with the eye openings.  This saved 4 more frames.  All in all, it was 74 frames faster

		" Final corridor of lv 6.  This is the loooong room with jetpack guys.  I saved about 140 frames here.  The result is also very nice looking in comparison.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" New luck manipulation strategy.  You will see me press select to select/deselect shurikens for seemingly no reason.  This is to manipulate enemies, particularly boomerang guys.  By doing this I make them not throw boomerangs, which prevents lag.  Not sure how much was saved from this, but it is rather small.  Maybe 20ish frames total.

		" I picked up recording from the 2nd turtle change in lv2.  Everything before is v2.  There is one spot prior to this where I didn't get inside the wall upon downscrolling.  This is a 4 frame error left into the movie.  Oops.  Also, it may only save 2 frames because it may mess with the timing of the black screen at the end of the level.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" At one spot in level 4 I spend 4 frames manipulating shurikens.  Later, I was able to get extra shurikens that I didn't plan on without losing time.  So I didn't need to spend those frames.  Though, even if I were to do a v4 with this hindsight, I might get them anyway.  There is no guarantee of mainpulating shurikens without losing a few frames since the randomness will be different.
		$LF

	[li 
		" I found a spot in lv6 where my subpixel position was such that I could press left 2 frames after walking right to a ladder and get on the ladder 3 pixels futher into the wall.  In this spot, I didn't need to get into the wall so it was useless.  But perhaps there is a ladder where I do need to that I also have the same subpixel position.  If so, I could save 2 frames.

	[li 
		" Manipulating the "random" enemy sets.  After extensive debugging of ram addresses, I found the variables that store and determine the enemy set.  I use this to make sure that I have the best choice of enemies whenever it is possible to do so.  This saves no time technically since v2 had that ideal set (by dumb luck mostly ;P).  But it did mean that a 20 frame improvement in lv3 had to be removed in order to manipulate the "proper" enemy set in lv4.

		" The jump in the 2nd sewer of lv1.  I jump and downstab to hit an enemy after the mini-boss.  This is required.  You can't hit him without jumping.  Jump + regular stab and jump + downstab cost the same amount of time.
		$LF

		" Killing of turtles to save animation time in the blimp cutscene after level 4.  The cutscene time is fixed.  If a turtle is dead, a pause will be put in his place.

		" Possibly a mega-shortcut in lv4 using the scrolling glitch.  I posted in the TMNT thread showing how I skipped from room 2 to room 17 but got stuck in a hole in the ceiling.  I revisited this glitch and used a cheat code to fall through the through the ceiling (becoming unstuck).  To my surprise I couldn't scroll right to the door.  This isn't actually room 17 it turns out but just some extra room layout in room 2.  Perhaps put there intentionally to tease :P  So even if I could get out of the ceiling, I would just be stuck in a the room. :(
