	"Funkotron has been invaded by Earthlings, and it's up to us with our Trap-o-matic jars to fix the problem.  Not only that, but the Great Funkapotamus is hiding in the Funk Dimension, and will take a little persuasion to get him out.  This run gets the good ending, by collecting all 10 of Lamont's favourite stuff.  The objects themselves are hidden in secret doors, most of which don't even exist until you've officially asked your friends for directions; but a few can be entered early without the need to trigger the dialogue.

	"Basic running speed is capped at 768, but has slower acceleration rates.  Diagonal jumping speed can only reach 512, but has much faster acceleration rate; thus the best start to each bit requires a quick hop at the start.  Other fast movements include Panic Buttons and sliding down snow, having speeds of 1024 and 1536 respectively, but naturally these cannot be done wherever we want.  Diagonal jumping itself is the intended way to get across platforms, with a standing squat jump being how to reach higher bits.  Squat jumps can reach a much higher altitude, but have a much lower speed cap of 384.  A neat glitch is through frame perfect swapping from running to squat jumps, we can maintain our 768 momentum while doing these extra tall jumps.  This allows for a few unintended shortcuts, plus the advantage of hopping over small obstacles without losing any speed.

	"Jars can also be used during jumps, but will affect your speed or control in some fashion.  If thrown outwards, your x/y speeds will be halved each time, but can be done as many times as you want.  If dropped beneath you, you can maintain your current x speed but your Y values will reset to 0.  This can used to delay descents up to 3 times, or to cut jumps short.  Throwing a jar while entering water will max out your drop

	"Desyncs are known to occur in this game, for example starting the emulator with sound off will cause one in level 5.  Fast forwarding other sections can cause desyncs in them too, so careful.  Otherwise, enjoy.
