Fortunately, you are carrying your pocket sonar, which always tells you how far from the 64 you are. The shorter the line displayed by your sonar, the closer you are to escaping.

These shocks, though powerful, are very short, so you can endure up to four collisions with the spikes and still stand chance to make it home.

	"The main work of this TAS, was to control RNG so that the "Hidden Computer" would be as close as possible to the starting point of each round. After I worked out a plan on how to force this RNG, I wrote a variation of a previously used BOT to accommodate for this task. Basically, I scanned the "Sonar" address to check for the lowest possible value and then stopped the BOT, so that I could manually play the level.
