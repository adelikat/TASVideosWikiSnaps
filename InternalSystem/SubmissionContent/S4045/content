	"This TAS is based on my previous work, 
	(__wikiLink|/2432M|2432M)
	".  By popular demand, this TAS attempts to achieve final victory in as few Frames as possible, rather than to achieve final victory with the shortest possible input file.  In my first TAS of this game, I aimed for the shortest possible input file.  I liked the idea of ending input as early as possible not just for the time saved, and for the bit of variety compared with the first 2 battles, but also to demonstrate the opposite extreme of luck manipulation by using it to defeat the final enemy Army with only enough effort to barely survive.  I'm still learning the finer points of making a watchable TAS.  :)   This input file ends 631 Frames later than my previous TAS due to more Frames being spent in "The Siege", and more Frames being spent manipulating "The Attack".  Of course, these Frames are not sacrificed without good reason: the last enemy Soldier is destroyed 3038 Frames earlier.  That's 50 seconds, nearly 50% of the total length of the previous input file!  Let's hope this is a bit more entertaining to watch.  Whether or not to Obsolete the previous TAS, or to create a new Branch, I leave to the judges.  Uhh...  Aqfaq I guess.  :)

	"There are several methods used in this TAS to manipulate event outcomes:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Delaying for 1 or more Frames
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The number of Frames that the A button was held when the previous command was entered
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The Frame on which the last input was entered for the previous command
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Many commands in the game require a brief screen transition.  If the A button is pressed to enter such a command on an odd-numbered Frame, the screen transition will be 1 Frame longer than the same command entered on an even-numbered Frame.  For example, if A button is pressed on Frame 100, the screen transition would be 9 Frames long, and if the A button is pressed on Frame 101, the screen transition would be 10 Frames long.  Unfortunately, this policy is often reversed, and an odd-numbered Frame yields a shorter transition, so this must be observed for each individual transition in the game.  This policy can't really be used to save Frames as such, but it does provide options as to what Frame to place input, which allows some manipulation without sacrificing any Frames.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The outcome of any given command is determined to some degree by the Frame on which the previous command input was entered.  For example, if "Done" is selected on the "Transfer Forces" screen on Frame 100 on Turn 1, and then the Player conquers an unclaimed Territory on Turn 2, the enemy may Raid a Player's castle after Turn 2 has ended.  However, if "Done" is selected on the "Transfer Forces" screen on Frame 101 on Turn 1, and then the Player conquers an unclaimed Territory on Turn 2 just the same as in the previous example, the enemy may choose a different command, and the Raid can thus be avoided.  Another method to manipulate event outcomes is to hold the A button for 5 Frames (or longer, as needed) when entering a command.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When using "Move Army" between the Player's own Territories, the A button can be held down for more than 1 Frame to prevent the cursor from resetting until the A button is released.  Holding the A button for 2 Frames or more will manipulate the RNG as needed to manipulate event outcomes.  If the A button is released, then held again for 2 Frames or more starting on the Lag Frame when the army's icon moves, the same effect is achieved.  Note that this will not work when using "Move Army" onto an allied, unclaimed, or enemy Territory, because under such circumstances the game accepts only the first Frame of input, and immediately begins the transition to the next screen.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Between Turns during the game, there is a (very good) chance of a random event occurring (the "Meanwhile..." screen).  One of the allied Knight's daughters may be kidnapped.  Refusing to rescue her will cause the Player's Knight's Leadership Rating to decrease by 1 factor.  Choosing to rescue her involves a lengthy sub-quest.  Obviously, either of these are unacceptable in TAS terms, so kidnappings have been manipulated not to occur at all in this run.  Another random event is raiding of the Player's Castle, causing the Player to lose half his Gold.  A Castle raid occurs once in this TAS, but required only 8 additional Frames and could not be manipulated without causing worse problems (the loss of the Gold itself was a moot point, as no Gold is required after November).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When de-selecting the last unit type on the "Buy Army" or "Transfer" screens, the A button can be held down for more than 1 Frame to prevent the cursor from resetting until the A button is released.  Holding the A button for 2 Frames or more starting on the Lag Frame will manipulate the RNG as needed to manipulate event outcomes.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"After the A button has been pressed to begin "The Attack", the result of changing to a different Option changes on Frame 42 of "The Attack", and then changes again every 31 Frames thereafter. For example, if "The Attack" begins at Frame 100, and the Option is changed to Bombard on Frame 141, the result would be the same as if the Option had been changed on Frame 100-140.  However, if the Option is changed to Bombard on Frame 142, the result would be different.  Note that changing the Option refers to the Frame on which the A button is pressed to confirm the Option: it doesn't matter on what Frame the directional input is entered.

	"A Knight's Leadership Rating determines the effectiveness of his Army in battle (and the speed of the crossbow during the.. never mind that now).  Leadership ranges, from lowest to highest, Weak, Average, Good, and Strong.  In the game, it acts as an attack multiplier for the various units in an Army.  A higher Leadership Rating means faster destruction of the enemy during "The Attack", which could otherwise be incredibly time-consuming.

If there are fewer than 30 Soldiers in the enemy Garrison (due to Disease or Greek Fire), Robin Hood will destroy slightly fewer soldiers, to a minimum of 5.  These enemy Soldiers will be destroyed by Robin Hood's attack, "The Ambush", after "The Siege" but before "The Attack".  You can get Robin's help a total of 3 times: just enough for this TAS.

	"Dorset must be conquered to have any access to attack Cornwall.  The enemy Knight from Cornwall will conquer Dorset.  Even if he is manipulated to not do so in October, and the Player conquers Dorset in November, The Cornwall Knight will attack at Dorset during his Turn, intercepting the Player's Army.  For these reasons, Dorset must be conquered as quickly as possible, and by extension Cornwall also.

	"Gloucester has 12 Vassals and an Income of 7.  That's 4 more Vassals than any other Territory in the game, and as much Income as any other Territory in the game.  Moreover, it can be conquered on the first Turn, if the Player's Knight begins at Clwyd.

[p 
	"Buying 5 Soldiers requires 39 additional Frames compared to buying only a Catapult.  Transferring 5 Soldiers requires 39 additional Frames compared to Transferring only a Catapult.  Thus, 78 additional Frames are required to field 5 additional Soldiers.  That's (78 / 3 = 26) Frames per battle, a negligible sacrifice compared to the cumulative effect of possessing even just a few more Soldiers, particularly considering that not a single Soldier is lost in the first 2 battles.

	"Using Greek Fire will destroy 3 enemy Soldiers in the Garrison.  If Greek Fire  is used after Disease has been used, it will destroy fewer Soldiers.  Greek Fire does not destroy enough enemy Soldiers to offset the number of Frames required to fire it, so it is not used in this TAS.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Using Disease on Day 1 of "The Siege" will destroy 10 enemy Soldiers in the Garrison.  Using it on Day 1 allows the Disease more time to spread throughout the enemy Castle.  If it is used on a later Day, it will destroy progressively fewer Soldiers, to a minimum of 1 if it is used on Day 6.  If Disease is used after Greek Fire has been used, it will destroy fewer Soldiers.  Disease could be fired slightly more quickly over a slightly damaged Castle wall on Day 2, but it would destroy only 9 Soldiers--not enough to offset the number of Frames required to destroy 1 additional Soldier during "The Attack".
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Boulders are used to damage an enemy Castle's wall.  The condition of an enemy's castle wall after "The Siege" determines the defense of the enemy Soldiers during "The Attack".  The more damage that has been inflicted on the wall, the lower the enemy Soldier's defense.  As such, Boulders are more effective than Greek Fire or even Disease at changing the outcome of "The Attack", despite the fact that Boulders cannot destroy Soldiers directly during "The Siege" as do Greek Fire and Disease.  After 3 Boulders have damaged the Castle wall, their effectiveness drops sharply, and they no longer lower the enemy Army's defense sufficiently to offset the number of Frames required to fire subsequent Boulders.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Firing Greek Fire over an undamaged castle wall requires 249 Frames.  For each level of damage to the castle wall, subtract 21 Frames from the total.  For example, at 1 level of damage to the castle wall, the total Frames to fire Greek Fire would be 249 - 21 = 228 Frames.  This adjusts for the shorter draw time on the Catapult and the consequently shorter flight time for the projectile.

Furthermore, the specific Frame on which the Option is changed alters the outcome; this has also been optimized.  After leaving Bombard selected for a time, the Option is changed to Outflank to prevent a kidnapping event after conquering Cornwall.
