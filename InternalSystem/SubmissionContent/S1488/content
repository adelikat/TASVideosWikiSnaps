	"A fun game with good music, improved by 13 seconds.  Most of the improvement was during boss fights, elevator scrolling, and bit better controlling of lag.  This guy walks very slightly faster than he jumps, kind of like Mega Man, so I do my best to avoid being in the air if it's not needed.

	"Level 5 - Autoscroller!  I dance to the music a bit more.  That's actually why I did this run in the first place - the music rocks and there wasn't enough dancing to it.

	"Final Bosses - 3 seconds saved by taking damage to hit the weak point for massive damage earlier.
