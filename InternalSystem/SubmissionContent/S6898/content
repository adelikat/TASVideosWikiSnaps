	". This run does not complete the game in any fashion and as such is unacceptable. Any longstanding community member could tell you that one typically does not submit movies that obviously break this rule outside of April Fools Day. As such, this submission would be better off in userfiles, the forums, or waiting for april fools. Please continue TASing however, as I believe you have a lot of potential.
