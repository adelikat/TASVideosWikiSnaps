	"Hello all! This is my first submission in 7 months. Now that so much time has passed since I asked to get banned in March, I feel like my mental health is finally good enough to return to TASVideos. This isn't exactly a massive return, as I made this in less than 2 hours, but it's great to be back ^^

	"RNG is manipulated to get the most optimal seeds as possible. Ideally, we want a seed where nothing slows us down. but that can't always happen due to the sheer amount of balls there are. For example, in this first level, we have to slow down for a bowling ball by sometimes letting go of L for 1 non-lag frame. We can jump facing backwards if we press B on the first frame we land, a bit like SMB1. Each jump costs 2 frames. so we essentially want to press B as little as possible.

This also happens in Levels 5, 6, 8 and 10.
