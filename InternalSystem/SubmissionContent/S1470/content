	"Xexyz is a side-scrolling shooter that not a whole lot of people have played. Xexyz takes place across five islands. The goal is to find a Force Star hidden on each island (world) to gain access to the Mechanical Castle and destroy the boss inside. Along the way, powerups can be bought (although I do not do so), ranging from different weapons to increased air maneuverability to a mirror image of yourself to fight alongside you.

	"One interesting note is that this game is a side-scrolling shooter, yet in and after the Mechanical Castles, a self-scrolling shooter is used to "travel" to other parts of the castle or to other islands in the land of Xexyz, leading to time that cannot be shaved off the run.

	"I have canceled this run for obvious reasons. First of all, noone likes it :) Second of all, I've started redoing it, and after passing the first level I can honestly say that both shooters were way better done (I'm aiming for way more kills & entertainment in the shooters now.) and make me look like I actually know what I'm doing (which of course I do, I have the game on cartridge and have beaten it many times, though that's on the matter of hours w/ passwords and stuff.).
