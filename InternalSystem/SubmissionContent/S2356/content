	[li 
		"you may notice lag during this run; despite my best efforts, I could only reduce lag and not avoid it entirely.

	[li 
		"the finishing moves can be manipulated so that they kill enemies other than the "targets" as well as enemies that weren't knocked down to begin with.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"if a jump to a higher platform is timed correctly, the player will "catch" the edge of the platform instead of staying in the air longer.

]p
[ul 
	[li 
		"running attack used on most of the hanging enemies
		$LF
	]li
	[li

		"poles not used because then jump kicks cannot be used
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"I intentionally destroy three containers in Level 2-2; the first and third are destroyed to avoid interference in battle, and the second is destroyed for entertainment
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"In Level 2-3, ramming the front bikers is faster than waiting for them and kicking them
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Big Blag is the only boss with no invincibility period; I clearly abuse this fact

	"Level 3:
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		"In Level 3-2, I intentionally have player 2 wait for player 1 so that both players can safely pass under the press; this is faster than having player 1 wait for the press to rise

	[li 
		"Also in Level 3-2, after the two whip girls, I move the players so that they both safely pass under the presses as early as possible

		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"damage during Robo-Manus fight is intentional so that player 2 can deliver the first hit as early as possible and since only one player is required to deliver the other hits as early as possible

	"Level 6:
	$LF
]p
[ul

	"Level 7:
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		"I could not manipulate the two containers that appear during the Dark Queen fight, but I didn't have to. The first container contains an invincibility power-up which actually helped player 2 deliver an early hit. I was able to destroy the second container (to keep it from interfering) and avoid losing frames at the same time.
