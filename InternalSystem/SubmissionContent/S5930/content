	": This hack doesn't really seem to offer much material compared to the base game or other Super Metroid hacks. Graphical and musical changes are basic, the level design and item placement while designed to be suitable for speedrunning don't offer too much of interest from a TAS-viewing point, and the choice of ending theme appears to be rather controversial to say the least. Ultimately, the hack just does not hold up entertainment-wise, and viewer reception turned out mediocre at best - which is not good enough to publish a hack with. Rejecting.

	": So the previous judgment is representative of a different time when we were much more snobby. We had a much more narrow idea of what we want to see from hacks and there really isn't a great reason for it now. Watching it now, it's really not a bad hack, even if I tell the ending theme "don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more" from how unfitting it is. Optimization seems absolutely fine. The hack is definitely well known and easily found.
