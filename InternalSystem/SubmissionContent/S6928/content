	"....probably not a good sign already) and published by Electro Brain/Milton Bradley in 1992 (boxart shows Electro Brain, Milton Bradley is mentioned in-game. Go figure.). There's no real story involved, except that you're a mouse named Maxie who's visiting a hotel, which surprise, surprise, is full of mouse traps. Wow, would've never figured that out, huh? BTW, the

However, it has a fixed scrolling speed, so you'll eventually hit the left or rightmost side of the screen with the technically fastest way of movement (jumping). Here's a comparison encode of the first four stages to illustrate what I mean:

There are also weights hanging from the ceiling, which are instant-kill if one drops on Maxie. There's one mandatory waiting period involving a weight where a bug has to trigger the weight drop first before Maxie can proceed.

Also, there's nets and some weird drawing pin-looking things falling down from the ceiling. Don't ask me why, I have no clue.

The loooooooong legs also disappear, so I guess they just panicked or something, even though only their shoes and pants would get wet. Unless it's because somehow, an inaudible fire alarm went off, which would make sense. That's probably why the luggage is still all there, if I had to guess. Oh yeah, some weird robot maid things (hereby referred to as Robo-Daisies) make their first appearance there.

This is the only semi-autoscroller segment of the game, by the way. I say semi-autoscroller, because Maxie's in fact on a conveyor belt, and if he seeps a bit too far to the left, the scrolling stops. Anyway, this dishwasher is pretty darn gosh dangerous, what with dishes just

This floor has a lot more LAZOR VENTZ (5, in fact!) to go through as well as bomb cars, which are instant-kill if you jump on them, as they explode. Duh.

Fixed scrolling, well given how many obstacles are in the way, and given that the RTA record is 2 minutes slower, there's definitely possibility in the game for optimizing speed. Poor at scale? Yes.
