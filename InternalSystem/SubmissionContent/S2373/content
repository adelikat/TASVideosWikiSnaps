	"I started this improvement in March of 2007, shortly after finishing my 
	[a class=intlink href=/797M 
		"2-player
	]a
	" version of the game.  While doing the 2-player version I had found one extra place to do the "Jumping glitch" in area 3 (explained in Area by Area).  This would save 60 frames in the pacifist version.  I redid my published movie (starting from that spot in the movie) and got to the boss 62 frames faster.  However, I got an idea that might improve the movie further by trying to use the spread gun on the area 3 boss & area 4.  The idea was difficult to test and caused me to lose motivation and ultimately abandon the movie.  This summer I created my adelikat-TAS SVN.  In the process I began uploading all my old unfinished works.  This led me to tinkering with this movie again and regaining my motivation.

				"Cons: The real problem comes from not having an R upgrade (which causes bullets to be faster).  An R upgraded regular weapon is superior to a spread gun that is not R upgraded.  Therefore in this scenario, the 290 frames saved on the area 3 boss will be lost by the end of area 4.

	"I used the "jump glitch" one more time to save 60 frames.  I used the "anti-jump glich" twice to save 2 additional frames.  I fixed a logic flaw in the boss fight resulting in 29 more frames.  The error was jumping up and shooting the first 4 bullets at the peak of a jump.  The correct logic is to shoot them from the ground and then jump and shoot the 2nd "round" at the peak of a jump.  I nor anyone that watched the published movie ever noticed this error.

By moving left then right while jumping up, it is possible to jump a greater distance than usual, resulting in landing on platforms that would normally be impossible.  Each time this is done, it saves the time it takes to make 1 jump; which is 60 frames.
