	"The PC version of this game has substantially different physics from the other versions.  In particular, this version plays much faster.  I'm able to end input extremely early during wave 9 and allow the physics engine to do the rest of the work for me.  Note: The temporary encode I made is much longer than it needs to be due to walking away for a bit too long during the dumping process.

	"Since the game does increase in difficulty for later waves with more distractions from the pterodactyl, and spawning enemies which move considerably faster, I am deeming this run incomplete. Several more waves need to be played, and a later cycle must be reached. Rejecting.
