	"The game changes the set of minigames once every second. It's always the same set of minigames on the same seconds no matter what you do, which means there's 59 different sets of minigames to choose from. The set I choose features six of the eight most high scoring ones.

	"Barrel-roll Bridge Blast: There's an annoying glitch where if you shoot the barrels too quickly the game goes to an infinite black screen after the score has been calculated, so I had to add a 2-7 frame delay between each barrel. Score: 54680

	"Zero-gravity Target Practice: Some minigames has targets you don't have to shoot, like the guy. Shooting them always give you 10 points. So whenever there's nothing else to shoot those targets will be shot. Score: 34240

	"Can Collector: In the end I shoot cans that doesn't have enough time to make it into the tray. You get some points from shooting the can, but the majority comes from hitting the tray. Score: 49088

	"Bonus Stage: I waited 4 seconds before the minigame to change the chests so I could get a heart + points. There's a 13 second wait time after shooting the chest where you can still shoot. I tried to make a melody but failed horrible. So since it seems to be a theme for this game, I instead went with annoying repeating sounds.
