	"The gameplay is very similar to 
	[a class=intlink href=/3232M 
		"The Legend of Zelda
	]a
	", but slower and simpler. You start with a sword, an attack power of 1 and 4 HP (2 hearts). Attack power and HP can be increased temporary or permanently by different items; temporary increments will disappear after you kill a boss and proceed to the next chapter (there are 4 in total) and permanent increments will stay for the entire play. You can move in the four cardinal directions for steps of 8 pixels (half map tile) and attack enemies by using an equipped weapon. Killed enemies may drop a potion or an armor; in rare cases other items. Here is the list:
	$LF

				" "Sword": Can attack only withlin 8 pixel in the direction the hero is facing.

		" "Special Items": Various items set to be used by pressing A button. Then you pick one, it will replace the one you already have, if any.
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" "Potion of Life": Looks like a jug. When used, refills HP completely and disappears.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				" "Shield of Valor": A shield with a cross on it. When you hold A button, it will protect frontally from ranged attack, but not contact. If you use the D-pad while you still hold A button, the hero will turn but not walk.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				" "Magic Axe": Looks like a pickaxe. Can used to remove some obstables.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				" "Chameleon's Ring": A ring with a jewel. When you press A, you the hero will turn into a background object and become immute to enemy contact until you press A again to come back normal. This doest not protect from ranged attacks and you can't attack while transformed.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				" "Power Crystal": Looks like an orb. To use it, you need to keep A until charged, then release. Does more damages than other weapons, but seems useless due to being slow.
				$LF
			]li
		]ul
		" "Other Articles": These items take effect in the moment you pick them up.

				" "Chain Mail": It is supposed to be an armor, but looks like a mushroom to me. When picked up, it increases your HP temporary by 1 (half hearth).

			[li 
				" "Merlin's Cloak": It is supposed to be a cape, but looks like a slice of watermelon. When picked up, gives temporary invulnerability to any attack.

				" "Elvenade": Looks like a vial. When picked up, restores 4 HP (2 hearts).

This value changes every non-lag frame and it is not affected by any action; however if some unknown requirements aren't met, the drop won't occur.

Here is a run recored with VBA-rr in which I managed to save even more frames, until I got forced to lose them all for the last potion drop: http://dehacked.2y.net/microstorage.php/info/145168094/thunderaxe31-rolanscurse-argh.vbm

		"). mmbossman (author of 
		[a class=intlink href=/1461M
