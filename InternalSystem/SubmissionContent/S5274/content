	"The gameplay is very similar to 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=The Legend of Zelda|href=/3232M)
	", but slower and simpler. You start with a sword, an attack power of 1 and 4 HP (2 hearts). Attack power and HP can be increased temporary or permanently by different items; temporary increments will disappear after you kill a boss and proceed to the next chapter (there are 4 in total) and permanent increments will stay for the entire play. You can move in the four cardinal directions for steps of 8 pixels (half map tile) and attack enemies by using an equipped weapon. Killed enemies may drop a potion or an armor; in rare cases other items. Here is the list:

			[li 
				" "Potion of Life": Looks like a jug. When used, refills HP completely and disappears.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				" "Shield of Valor": A shield with a cross on it. When you hold A button, it will protect frontally from ranged attack, but not contact. If you use the D-pad while you still hold A button, the hero will turn but not walk.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				" "Magic Axe": Looks like a pickaxe. Can used to remove some obstables.
				$LF

			[li 
				" "Chameleon's Ring": A ring with a jewel. When you press A, you the hero will turn into a background object and become immute to enemy contact until you press A again to come back normal. This doest not protect from ranged attacks and you can't attack while transformed.
				$LF
			]li

				" "Power Crystal": Looks like an orb. To use it, you need to keep A until charged, then release. Does more damages than other weapons, but seems useless due to being slow.

		"). mmbossman (author of 
		(__wikiLink|displaytext=the current run|href=/1461M)
		") also noticed this, but was unable to solve the problem. Optimizing this exploit may save frames for any situation in which it is needed to hit an enemy multiple time, like for that wolf and the boss. It may even allow to kill the lizardman at 12718, which would result in not needing a potion.
