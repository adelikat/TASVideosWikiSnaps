	"Doc Louis's Punch-Out!! is an exclusive game that was released only to Club Nintendo Platinum members, and only in North America. It is by far the shortest Punch-Out game, and is really more like a demo for Punch-Out Wii. The game consists of only three different fights (all against the same opponent, Little Mac's trainer Doc Louis), fewer than even the arcade games, and the total in-game time is faster than SNES Super Punch-Out!! despite the ingame clock running faster.

	"-Starting here intentionally blocked punches are used to start the timer for the next attack sooner. This doesn't help for short delays, such as the one between the first two attacks. A two-star punch will slow the clock down for longer after it lands than a one-star punch, and three-stars are even better. However, Doc will regenerate all his health if his health gets too low, so a three-star punch can't be used in this fight.

	"-A little trick is added onto this fight, that was developed by zallard1. after the RJ countering his "Duck this one!" attack, I opt to throw a right hook first instead of a left hook. Starting a buffer with the same side punch wastes 3 frames over an alternate side one, and it turns out if we were to start with an alternate side one, we would have to delay the last hook in the buffer sequence by 3 frames, so this gets rid of that, meaning I can buffer all 4!

	": This submission seems to be in a tough place here. The movie has a few technical issues which prevent it from being accepted. The main issue is the author mistakenly started the movie from a savesate. This is not acceptable, nor easily fixable. There is another issue that this TAS had Dual Core enabled. If the savestate wasn't an issue, this would undoubtedly cause a desync and prevent playback of the movie, rendering it unacceptable.

	"Awosomeandy, I apologize the movie has ended up here. I encourage you to remake the movie, making sure to not start from a savestate (make sure to not have the game open when starting the movie) and to disable dual core (Config > General > Untick Dual Core).
