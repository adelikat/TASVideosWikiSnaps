	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The game was developed by Layup Co., Ltd and published by Bandai, instead of by Capcom itself. Because of this, the game has several oddball quirks - the set of Robot Masters is more obscure than ever ("What's a Komuso?"), Dr. Wily plays no in-game role at all, the stage enemies more closely resemble Mechaniloids from the X series, shots can pass through screen transitions, weapons do not get refilled between stages at all, bosses have differing amounts of hit points, there are no boss refights, boss patterns are almost all completely fixed and they tend to get temporarily invincible a lot, boss weaknesses are not a thing as each weapon does set damage, there are only six or seven Robot Masters (depending on how you count the Clock Men), only four of which can be fought in a varying order, and Compas Man does not give any weapon at all.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Like the last time Capcom outsourced development for a handheld Mega Man game, the game involves time travel and one of the chief villains is a version of Mega Man from the future (called Rockman Shadow, or R-Shadow in short, this time around). This time around, R-Shadow and his band of misfit robots (calling themselves the "Dimensions") come from the future to ransack a city until Mega Man or Bass kill the lot. (No really, that's literally why R-Shadow went back in time according to the plot).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Before Mega Man or Bass go after R-Shadow, they need to face off against his six-and-a-half Dimensions first. Their names are Aircon Man, Konro Man, Dangan Man, Komuso Man, Clock Men (sic) and Compas Man (sic). After an intro stage, featuring the Grey Devil (which is just the Green Devil from Mega Man & Bass, but now in a greyscale handheld system), the first four of these bosses can be fought in any order. Following them, the Clock Men await, then Compas Man after that, then R-Shadow himself after that. That is just eight stages in total, fairly short for a Mega Man game.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"As with Mega Man & Bass, the player can pick between Mega Man or Bass at the start of the game. And as with that game, Mega Man's advantages include having a slide to reach low areas and a charged shot to defeat tough enemies better, while Bass has a dash, a double jump to reach high areas and a weaker multi-directional shot to defeat annoyingly placed enemies better. The weapons that they get from defeating bosses are also different, but only half the time.

	"This run originally started in the middle of 
	[a class=intlink href=/3199M 
		"the Rockman run
	]a
	"'s production, aiming to see what kinds of interesting differences there would be in the runs between Mega Man and Bass. However, its progress got cancelled relatively early on because it turned out the first boss battle would be 40 
	[em 
		"seconds
	]em
	" slower as Bass, already eliminating any hopes of Bass being the faster character of the run. His half-damage Forte Buster would also cause further slowdowns in the next few (mini-)bossfights as well, further cementing his relative slowness. However, this latter bit could be mitigated for the most part thanks to an item shop part that doubles Bass's buster damage, bringing it on par with Mega Man's buster (but without the charge). All that's needed is to get 300 bolts...or in other words, 30 large bolt drops...before the first Robot Master stage. It was not 
	[em 
		"impossible
	]em
	", but even after figuring out the RNG's workings (more on that later), it was just not interesting to do, so the project was sidelined with about half of the intro stage done in the end.

[p 
	"Fast forward a few years, I decided to come back to this project to see what I could make of it anyway. Earlier this year I finished the intro stage, getting past that horrible 40 second loss and large bolt manipulation.

The intro stage is first of course, where Bass has to collect his 300 bolts in order to not lose massive time on the miniboss and boss of whatever the next stage is. Then, after the intro stage, the Super Buster part is bought in the shop. The first boss of choice is Aircon Man, for the same reason as Mega Man: his weapon (Forte Cyclone for Bass, which is identical to Mega Man's Barrier Wind) is enormously powerful and useful against other bosses. Komuso Man is next for Bass, as his Doppler Attack is highly useful in all stages from them on. Then both Konro Man and Dangan Man can be done in either order; neither stage has use for the other's weapon. Then the rest of the order is fixed with Clock Men, Compas Man and R-Shadow.

]h4
[p 
	"The RNG was already touched upon for the Rockman run, but it bears a special notice here. The RNG still functions the same, but for Bass it is far more important all throughout the run. This is both because he requires bolt drops to buy parts early on, and because he needs large weapon refills all over the place to keep his constant use of special weapons ongoing throughout the stages (weapons do not refill at all between any of the stages).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The RNG in this game runs once per frame. Other than that, it is 
	[em 
		"completely
	]em
	" unmanipulatable. This means that whenever a particular type of drop is needed, it just means having to kill an enemy on a particular frame. Due to random entropy, this means that getting a certain drop from a particular enemy could mean a delay of 0 frames, or a few frames, or in the worst cases, up to several dozen frames. Fortunately, it never actually comes down to giving up multiple dozen frames, as by that point it's better to find drop opportunities elsewhere instead, but still, there are plenty of cases where there is visible slowdown because it is just necessary to give up the frames for a required drop.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There is relatively little randomness in this game. The RNG only comes into play for item drops, and for a small few boss actions (for example, the spread of the bones of the R-Shadow miniboss). Almost all bosses have completely fixed patterns otherwise. R-Shadow has a varying pattern, but it depends on his hit points and on Bass's position, not on RNG.

[p 
	"There is an odd trick involving climbing ladders, where if Bass stays at the top of a ladder (as high as possible without going up it) and waits for a certain amount of frames, pressing up will lift Bass up immediately, skipping the usual ladder-climb animation. This saves 5-10 frames on each ladder, depending on the delay required. The delay can be between 1 and 8 frames, depending on how many frames Bass has climbed the ladder for. For many ladders it was an interesting challenge to find the right number of frames to spend on the ladder, so that I could go up the ladder with only 1 frame of delay, or otherwise get up the ladder as soon as possible overall.

[p 
	"Entering a ladder from the top from a certain state at the right positioning will cause Bass to immediately drop downwards by ~32 pixels. This can be done either by ending a slide or dash on top of the ladder (which requires very convenient timing), or more commonly by jumping on top of the ladder. This is used anywhere Bass needs to drop down a ladder.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Unlike practically every other Mega Man game, enemies and projectiles are persistent and keep on moving whenever Bass goes through a screen transition. This means it is sometimes possible to kill enemies before Bass is even in the room yet, and it allows Bass to fire a few opening shots at a boss or mini-boss before the battle actually starts.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Note that when a boss is hit before his life bar is initialized, its hit points are already set, so it's not possible to quick-kill a boss like Mega Man 7. However, it will decrease the boss' hit points. If more than 8 points of damage are dealt, it will in fact reduce the maximum length of the lifebar when it is generated (and does so for every 8 points of damage). This gives the illusion that a charged shot does no damage, but it actually still does.

[p 
	"It should be noted that this does not work for every boss, as some bosses such as Grey Devil, Konro Man or Komuso Man, start out invincible during the boss introduction.

	$LF
]p
[p

This is used extensively in RTAs of this game, but in a TAS setting, it is usually slower than just letting the projectile dissipate as soon as possible normally.

[p 
	"The fact that Bass can use this weapon to go through walls/floors/ceilings means it can be used to render passing any sort of stage geometry trivial. If the level design forces Mega Man to go back and forth through corridors to progress, then Bass can just use Doppler Attack to go through the walls and just proceed in whatever the intended direction is, often saving quite a few seconds along the way.

		" Thirdly, Doppler Attack's movement is limited to walking speed, slower than dashing, jumping or falling.

		$LF

		" There would be an opportunity to use Doppler Attack to clip through the floor before the mini-boss, but since the mini-boss requires the buster anyway, it is not worth switching back and forth. Later on in the stage there are more opportunities to use Doppler Attack for clipping, so it gets used there instead.

		" Dangan Man has 80 hit points. Mega Man can take 10 points off by pre-hitting, but Bass can't, so he can't save a hit for Forte Cyclone. This means one more Forte Cyclone is used for this battle. Besides that, the same strategy is used as with Mega Man.

		" Forte Vulcan is used against the mini-boss because it's faster to get shots in with than Forte Cyclone. The mini-boss has 96 hit points. One Forte Vulcan pre-shot is done before the start of the fight, and another 11 shots in the fight proper. Note how this already takes out three-fourths of Forte Vulcan ammo.

		" The gravity-reversing section was one of the most complicated to route, as especially Bass has a lot of leeway with whether or not to touch a gravity switcher, and both the floor and ceiling have their benefits in various areas - and this was on top of deciding where to luck-manipulate for weapon drops.

		" The Clock Men have 112 health, and share a lifebar although both count invincibility individually. Forte Cyclone is used, and mostly the same strategy as Mega Man, although Forte has the advantage of double jumping for easier reach. This makes his fight slightly faster than Mega Man's.

		" The mini-boss has 80 hit points. Mega Man used the buster for most of this fight, but Bass doesn't have charged shots, so Barrier Wind is used instead. Forte Vulcan would have been a slightly faster option, but it would be impossible to get enough weapon ammo for the Compas Man fight then.

		" Compas Man has 96 hit points. Using Barrier Wind didn't work for Mega Man, so he had to work with Doppel Crash instead. Bass doesn't have Doppel Crash, and Doppler Attack isn't nearly as useful here, but fortunately he has something even better: a nearly full stack of Forte Vulcans. Compas Man is quickly shot to pieces. Annoyingly, Forte Vulcan's homing capability actually works against Bass here, as it would usually swerve away from the weak point (often towards the invincible top half), so some careful positioning was needed.

		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" This was one of the hardest stages with regard of ammo planning with Doppler Attack. Many times, the RNG was just in a bad position when drops were most needed, so there are some delays here and there.

		" This mini-boss has 80 health. This is another instance where Mega Man had to faff around with precise yet not fully practical Barrier Wind shots, but Bass can just unload Forte Vulcan into it. Slight luck manipulation was required that the random bones wouldn't get in the way, but this only cost a single frame.

		" Doppler Attack is again used for the last few rooms of the stage. Again, ammo drop manipulation was tight. Ideally one or two more drops could've saved a handful of frames near the end, but manipulating for it would have taken more time than just progressing this way. The last few enemies in the final room are done with Forte Cyclone instead.
