	"Hello, today I am submitting the greatest movie to ever grace this god-forsaken website. In this tool-assisted speedrun of Ocarina of Time, I complete it as fast as possible without using any doors; that is to say, I never press 'A' to open any sort of door anywhere in the run.

In this submission, I use the wrong warp commonly known as 'ganondoor' to warp straight to the tower collapse as used in any%, but not before gathering a few things to make that possible without using any doors.

	"After gathering enough rupees for 2 Deku Sticks and 1 set of Deku Nuts, I escape the forest using a common clip into the Zora River exit. After making my way to Kekariko and collecting the bottle, I navi dive into the Bottom of the Well and use a special glitch exclusive to the 1.0 version of the game to alter Link's collision and make my way to the bombchus, after which I use one of aformentioned chus to vine clip and swim out of bounds to collect the Master Shield, which I will need later in the run as adult Link. From here, it is a simple matter of making my way to the Taylor 'Temple of Time' For The Win and skipping the Door of Time with a nicely angled twisty sidehop to go adult.

	"Once I am fully grown, I go back to Kakariko and grab the hookshot from the Dampe race. This will be needed for a glitch later on in the run. After exiting Kakariko, I kill and then bottle a poe, then use quick-draw duplication to get a bottle on my B button and RBA the poe. This gives me 29 chus, which means I am now well equipped to start my last leg of the journey to performing ganondoor-less.

	"In Kokiri Forest, I hover on top of the trees to the unloaded Deku Tree area which allows me to enter the loading zone of the Deku Tree uninhibited. From here, I climb the spiral and perform a 'ground clip' to fall into out of bounds basement, where I jumpslash off an unloaded torch to get to the boss room loading zone. After killing Gohma, I use Ocarina Items on the edge of the warp to be able to move around very shortly after the initial warp cutscene.

	"This is the most critical part of the run. At this point, the most important thing is that I have the camera positioned in such a way that I am not looking too close to the warp or too far away from it, but at an angle which 'freezes' the timer that tells the game when to actually send you to the Deku tree cutscene. With the camera like this, I get ISG off of the closest thing I can (a bush- I have no bombs, damage ISG would be too slow, and getting ISG at all before Gohma dies doesn't matter because the death cutscene cancels it) and begin my hover by the door. It was recently discovered that using the 'quick-draw from explosive limit glitch' (seen here

	" it is possible to store and ground jump anywhere, only using chus. I use this to my advantage here as I store the ground jump and use it to climb out of bounds on top of the stone slab that is blocking your exit towards the door I didn't come in through. Once I am on top of this stone slab, I let my camera look at the warp for a second or two to advance the warp timer to a certain value, then hover to the loading zone and again abuse the camera such that it begins taking me to the deku cutscene while it is also taking me to the previous room via loading zone.
