	"When a character is on-air, not moving upwards (i.e., vertical speed is zero or it is downwards), and his vertical speed speed is at least equal to his horizontal speed (in magnitude), he may fall through otherwise-solid ground. If the pixel portion of the vertical velocity plus 8 is greater than the distance both of the character's bottom collision anchors are inside the floor, then no collision with the floor is registered and the character can fall through. This is explicitly used in HCZ1 to enter the wall, and at LZR (both acts) to clip through the stairs. It is implicitly used to speed up entering the ground in LBZ1 and in MHZ1.

The problem is that going over the top of the screen when far enough to the right will trigger this. The main issue is that this creates a lot of terrain that make it impossible to break through the roof of the boss' arena. For this reason, the glitch is triggered early, so that this additional terrain has moved up enough to let Tails go in. There is a bonus to this glitch: while on air, Tails is dragged up by 3 pixels every 8 frames, meaning he can deliver 7 hits while above the screen.
