	"Originally, this was going to be a "Tails" run that doesn't use nor abuse the Ultra dash glitch, but then a new idea was suggested to me and here is the result. While it doesn't make use of the Ultra Dash, it also uses its fair share of glitches that gives Knuckles a pretty good chance at beating the game in record time.
