	"Originally, this was going to be a "Tails" run that doesn't use nor abuse the Ultra dash glitch, but then a new idea was suggested to me and here is the result. While it doesn't make use of the Ultra Dash, it also uses its fair share of glitches that gives Knuckles a pretty good chance at beating the game in record time.

[h4 
	" Ice Mountain 2 - 0:59:85
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Mostly route optimization. To explain why I chose to slide instead of jumping into the water, it was so Knuckles can stay afloat for when the boss fight begins. Also manage to cause Knuckles to move in forward as the boss first appears.

	" Angel Island 1 - 0:29:32
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Angel Island 1 is one of two levels where a glitch had to be exploited for a faster time. It also the only death in the run.

	$LF

[p 
	"Not much special here aside from picking up an Invincibility midway. Mecha Knuckles fight was rather silly.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Ohh Egg Rocket, how I hate you so! This run made use of a glitch that pushes Knuckles through the floor and causes the level to lose solidarity. Thus making it possible to complete it in one go.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Eggman 1 and Eggman 2 were no problem, but the final boss was a pain due to trying for manipulating which weapon he attacks with! I had to end the movie a little later due to Knuckles' positioning after bouncing off of Eggman.

	"Major Thanks to Zeupar for suggesting the run idea and giving a bit of support.

	"Also thanks to VanillaCoke for being my potential rival as well as being around when I needed an extra ear :3

	"Once again, Toothache, you're a wonderful motivator! I also need to really thank Mukki for without his help and his script, I would not have gotten very far. :)

	"Thank you also to footbigmike for his strat for Egg Rocket 1~
