	"There are two characters in this game, a fast moose who is used most of the time and squirrel who can fly and reach platforms the moose can't reach.

[p 
	"Holding down Select kinda freezes the condition of the character, which means it doesn't cost energy while going fast. MESHUGGAH did this in his first level WIP.

[p 
	"To effieciently jump over enemies which can't be bypassed without getting hit, it's needed to reduce speed before getting hit.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"It's needed to stand still to change characters. Also for character change while screen transition the character needs to stop moving before being able to change. This only works when jumping up stairs with the squirrel.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The moose has only one possible jump height, so speed needs to be adjusted when jumping over the stones in water.
	$LF

[p 
	"The "Goof" things reverse left and right, it has no effect when doing the Select trick though.
