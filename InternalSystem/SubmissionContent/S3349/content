	"The way sfa3 juggle combos work is, as soon as you enter a neutral state the opponent can air recover. For dramatic battle this counts both characters, so a dragon punch can become unsafe on hit if your partner is grounded, beacuse the opponent can recover immediately. A common technique for extending juggles is to crouch when landing and then immediately rejumping. This prevents you from going in to a neutral state. This isn't used much in the run, beacuse they get old really quick, and Rose and Dhalsim are not well built for them.

	"Despite fighting multiple opponents the AI can only focus on one opponent at a time. It faces and will only react to and attack the the character it is focused on. This is why Dictator whiffs a throw in front of Dhalsim in the last round, he is focused on Rose and can't throw sim.

]h4
[p 
	"In the corner instead of pushing the opponent back, the game pushes the attacker back. In sfa3 dramatic battle it will only push one character back at a time and it's not related to who is attacking. 
	$LF
	"It is possible to negate pushback by causing the opponent to enter hitstop. So a rapid sequence of attacks cause less pushback then the same attacks linked slower. Some characters can chain light attacks so fast they can completely negate hitstop.
	$LF
	"If you put one of your characters between you and the corner, then there will not be any push back for the character not in the corner.
