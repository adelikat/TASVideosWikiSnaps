		"The Second Reality Project Reloaded
	]em
	" is one of the most well-known Super Mario World hacks in existence today. It is known for its intuitive and unique level design, as well as its lush visual appeal. This hack is a remake of the 2002 hack 
	[em 
		"The Second Reality Project
	]em
	", which was created almost exclusively with vanilla resources. This new incarnation did not change much in terms of level design from the original game--
	[em 
		"The Second Reality Project
	]em
	" was created before the days of custom music, sprites, and fancy ASM-hacks, so they were, for the most part, excluded in this remake.

	": First off, the hack. This hack for the most part seems to be a well made hack. There's plenty of nicely made levels, which are cohesive, and take advantage of what the SMW engine has to offer, and then some. This hack also goes a bit beyond raw level changes, there's new enemies, components of levels that are new or act differently, and so on. It's also refreshing to have a final fight which is something other than Bowser flying around in his piranha copter, even if it is copied out of a different Mario game. The hack isn't perfect though. A few of the new music tracks are quite enjoyable, although most of them are bland, and some of the graphical changes are a bit questionable.

	"Overall, I find that the game deserves a TAS which shows it off nicely. However, this may not be it, as most of the game was skipped.

[p 
	"The run itself was well played. While admittedly some of it could be optimized a bit more, it's pretty well optimized as is, and takes advantage of some techniques that are relatively recent discoveries in terms of all the years SMW has been TAS'd for. I did not find the run penalizable in this regard, as none of the issues are overly noticeable.
	$LF

[p 
	"On the other hand, much of the run was repetitive, and flying over or under many levels made this run's entertainment a bit lower than our existing Super Mario World or Super Demo World runs. However, after careful consideration of everyone's comments, it seems that most people don't mind, and really like what the rest of the run has to offer.
	$LF

[p 
	"Overall, it seems to me that this game would be better served by a 100% run, which is less repetitive and really shows off how varied this game can be. In the mean time though, I find that this run deserves to be published alongside our other SMW runs, and am accepting this hack. We'll debate if this run should be obsoleted by the 100% run when the time comes.
