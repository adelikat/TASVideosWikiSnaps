	"The goal is also strange. Tetris is a game that will show you an ending after you die, and this movie does get an ending after reaching the kill screen at the end, where the game pauses for a moment and then pieces start falling again and you can't do anything. But this movie uses a patch that does some tweaks to the score counter, and that decision is questionable.

	" which goal could be more suitable for this game, but it's hard to discuss the potential if the original game has to be hacked to continue working after a certain point. And if we don't patch it, the only goal I can see as technically interesting is playing until the difficulty resets. But that would still not be Moons content, and if we're limited with Playground, we can have quite some variety of arbitrary goals, as long as they are worthwhile in their nature and as long as they are actually met.
