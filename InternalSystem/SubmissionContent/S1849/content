	"This run beats the current run by Nitsuja by 1799 frames.  Lots of memory watching and lots of optimization.  A few route changes now and then for some more significant gains.  Most of the gain was in the last level.  I used Sami's run for most of my comparisons since his run was faster in most areas.  I was able to improve on all of his times as well as Nitsuja's times.  A big part of the improvement came from finding out that jumping results in faster speed than walking due to oscillating speed value on the ground and static speed in the air.  Not to mention that you gain get a higher speed in the air and gain 1-2 subpixels per frame in the air.  I have to apologize for the ugly manipulation just before the first boss in level 6, but I couldn't figure out a faster way to get him to move in the way i needed of him.
