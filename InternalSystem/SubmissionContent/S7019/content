	"So how do we get the AI to take the shortest turns? Give it nowhere to move. Therefore, we should aim to hit one of the AI's checkers early to make it easily accessible to future hits in our home board, and immediately start closing our home points. The more home points we close, the higher the likelihood the AI will be unable to move and we save lots of time!

	"More insignificantly, some attention was paid to the time it takes checkers to move from one point to another. Checker speed is constant so we can just use distance travelled as a time reference. Take moves 4 and 6 for instance where a total of seven checkers are moved from the 14/13-point to the 8/7-point... in other words, they were all moved there via a 6 roll which takes the most diagonal path between these points, saving time.

	"Q: Why did you not roll doubles on turns 1-3? A1: The game simply doesn't appear to allow doubles to be rolled on the first turn. A2: Only if black rolls 2,1 5,1 6,2 6,3 or 6,5 will they be in a position to be hit, and White must also get a roll which actually hits blacks checker, meaning if we want doubles they must be either 4 or 6. Since White's roll is tied to Black's roll, this is really difficult to all line up and so it's faster to just take the 4,6 route. A3: Double 4's or 6's didn't come fast enough.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Q: Why get double 3's and 4's on moves 5 and 7? A: This is simply to close up all points possible so that Black has a higher potential of losing turns.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Q: Why did you let black enter on turns 2, 4, and 10? A: On turns 2 and 10, only one point was closed, meanining it would be a 1/36 chance for Black to be blocked which must be followed up by a decent roll for White which did not happen in a timely manner. On move 4, it was the only way the game would give me double 3's which had to be rolled that turn to close off the 5&4 points.

[div class=p 
	"Q: On move 3, why did you move the checker from the 6 point before the one on the 8 point when if you did it the opposite way you would've saved a small bit of travel distance? A: I would've rolled double 6's at the same time for the subsequent turn regardless. I actually chose to move the checkers in the order I did because that saved 1 lag frame for whatever reason.

In the end, the feedback is mixed: from strong "No"s to "boring games are entertaining". Poll votes show 43% (6/2/8) support. We can't accept such a movie to Moons either, even though I really tried to give it a chance to not get rejected. Unfortunately, board game TASes are very rarely entertaining. Rejecting.
