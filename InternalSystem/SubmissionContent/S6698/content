There appears to be no limit as to how long I can make my name which means I can keep making my own name more and more awesome. I could probably tell a story here if I really wanted to. You know what I will. Just kidding. At least for now. Maybe next time. For now I will leave you with this run.

	"Okay before I get into the meme part of this text I felt I should write this semi-serious part of the text so that there's at least some context to this run. So this run uses 2 game genie codes, one that makes it so Sonic always has 50 rings (FFFE20:0032), and one that removes the speed cap (FFF760:7EEE). Also for some reason I decided to use the sound test codes instead of a 3rd game genie code to get all emeralds. Everything else is unchanged. Oh and speed is a goal this time along with banning level wraps. Alright that's enough serious talk. Now for me to shove my keyboard into my mouth in an attempt to write the level comments.
