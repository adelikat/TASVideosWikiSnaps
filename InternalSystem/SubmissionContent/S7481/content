This is because of a few intro movies at the very start of the movie; pre-rendered cutscenes throw off the audio for some reason. Just cut off the first 5 seconds or so from the audio and then line it up. The dtkdump (music) should be fine, but about 12db too loud, so that needs to be decreased unless you want to blow out the viewer's eardrums with the title screen music (and the rest of the music in the game).

So apparently this guy named Faze found out that by having your glider parallel to a corner, and descending, will allow you to go through it. It's useless most of the time, but this time, you can use it to go through the floor and fly out of bounds. This game has an extremely strict "position verification system" as I like to call it, which prevents almost all instances of out-of-bounds. Even moving out of bounds with this trick is extremely difficult and only works because goblin can just generate speed out of nothing.
