	"In general, the levels aim to be as entertaining as possible at the cost of speed. There are a few exceptions where we decided that a level or part of a level was not entertaining enough on its own, so we opted to just get through as quickly as possible. These are explained below in the individual level comments.

	"The TAS completes only the 10 main worlds (the puzzle worlds) of Super Scribblenauts. In particular, this TAS does not complete the two bonus worlds. They were skipped for a number of reasons, but primarily because they are more platforming-oriented (similar to the first game’s Action levels) and were felt to have less potential for entertainment compared to the rest of the run. Since the credits are automatically shown upon completion of 10-5, we considered this a reasonable end to the TAS.

	"The Scribblenauts item dictionary contains over 20000 words - this is its main selling point as a creativity-based game. However, the actual number of unique objects in the game is far smaller. This is because many words will ultimately map to the same object. As an example, the following words all summon the same thing in-game: “Auto”, “Automobile”, “Bait car”, “Car”, “Motor car”, “Muscle car”, “Sedan”, “Unmarked car”, “Vehicle”.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Interestingly, when the game checks if the summoned object will solve the puzzle, it does so by checking what type of object was summoned, not the phrase that was used to summon it. We exploit this fact constantly throughout the run to summon objects using their funniest or most-interesting name in the game. Using the above example, if a level solution involved a car, we might summon it using “Bait car” to increase the entertainment value.

	"While plenty of “Scribblenauts word lists” exist out there on the internet, to our knowledge there aren’t any lists that show which words all summon the same object.

With the right manipulation, the object can also be ejected into other rooms entirely.

	"The emphasis on entertainment means that the TAS contains lots of comedic-effect pauses, carefully-chosen camera views, and general tomfoolery to produce an interesting result. We also deliberately leave the level messages open for a short time so that viewers can understand the level objectives more clearly. (In many cases the messages are particularly funny in-context, so it makes sense to show them anyway). We opted to leave every message open for exactly one second (60 frames); this is enough to catch the gist of the level (or pause the movie if you want to read it in detail) without being especially interruptive to the flow of gameplay. Finally, the level intros are skipped most of the time, but are sometimes allowed to play through to give further context to a level.
