	"Superfast Mario Bros. 2 is a ROM hack for SMB 2 created by Acmlm. The speed of most objects, as well as players, increases to ridiculous levels, with notable changes including:
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		" All characters have a maximum horizontal speed of 127 for right and 128 for left. In the original, each character has their own unique abilities: Mario has averages stats, Luigi can jump high but his vertical and horizontal speed is a bit slower than the others, Toad has the fastest speed but is weak at jumping, and Princess has the weakest speed and power but can stay airborne longer than the others while pressing the A. In this hack, however, the x speed is the same for all characters, so these differences are irrelevant. Also, the vertical speed has only been changed for Mario, and the rest of the characters are the same as the original.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Due to Mario's strangely changed y speed, his certain jumping pattern can ignore a few floors. So, if he has to fall from a high place for quite a while, it's faster for him to land once on the ground as high as possible and then jump and fall to the floor below.
		$LF

[ul 
	[li 
		" Climbing a ladder with U+D input is slower than climbing it normally with U input.
		$LF

[ul 
	[li 
		" You can enter a door (except for the Mask Gate) while holding an object, as well as a keys. This helps by allowing you to fight bosses faster with enemies or vegetables instead of the eggs that Birdos shoot.
		$LF

		" Instead of Birdos' eggs, if you hit them with an enemy or vegetable, it only takes one hit to kill.

		" If you enter a door at maximum speed in the opposite direction from where you were going, you can do a wrong warp on the next screen.

	"Note that, to my knowledge, the 5-3 boss cannot be defeated by any method, so warpless run would be impossible. Clawglip throws rocks to the player and you have to catch them to fight the boss, but in this ROM hack, he's become a fool and doesn't do anything but move from side to side. Although you can think of other ways to fight the boss, but you can't go through the Mask Gate while holding something, and the Power Star doesn't last long enough to get you to the final room. Here's a demo movie of me playing rough up to 5-3. You can check it out for yourself:
