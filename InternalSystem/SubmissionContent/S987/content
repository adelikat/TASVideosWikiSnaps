]h3
[p 
	"I never thought I would have the patience or ability to run this game, but I always wanted to.  In fact, before even signing up on the forums, I tried to do a run of this game - it was 1-player and didn't use turbo mode (imagine how not fun THAT was to watch...), not to mention it suffered from a lot of desyncing.  Now, almost a year later, the run I wished to see someday has finally come together.  I just happened to be the one to do it.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I always wondered how others did their 2-player runs, so I'll include how I did mine here.  I used a Playstation 2 DualShock controller (the one with 2 analog joysticks) connected to my computer through a PlayStation2->USB converter.  My controller setup was as follows:

	[li 
		" Right analog joystick - Player 2's shooting
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"Since the players can only shoot once every 6 frames, my right hand was much more free than my left, which was convenient for hitting frame advance, which I had set to backslash.  Usually, my left thumb was controlling Player 2's movement while my left index finger was trying to hold the digital pad for Player 1's movement.  At first this was a huge pain, but luckily I got used to it rather quickly.  Shooting was the same story for the other hand, and my right pinky was available for frame advance (which is how I usually frame advance anyway).

	"This game is unlike almost any game I've played.  The simple concept of independently controlling your walking and shooting directions brings a new element of strategy to gaming of this type.  The game puts you into closed-off arenas where you single-handedly (or two-player-handedly) fight off wave after wave of enemies who aren't very smart individually, but will swarm you in numbers.  Special weapons appear at random, as do fabulous prizes that can add to your score.  There are three levels, each with several paths of rooms that can be chosen.  Each room requires you to dispatch all enemies waiting to attack, and every room completed moves you closer to the big bad boss of that level.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"As you fight through the rooms, cash and fabulous prizes will appear at random for players to try and collect while attempting survival.  Special weapons also appear periodically with limited ammunition, each type having their own strengths and weaknesses.

		" Shotgun: It looks more like a grenade thrower, but my favorite name for it is "Useless".  The range on this gun is short, the trajectory is random, and the ammunition runs out quickly because it wastes its ammo so fast.

	" Some interesting mechanics of the game
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"First of all, each room has a predefined number of enemies of different types.  Rooms can have only one type of enemy, or multiple types.  Each type of enemy has a time to wait after the room starts before they start attacking (this time can be zero if the enemy type attacks immediately).  Each type of enemy also has a minimum number that can be on screen before more enemies of that same type will enter.  Once that number is hit, a random number (between 1 and 12 or so) of that type of enemy will enter the room through one of the doors.  This process repeats until that type of enemy has completely exhausted its amount for that room.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Enemy types can have a waiting time before beginning their attack.  This is noticeable in the run when waiting occurs in some of the rooms.  Some enemy types will NOT attack if the room is completed before their time is called - the room will open its exits.  You can test this in the very first room by playing it without completing it very fast.  Given enough time, a tank will appear in the arena.  If this room is completed fast enough, the tank will never have the opportunity to enter the room.  On the other hand, some enemy types will attack regardless if there are other enemies remaining before them or not - in this case, the room will not unlock its exits, and you simply have to wait for that time to pass.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The way enemies enter the room has a random effect on the actual enemy count you fight.  For example: say you are in a room with 15 soldiers remaining, 8 of which are on the screen currently, with a minimum number onscreen of 7.  You shoot one of the soldiers, so the game brings in some reinforcements (since there are now the minimum number left).  The game chooses a number between 1 and 12, in this case it chooses 9.  Even though there are only supposed to be (15 - 8 = ) 7 soldiers left in reserves, the game does not check this until the end of the room.  It's sometimes possible to manipulate this into fighting a few less enemies at the end of a room.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"It's also important to note that enemies can only enter the room at a set speed, no matter how fast they are killed.  So, even if enemies aren't always killed on the first frame they are visible, they can still be killed frequently enough to keep the new enemies entering the room as fast as the game allows.

	"Scarface's first form cannot be destroyed until all but one of his outer plates are completely destroyed (and the last one needs to have some damage as well), in addition to about five rounds of mortars to his face.  His second form cannot be destroyed until all seven outer sections of his skull are cracked, and a couple more rounds of mortars to his face are delivered.  Note that occasionally, mortars were used on Scarface's outer shielding when it was out of reach to a normal gun (in a corner, for example).

[p 
	"The Twin Cobras are really just one boss with one shared life meter, so it doesn't matter which one I'm shooting at, as long as the shots connect with one of them.  The "Useless" gun also ends up coming in handy here, who would have thought?
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Getting all five ?s is how you normally access turbo mode - the higher difficulty I accessed by entering a code at the first menu.  After finishing the game, it will play a short cinema in which turbo mode is "activated", and then immediately start the game at the beginning, without resetting your score or showing you any kind of ending - even if you are already in turbo mode.  Since I wanted some kind of ending, and also to enter my initials, I avoided this last tile.
