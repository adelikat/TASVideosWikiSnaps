	"Credit Warp: It turns out the glitched characters generated via holding up while mashing C can be influenced via the amount of Meseta that you currently have. We get the character who shows up from having 215 meseta at the time of initiating the glitch, and access his expanded inventory using the inventory underflow glitch. However, unlike normal characters who influence the stats and equipment of other characters through the expanded inventory, this character's inventory allows us access to the game mode (slot 35). By removing the item that is currently in there (by putting it in storage), we are able to place another item in there and overwrite the game mode by buying additional items. By putting a carbonsuit in the game mode slot, it starts the credit sequence. For a more detailed explanation on this, please check out Veo's video on it (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GpswAp9nRg).

	"Menu Buffering: If you open the menu and hit B at the right frame before the character stops moving, you can avoid encounters that would have happened on that movement. This only doesn't cost time when the screen doesn't move, otherwise you have to wait for the screen to move before it will allow you out of the menu. Credit again to Veo.

	"Route Changes: Rolf is named: "ホュ" as the characters used here are converted to Teim and an Antidote once selected in the expanded inventory. Teim is needed to cross the bridge to Oputa, and the antidote is used in meseta manipulation. By selling the antidote and two of Nei's equipped items then buying an telepipe we get the 215 meseta required. The rest of the route changes are outlined in the credit warp explanation.
