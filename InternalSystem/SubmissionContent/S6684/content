	"This is Uno for GameBoy Color. It's exactly what you expect, and more. More than the standard uno pack and style, there are multiple styles and a second pack to choose from. In this run I choose the fastest settings to get the fastest Uno game... with a catch.
	$LF
	"Usually in RTA runs of this game, the run ends after a green checkmark shows up after a game. Here... it doesn't happen because i didnt get enough points. the minimum required is 100 points but I go by so fast and my RNG is so specific I don't get the chance to get enough points to get the checkmark. But who cares. I've never played Uno with a score system like that with my family so I don't mind. It's Uno, fun for the whole family, and no score is gonna stop me from enjoying the game as is.
