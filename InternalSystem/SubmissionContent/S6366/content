There are 20 different instances for which Sonic can enter a Special Stage within the game. Only needing 7 of those, we needed to route the best viable opportunities to do this. In order to enter a Special Stage, Sonic must collect 50 rings and take them to Knuckles or Tails. This route was determined by figuring out which entrances would take the least amount of time loss versus completing the stage normally, needing at least 50 rings within the routing and having a convenient access to Knuckles and/or Tails. The Special Stage entrances used in this route are:

This segment was by far the most difficult and underwent numerous revisions. Kurayami was the first to match the IL world record in RTA (and with video), and shortly after CoEmpathy brought the time down to 0:17.
