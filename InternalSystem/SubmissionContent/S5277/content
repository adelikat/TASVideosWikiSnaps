	": Before watching I was skeptical about the entertainment in a run of this game. However, the gameplay is actually really fluid and the run shows off many things we want to see in a TAS, such as silly last-frame jumps and entertaining music syncing in places which are otherwise boring. This run also looks very optimized, so it's overall a high quality TAS.
