	"Altered Space is an isometric puzzle / platforming game for the Gameboy. This run improves on the previous publication with slightly better optimization, as well as taking advantage of the odd way the game processes input. It is ~2 seconds faster then the current publication when accounting for the BIOS.

	"On menu screens, the game checks when you release a button to clear the menu, as opposed to most games that look for a button press. Recognizing this accounts for about half the savings in the run, as there are a lot of extra frames of held input in the original.

	"The other time save is taking advantage of screen transitions. The game will register your input just before leaving one room and apply it at the start of the next room. This is actually used in the original run, but only in a single instance. This run uses it much more extensively.
