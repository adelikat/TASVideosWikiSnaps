The first, by Nitrofski (and consulted on by jeremythompson and touval), was started early in 2015. The first homeworld was completed, but, as availability and motivation waned, activity in the project declined and eventually was suspended indefinitely. 2 years later, a second project began, this time authored by lapogne36 (and consulted on by grantchil and jeremythompson). After some work on a rough draft, sections of the project were stalled slightly and, before long, Nitrofski (as a co-author) and touval (as a consultant) joined the project's team to assist with the remainder of the TAS.

	"In many cases where a project takes this long and is worked on as non-linearly as this one was, you reach the end and can look backward to see that the perceived quality of the project gradually improved as it progressed. Sometimes this is because your skill improved as you worked, and the project serves as a diary cataloging that improvement. Sometimes it's because an entirely new skill was learned and applied to only what came after the discovery. Sometimes it's something else. Regardless, the other side of that coin (or, a glass half-empty interpretation) is that you look back and see imperfection. We did not accept that. Instead, we used it to our advantage. When we looked back and saw imperfection, we disassembled whatever followed it and we fixed it. In some cases, this meant we did entire segments 5 or 6 times over, hex-editing where we could, but never in enough places to make it easy. This recursion allowed us to sharpen each segment equally; the first level can be held to the same standard as the last. And we can look back over our work with no reservations pertaining to the quality or effort put forward.

In other words: you cause Spyro to get squeezed between 2 or more bodies/surface and cause a soap bar effect (given you successfully apply MSC). Squeeze proxies have the proxy power of a perfectly aligned horizontal proxy when 2 hitboxes are involved*, and greater power still when 3 or more hitboxes are involved â€” though the game oftentimes refuse to move Spyro in such situations.

Interestingly, in this case, we found that the edge of the swim trigger and the vertical wall of the container are set at different angles, so there are some positions where landing clipped and attempting the swim in air causes Spyro to fall into the swim container still in ground state and others where we were able to achieve a swim in air out of bounds. This discovery was obviously faster as it allowed us to ignore the sub-level detour entirely, so we re-TASed the level with the new skip implemented and continued on again - finally done with the level for good.

We discovered that Sheila's movement is dependent on her radial distance from Buzz along the arena. Within a certain range (if you must know: pi/2-1 to 1 rad on her either side), she will stay still and, if Buzz leaves that range, she will move to follow him.

The end of level NPC is atypical in that it moves continuously until we take action against the enemy it's avoiding projectiles from. We noticed not only that the movement of the NPC is cycle based, but also that the first iteration of the cycle only begins once Spyro is close enough to it. In this case though, distance is not the only relevant variable: camera direction also influences the definition of "close enough". That is to say, there's a certain distance from the NPC that will activate the cycle only if the camera is pointed in the direction of the NPC and another distance that will activate the cycle irrespective of the direction of the camera. This subtlety allowed us to suspend the cycle under certain camera conditions and we exercised that power to force the NPC into its lowest possible position on the frame the antagonising enemy was killed. It's worth noting that, while the movement of the NPC isn't strictly vertical, the lateral movement is unimportant since it's possible to reach the area of effect of the interaction before the NPC touches the ground in every situation.

Our interest in this area peaked (no pun intended) when we confirmed that the roof of the cave was almost totally non-solid.

With some effort, we were able to reproduce this observed scenario, and soon after encountered a proxy-like effect that did not actually fall under our agreed-upon definition of proxy.

If Spyro is standing on the wall of ice as it breaks, he is moved along with it until his path is obstructed by the solid surface of the scenery, at which point he stops and flops to the ground. Amazingly, if instead we use a state transition to conserve this very high momentary speed, we can cause Spyro to be launched at unseen-before speeds directly toward the mountainside, and gradually slide up it. If we then use a charge to redirect the remaining speed forward, we can achieve an astonishingly quick skip to the end of the level.

With some further experimentation, we observed that the wall typically broke in that manner when Spyro was next to the wall and a shot from the cannon "missed" (that's to say, it was shot past everything and exploded based on its timer rather than by contacting a solid object). Curiously, we also observed that we could not reproduce the wall break if we did not have Sparx or had died at some point after entering the level. We concluded that, for some reason, when a cannon shot explodes due to its timer while the NPC is on the cannon, the explosion is applied to whatever happens to be first on the actors list â€” in this case, Sparx â€” and that the wall breaks in these situations because Sparx is near it.

	"Fireworks Factory, Charmed Ridge, and Bentley's Outpost all have "locked" portals and we knew we wouldn't have enough collectibles to unlock them (not even close at this point), so they would all require a boundary break to enter. This restricted efficient route possibilities further since we were dependent on the OoBs available to us. Interestingly, these OoBs included ones made possible through zombie mode's difficulty transitioning between swim state and ground state (i.e. getting out of bounds after exiting a level with a portal structure that's underwater is trivial as long as you exit the level with zombie mode activated), so we knew that exiting every level but Bentley's Outpost with zombie mode could provide favorable results depending on the level that followed.

Namely, Greta's teleport to the stairs in Fireworks Factory, the Charmed Ridge end of level cutscene, and any form of Lost Fleet involving a skip (since a death abuse is required to break the escort and complete the skip). Because of this, we ended up testing the detour to activate zombie mode in each level so that we could apply that time loss to any level order we examined in order to identify the situations where activating zombie mode was optimal.

We also believed that, since every level other than Frozen Altars and Fireworks Factory benefited internally from zombie mode or, in the case of Charmed Ridge, essentially required zombie mode to enter, it made sense to restrict our testing to only routes that began with either Frozen Altars or Fireworks Factory.

We knew that we wouldn't be able to end on Bentley's Outpost if we left with zombie mode active and it felt like ending on Frozen Altars would be wasteful considering it was one of only two levels we could carry zombie mode through, so we felt confident in asserting that our route would end on Charmed Ridge.

In fact, we discovered one such spot where this was applicable, but the location was inconvenient, so the most we could do was reach the platform with the egg near the top of the Frozen Altars portal structure and get out of bounds from there. We hoped that we would discover another spot nearer to the lower section of the solid boundary and with a more direct path to Fireworks Factory, but, as it turns out, we didn't need to use the slope-jumping mechanic at all.

At the time, the only considerable alternative was to manipulate the position of one of the smaller enemies in the level (by flaming close to him) so that he was close enough to a corner to give us the opportunity for a vertical squeeze proxy.

By jumping on a frame during the clip, we were able to use this to skip directly to the level checkpoint mentioned before.

Both enemies in that area were tested as potential death abuse antagonists.

By using a swim in air spot near the invincibility powerup (in the room right next to where the end of level interaction occurs) and then initiating the conversation with the end of level NPC, we force Spyro into a rhythmic cycle of "false deaths" whereby he is protected from death by the interaction, but still continually receiving the beginning of the death animation. After the interaction concludes, there is enough time before the next applied death attempt (with optimal text scrolling, at least) to begin collecting the end of level egg, which is another protected interaction. After that interaction is completed, it's possible to pause on the frame of the next death attempt and initiate zombie mode similarly to how it is initiated under normal circumstances. It's also worth noting that the swim in air is restricted by the cycle of the acid movement, which is reset during Spyro's post death abuse respawn.

Based on this, we believed that it may be possible to force Spyro out of the level during the cutscene by positioning him so that he was touching the end of level portal when it spawned and became active. We used the ground trigger gliding technique to place Spyro appropriately and quickly confirmed that hypothesis. In doing so, we also negated the time we had expected to lose as a result of entering with zombie mode and were able to preserve the glitched state for the next segment.

During that time, 3 cannons spawn randomly spread over 5 possible spawn locations (forming a regular pentagon). Notably, if Sparx's value is anything less than blue, Agent 9 will target a fodder before any vehicle. After the Sorceress is damaged twice, Spyro is forced off any cannon he is boarded on and the arena is cleared of all grounded cannons. However, if Agent 9 is already shooting down or targeting another cannon under certain circumstances after the end of the phase, that cannon may be dropped after the conclusion of the phase. Additionally, if a cannon shot is already in the air, that shot does not disappear when the phase is completed and can still damage the Sorceress normally.

	"In specific situations, it had been observed that the Sorceress could damage herself with her own fireball attack. In the past, this had exclusively happened while Spyro was piloting a UFO. The fireball homing is broken and it's possible for the fireball to boomerang back to her especially when Spyro is circling her closely at her shoulder level as she attacks. We developed an early theory for recreating that boomerang effect without a vehicle by luring the Sorceress to the edge of the arena, proxying from Agent 9, and manipulating her to attack with a fireball as Spyro glided around her shoulder. Before we got around to testing this theory though, we saw a recording of the Sorceress damaging herself inexplicably while a player simply ran around the arena with the camera averted. It was clear that this was the best opportunity to achieve what we wanted in the fight, but, since we couldn't see anything apparently relevant to the hit and only had a recording, it was difficult to confidently identify the cause of the self-inflicted damage. We filed the information away and intended to revisit it to determine the cause when we finally arrived in Midnight Mountain.

	"However, while developing RTA strategies for the fight in an unrelated project, we noticed that we could somehow separate the Sorceress from her staff while on a cannon (which has a fixed swiveling camera) by turning the camera away from the Sorceress as she ran through her scripted fleeing patterns. Although this was on a vehicle and the video we had seen was not, to us, this was a breakthrough answer to what caused the self-inflicted damage. We suspected that the player who recorded the video of the self-inflicted damage had unintentionally managed to separate the Sorceress from her staff in a similar fashion and then coincidentally was positioned such that the Sorceress was directly between her staff and Spyro as she attacked using her fireball. Because the fireball was aimed at Spyro and she obstructed its path to him, she was hit instead and received damage from the attack. We theorised further that this could be done all the way until the conclusion of the fight with no restrictions; we just needed to stay in place at the appropriate spot and manipulate the Sorceress to select consecutive fireball attacks until she killed herself completely. After some testing, we confirmed this theory in full.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"When attempting to optimize the self-inflicted damage, we noticed that even more variables than we thought played a role: the fireball itself is not what damages the sorceress, but instead the fireball blast radius is. The fireball blast isn't caused by the fireball interacting with the sorceress (it goes right through her), but instead with the fireball hitting the floor shortly after it spawns. The fireball blast also has an expanding radius. Putting all this together, the required conditions for an optimal staff dislocation location and angle were:

	[li 
		" The staff pitch should be -17Â° to -25Â° (pitch being the angle along side-to-side axis).

[div class=p 
	"Although already much quicker than playing the fight optimally with just vehicles, we realized that the space between each of these self-inflicted hits was longer than the optimal space between hits administered by a vehicle's weapon since, with these, the Sorceress had to both complete her damage animation and her attacking animation each time the technique was applied. As a result, we believed that it could be valuable to manipulate Agent 9 to shoot a tank down as the tank phase ended so that tank could be used for the remainder of the fight (most or all of the UFO phase). As it turns out, this theory is also correct, so we manipulated the most efficient tank to drop and used that one.

We use a proxy from Agent 9 to improve the path to the appropriate location across from the staff. After we reach that location, we manipulate the Sorceress to only select fireball attacks while we concurrently manipulate our desired tank to spawn after the cannon phase is completed. We then force that tank to be dropped as the tank phase is completed by the Sorceress and use it to complete the remainder of the fight, distancing ourselves from the Sorceress as much as possible to optimize our final decisive action.
