	"After finishing my Time Race mode TAS, I went back and rewatched my Round Game one, spotted a couple more optimizations, and tried to add them in but the RNG state kept desyncing. Next thing I knew, I was redoing the whole movie. It went a lot faster this time though, in part because I know the inner workings of the game better, but mostly because I could still work off of the strats I used in the previous version.

	"I can either move Toad to the right to catch the red diamond at the end, or let it fall. The former finishes the round faster, but leaves Toad further to the left of the screen so there's a longer transition to the next round. I tested both and it turns out they take exactly the same number of frames but leave the RNG in different states due to the latter rolling an extra diamond, so I pick the one that lets me save a couple frames on luck manipulation in R16.

	"Normally, after Toad turns around, there's a cooldown of about 10 frames before any further left/right/A/B inputs can take effect. This appears to be the game's way of trying to tell whether you wanted to simply turn around or walk in the direction you pressed, but since Toad can't move while in midair, there's also no cooldown. I exploit this to make a whole bunch of placements from midair in a split-second. This is the first time it I do it in this run, but it'll happen quite a few more times throughout the run.

	"I also ran into a rather annoying bug in the game, where a kicked monster transitioning from sliding to falling seems to become immune to gravity and diamonds for 1(?) frame. If a match occurs on that frame, the monster just hovers in midair until the chain resolves, and if the chain involves a diamond that would normally clear the monster, it remains there. This meant I couldn't kick out the blue monster between the pinks at the end, and instead I had to lose about a second to pick up the stack, walk left, and drop everything in place.
