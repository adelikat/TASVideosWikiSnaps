	"Adventure Time - Hey Ice King! Why'd You Steal Our Garbage?!! is a DS game based on the popular show, Adventure Time. It steals...uh, I mean, borrows the gameplay from Zelda 2, only with an item system. It was made by Wayforward, who also made Shantae. You know, that half genie hero.

[p 
	"Normally whenever Finn takes a hit, he'll be immediately sent to the ground and you'll only gain about 2 frames from the boost. However, if Finn takes damage while he's traveling upwards, for example from an enemy above him, he'll get the full boost. But that's not all.

[p 
	"While in the air, Finn will have a 1 frame window to do anything he'd like. This includes jumping, but more importantly sliding. Thus you can gain an additional frame from each boost.

	" Item Jumping
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The biggest glitch in the run, Item Jumping is activated by having Finn jump, and then 1-5 frames later have him use an item. He'll use the item, and there will be a 1 frame window where he can jump again. This can be chained with yet another item, effectively meaning infinite height for as many items as Finn has.

[h3 id=SlideScooting 
	" Slide Scooting
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"An odd glitch arises if you slide a frame before the normal window of sliding begins. This has Finn scoot across the ground, and it can be chained forever if you press slide every other frame. Normally this would be useless, but it was discovered that it can be used to bypass air currents. This skips a detour to get the Ear Shield, saving 50 seconds right off the bat. It also saves a few frames from then on, as the Ear Shield animation is slow to get out of.
