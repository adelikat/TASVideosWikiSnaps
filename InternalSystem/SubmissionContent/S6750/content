	"Fire Emblem: Thracia 776 (ファイアーエムブレム　トラキア776) is the fifth game of the serie, originally released through the Nintendo Power (japanese only flash cartridge service) before receiving a proper ROM cartridge the following year (only in Japan). There are a few minor differences between the two versions but nothing important as far as this TAS is concerned. The story takes place during the events of Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War, with Leif trying to retake Manster and liberate northern Thracia.

[div class=p 
	"This game has several unique features compared to other Fire Emblem games. The most notables ones for this TAS being :
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		" Fatigue: Doing an action (Fight, Dance, Steal) with any unit increases his Fatigue by 1 (or between 1 or 5 for Staves, depending of the Staff used). An unit with a Fatigue greater than their maximum HP cannot be deployed in the next chapter. Fatigue is reseted to 0 when not deploying the unit or giving him a Stamina Drink. Leif isn't affected by this mechanic.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Rescue/Capture: An unit can rescue an ally if his BLD is higher than that of the ally (mounted units are treated as 20 BLD ones), and will have his STR, MGC, SKL, SPD and DEF halved if the rescued unit's BLD is more than half of the rescuer's one (or more than BLD + 5 if the rescuer is mounted). You can also capture an enemy unit by winning a battle against him (with STR, MGC, SKL, SPD and DEF halved). The same penalties apply than if it was an ally, and you can trade items with him. The enemy tends to prioritize capturing over attacking, and no battle occurs if the attacked target is unharmed.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Escape Maps: In some chapters you must escape with your army, and once Leif Escapes any other unit left will be lost (you get one opportunity to get back the units lost in chapter 21x, which is also an Escape Map).
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Minimum deployement: In addition to the maximum number of units you can deploy, there is also a minimum number, presumably to prevent cheeses in Escape Maps. If you don't have enough units available, everyone will be deployed regardless of their Fatigue.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" MOV growth: Most characters have a movement growth rate (usually between 1% and 3%), movement which can go up to 20. Needless to say it can be very useful early on when you don't have access to the Warp Staff yet, or for Escape Maps. A pop up message appears after the level up to say to the movement was increased.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Movement Stars: About half of the cast have "Movement Stars" (between 1 and 5), which give them a (number of stars x 5%) chance to move again once per turn (not taking dance into account). In particular Leif and Lara both have 1 Movement Star. Starting from chapter 7, any character will also lose his ability to re-move if he Seizes or Escapes, and the only way to get back this ability is to end the turn normally (i.e. by not Seizing the throne or Escaping, which isn't common from chapter 7 onward) or getting danced by Lara.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Staves: All the Staves have a (60 + 4 x SKL)% accuracy, meaning that any unit with less than 10 SKL can miss when using a Staff (you still get the Exp and the Weapon Exp from it, and it doesn't cost a Staff use). Status like Sleep last forever and can only be cured with a Restore Staff. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Battle Accuracy: Hit cannot go higher than 99% and lower than 1%, so every attack can either hit or miss and is subject to the RNG.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Critical Rates: When two units are fighting, both of them can only have a maximum critical rate of 25% for the first round of combat (so if the critical rate should be higher than that, it is reduced to 25%). After that, if one of the unit has an extra round of combat (because his Attack Speed is higher by 4 or more than the opponent's one), then it's critical rate for this round of combat will be the expected critical rate (i.e. the one displayed in the battle summary) multiplied by the Pursuit Coefficient of the unit (can go from 0 to 5).
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Critical hit damage: The critical hit damage formula is ( (ATK x2) - DEF), as opposed to the ( (ATK - DEF) x 3) in the later games.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Deployment order: Unlike later games, you can't choose where your deployed units will spawn, as it depends only on when you deployed them for the last time. Since for some chapters the units are separated into several groups (chapters 18, 19, 20, 21x, 24, Final), a big part of the planning for this TAS was to find in which way I had to deploy my units in order to have them at the right spot at the right time, given the other constraints (Lafiya and Sara must often be deployed as part of the strategy, there is a minimum and maximum number of units to deploy, ...).
		$LF

	"This is the last Fire Emblem game to use a 1 RN system, meaning that what is displayed on screen are the true odds (except for critical rates).
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Each time the RNG is reseted, the game randomly picks 1 seed out of the 64 available and use it to get the 55 first RNs, the following ones are calculated with the formula RN#(N) = (RN#(N-55) - RN#(N-24)) modulo 100
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The RNG is often reseted, in particular at the start of each chapter and each time you check the stats of any unit. Checking an unit stat costs at least ~50 frames, so most of the micro optimization of this TAS was to find the best compromise between checking the stats and burning RNs.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"There are two efficient ways to burn RNs, the first one is to watch the battle summary (right before the battle), as it will "simulate" the battle and so it will burn the RNs accordingly, the other one is to move an unit to a diffrent place to force the game to burn RNs to dertermine the path to take (slower but more accurate). There are also some oddities that can burn 1 RN at a time, but none of them were usuable apart from one with the Bragi's Blade in the Final chapter.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Since you must always watch the battle summary before doing an actual battle, some RNs strings for a particular battle may be inaccessible because you can't "sync" the RNs with them (i.e. after the simulation from the battle summary, the RNs are right where you want them to be). The more complex the battle (several attacks, several skills involved), the more likely you are to not be able to sync the RNs with a specific string.

	"It's faster here to prevent the reinforcements from appearing by blocking the squares where they spawn than using a strategy similar to chapter 14. I put 2 Armors to sleep to help me in this task (since their squares are close to the boss and his bodyguards, they are very inconveninent to block with my own units), while the third and last use was to prevent the Armors in the northeast cell to waste animation time every turn. The boss can't be killed in the first three turns, but I am not in a hurry because only some reinforcements from Turn 12 onward can be prevented by killing him. I had a very nice RNs string to get a BLD level-up for Safiya (she needed to repair the Warp Staff at some point in this chapter).

	"I had 15 units to work with, including 7 without a Movement Stars ability on Turn 1 (the 5 usuals + Leif + Cyas), which lead to 3 groups of 3 people and 3 groups of 2. To clear each room on Turn 1, I needed to have 4 actions per group (open the door, kill 2 enemies, place an unit in the center of the room), which wasn't possible with my army (I would need 1 more guy to have his Movement Stars ability basically). 
	$LF
	"However I came with an alternative strategy which made good use of the excess of actions I can get from Lara's group thanks to her Dance + Movement Stars, putting her in Cyas' group so that he could solo clear the room and Warp the third guy (Dagdar) to an otherwise unclearable room. After being warped, any Movement Stars unit can kill the two enemies and occupy the center with his two actions. The top left room was chosen for this because the guys here can be so weak (11 Atk both) that they won't try to attack him on enemy phase, saving some time. This led to the least reliable round of combat of the whole TAS, with dodging a 83% attack (Berserk Sword) followed by a 8% Hit 7% Crit, to then proc a 5% Movement Stars (so a 1 in 21000 chance of success...).

	"I don't think you can go faster with any less units. My final army consists mainly of automatically recruited units, with the only ones who cost some sort of time to recruit/keep being Safiya/Lara (mandatory), Dagdar (instead of Tanya), Mareeta (needed for Galzus, I must repair the Warp Staff at some point anyway), Sarah (mandatory for chapter 19) and Galzus (I pretty much can't kill the final boss without him or his weapons).
	$LF
	"In retrospect, it might be possible to kill the chapter 10 boss with a crit and still get a MOV level-up and a Movement Stars proc (so I wouldn't need the extra level-up against the Warrior in chapter 8), but I would need to have EVEN MORE SKL, which would be tedious given the other low % stats I must get every time.

	"However the main point of controversy was the usage of a cheat code to unlock a sort of Easy Mode. While normally easy mode could be acceptable, the usage of a code changes things. I wanted to verify that a run that uses a code to unlock an easier difficulty could be acceptable to Moons. If the run was sufficiently unique, I would say yes. However, the usage of a cheat would bar it from being qualified as fastest completion as far as legitimacy (and Vault) is concerned.

This tas uses an in-game code that unlocks an option to play on "Elite Mode" that gives characters twice the experience by giving all characters the innate Paragon skill.  There are no other in-game codes in this game that could be used to further reduce the time of the tas.  This code is also the only in-game code.
