	"Here's where all the time saves are. Around 5 years ago it was discovered that you could trick the game into thinking you went past a certain screen, thus triggering a checkpoint. By making the player walk very slowly at the end of an elevator you can make the current screen value (017E) increment if the X micro frame value (0031) is greater than zero, for each increment the X micro frame value will decrement. Using this trick and some damage boosts to get killed right after the manipulation I was able to save roughly 75 seconds.

	"Due to the player placement right after the second wrong warp I had to use some extra ammo to beat the last enemy before stage 4's boss fight. Which meant that the game would automatically switch me back to the default weapon. So I had to lose 100 frames there.
