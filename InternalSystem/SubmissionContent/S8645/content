	": So there's a second version of Haunted Castle known as version M. It's considered the harder version of the game due to the fact that everything does much more damage and item drop rates are much worse. However, the stopwatch still cheeses the game in that version as well so the only real difference between versions is simply the amount of damage boosting and heart management done. That's not really enough of a concern to warrant playing on the harder version so that's not a concern.

This submission implements both of those skips and also includes a Dracula phase 2 skip that I didn't even know about until watching this. Of course there's also the more comparable
