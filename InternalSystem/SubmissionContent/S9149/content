They almost always set your horizontal speed to 72 when you're on ground, but in the air there's a higher change to get 32 speed. Either way, it's faster travel to get 72 speed than 37, 49, and 51 speeds. So we bump into them to obtain the speed, then once it gets down to 63 we start the hopping glitch. However we occasionally need to slow down still as 63 is too fast in some cases. We also need a damage boost to avoid losing all the speed on the unavoidable lava pokey. Funnily enough, the camera scroll after the midway was not supposed to spawn all those fireballs. It did help though. Otherwise a lot of stuff would spawn that'd get in the way. The camera scroll was so that the lava geysers would not be too high and I could actually grab the second Star coin.

Mainly because I wanted to do section 1 last and section 4 first due to the choice of powerup both of the ended with, so 4-3-2-1 was the fastest route I could find. For the second section of room 4, you can actually skip grabbing the spring by placing a cloud block right under the powerup removal blocks, then jump and you'll get enough height to get into the door. For the first section of room 3, the Penguin suit is back, for 20 seconds as immediately afterward we need the mini mushroom to get to the next section (I don't know why the poison mushroom has a visible X sprite as if it was Lunar Magic. If I'm unlucky I may have ever so slightly modified something in Lunar Magic when I was looking at the level, but then again I don't think I ever clicked on that sprite. For the second section of room 1, avoiding damage could have been way faster than what I did. I have no clue how I didn't see that. Using the shell to do a Shell jump in the small hole can be used to reset vertical speed to be able to land on the spring. Then the boss fight is the same as before, just longer. and that's it.

	[li 
		"The main changes between Normal and Hard mode are as follows from the hack page:
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				"Normal mode allows a powered up Mario to power down to big Mario when damaged. Hard mode changes it so that a powered up Mario powers down to small Mario when hit. This mostly isn't super relevant outside of an edge case in World Star-Castle where a fire flower could've been grabbed slightly sooner on Normal in one of the rooms.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				"The timer in Hard mode runs faster which is irrelevant for a TAS as it doesn't affect anything.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				"Star coin locations are shuffled between Normal and Hard. In general, Hard mode star coins are harder to reach. However, there are some cases where Hard mode star coins can be faster to grab than Normal mode star coins e.g. all of the star coins in World 1-1. This doesn't mean anything for a standard TAS that reaches the ending but is incredibly relevant for a 100% TAS where Normal mode and Hard mode require different approaches.

That's not exactly something to worry about for a TAS that's over 2 hours in length, especially considering that I'm pretty sure frame rules are still in effect for some objects in the hack. The fact that I only found that much means that this is very well optimized everywhere else. Nice work overall!
