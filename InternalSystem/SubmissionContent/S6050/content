	"Sonic Labyrinth is a puzzle and platform game featuring isometric game play. Sonic must obtain keys located throughout the first three acts of each zone and then battle a boss to retrieve the chaos emeralds. While Sonic has an incredibly slow walking speed, there is plenty of super fast bouncing around that makes good use of the spindash. The best ending is achieved in this run by entering the bonus stage in 2-3 to collect a chaos emerald.

This gives Sonic access to a switch that unlocks the BONUS area. In this run, the BONUS area is accessed shortly after collecting the last key. Typically, when a key is collected, the time remaining is rapidly incremented 30 seconds. However, when a door is entered, this process is paused until the next room is entered. The next room in this case is the BONUS area, which has its own timer. The remaining amount of time that the key awarded, 20 seconds, gets added to the BONUS area timer.
