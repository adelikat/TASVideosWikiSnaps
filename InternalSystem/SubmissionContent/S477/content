	"This is still a highly underestimated game. You play as the hero (of course) who returns to his town to find it almost deserted. It turns out to be the evil dwarfs who is behind this. So off he goes.

	"This improved version is MUCH faster than my old. This is because of several things.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"First of all, I changed tactic when killing enemies. When you are about to hit something and standing on the ground the hero will stop and swing his sword. This can be prevented if you jump at the same time, but if you hit an enemy while in air you will stop in midair and lose your speed. So I tried to solve this by jumping at enemies and strike them at the moment my sword "goes back" to the hero. This results in more movement forward instead of stop and kill all the enemies. I don't know how much this saved me overall but it's pretty much. Say 20-30 seconds.

[p 
	"Second. I decided to skip Tilte, the strongest magic in the game!
	$LF
	"This resulted in most time saving overall. First, Tilte takes 30 (!) seconds to buy. Second, because of this I didn't had to collect 15 000 gold which saved me a sick amount of time. And as a result of this I could use my second pair of wing boots better. I found a shortcut with them that saved me lots of time.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Also, after suggestions based on my previous run, I missed two jumps. One in the misty world and one in the branch world where the poison is. The misty world jump is NOT possible without boost from an enemy, so I had to "stop" to collect some energy but this saved me time anyways.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I also found a nice glitch when you use the wing boots. When about to climb a ladder you can reset the heroes status so the game thinks it's solid ground and thus I can jump upwards ladders. This only works with wingboots though.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"And lastly, I complete the game with a different title in this version. As "adept". I got this when I talked to the guru so I could use death as a shortcut to avoid some heavy backtracking.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I think I got the main improvements covered..
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Also, this game is very hard to plan because you have to concider where you can take damage and/or use
	$LF
	"magic and how much money you need. Fortunately I didn't have to do the money collecting part after I got the King Keys
	$LF
	"because I skipped Tilte.
