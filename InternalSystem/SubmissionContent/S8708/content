	"The cave section requires a bit of strategic slow downs to not die, as well as not sliding off the wet surface when heading towards both dorayaki (since sliding will send you front-first into them, which will trigger a ~2.5 second cutscene where Doraemon will pick up the dorayaki).

First, there is nothing to the "Menuing", since lag frames show up and give you the perfect place to focus for when to press the next input. For the run though, I saw multiple places where you land and delay for a short period of time. I thought these were mistakes, but I quickly found out that you are prepping for a big speed increase. The rest is not obvious to see, as you continuing plowing through enemies as top speed. The adventure through all the stages was a fun little trip, but I really liked it when you got to the end to play musical chairs will all the characters.
