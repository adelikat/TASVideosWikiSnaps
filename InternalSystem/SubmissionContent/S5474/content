	"Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone (Or Sorcerer's Stone, if you're in the US) is the first piece of the Harry Potter series, and this movie tie-in game loosely follows the story of the book and movie, surprisingly becoming one of the best-selling PS1 games in the process.

	"Unlike the movie or books, though, Harry Potter also has the additional magic powers of walking through walls and blatantly ignoring people, as well as skipping half of his own game in order to finish the game in a magical 1:13:57.

	"Aah, I am -so- glad that this over! After restarting this TAS several times, and getting annoyed at the game more times than I care to admit, this project of mine, after months of effort and hard work, has finally concluded; And to think, I only started TAS'ing 6 months ago!
	$LF

	"This game turned out to be a lot more challenging to TAS then I originally expected. Frame-perfect skips, unexpected glitch findings and just general annoyances stretched out how long this run should've taken to finish.

[p 
	"Many thanks to the guys in the Harry Potter Discord, for all your help with glitch finding and investigation! This really wouldn't have been possible without you, so sincerely, thanks. Special thanks go out to Nanonym and Pr0te for helping me with many of the glitches in this run, as well as Slendbed for holding the current WR and inspiring me to actually do this TAS in the first place.

Going through the school year is no easy feat - learning new spells and defending yourself against the dark arts as you unravel a mystery surrounding the Philosopher's Stone, a powerful artefact that is being hunted down by the evil Lord Voldemort, the man who murdered your parents while you were still young.

	" Frame Dilation
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The main reason why HP1 took so long to TAS is mainly because of frame dilation; entering a door one frame early or one frame late can result in the load times dilating by as much as half a second, which can knock your inputs completely out of wack, even when they should theoretically be sync'ed. Adding to that also is that the game only accepts inputs at 30, or in some cases, 20FPS, which combined with the previous dilation means that a simple change early in the TAS can have drastic effects later on.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Acute Angle Trick
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The Acute Angle Trick (AAT) is a programming oversight in the HP1 engine. Basically, if you walk into the point where two solid geometries join, and the resulting angle is smaller than than 90 degrees, the game will get confused and push you into one of the geometries, resulting in HP acting bizarrely. Sometimes, HP can teleport upwards, as shown in Forest, or HP can jump upwards and grab the wall geometry itself, at which point alternating the inputs you used to activate the AAT can result in HP scaling the wall very quickly as he jumps up the wall geometries, leading to an OoB. This is the basic theory behind FSS.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Skipping Cutscene Triggers
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Cutscenes in HP1 are triggered when HP walks into a specific area - usually these trigger areas are large enough to the point where you can't skip the cutscene, but in certain areas where the level design is sloppy, you can walk around or jump over cutscene triggers, and skip cutscenes entirely. This results in quite nice timesaves across the board.

	"This TAS could be improved by optimising movements and not saving at the start of the game - however, the Frame Dilation I previously mentioned means that I'd practically have to re-do the whole TAS, and I really can't be bothered with that. Besides, the timesaves wouldn't be that major, so it's really not worth the effort.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Starting out of the gate, I noticed that the memory card was saved twice when the file was being created. This was a minor time loss of about a second or so, but it's not that much of an issue. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The next two issues are related to each other, so I'll be putting them together. This was pointed out a few times by people in the submission topic where the movement didn't feel optimal. Movement in this run exclusively uses the D-Pad, despite the game fully supporting analog controls. This does lead to less precision in the movement. It should also be noted that the camera can also affect movement, depending on what direction your facing. From what is understood from the RTA community, the analog sticks have an input lag and makes certain tricks harder to setup. However, this is basically moot in a TAS as it could be easily worked around. I would have preferred if the movement was done with analog (if such movement is more optimal), but I'm not going to let it be a major sticking point.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Now for the run itself. The run was pretty decent, but there are definitely a lot of slow spots. Some example of slow spots are certain long cutscenes, as well as the auto-scroller in the middle of the game which goes on for roughly 20 minutes. This can't really be helped currently due to not being able to skip these, but it does regardless take away from the entertainment of the run. The overall reception from the audience was mixed, and I feel similarly to the audience. The run does aim for Moons, but I just don't think the entertainment value is there for what the game is.
