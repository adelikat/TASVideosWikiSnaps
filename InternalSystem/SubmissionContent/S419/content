	"To maximize the score, I started at the highest level (19) and did only tetrises (41). I also had to do it all in the top half of the screen to drop the blocks faster, managing to fit them all up there is where most of the challenge came from.

	"The block sequence is affected slightly by player input (pausing the game for a very short time works best), so I took it to my advantage. I wasn't able to get exactly the blocks I wanted, but it still got me out of many dead-ends and gave a higher proportion of straight bars.
