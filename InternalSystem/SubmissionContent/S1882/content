	"You control Dr Jekyll, and your mission is to get to the church to your wedding (or something like that). If pranksters, animals and bugs annoy you enough (by causing damage), you get angry and convert into Mr Hyde. If that happens, you are basically transported to a nightmare world and you have to kill monsters as fast as possible to return back. Naturally I never convert into Mr Hyde because it would slow down.

	"Taking damage is not an option. Any time you take damage, you are thrown several meters towards the left of the screen (regardless of which way you were facing). Thus taking damage not only cannot be used as a shortcut, it would be a big slowdown. Thus I avoid taking damage at all costs. There's only one place were I take damage in the last level. Seemingly this is inevitable (or at least I couldn't find any way to avoid it, no matter what I tried). I take the minimum amount of damage possible in that situation.

	"In the last level the bombs cannot be bypassed in the same way as in earlier levels. They explode way faster.

	"May I add that I hate this game? Especially the last level is a real nightmare to run (and you can see that in this TAS).
