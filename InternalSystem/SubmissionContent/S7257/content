	"To quote Wikipedia, “Virtual Boy Wario Land is a platforming video game.” It continues the tradition of previous Wario Land games, following the antihero on his quest for riches as he becomes trapped in a series of 14 underground caves with hidden treasures in all of them and is forced to find his way back aboveground.

As a last note, when completing with all treasures, the amount of coins does not matter! So the only target for this movie is 100% fastest run.

The main difference between any% and 100% run, is that sometimes changing Wario’s form are required to get a treasure, Sea Dragon and King Dragon Wario are definitely useful for the run, but also slow, so we tried to use Sea/King Dragon the least amount of time possible (see Stage 2 for the most noticeable example).
