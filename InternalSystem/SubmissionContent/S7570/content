	"This is Astro Barrier, a minigame from Club Penguin. The version I prefer is 2006, because it requires less modification to run, it looks nicer, and it actually has an end screen. However this should sync on any version, including Thinicetrobarrier, which requires no modification. To be able to run the 2006 version, use an SWF editor such as FFDEC to remove the checkDomain function from frame 1.

	". This time I modified the SWF to show the position of the player and current frame so I didn't have to rely on external timings to sync. It still wasn't great however. Using a proper rerecording emulator made it significantly easier to create and optimise the TAS. I saved 8 frames over my previous attempt, partly due to rerouting the last level, but mainly from having much better precision in the timing of shots.

My proposed solution here would be to accept as-is, but in the future allow full runs of this game to obsolete this submission. It'd be a special case, though, and not something that should be seen as universally acceptable. But there's disagreement among the judges about accepting even this since it's basically starting a run from a pre-existing save file for this game.

	"Issue 3 is a pretty big problem. Ruffle is already a special case because it has no stable release yet, making it akin to Dolphin (which has not had a stable release for over 6 years). So here, Ruffle nightly builds are considered to be official releases of Ruffle. We try pretty hard to do everything possible to get things to sync on official builds, such as with

	"Here though, the patch is both unofficial and not accepted by upstream. Specifically, a pull request of the patch was opened, and then a Ruffle maintainer explained why they were hesitant to merge it. Then the author later closed it themselves due to being outdated (Ruffle is a fast-moving project) and needing reconsideration. This is very much not ideal, and after talking with judges, we agree that this can't really be accepted as-is.
