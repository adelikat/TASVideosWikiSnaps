	[em 
		"ests

	"), is a game released for both the Sega Genesis and the Sega CD, with the Sega CD version having an enhanced soundtrack and a slide whistle effect every time Earnest moves. It is actually the second game in a very loose trilogy, coming after 
	[a class=intlink href=/977M 
		"El Viento

	" and preceding the Japan-only Annet Futatabi. There were at least three jokes I could have made out of that name and none of them are work-safe. Also it might be Anett Futatabi. Wikipedia is giving me trust issues. The game was developed by Wolf Team, who are mostly known now for splitting into Namco Tales Studio and tri-Ace and going on to develop much better games than Earnest Evans.

Also, used in places where I die and need to keep moving forward: If you jump a frame after pressing start to continue, you get a significant speed boost while you "stand up".

	"Only used in Stage 2 because it's the only stage that requires climbing. Hitting the very lowest part of certain climbable walls with the very top of your body allows you to grab them while you're slightly inside the wall. You can rapid-fire climb into the wall from here, which will send you upward at the max vertical speed of a jump. However, at some point you'll get stuck in the wall and start taking damage, because this game was programmed, so even if it looks like I can go higher in the one place where this applies, I can't.

If you land in a crawlspace in just the right way and keep jumping, you will maintain standing position and normal running speed all the way through instead of needing to use the slower crouchwalk. It's easier if you're jumping up into a crawlspace, but it's possible to do when jumping down in certain places.

Therefore I time each attack and position Earnest in just the right way to maximize the damage of each hit. If you see me randomly turning around during boss fights, it's because the whip hitbox extends behind Earnest for that period of time. This is one of the primary improvements of the run, with all bosses except for three receiving fairly large improvements due to managing weapon hitboxes better.

Studied it for a while, couldn't come up with a solution or a faster fight so I went with it. I'm assuming part of it is the weird lag situation and the other part is a worse boss pattern, which happens a lot in this movie.

	"Stage 9 is what I like to call my personal nightmare. It's got all of my biggest fears in it: Heights, massive bugs, the outdoors, death, dangerous waters, and rejection. The start of the stage contains the second biggest improvement in the run, which is a massive swing that sails straight over the falling tree. Then after that it's mostly just more swinging and bosses. You may notice I die on the stage boss, this only loses 2 frames and allows me to be a bit more aggressive with the Stage 11 boss, which saves more time than is lost here.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The first swing saves 294 frames by itself. The first miniboss is 19 frames faster, and the stage boss is 18 frames faster. Overall, there are 6 less frames of lag in the stage, so the total realtime improvement is 337 frames.

	"If you're paying close attention to this submission text... Well, for one, you're paying more attention to it than I am, but more importantly you may have seen the video I posted where I die while swinging and sail straight to the end of the stage. This is where the rejection comes into play: The stage doesn't end until you kill the boss. The boss doesn't appear until you kill the miniboss. It sucks, as this would have been a much, much more substantial improvement if I could have made that death launch work, but unfortunately game logic had to kick in and ruin my dreams.

The first boss can't be killed before it retreats into the background: At best I'd need to be able to get at least one more full swing in to be able to do that, which doesn't really work out unfortunately. The extra health allows for a faster boss fight since I can take damage to do more damage with each swing. This allows me to deliver the final hit using the back end of Earnest's swing, saving a bit of walking time as well.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Like the published run, I take a death on the second bos so I can go full hog on the final boss. This is actually the most improved boss in the run. Utilizing weapon hitboxes to their full potential did a lot to make this fight faster.

[p 
	"The final boss, on the other hand, can eat a dick. I spent hours trying to manipulate it into a better pattern, but I had absolutely no luck without ruining the rest of the improvements in comparison. After all that time, this is the fastest fight I could come up with for that pattern.
	$LF

[p 
	"The first boss was killed 17 frames faster, the second boss was killed 92 frames faster, and the final boss was 70 frames slower due to an unmanipulable pattern. Since I'm almost completely sure my math doesn't properly add up, I'll just awkwardly end this section with an improvement summary.

	"There are known improvements in stages 6 and 7 that amount to about 35 frames, but implementing these ruined the stage 8 boss pattern in a horrible way, negating those 35 frames by adding seconds worth of lag and about 15 frames of waiting needed just to start the fight optimally. Figuring out how to properly manipulate the pattern of the final boss is probably the biggest improvement I can think of, barring a new trick or a better application of one of the current tricks.

	"Earnest Evans is wonky. It is ridiculously wonky. I wouldn't be surprised if a future run improved every stage by at least half a second due to how awkward the movement is and how nothing makes sense.
