	"Overclocked is a very short NES homebrew made for the Byte-Off 2020 Competition by someone named Sam V, known as The1StickMan on YouTube. You play as a computer cursor who has to collect 3 files to escape the black and white world it's in. Under specific conditions, the game can randomly go back to the 1st screen.

Because it was considered a "demo", we felt as if it was not a finished product. Well, its been a while and I'm not getting a reply back from the developer and is apparently not going to be further developed. Its current form of release was in September 2020...so we are accepting the use of this ROM .
