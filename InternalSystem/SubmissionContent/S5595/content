		"This submission is a redo after a better strat for fighting Abobo was was pointed out.  In re-working the original submission using that strat, I discovered a glitch that allows you to control the horizontal flight of Abobo's body after he gets hit. Specifically the control is available from the 13th frame to the 26th frame after the button press for hitting him.  This glitch strat allowed me to position him in ideal locations for the next hit with minimal wait time between hits.   Unfortunately this glitch doesn't work for other enemies.  I then re-re-worked the run using the glitch strat to save even more time.

	"There are two licensed ports of Double Dragon on the C64; one published by Ocean and the other by Melbourne House.  This run is the Ocean version.  Both ports are generally considered mediocre to poor quality ports.  From what I can find online, the Ocean ports seems to be the one with the slightly more positive reviews.  These generally revolve around increased combat attack options.  Unfortunately this port is one player only.  From what I understand, the other has the 2-player co-op option. Perhaps I'll look into a TAS of the Melbourne House port for comparison.

	"Last time my tests helped to find a cool glitch, this time what caused my suspicion was the place before the second boss. The player leaves two enemies (that take a lot of hits) on different sides, waiting for each of them every time, as they get knocked back after every hit. I thought about manipulating them to be on one side, and instead of waiting for both to close up, walking at them and hitting them at a higher frequency. The first test saves 98 frames. I consider it a major drawback for a game where most of the time you have no way to speed up the fights.
