	"This is an improvement of 772 frames over Zggzdydps published Julius version run of Aria of Sorrow, and an improvement of 308 frames over my previously submitted atempt.

	"The biggest part of the improvement over my old atempt comes from the headhunter fight (~180 frames), I used the L backdash halfway through the first form battle to get her to be in a better position when she died, making the next head connect a lot faster (I completely forgot about the L backdash last time in that battle). I also saved some time on the second form by different weapon usage. Graham was also improved, though not by very much (15-20 frames or so), most of that was because I managed to use one axe less on the first form without actually slowing the battle down, so that extra axe saved some time on the third form.

	"The rest of the improvement comes from some 1-2 frame optimizations and a few new/slightly altered room strategies (I played through most rooms 2-3 times trying to make them as optimal as possible).
