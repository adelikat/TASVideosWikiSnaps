	"The biggest part of the improvement over my old atempt comes from the headhunter fight (~180 frames), I used the L backdash halfway through the first form battle to get her to be in a better position when she died, making the next head connect a lot faster (I completely forgot about the L backdash last time in that battle). I also saved some time on the second form by different weapon usage. Graham was also improved, though not by very much (15-20 frames or so), most of that was because I managed to use one axe less on the first form without actually slowing the battle down, so that extra axe saved some time on the third form.

[div class=p 
	"The rest of the improvement comes from some 1-2 frame optimizations and a few new/slightly altered room strategies (I played through most rooms 2-3 times trying to make them as optimal as possible).
