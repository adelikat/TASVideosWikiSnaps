	"My first TAS ever! The reason I chose this game was because it was one of the few games I own myself that didn't have a TAS submitted yet. This game's difficulty lies mostly in it's clumsy controls, for example the insane recoil whenever you shoot, which are easiliy abused in a TAS. The movie is played on Normal Mode, where the other option would've been Hard Mode. Hard Mode significantly decreases your weapon damage and therefore, in my opinion, eliminates one of the best aspects of this movie; the incredibly short boss fights.

When switching weapons after having shot, the projectile you fired disappears, and the weapon cooldown is (partly) reset. This allows Daffy to fire more rapidly, but only in short range since the projectile would otherwise disappear without having reached it's target.
