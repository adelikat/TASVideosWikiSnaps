	"Manic Miner is a game made originally in 1983 for the ZX Spectrum where you control a miner named Willy as he travels through a sequence of weird levels while avoiding bizarre enemies such as flamingos, basketballs, toilets, and mutated telephones. In each level the player must collect a set of items and then reach the exit before either running out of air, being killed by any of the many obstacles, or being driven insane by the repetitive music.

	"Honestly I don't care much for the 'updated' graphics, but even if there were accurate ZX Spectrum emulators available, this faithful port controls identically and has features which make it the best choice for a speedrun. The main bonus is the existence of an 'Enhanced Game' mode, which contains all of the original 20 levels interspersed with 10 new levels, and while some of the additions are uninspired, others demonstrate some interesting routing tricks. The GBA version also contains a wall-hopping trick which isn't universal across all ports (and which saves a grand total of 0 frames in this entire run, but whatever.)

	"Willy's controls are very rigid. His horizontal speed when moving is constant. He has two options when jumping: He can jump straight up (reaching a height of 20 pixels) or sideways in the direction he is facing (which again reaches a height of 20 pixels and travels horizontally 36 pixels) and he cannot be moved in the air. Turning around takes a frame but you can jump vertically on the same frame that you turn around, meaning this change of direction can be done for free if you needed to jump vertically anyway.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"If Willy is still in the air after travelling the full 36 frames when jumping horizontally then he will lose all horizontal speed and drop straight down, so it's often best to plan routes that minimise any falling since this loses horizontal movement time. More interesting things happen if Willy hits a wall while jumping. If he hits his head on a ceiling then he will lose all horizontal movement and drop straight down, which can be abused to land earlier than you would otherwise on some occasions. If Willy hits a wall while jumping horizontally then he will lose horizontal movement (obviously) but will still take the same vertical movement he would have. Stranger is that if this vertical movement takes him out of the way of the wall (by either moving above or below it) then his horizontal movement will start again.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Depending on Willy's x-position, his standing sprite will be in a different stage of his movement animation. Some of these images are wider than others, and his hitbox depends on his exact size. Since his sprite does not change when jumping vertically, this means that some jumps over enemies or between spikes can be made only at certain x-positions when his sprite is at its thinnest.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The main limiting factor in routing the levels is that Willy will die if he falls 40 pixels or more, and the levels are often sneakily designed in a way that the 'obvious' route would require you to fall too far, so an alternative route must be taken. The other limiting factors are of course the enemies (which I'll dscuss on a case by case basis in the level comments below) and the two special surface types:

		"Flunky Punkie Munkie
	]b
	" (Enhanced): This first level is new for the Enhanced Game mode. It immediately demonstrates the most useful trick in the run, which is that items on platforms <20 pixels above your head can be collected just by jumping from below. I collect the items in the bottom left and top right that way, saving a bunch of time.

]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Central Cavern
	]b
	" (Original): Level 1 of the original ZX Spectrum game, and therefore probably the one with the highest death count. It already has a couple of 'frame' perfect jumps, but other than that there's nothing particularly complex.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"The Cold Room
	]b
	" (O): The first level with a number of possible routes. The advantage to the one I've taken is that you can get ahead of the penguin at the top, which gives you enough time to collect all the remaining items and sneak into the exit before the second penguin turns around. Before I realised you could sneak into the exit this way, I used a completely different route for this level which involved falling into the exit from above.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"The Catacombs
	]b
	" (E): I leave the perfect amount left of the first fading platform so that when I land on it towards the end of the level I fall at exactly the right time and end up as close to the enemy as possible. As an aside, the jumps over the enemy at the top are both very precise, and the one on the way back is even required in a real-time run of the game. Already you can see how tricky the game is.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"The Menagerie
	]b
	" (O): Nothing particularly novel here. Note that I use the 'turning around for free when jumping vertically' trick in the top left to save one input frame (3 real frames).

[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Abandoned Uranium Workings

	" (O): The first level where it is really important to pick a route that minimises the time spent falling. Also, how sneaky is that barrel in the background in the bottom left? Very easy to mistake that for the exit.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Mummy Daddy

		"Eugene's Lair
	]b
	" (O): This level has an interesting gimmick where the enemy bouncing up and down in the centre (Eugene?) will abandon his pattern and drop to block the exit as soon as you have collected all the items. This means that to get to the finish before he blocks it, you really have to leave the item (toilet paper, in this case) at the bottom until last.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"After quite some time spent routing this level I realised that falling through the fading platform at the beginning allows you to collect one of the later items early, which makes the rest of the level simple. At the end I mess around a bit while waiting for Eugene to get high enough so that I can creep into the finish before he blocks it.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Processing Plant
	]b
	" (O): Pretty simple. Collecting the items on the middle from the left is quicker than doing it from the right because of better enemy cycles.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Nightmare Before Last Night
	]b
	" (E): A surprisingly complex level. I wait for a moment on the top fading block before jumping over the kangaroo so that when returning at the end I fall down just before the kangaroo gets me. One frame later and I would die, either the first time or the second. The order in which I get the items on the right is to minimise the time waiting for the kangaroo at the bottom. Note that I jump onto the fading platform in the bottom right which leaves enough remaining to reuse to climb back up. If you fall onto them then they will fade completely and you are left stranded.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"The Vat
	]b
	" (O): I tried many ways of getting through the mass of fading platforms on the right of this level. The quickest way down through them is using the diagonal step method that I use at the beginning, but obviously some deviation is required to get the items. Every one of the routes I tried takes the same total time though, because you always have to wait to jump over the kangaroo to get into the finish. I eventually settled on this route because it looks more interesting, and it shows just how close you can get to doing it faster. If only there were enough room to jump over the kangaroo horizontally rather than vertically when it corners you in the bottom right corner...

[div class=p 
	"There's a switch in the top left which must be pressed to gain access to the right hand side. The only other thing that really needs explaining is that I turn around before jumping onto the conveyor at the very beginning so that I am able to jump vertically off it again. The switch in the top right would kill the 'Kong Beast', but I can ignore that since I don't care about score. I guess a '100%' run of this game would hit that switch and otherwise be identical?

[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Helium House On The Highlands
	]b
	" (E): There's a bit of waiting around for the enemies at points in this level, and all in all it's pretty straightforward. The jump into the exit off the last set of fading blocks is a neat little time-saver that I'm really pleased to have found.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Wacky Amoebatrons
	]b
	" (O): The first of two 'amoebatron' levels. While these both have only one route, optimising the jumps and timings involved was surprisingly tricky. The most interesting thing to note here is that jumping vertically to avoid the green... thing at the top middle is better than jumping over it, because you still have to wait for the vertically moving green enemy and this way you can do a single jump over both of them.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	[b 
		"The Endorian Forest
	]b
	" (O): A lot of the jumps on this level are very precise, but other than that it's fairly simple. I was sure that there must be a quicker order to collect the items on the right hand side but this way ended up being the fastest.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Metropolis Bingo
	]b
	" (E): At the beginning of this level I use the 'wall hop' trick to get up to the first item. It's only possible when you jump at the correct angle to a block just below the top of a wall, and even then only on some walls. It also doesn't save any time here, in fact it's one frame slower, but I have to wait on the right hand side of the level anyway and I wanted to show it off.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The right hand side of the level is one of the most unsatisfying parts of this run for me. It looks clunkily slow, and has a large amount of waiting (which I've disguised as best as I could!) but there really seems to be no faster way to do it.

		"Return Of The Alien Kong Beast
	]b

	" (O): Funny story: when first routing this level I somehow failed to notice the ladder on the right hand side.

[div class=p 
	"This is where the flag-tailed scorpions are really annoying. The jumps I do around the one in the top right may seem like a waste of time, but you cannot jump vertically over it without hitting its tail, so this is actually the quickest way to get the key.

[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Jester Under The Bed
	]b
	" (E): There are many possible routes through this level, but since you have to take the path from the top left to middle right at some point, clambering up the column of fading platforms at the beginning is the quickest option.

[div class=p 
	[b 
		"The Warehouse
	]b
	" (O): This level was fun, because I kept thinking I'd done it perfectly, and then I'd find a new, faster route. The haphazard-looking movements I make near the beginning are to allow me to jump over the yellow enemy as early as possible without hitting the obstacles above. Another neat thing about this route is the vertical jump I do when standing next to the grey enemy later, which is only possible because Willy's sprite is at it's thinnest.

		"Clockwork Satsuma

	" (E): The last of the levels new for 'Enhanced Mode', and one that seems particularly dull. I guess the jumps in the bottom right corner are tricky, but the rest is really uninteresting. Note that I hit my head when jumping to collect the final item which allows me to fall a little earlier.

]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Solar Power Generator
	]b
	" (O): This level has a gimmick where your air drains faster than normal when the energy beams hit you, but in a TAS it's never at risk of running out anyway so that's no danger. Because of the item in the top left that you can only get by falling from the exit, this level will require two cycles around to get everything, and the only routing considerations are which cycle to collect the item in the bottom right, and the same for the item in the top right. Whichever option you choose there is a lot of unavoidable waiting, but it ends up being fastest to collect them the first and second cycle round respectively, and so normally that would be that... if it wasn't for the aforementioned gimmick.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"At the end of every level you have to wait for your remaining air to be converted into score. Usually there's nothing you can do about that, but on this level there is a way you can have less air remaining without wasting any time (and therefore it's quicker to convert to score), just by getting hit by the energy beams. I'm so glad I realised this was possible, because it means that all the unavoidable waiting can be put to use, and also because while humans are incredible and you can imagine that a particularly dedicated (or lucky) person might be able to get close to TAS times on the other levels, here is a level where tool-assistance is absolutely required for fully optimising the time.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Your air still drains faster at the end of the level than the beams drain it, so it's not worth taking longer to complete the level just to get hit by them, but because there were many waiting periods it's actually possible to drain almost all of the air just by waiting in the beams on some occasions and making well-timed jumps on others. Easier said than done though, and this level probably took longer to TAS than most of the other levels combined.
