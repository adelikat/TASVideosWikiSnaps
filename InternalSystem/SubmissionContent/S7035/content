On normal, it's 1x, on Hero, it's 1.5x, and on Super Hero, it's 2x (with some exceptions). Spider-Man's web usage also uses these numbers (e.x. web balls use more webbing so you can't shoot as many).

To do this, open Dolphin 5.0 and right click on your copy of Spider-Man. Press "properties" and then click "show defaults" at the bottom. In the txt file, at the bottom, there should be 2 things - one that says "enable xfb = true" and "enablerealxfb = true". Erase both of those lines and Ctrl+S to save the file.

On Hero, there are two additional enemies in the following room. I web yank one of them toward me and push him through the garage door, then jump on his shoulders to clip through the door. This saves over a minute compared to the intended route, because it skips a cutscene where a lot of things happen (specifically, an enemy with a necessary item no longer has the opportunity to lock himself in a back room). I go behind the truck, up through the vents, and land on the enemy with the necessary item and beat the crap out of him, using the slanted control terminal to skip the animation of applying web gloves (web gloves allow me to do more damage). Once he's KO'd, I put the item back on the control terminal and watch a short cutscene of a door opening - or rather, it's already opened. You have to do this anyway or else the enemies in that "locked" room won't spawn and you won't be able to complete the level. I then use a precise webzip to clip through the wall on my left, and zip over to the opened room. I quick-throw the gas canisters (by pressing X) at the thugs to deal massive damage, and then double-swing-kick the revealed thugs in the side room before performing a webdome to finish them off. I webzip to the exit door which has now been opened. Normally, when performing a webzip on the ground, Spider-Man goes through an animation of preparing the zip before actually zipping. I perform the inputs for a web-yoyo and then do a webzip 1 frame later to skip the animation. You can also do this while attacking to skip recovery animations, and I will be using it quite a bit at a later time.

I continue down the hall and grab the Handspring combo, then enter a large room.

I simply yank an enemy near the door and push him through to skip the entire fight, then webzip to the top of the warehouse to Uncle Ben's Killer.

The third batch is taken by destroying the balloon (there is a small timer before you are able to destroy it, so I delay firing web at it). Now I go to the marker and move onto the second part of the level. Some robots spawn, so I swing kick them twice (on Normal and Easy, they only require 1 swing kick, and on Super Hero, they require 3). I then climb on the wall. This causes the next batches of robots to spawn directly below me instead of in the sky, and I swing kick them twice.

I stand at their spawn point and face away so I'm able to use my new combos on them as they appear. Once they're taken care of, I head up into the side room and defeat enemies, using the yoyo-into-zip trick I mentioned earlier, allowing me to do swing kicks and flying punches with no recovery time. I web zip back into the main area once the thugs are taken care of, and then swing to the two thugs attacking the policeman. I swing kick them, and then do another piece of tech - by performing the inputs to shoot a web ball and then swinging immediately after, I can shoot the web ball AS I swing kick. Then I save the guy on his phone from being crushed by the falling pillar, then webzip to the next group of thugs. I use scissor kick on them to KO them easily, then grab a Golden Spider from under the overhang. Another cutscene starts, which I skip, and head down the hallway. I use handspring extensively as crowd control on the numerous thugs, then face away from their spawn location and handspring them some more.

I reach a large room with a pipe blasting out water. One of Shocker's goons has taken the valve, so I head to the side room and beat him up to get it back. I intentionally get shot as I apply web gloves to skip the animation of putting them on. I KO the thug, get the valve, and head back to put it in place. I grab the Golden Spider from above the pipe and use a suplex on the nearby enemy while he's in the air, making a neat little force-suplex. I go through the pipe as the water shuts off (frame perfectly, actually) and go upwards to another room. I hit a switch with my web and go back into the previous room, dropping down, and zipping through the door to grab Advanced Web Gloves. I continue through the level and reach a largeroom with some green water. I pull a thug into the lower region and use him to clip through the door (this door has weird collision and instantly forces me off the thug's shoulders when I get through, but only on this side). I grab Advanced Impact Web and clip back out of the door on the side that DOESN'T force me off the thug's shoulders. I webzip to the door on the opposite side (this door functions in the same way - one side forces you off the thug's shoulders while the other doesn't). I web yank the enemy and use him to clip through the door, press the switch to open the exit, clip back through, and then zip to the exit.

If I were to knock vulture down before I went up, I would be wasting webbing (which I need for this level). Getting hit by vulture is simply the fastest option here. I then drop down the tower to grab the Sting combo - a very high damaging combo. I knock vulture down and apply advanced web gloves, then do the Uppercut combo I grabbed earlier, only hitting him with the third strike, followed by the Dual Fists combo. Vulture flies back up, so I knock him back down with a web ball and swing kick. I then apply advanced web gloves again and do an uppercut (just an uppercut, not an uppercut combo - there is an important distinction there), followed by a falling punch, and another uppercut.

I save Mary Jane next, and climb up the building I spawned on to grab a Golden Spider as Goblin flies away. This Golden Spider spawns inconsistently - I had to do some minor RNG manipulation in the previous level to get the combo to spawn here. Once I have it, I go to the location, right on time for Goblin to try and destroy the radio tower. Blah blah blah, minor chase sequence which can't be sped up, etc. I get to the bridge and perform what I like to call a "reverse web-yoyo". By cancelling a punch while on a wall into a web yoyo, Spider-Man will be upside down (from his intended axis) on the web.

I then follow him into the building and perform Sting, followed by sideways dodges to cancel the recovery and save... 2 frames on every sting combo I perform. Once his health reaches a low threshold, he retreats back onto his glider. And no, you can't kill him early unless you're playing on Easy or have cheats enabled to have a certain combo move early.
