	"The demo which plays is not a proper video file, it's effectively its own TAS which plays a specific input in order to produce the demonstration.  However, it doesn't update the movie according to the current Input configuration, which means if we change which button does what it results in the demos no longer producing the intended effect.

	"What does happen, will be standard deaths on most stages, which would otherwise cause you to reset on your current level.  The exception here is for the bonus stage "Apu in Agrabah", which upon failing results in it advances you to the next stage instead.  You will then find that the next stage the game tries to demo, is not the intended "Agrabah Rooftop", but instead the stage after the previously selected one, IE level 04.  This then happens every cycle, such that next time it tries to play the demo input into level 05, then 06, all the way up to the final level.  The demo cycle 'completing' the previous Apu level, means that the final level then gets advanced, and 'completed', resulting in the final credits being displayed.  These are different from the regular credits which come up while waiting, since they contain the romantic background of both the rug ride and the kiss, and thus is a definite ending.

	"Sadly though, this takes ~378131 frames, or about 100 minutes.  What happens meanwhile is very boring, the only interesting thing would be a graphical glitch at ~271895, which may be a screenshot.  At best, this should go in vault as an alternate category, but not to beat the current record.

	": This is a nice glitch demonstration, but it's not really a publishable TAS. There is nothing in this movie that encompasses superhuman gameplay, or even gameplay period. It literally consists just of setting a menu option.
