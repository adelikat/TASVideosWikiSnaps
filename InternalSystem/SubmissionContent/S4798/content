	"Hetfield90 and StarvinStruther's GB Kid Dracula TAS in 18:43.6. It is 2981 frames(~49.9s) faster than the published run in terms of comparable gameplay improvements, and 1942 frames(~27.3s) faster outright due to version and emulation differences. Emulator used was BizHawk 1.11.0.

There were smart gameplay refinements featured, as well; including the use of jump shots in Stage 2, the vertical descent in Stage 8, and the final boss strategy on Garamoth.  All in all, this was a very solid improvement.
