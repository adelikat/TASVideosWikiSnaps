	"There is no selection of difficulty. Basically, just survive the constant passing of cars. As for the ending, it will eventually get to the point where the time remaining will not be enough to complete a lap. This is due to the reduction of the "finishing time", by 3 seconds each lap completed.

	"This was a very easy game to TAS. All I had to do, was move my car to one side and then control RNG so that no car hits me.

	"Why not avoid on-coming cars by steering? Well, steering causes the game to slow down...if held too long. Short burst of turning will not do this. So it was better to control RNG, so that cars will go around me. This was done by using random key inputs...for when a car is approaching. Doing so, will cause the car to take a different route around our vehicle.
