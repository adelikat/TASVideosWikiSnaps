	"Merry Christmas, and your present is an awesome TAS.OK, This is my 4th attempt at TASing The Terminator. The 3rd attempt is on Youtube and this submission is about a minute shorter than that run. Needless to say, this ones way more entertaining. There are more glitches in this run than all my others. One in the first level, saved tons of time. Also more Luck manipulation was used in this one.

	"Turning around for 1 to a few frames can manipulate an entire field of enemies coming along. If you see me do that, it's to luck manipulate. I shoot Arnie once in the Police station, to stop him from shooting so I could jump over him.

	"I briefly tested the shooting sequences since you appear to just mash the buttons there, and saved 10 frames on one police officer. It might not be completely fair to extrapolate, but you have about 40 of these gunfights, which would mean a possible improvement of 400 frames or 6-7 seconds.

	"This is not the main reason for rejection. This game is just lacking in possibility to do something interesting. Even with optimal gunfights, I doubt a movie of this game would be publishable.
