	"I was looking into doing an updated Ristar TAS but I thought first I might look at the Bonus Stages run to get an idea what I was getting into and if it would hold my interest. I didn't realize how optimized the run was at the time. I started looking around for obvious improvements and found none, after checking for even tiny improvements I found only 2. (Note that the movie length is longer due to longer loading times.)

	"I wasn't sure what to do about authorship here. Obviously most of the inputs are by mmarks. But the strategies are obvious, and he is perma-banned, so I wasn't concerned about not adding him. If people have a different opinion on this let me know, I don't mind adding him if people feel really strongly he should be.
