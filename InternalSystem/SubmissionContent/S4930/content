	" Introduction
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"It's about time someone did a 100% run of this game! Sonic Advance 3 is, without a doubt, a lot harder to TAS than its predecessors (Advance and Advance 2). With the introduction of the partner system and 20 unique teams to play with, this game offers countless possibilities; even more so when making a TAS.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This idea has always been in my head even before I made my 
	[a href=/4916S 
		"Sonic Advance 2 "Knuckles" run
	]a
	", but this game's required level of precision with the tag action, as well as its completely different physics from SA2 was rather intimidating for me as a TASer. Combine this with the fact that this game's bosses are incredibly difficult to optimise (more into that later), I thought I would never muster enough patience to even begin this project.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Regardless, I still gave TASing this game a go anyway; I started with some individual level TASes, and eventually understood enough of SA3's physics, tricks and techniques (most of them from nitsuja's outstanding any% run) to work on the full game completion TAS. I had to map out Chao locations (with the help of the maps on The Sonic Center) and key locations, then determine the most efficient order of acts to be played in each zone.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I'd just like to say that this movie would not have been possible without 
	[a href=/1192S 
		"nitsuja's run
	]a
	". Most, if not all of the entire TAS was done while analysing his movie and using it as a reference in a separate window. Most of my lengthy commentary will make references to his run, especially the boss stages. Some of my words here will closely mirror that of his submission as well. I also won't be going into too much detail regarding the game's various tricks and techniques as nitsuja has already amply described many of them in his submission.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This TAS was done with VBA-rr v23.5 svn421, with the "Auto-hold" function on R (to always charge a tag action). I only have to press R once to "release" the R button and use my tag action. I also opened a separate VBA window alongside, and ran nitsuja's movie to look through his inputs in common areas and try to improve them (although most of his work is already incredibly optimised for a run done 9 years ago). I also run a lua script (kindly provided by Anty-Lemon) which details X/Y coordinates, X/Y velocity and a timer which also runs in the overworld.

				" In Sonic Advance 3, there are 10 chao located in each of the 7 zones, collecting all of which will "unhide" the hidden keys in the individual stages. You must collect the key and complete the act without dying to keep it (will elaborate more on keys later on).

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The goals, in order of highest to lowest priority, are as follows:
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" 100% completion of the game without playing any level twice
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Death abuse only if it saves both real time and in-game time, not one or the other

		" Maximum ring count on special stages
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" Collecting more rings past the required amount on the special stages won't affect time in any way, but I thought that for a movie of this length I might as well optimise everything I can and add on to the entertainment value.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				" Time can be affected in special stages if you jump, and are in mid-air when the "Good!" message (which appears midpoint and at the end of the stage) would appear. In which case, the message will be delayed until you land, which ends up wasting time.
				$LF
			]li
		]ul
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"With these goals, which closely follow those of nitsuja's run (except the death part), more team diversity is encouraged, rather than racing through the entire game with one or two teams simply to avoid resetting and switching characters. The character switching no doubt adds a considerable amount of real time to the movie length, but I felt that better-optimised individual levels would add to the movie's appeal much more than an invisible "real-time".
	$LF
]p
[hr 
]hr
[h3 
	" Hidden Chao and Keys
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"There are between 2 and 4 hidden Chao in every level (or "act"), and sometimes one Chao on the zone overworld. Collecting a Chao brings up a dialogue, which pauses the in-game timer, then the game saves the Chao immediately regardless of whether or not you complete the act. While this technically means I can collect all Chao in one level, then die/reenter again and complete it as fast as possible to "save" in-game time, this would both pile on to the movie length, and kill a whole lot of entertainment with its repetitiveness.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"As for keys, every level has about 6-8 keys, with half of them appearing in one layout and the other half in another layout. The key layout is random (which means technically there's a 50% chance of any given key appearing in that level), but luck manipulation on my part takes care of that (more on that later too). As mentioned earlier, the layout is determined the moment you start the level, regardless of whether you have collected all 10 Chao in the zone or not.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Therefore, the general strategy of this run will be to collect Chao in a certain route on the way to the goal for each level, then collect the 10th Chao together with the key in an act. Before TASing the act in which I would collect the key, I manually collect all the Chao in that act first then see if the key appears where I want it to (typically placed conveniently somewhere between the last Chao and the goal ring). If it doesn't, I add in small delays of 1 frame increments before entering the "Act Ring" in the zone then try again.
	$LF

[h3 
	" Team analysis
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Although there are 20 different teams from 5 different characters to choose from, not all of them are used in this run for two reasons: 1) Not all characters are unlocked from the start; 2) not all teams are fast and/or mobile enough to fit into a run aiming for speed. Here are the teams I use in the run, listed in their order of appearance:
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Tails/Sonic
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The most used team in this run, unlockable from the very beginning of the game. This is definitely the most broken team for any run aiming for speed. Sonic's tag action gives immediate boost mode and, thanks to a bug, allows for an immediate jump after using the tag action (more details in nitsuja's submission). Boosting off a downward surface (preferably a completely vertical one) gives an enormous speed boost; combine this with the fact that Tails maintains his horizontal speed completely when flying, and you have a team which can blast through most levels quickly with ease. However, due to the fact that, on a vertical surface, you have to release the tag action the exact frame it is charged, this makes optimising jumps extremely troublesome as I have to determine the exact frame to begin charging the tag action. The only downside of Tails/Sonic which has a significant impact on this run is their poor vertical movement. This brings us to the next team...
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Sonic/Tails
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This team can attain boost mode, but only from running off a booster. With Tails' tag action giving a high jump, as well as Sonic's potential to reach high speeds, S/T is a great team in levels which require a lot of vertical movement. However, they are mostly slower than T/S; I only use S/T 4 times in this run. Three times to unlock the other characters in three levels, and once in Ocean Base 2 because of the level layout requiring a lot of vertical jumps to make it through quickly.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Knuckles/Tails
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Although this is a very useful team for exploring places and reaching almost anywhere in a level, K/T can't boost at all. I only use this team once in Ocean Base 1, because Knuckles' power attack is required to break a wall, and Sonic's tag action isn't very useful in a level which vertical movement wins out horizontal movement.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Sonic/Knuckles
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This team is used twice; in the Ocean Base boss, and in the final Altar Emerald fight. This team's main selling point is the upward flame burst attack which Sonic can use only when Knuckles is his partner. Sonic also has a cooler slide attack, with increased sliding distance and a cool flame animation. Pressing B mid-jump also gives a speed boost and is very useful when used immediately after jumping out of a spindash. While the upward flame burst attack is greatly overshadowed by better vertical movements in Tails and Cream's tag actions in the individual levels, Sonic's upward attack doesn't require any charging (unlike a tag action), allowing him to demolish the two abovementioned bosses quickly.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Knuckles/Sonic
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"I only use this team once in Cyber Track 1 to break a wall which requires Knuckles. Cyber Track 1 doesn't require any flying or high jumps to complete, making Sonic the ideal partner for Knuckles. Knuckles' gliding is replaced with a useless headbutt attack when paired with Sonic, effectively rendering him useless when compared to T/S.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Knuckles/Amy
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"I really like this team a lot. This is the only team which can spindash straight up walls, and is probably the most versatile team of all. Their only downside would be their inability to boost, which unfortunately slows them down in most levels, making a +Sonic team better in such cases. Unfortunately I use this team only once in the Cyber Track boss because they have the fastest exit from the battlefield.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Sonic/Cream
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This is an amazing team, with the ability to make quick, fast jumps (albeit not as high as Tails' tag action) without losing much speed. Unlike with Tails, Cream's tag action maintains most of your horizontal speed and momentum, making her very useful in two of the largest levels in the game. However, this is an extremely difficult team to TAS, because very careful planning is needed for every tag action to land as soon as possible. It's a pity that Cream is unlocked so late in the game.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Tails/Amy
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Tails' flying capabilities get a huge boost when paired with Amy. He gains a lot more altitude, and flies with much higher acceleration. The only downside to his flight is that he only can fly for 3 seconds (unlike the normal 5 when paired with Sonic). However, T/A is put to great use in Chaos Angel 3, where boosting is useless and prolonged flight is crucial.

Hitting the boss on the very first possible frame proved to be a huge challenge with Tails/Sonic as well due to their poor attacking range; it took some 2-3 hours to finish this boss.

Near the waterfall at the end I charge a tag action and boost-roll past it, instead of riding it down. This saves 10 frames or so. I also grab the key at the foot of this waterfall and complete the level slightly under 32 seconds.

	"This was another nightmare to optimise. This boss is the most random out of the other 7; hex editing even a single frame of delay before the run will cause it to desync entirely, even with the exact same inputs. Here I take a few hits to abuse the invincibility to land certain hits more easily; the final hit has to be dealt in such a way to force the boss offscreen after it dies. This nearly drove me insane, but I miraculously managed to get a hit where the delay before regaining my controls was greatly reduced. This allowed a huge time cut from nitsuja's run.

The very first checkpoint I touch practically screams "death abuse" in my face for the 1st Chao, but taking a death is much slower because I already have some rings from the launcher path. The 2nd Chao is placed conveniently in my path, and the 3rd didn't require much of a detour to get. The key is also located directly in my path shortly afterward.

[p 
	"For the act itself, it definitely wins the "most inconvenient Chao location" award, with all four damn Chao placed in locations which require huge detours. The 3rd Chao especially required a snaking route to reach it (I tried jumping from the rail below to reach the series of springs, but Cream's tag doesn't give that much height), costing a good 20 seconds. The 4th Chao required jumping into a low pit which costed a lot of time getting back up onto the faster route of the level. I end up taking the longest time here of all the levels.

The 2nd Chao required a bit of a detour; I had to do the entire level with Knuckles/Amy also, to make sure that Tails/Amy was faster, and they definitely won out especially with the long stretch to the goal ring. Speaking of the final stretch, it's possible to fly all the way to the goal ring from the first pillar I landed on; however the spikes were in the way when I passed the second pillar, meaning I had to spindash jump off there and fly to the goal.

A bit of luck manipulation was needed after the 3rd hit, to ensure that both his hands drop down and come back up at the earliest possible moment (this is because when his hands come back up, he starts shielding his face, adding 1 second or so to his invulnerability).

I have to watch the credits in its entirety then come back to defeat this boss again to access Nonaggression. And no, a reset to skip the credits doesn't work - I learned it the hard way. It seems that you must view the two "unlock something" messages at the end of the credits shown by the Chao before you can actually trigger the cutscene leading to the Nonaggression boss fight.

	"This boss takes 12 hits to defeat (8 if Easy mode is selected in the options), and the only way to hit him is to charge a tag action to open up his eye, followed by an attack on it. Eggman's tag action takes 2 seconds to charge, and unlike the other characters, you can actually charge his tag action longer to make the boss's eye open up for a longer period of time. This is however slower than simply charging a tag action to its minimum power. It took quite a bit of getting used to this boss to bring the timing lower than nitsuja's 0:35.33.
