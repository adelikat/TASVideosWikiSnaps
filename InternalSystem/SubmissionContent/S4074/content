	"Time Diver Eon Man is an NES game that for some reason was never released commercially, despite being completed. I played through it in a blind race and it was a lot of fun, so I decided to make a TAS. There were a lot of decisions to be made in this run, such as which bosses to use special attacks on and when to take damage to save time. There are two points where I kill myself intentionally to regenerate health. Power-ups drops in this game are fixed, so there's no way to manipulate items. There is some improvement potential on bosses and whatnot, but due to my routing choices, I had to take a small delay to save time elsewhere. Levels are randomized after the first, so routing has to change accordingly.

	"Level 1:
	$LF
	"Pretty straightforward. Plowed through pretty much everything without stopping except to wait for platform cycles. Decided to save my special attack for level 2 boss.

	"Level 2:
	$LF
	"Another pretty straightforward level. May have been able to save a few frames by jumping into the spikes during the digging section, but not having to wait for health regen after the boss made it pretty much even. Climbing the shaft was awesome. The boss didn't even get an attack in, which is a shame because he literally throws the word "wow" at you.

	"Level 3:
	$LF
	"Waiting for the stupid tram wasted some time, but it's instant death if you get hit. Intentional death to restore health because walking through the electricity is much faster than waiting for the platforms. The robot boss wasted a little time because I had such low health.

	"Level 4:
	$LF
	"Jump a lot because water slows you down. Climbing the shaft seems a little slow, but I don't think it's possible to do it in one cycle. Boss went quickly.

	"Level 5:
	$LF
	"Took a little too much damage in the beginning, but had some nice damage boosts escaping the flood. Died intentionally to restore health. The rest of the level was pretty smooth. The boss could have been slightly faster, but I'm mostly satisfied.
