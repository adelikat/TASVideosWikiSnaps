	"I started to play around with this game some time ago with the intention to maybe improve the current 2-player run. I however started by making a 1-player test run to get a little more used to the game and apparently this gave me enough inspiration to complete a serious 1-player run. It ended up being 6544 frames or 1 minute and 49 seconds faster than last published 1-player run which also means that it actually beats the current 2-player run by 20 seconds despite all the disadvantages. Disadvantages are that you have more Nibbley Pibbleys to collect, are not able to eat in parallel and longer score countdown after the levels. Having only 1 player creates much less lag though to help getting down the time a little and also makes the run more enjoyable in that aspect.

	"Technical stuff about the run:
	$LF
	"In contrary to how things usually works out for me I actually was very lucky with a couple of strategies this time. In the levels 2, 3 and 5 I manage to catch the 128 framesrules, that determines when Nibbley Pibbleys pop out of those canons or whatever they are, by 1 or 2 frames and it was also a close call when catching the last water shot in level 7. In level 8 I used a trick that made it possible to eat one less Nibbley Pibbley in the last three pools by eating one more at the end in each of the three precedent pools which then carry over to the next pool. Also, every object can only be loaded to the screen every ~20 frame so in some cases it wasn't necessary to optimize the movement to the last frame if it was obvious that I couldn't catch the next frame rule. I should also say that optimizing movement in this game, being a 3D-environment game with very slippery controls, is insanely difficult.

	"As I feel now I will unfortunately not make the 2-player run as I'm tired of this game now and I know that such a run would require much more work with than this one. So as far as it comes to Snake Rattle 'n' Roll, this is most likely what you'll get from me.

	"If anyone's interested in what time a warped run would've had if played with the same precision it would be done in 3 minutes and 54 seconds. Such a category is very unnecessary though since it would only show the snake running directly to the rocket in level 1 and then show level 8 - 11 as in this run. One small fun fact is that this warpless run beats the first warped run submission:)
