	"A brief rundown of the flaws in this TAS: very poor movement overall, misses the 1-1 warp, misses walking through walls in 1-2, misses the vine warp in 4-2 and warps to World 5 instead (!), gets fireworks in 5-1, 6-3, 7-1 and 7-2, misses several maze sections in 7-4, misses some more maze sections in 8-4, misses various time saving tricks like the flagpole glitch, wall jump, and more. It loses over 9 minutes of time compared to the less than 5 minutes long
