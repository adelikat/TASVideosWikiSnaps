	"This is a TAS of a hack of Sonic the Hedgehog for SEGA Genesis where Vector the Crocodile is in Sonic 1, which was created by E-122-Psi. Every level abuses a bug (with the exception of Labyrinth Act 3, Star Light Act 3 and Final Zone), only present in this hack, where spindashing into an object or wall, and then spindashing again as soon as the camera catches up so that Vector is back in the middle of the screen, causes the stage to level wrap and zips Vector to the end of the level. The aim of this TAS is to beat the game as quickly as possible.

	"There's a faster way where when stomping down in the ground then spindash again you'll do the level warp again. There were 2 glitches that were found for example (Walking on air, and in Labyrinth zone 3 the Ice Cap Zone Level Skip Glitch)
