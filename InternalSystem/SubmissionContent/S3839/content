	", then blow them away with rainbow mana attacks. However, for the purposes of this video game, which only loosely resembles the second anime season, you can cross the first and third items out. Here it is all about beating up monsters; transformations and magical attacks don't exist except in cutscenes. In the case of this TAS, it is running/kicking/flying through levels as fast as possible. Because it is also a platform game, complete with wall-jumping, the TAS is essentially just parkour stunt perfection.

		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Collecting hearts increases HP by 1, and collecting five orbs also increases HP by 1. They tend to be out of the way.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Bonus rounds allow you to collect orbs. While you definitely want to play these rounds during normal gameplay, they are extremely time-consuming and serve no purpose to this TAS. Accessing one also unlocks that bonus round in the Extra Game menu, not connected to normal gameplay.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" There are presents to collect, but they are completely optional (in fact, collecting one slows you down because the game reports it after the level). They serve no purpose except for some furniture dressing and hide-and-seek mode. As you can tell from the names of those modes, they are not real gameplay.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" There are four worlds in the game (Marchen World, Aqua World, Jungle World, and Mystery World). Each world has five levels, four normal levels and a boss level.
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" Each normal level has four areas, of which the third area is always the Attraction. The Attraction is an area with a unique setting and (usually) unique enemies, in which a goal is to be performed, such as "Get to the end" or "Defeat this enemy" type goals. The name of the level tells you the Attraction.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				" A boss level just has a single area where you fight a boss. Because the game has to shoehorn all the girls into the battle, there are three forced switches during the fight. No, I didn't count wrong; one girl gets two appearances. Technically, in the final boss level, you fight three different bosses.

		" Screw kick (basically a dash kick that acts as an attack) is 3.5 u/f. It can only be used in air, and lasts until you hit the ground. It is possible to cancel the screw kick in the middle of flight; this is sometimes faster, since it increases vertical speed downward.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Assuming flat ground, optimal speed is a jump of 12 frames of A, followed by a screw kick (B _ B), an average of about 2.822 u/f.
		$LF

	[li 
		" A wall-jump is 2 u/f away from the wall. However, by interrupting the wall-jump with an air kick or screw kick, then cancelling the kick with A, you can now control your character by pressing left and right, but with an extra 2 u/f velocity (away from the wall) added onto the character in mid-air. So by pressing toward the wall, the velocity is 0; not pressing anything, 2 u/f; pressing away from the wall, 4 u/f. So it is possible to go very fast from a wall. However, the downside is that your character is unable to attack any enemies that are in the way.
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" It is best to interrupt the wall-jump with an air kick and then cancel with A, because an air kick preserves upward velocity (if cancelled), whereas a screw kick does not. Screw kicks are only used in this trick if there is no benefit to upward velocity (such as, if it is better to have downward velocity).
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				" It is entirely possible to wall-jump from a slope, in the direction where the slope slants downward. Around where the vertical position is a multiple of 16, by starting an air kick into the slope and cancelling it (may also occur from going very fast into a slope), the slope is treated as a wall (think of steps on a staircase). This is abused in a few places.
				$LF
			]li

	]li
	[li 
		" However, by interrupting a wall-jump with an air kick, and then not cancelling the kick, the extra 2 u/f velocity is not applied, and it is possible to return to the same wall to wall-jump again. This trick is abused to climb walls which are intended to be impassable without the use of other routes or platforms. It takes a while though, since the air kick must not be interrupted, so it is only used in a few places.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Enemy boosting is used a lot in this run. By using a screw kick to hit an enemy, normally it slows you down (backwards 0.5 u/f), but when hit from above, it is possible to be boosted forward by 7.5 pixels in a frame. It only lasts a couple frames at most, and may occur in conjunction with being slowed down.
		$LF

There are two sets of Shadow Hikari mirrors which produce 6 shadows per set. You can have all 6 of them running around causing havoc if you want, but since we must beat 6 of them as fast as possible, I don't have so many of them running around. For the first set of mirrors, the last shadow is destroyed at the right side of the right mirror so that I can advance as fast as possible. Same thing for the second set of mirrors. Then we must fight ... Dark Hikari. Which is quickly destroyed.
