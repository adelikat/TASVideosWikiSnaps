		"Spring 1 : I arrived in my new farm if you can name that like this‚Ä¶ The stone wall is broken, a field of weeds and stones, a little timber house and full of cut tree trunks. Not very motivating‚Ä¶. A man comes and presents himself as the shipper and of course he asks me my name because I‚Äôm a new comer, he wants to be welcoming‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm very lazybones, so I take just one kana. He wants me to go with him. I don‚Äôt know what to do so I follow him. We arrive in the village and the shipper wants me to meet every interesting person. Faster I am, faster I‚Äôm in my home so let‚Äôs go! I know what you think but I never wanted to be here, it‚Äôs my father! He wanted me to leave at my grandparent‚Äôs farm‚Ä¶. I begin with the Livestock store owner, he sells animals. I meet Ann, Eve, Maria, Nina and her mother and now, I finally can come back to my house!

She asks me to keep the dog and of course I say YES! But I thought it was a love proposal‚Ä¶. I can‚Äôt believe myself, I have in front of me one of the most beautiful goddess I ever encounted! She asks me a name and I think I reply : ‚ÄúDo you want to be my girl?‚Äù but I think just one word comes out‚Ä¶ She says me it‚Äôs a good name and leave my farm. At this point, my motivation blew up at 100%! I must to upgrade my house and buy a blue feather to marry her. I need 42 stumps and 5000G to upgrade my house and 1000G to buy the blue feather. The faster way to have it is to cost fishes in the mountain. For one week, I cost most fishes as I can and cut all stumps I need every day.

Ultimately, however, the movie does not really have too much going for it in the entertainment/audience response department, and the movie runs into issues such as the category not beating the game. I'm rejecting this movie for these reasons.
