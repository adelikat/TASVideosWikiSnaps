Guilty Gear: The Missing Link is the first game in the series, and true to its name it is in fact missing Link, much unlike Soulcalibur 2 for the GameCube. Other things it's missing include many iconic characters from later in the series, any sense of game balance, and the code that would have allowed Axl to charge moves.

I actually finished this run about a month and a half ago at time of submission. I originally didn't plan on submitting it at all, wanting to instead research further improvements and submit an even faster version, but with my spare time decreasing I found myself growing less and less interested in research and development, so I figured it was best to just submit as-is.

Every character has a hidden dizzy meter that rises when they're hit, with stronger moves adding more dizziness. When this internal number goes above that character's dizzy threshold (specifically above and not equal), they have a chance to be put into dizzy status every time they're hit. That chance, in theory, isn't 100% due to each character also having an internal "Luck" value that takes away from the chance of being dizzied... In practice, though, the chance is 100%.

	"Congratulations, this is the most dynamic fight in the run. Not pausing would cause Ky to charge and instant block every attack, so the quick pause was necessary to be able to land something. Since this is one of the last three fights, the CPU needs to be in dizzy status for the IK to connect. Chipp's fastest method is 5H over and over, with each hit raising the CPU's dizzy meter by 3. Ky has a dizzy threshold of 30, so 10 5Hs are needed to reach it, then the initial IK hit brings him over 30 to put him directly into dizzy status. Between hits, I only dash when I absolutely need to as each dash loses a frame.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"This might sound a bit inefficient at first. Since dizzy status is caused when the threshold is *surpassed* and not *reached*, reaching that threshold on one attack then surpassing it on the next makes it seem like I'm wasting a move. In a way, this is correct, but not in that particular way, and not for Chipp at all. The maximum "damage" I can do to an opponent's dizzy meter while maintaining the ability to charge cancel is 3 per hit. The IK starter itself deals 2 damage, which means the opponent can be one below their threshold when hit by it and still get knocked dizzy. In Ky's case, his threshold of 30 should mean I only have to damage him to 29. This would still be 9 5Hs in a row, but the 10th would be replaced with a faster, 2-damage hit. For pretty much any other character, this would save a couple frames of startup on the last pre-IK hit.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"From my testing, however, Chipp doesn't even have a 2-damage hit outside of his IK starter. All of his normals, save for two, deal 1 dizzy damage. 5H and 2H both deal 3 damage. 5H actually has a slower startup than 2H, but 2H is a

	" and IKs don't work on launched opponents even if the starter lands. With Ky's 30 threshold evenly divisible by 3, this means that Chipp is forced to reach that threshold exactly before surpassing it.

]div
[div class=p 
	"Earlier, I mentioned Ky having one last objective advantage left, and this is the fight in which it would take place. Ky's stage 9 is against Sol, who only has a dizzy threshold of 24, meaning Ky doesn't have to infinite as long in order to put Sol into dizzy status. This would save around 50 frames: ~45 coming from two less loops, and another small handful since Ky actually has attacks that deal 2 dizzy damage, meaning he can use a move with a faster startup (2S comes to mind) to get Sol to 23 so the IK starter can push him over.

[div class=p 
	"Secret bonus Chipp tech, though: Since Chipp's IK requires him to dash through the opponent first, he can actually start his IK 4 frames faster than normal if the opponent is against the wall. This only saves time on these last three fights, however, and it would be negated if a way was found to IK them all instantly.

	"Going off of the main improvement point of RNG manipulation, there is actually a definitive fastest character that isn't Chipp or Ky. I made a point of comparing IK and prefight animations when comparing Ky and Chipp, as they have the fastest of their respective categories, and one character just so happens to have both a very fast IK and a very fast prefight animation.

Kliff's prefight animation is 119 frames, 30 frames slower than Chipp's but still 59 frames faster than Ky's. If my math is right, those two factors come out to be a 364 frame objective advantage over Chipp and a 153 frame advantage on Ky (since Ky isn't losing time on opponents with slower prefights). I haven't checked Kliff's loading times for reasons that will become apparent in the next paragraph, but I seriously doubt they'd overtake either one of those advantages.

	"Clearly, there has to be a downside to Kliff given that I've dropped this reveal and haven't just submitted a faster Kliff% run. There is, and it is a downside that completely kills the possibility of an improvement with current knowledge: He can't dash. Dashing is incredibly vital to this run both for closing distance and maintaining the infinites used in the final three stages, so it's guaranteed that Kliff would lose his entire advantage as long as those fights remain how they are in this run. The gameplay difference between Chipp and Ky is nebulous and hard to really quantify either way, but it's very clear with Kliff. The lack of dash just kills him.
