	"This is a Tetris playaround. In this TAS, I aim to create the most impressive/difficult pattern I could think of. It might look random at times, but every block is carefully planned and manipulated. The planning of this TAS might have been more work than the actual TASing itself. Shortly before I die, the 18th line of the pattern is completed.
