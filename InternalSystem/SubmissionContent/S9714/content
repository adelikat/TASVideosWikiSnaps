	"One of the cool inclusions in this game is the level editor. Once you've beaten any (non-tutorial) level in challenge mode, you can use that level as a template to create your own. The level geometry and the background remain the same, but you can put your own objects in, including a functional Starite exclusive to the level editor. Once you've put in a Starite, you can play the level from the level editor or from a separate menu called "Extra Levels". You can also send levels to friends and strangers using NFC or Wi-Fi (back when DS online servers were maintained).

I found that you can use it to get credit for beating a level that you didn't have access to on that save file, although this wasn't a useful application as it requires a secondary save file that's already beaten that level. It also doesn't unlock the world itself; once you exit the vanilla level, it puts you in the last level select you used in challenge mode. However, I noticed that it let me keep the ollars I had earned from playing the custom level, even though the game would normally clear it after leaving Extra Levels. I also found that the par multiplier is the same as the vanilla level, so you can farm your custom level for the same value, or even more if you set the par to 9 (the highest it ever goes in-game besides A10-11).

	", you can beat one level in a world in order to edit it using the level editor. You can set the par to 9 to get the maximum possible value out of a level in this world (in this case, 2180 as opposed to 1586 that we got from A3-2), and then head over to the extra levels mode to beat the level as many times as needed to rack up 25000 ollars, all without getting the pesky hint or merit screen every time. The game would normally revert any ollars you got this way, but by using a teleporter/time machine to go to one of its levels, and then retrying the level, it places you back in the original level that your custom level was based on, and keeps your money. From here you have to beat the original level one more time in order for it to fully save your money, and then you are free to buy anything you want with it.
