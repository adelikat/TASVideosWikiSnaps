	"First I visit options to change game mode from "5 bikes, passwords allowed" into "10 bikes, no passwords". It saves time between levels by skipping password screens.
	$LF

	"Before each level, the bike statistics can be modified according to circumstances. Too fast bike is hard to control in narrow tunnels and too powerful brakes easily turn the bike upside down. Anyway, I went with maximum stats... for everything... for every level.
	$LF

[p 
	"The game has 25 levels + 5 bonus levels. The goal of each level is to reach the goal. The goal of each bonus level is to perform a jump over various objects.
	$LF
	"Four of the bonus levels are identical. I failed to do anything entertaining there, so I just went with fast completion. I even copy-pasted the input for the bonus levels. Sorry about that.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The final bonus level is a jump over a canyon. I ended input early, so it takes some time for the game to end, but at least it looks a bit different than all the other bonus levels. Hopefully the next player manages to pull off something more interesting there.
	$LF

[p 
	"Health does not refill between levels, but going fast requires taking damage, so the brown repair bags need to be collected, most of which lay directly on the route. My health management went nicely, I guess. At least I was able to die about half-way through the game just while touching a checkpoint in the middle of a level to refill all health with little time lost. Also, I have very little health left when the game ends, which would be expected for a well-planned run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Individual level times are not recorded by the game and they would make little sense in a full TAS anyway, because health management is a global issue. For any full-game run it is necessary to either waste time to collect health or use death. It is hard to tell whether collecting more repair bags would be faster than dying. I went with my intuition and used the death sequence.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The movements are very hard to optimize, because tiny changes make huge difference on how the bike behaves. Due to the chaotic nature of the bouncing bike, I recorded most of the run in 25-100% emulation speed, just trying to keep the bike speed to the max with random input variations (and mostly succeeding flawlessly!), then frame-advancing through the hard spots (mostly not succeeding flawlessly). I hope somebody polishes the run in the future. One second per level would make a 30-second difference! Also, optimizing score screens with lower digits would save time, as dunnius pointed out.

This is impossible to do consistently in real-time. The rest of the level requires some precise jumps over obstacles, but nothing too hard.
