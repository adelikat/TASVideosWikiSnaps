	"First, I want to say something. I'm sorry to submit my run so early. Maybe I should submit it after Heidman's submission published. But I've said that I'll finish my TAS today or tomorrow. So I submit it now. Please forgive me that.

	"From my submission list, you will see that my first submission is this game - Super C. I do 1P that time. But it failed. Due to slow speed and no entertainment. I've said that I'll redo this game's movie. But I didn't do it all the time. Because I don't know which type to do with this game. When Heidman submitted his pacifist run, I think I have found a good type record of this game. So I download and watch it. I find lots of improvements. So I couldn't wait to redo it. Now, I've finished it and publish it!

	"This submission beats his 1264 frames. About 20.07 seconds. Because of better randomness control, better weapon choice, and better boss fighting.

	"I control randomness to decrease the number of enemies. To reduct lags.

	"I control randomness to control enemies' walk direction.

	"Use F to fight boss. Saves lots of time.
