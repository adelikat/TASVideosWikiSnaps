	"From my submission list, you will see that my first submission is this game - Super C. I do 1P that time. But it failed. Due to slow speed and no entertainment. I've said that I'll redo this game's movie. But I didn't do it all the time. Because I don't know which type to do with this game. When Heidman submitted his pacifist run, I think I have found a good type record of this game. So I download and watch it. I find lots of improvements. So I couldn't wait to redo it. Now, I've finished it and publish it!
