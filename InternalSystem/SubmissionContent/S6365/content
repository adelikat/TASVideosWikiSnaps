	"Oh boy, this was way more work than I bargained for.  When I first started this TAS, I was blissfully unaware that someone by the name of DES had already made a TAS significantly faster than Dooty's record here on TASVideos.  I had intended to take advantage of RAM Watch to tighten up all the levels, find faster routes using the 2-1 jumps that were relatively new at the time of Dooty's TAS, and have better RNG by manipulating it more deliberately.

	"Instead... I ended up being the one playing catch-up, trying to compete with a TAS with nearly 400,000 rerecords that had tightened the movement even more than me and also did tricks I didn't know existed!  It was a humbling experience to be sure, and I'm grateful that I was able to obtain the input file from DES so I could improve on it.  This is also the reason DES is listed as a co-author... without their input, the TAS would not be anywhere near as good.  Thanks!
