	"Bonk’s Revenge is the 2nd game in the Bonk series.  Bonk was the Mario and Sonic to the TurboGrapx-16 (or PC Engine), with 3 different games released and one spin off.  Bonk can spin in the air to hover and can damage enemies with his head, and can eat meat to become insane bonk.

	"EZGames69: After watching the published TAS a bunch, I noticed some very small mistakes here and there and thought that it could be improved.  After working hard on this game, me and Memory managed to save a total of 4261 frames, about 1:11.  Not sure how much that is when removing emulation differences though.
	$LF
	"This game involves preserving as much speed as possible from the meat powers, which increases bonk’s speed when eaten (even more if he is invincible).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Memory: I joined the project after EZGames69 finished his second iteration of the TAS. I had finished with PCE Bonk's Adventure at that point (waiting to get a response on something before I submit) and noticed some things that could be potentially improved and ended up TASing yet another Bonk game. That doesn't mean I'm going to get tricked into TASing anymore, I want a break from this series for now. (I'll do the rest of my comments later)

[p 
	"Normally your speed would have a value of 386, but if you have any meat upgrade it increases to 512, and if you’re invincible, it goes to 640.  When you’re invincible, you can preserve that same speed after invincibility wears out by jumping in the air and continue to spin.  However you also can let go of the directional pad which will allow you to preserve that speed without having to consistently spin.
	$LF
	"Meat power-ups eventually wear out, so after a few seconds you’ll drop a level.  And for some reason when you drop down to normal bonk, there’s a few frames where his speed gets faster before going back to 386, when this happens, you can jump as soon as that speed is at the max and do the same thing when invincibility runs out.

	"First level involves having the shortest distance to climb up waterfalls.  On the waterfalls on the left, you can walk up a bit before having to jump, this makes your climbing time much shorter.  You then have to spin on red flowers to make them yellow, yellow flowers bounce you upwards.
	$LF

	$LF
	"For the minibosses in some stages, I may look like I’m missing the trigger to the next stage, but you actually finish the stage when bonk touches the very edge of the screen, I can manipulate Bonk’s position to instantly hit the edge once the mini boss is defeated.

[p 
	"Memory: If you are at 320 speed in crab form and you jump, you can reach up to 572 speed. However, normally the game will push you down to 320 speed the frame after. There are two ways to maintain this speed however. If you let go of the horizontal direction on the dpad the frame you hit 572, you will instead drop down to 556 speed instead. Holding right again will allow you to go back to 572 and rinse and repeat. The other way involves abusing landing mechanics. When you land on the ground, your speed is temporarily frozen. Therefore I intentionally land on the ground right when my speed hits 572 to have it stay at that value for a few extra frames. I then swim up off the platform and then land back on it when it hits 572 again and rinse and repeat.

	"I discovered on the boss here that it is optimal to end these fights at a y-height of 99 because that will place Bonk at a height of 70 after his jump, which is as close to the top of the screen as you can get. Unfortunately, I discovered this after the previous bosses were already completed so this was not taken advantage of there.
