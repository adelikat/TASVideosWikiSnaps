After working hard on this game, me and Memory managed to save a total of 4261 frames, about 1:11.  Not sure how much that is when removing emulation differences though.

I had finished with PCE Bonk's Adventure at that point (waiting to get a response on something before I submit) and noticed some things that could be potentially improved and ended up TASing yet another Bonk game. That doesn't mean I'm going to get tricked into TASing anymore, I want a break from this series for now. (I'll do the rest of my comments later)

When you’re invincible, you can preserve that same speed after invincibility wears out by jumping in the air and continue to spin.  However you also can let go of the directional pad which will allow you to preserve that speed without having to consistently spin.
	$LF
	"Meat power-ups eventually wear out, so after a few seconds you’ll drop a level.  And for some reason when you drop down to normal bonk, there’s a few frames where his speed gets faster before going back to 386, when this happens, you can jump as soon as that speed is at the max and do the same thing when invincibility runs out.

There are two ways to maintain this speed however. If you let go of the horizontal direction on the dpad the frame you hit 572, you will instead drop down to 556 speed instead. Holding right again will allow you to go back to 572 and rinse and repeat. The other way involves abusing landing mechanics. When you land on the ground, your speed is temporarily frozen. Therefore I intentionally land on the ground right when my speed hits 572 to have it stay at that value for a few extra frames. I then swim up off the platform and then land back on it when it hits 572 again and rinse and repeat.
