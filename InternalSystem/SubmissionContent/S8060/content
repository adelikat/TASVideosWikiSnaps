This is mainly due to improvements noted in his submission notes over the years, alongside other optimizations found by community members and myself. Certain sections of the run use keylie's input as a base, thus he's fully deserving of co-authorship credit.

	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"When remapping the confirm button to any other button (X, B, etc.), it's possible to bypass a few cutscene and battle triggers by pressing a direction and confirm for a frame, releasing, etc. until you're past the trigger. This is used to skip the first fight in Truce Canyon a few times, a battle in the Cathedral, among other places.

	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"It's not normally possible to de-equip characters, as the game throws a buzzer when trying to do so. However, it's possible to trick the menu by doing multiple inputs on a single frame (Down+L or Up+R), bypassing the check by using equippable items in different slots. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"De-equipping armor and helms has very useful properties. Each piece of gear de-equipped increased Magic Attack by 10 and increases Shadow, Ice, and Lightning defense by about 80%. This is used to speed up quite a few fights, although it comes with extreme risk whenever dealing with enemies who are strong physically or in Fire magic.

	" Fadeout glitch
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"Transitioning to a different map has a small fadeout animation before it properly completes, which can be moved to arbitrary locations in a map by opening the main menu or swap menu. This is used to bypass many fights and cutscenes, and is also necessary for Save Anywhere.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Note for the Guardian fight skip, the fadeout only works if the menu button is not assigned to X, as the game spawns enemies normally when that is pressed.

[h4 id=SaveAnywhere 
	" Save Anywhere
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"When doing the fadeout glitch on a save point, you're warped out before the game has an opportunity to unset the save flag, allowing you to save anywhere in an interior map until entering one that has a save point present. This is a core trick to skip quite a few bosses and cutscenes.
	$LF
]div
[h4 id=EndOfTimeSaveAnywhere 
	" End of Time Save Anywhere
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"A variant of Save Anywhere, interacting with the HP/MP bucket at a specific time after closing Gaspar's text/storing a warp choicer text allows you to regain control by swapping party members as the warp sequence begins, allowing you to do Save Anywhere in many more locations. This is used to setup skipping Zombor and Forest Maze.
	$LF
]div
[h4 id=LavosShellSkip 
	" Lavos Shell Skip
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"This skip is similar to End of Time Save Anywhere, only using two warp choicers for Tyranno Fortress and Bangor Dome when interacting with the 1999AD bucket. These two buckets are necessary to delay the transfer for long enough to reach the corner of End of Time.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Once there, opening and closing the menu transfers your map coordinates into the 1999AD map, and if your map position is roughly (8,8) it automatically teleports you into the shell and skips the associated battles. This is one of the biggest skips in the run, saving about 20 minutes. 
	$LF
]div
[h4 id=ElixerGlitch 
	" Elixer glitch
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"When killed and re-raised at a specific time (done in this run with the Green Dream accessory), if the entire party is dead the game gets very confused and temporarily still considers everyone to be dead until the enemy takes another turn. In this state, single-use items such as Elixers automatically cancel without displaying a cursor, but still maintains it within the game's memory.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The cursor can then be glitched out via attacking or using a tech to select an opponent instead of a party member. Since Elixers fully restore HP, if it's used on an enemy with more then 16,384 HP, their health will overflow to 0 due to reaching the max value of 32,768. Inner Lavos and Lavos Core both have more then that amount of HP, and so they're immediately killed with two consecutive elixer glitches. This saves roughly an hour in any% from not needing to prepare for Lavos via gear/items.

[h4 id=RngManipulation 
	" RNG Manipulation
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"Battle RNG tends to 'snap' to specific values when a battle initiates, and critical hits are determined by what the value was before the snap on a rough table. This means that critical hits will always happen after a specific amount of attacks rather then being manipulable on a frame-by-frame basis.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Somewhat granular RNG manipulation is possible in-battle, but it can be slow since it often means taking extra actions.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The RNG also increments every frame when on the file select menu, allowing for critical hits to be manipulated more easily and 'snap' values to be accessed more easily. In this run, resets are used to manipulate RNG for later sections, with only one (right before Magus) done as not part of a different trick.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"NPC RNG runs on a 60 frame cycle, which can be manipulated by just entering rooms at earlier/later points. This is done to manipulate a fight in the Factory, the beetles in the Reptite Lair, and where Retinite spawns in the Sunken Desert.

]div
[h4 id=AtbManipulation 
	" ATB Manipulation
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"Opening and closing the tech/item menus in battle or delaying attacks allows for some control over enemy and party ATB bar increment rates. This is used extensively in the more complicated fights (Masamune, Magus, Black Tyrano, Retinite) for RNG manipulation and to avoid enemy turns, most notably to skip Magus's second Dark Matter and to stop Masamune from attacking.
