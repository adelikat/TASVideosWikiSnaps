Not-Rarity, however, has a bad case of ADD.  Hoping to get rid of some of this excess energy, not-Cheerilee has her help the other unicorns in setting up for the Rainbow Celebration.  This doesn't help, and her ADD addled (ADDled?) brain gets her into trouble.

Ordinarily she has the ability to send another pony to go help others with their chores, but she miraculously becomes responsible and helps them herself.

While some people claimed to have voted "no" due to ponies, it seems to me that a majority of yes votes were only for ponies. The general feedback related to game play was miserable. We here at TASvideos are not your friends, nor do we make magic. This leads to an incompatibility between ponies and TASes. Thus, I must reject due to this incompatibility.... Ok, actually game choice.

It suffers enough in terms of not looking much like a TAS, this would help.  Therefore, setting this back to rejected.  However, a more optimized version of this may be Vault eligible.
