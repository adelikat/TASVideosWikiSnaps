	"This movie is faster because (1) I discovered a new way to deal with Green Tentacle, (2) the designated brick-pusher kid (Jeff) is captured by Ed in a much more efficient way, (3) I use the main kid (Dave) to open the water valve instead of using the front-door kid (Razor), (4) I use two kids on the same screen more often, and (5) I corrected minor lagging and other gameplay errors.

[p 
	"The most important element of the route is that I'm able to bypass Purple Tentacle because of a glitch. Therefore, most of the movie is dedicated to acquiring three essential items: (1) the glowing key, which allows access to the inner lab, (2) the card key, which allows access to the Meteor's room, and (3) the yellow key, which allows the kid to start the car (which blasts the Meteor into outer space).

When I select a character, it takes many frames before it registers. Additionally, I have to move the cursor as far left as possible (for the next screen) after I click on Start. Therefore, my plan was to get the maximum possible 
	[em

	"GT isn't like the other residents of the house. Ed, Edna, and Purple Tentacle have 'capture' programming. Green Tentacle has 'blockade' programming. Therefore, switching kids doesn't 'freeze' GT like it does with the others. If you do get by him, the blockade programming eventually kicks in (with the message 'oomph') and drags the kid back. But, if the player selects 'New Kid' while the kid is walking, the kid can walk all the way to the top of the stairs (but not to the next room). Then I do the kid switching trick, and now the kid can go into the next room before the 'oomph' appears.

I thought that it was impossible to finish the game in time. I was right. But what I didn't know is that when a kid reaches the inner lab, the water valve timer is disabled. Therefore, I save quite a few seconds by having Dave turn it on now and never turn it off. Unfortunately, this means that whenever I'm inside the house, the klaxon (alarm sound) is going off. It's somewhat annoying, and it creates more (avoidable) opportunities for lag. But it's definitely worth the time that it saves.
