	". In testing routes for this TAS, I replicated the sequence of moves made by the four 64-0 games on Twin Galaxies but taking the absolute minimum time to select the next move. Since I am a 
	[em 
		"terrible
	]em
	" Othello player and could never win a game 64-0 myself, I also used the Othello computer program WZebra to play a whole bunch of games against the Atari 2600 and see if it could win 64-0.

	"The WZebra settings I initially used for testing included a search depth of 24 moves + last 26 perfect, play human and computer-style openings, no opening book or midgame randomness, and use a 256MB position table. I ran games with these settings until I started to get duplicate games. By the time that happened, I got 
	[em 
		"no
	]em
	" games that resulted in a 64-0 win. None. At that point, I progressively increased the opening book and midgame randomness until I got a couple games that ended 64-0. I then trimmed these games down to spend the minimum time taking a turn.

	"For all the valid Twin Galaxies and WZebra routes found, I also looked at the last couple of moves manually to see if there were any obvious move order changes that could reduce the number of checkers flipped, the number of cursor movements, or just end input earlier to make sure they were all as fast as they could be before comparing with each other.

By delaying when you place your checker, the computer may place theirs in a different place on the next turn, provided it thinks more than one move are about equal. This was used in some places to replicate the moves played in the Twin Galaxies and WZebra games for TASing purposes.

		"one of the Twin Galaxies runs
	]a
	" by ZilchSR and not one of the computer games. So congrats to him for putting most of that route together! I changed the last nine moves so the long row of six checkers on the edge would be the last checkers flipped—great for ending input early. I then realized that ZilchSR's game starts with a checker being placed on c4 which is four cursor units away from the starting point. If we assume a 180-degree rotation of the board, that checker would be placed at f5, three cursor units from the starting place. So I redid the entire game rotated 180 degrees to get out one less cursor move; but I got worse luck so it only ended up saving 3 frames. I then realized I could flip the already rotated board on the upperleft-lowerright diagonal axis so the first checker could be placed at e6 which is still three cursor units from the start. After redoing the entire game again with this board transformation, I got much better luck and saved an additional 9 frames.
