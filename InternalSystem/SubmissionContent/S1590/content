	"Youkai Douchuuki is originally an arcade game, known as "Shadowland" in the US. The game has a lot of religious influences, such as lots of praying, the last level being in heaven, the fact that you can summon your own soul to fight for you, etc. The game is pretty weird as you'll find out when watching this run.

	"The first part of the run is focuses on getting enough money to do the praying and buying the necessary items. I improved the money collecting part on a few fronts:
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		"There is a dice game in the beginning of level 1, where you win money if you bet on the right character. For some reason, Morimoto bets on the wrong character the first two times, making him loose 6000 money, not saving him any time. I bet on the right character all the time, gaining me some more money.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"I don't go out of the route on level 1 to obtain money like Morimoto does, gaining several seconds.

[ul 
	[li 
		"Of course, movements in general are now a lot more precise, because I have frame advance and Memory Watcher.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Praying has been improved a lot. When you pray, you have to press A and/or B to fill up the praying gauge. You have a timer counting down from 50, and if it reaches 0 you have failed with the prayer. While Morimoto has usually has 3 timeunits left after praying, I end my prayings with 42 units left. I gained about 20 seconds or so on the praying scenes.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Boss fights are faster. I found the Memory address for boss health, which was invaluable for killing bosses as fast as possible. I use the soul warrior on the bosses because he deals twice as much damage as the boy.
