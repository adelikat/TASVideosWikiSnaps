	"About the Hack:
	$LF
	"Sonic Classic Heroes is a ROM hack for the Sega Mega Drive that is the result of a collaboration between flamewing and ColinC10, combining their respective hacks Sonic 2 Heroes and Sonic 1 and 2. It therefore is a single ROM that offers the entire campaigns of Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2, either alone or together; and enables the player to play as many characters such as Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles. The hack is named due to the ability to control a team of characters, which is reminiscent of the more recent 3D game Sonic Heroes.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"The hack is built on Sonic 2’s engine, which has been enhanced by both flamewing and ColinC10 to have new features. These include: multiple gameplay elements from Sonic 3 & Knuckles, such as element shields and character-specific abilities; the ability to save progress, scores, etc. to SRAM (something rarely implemented in Sonic 2, with the other notable example being Esrael’s Sonic 2 Delta); various bug-fixes and improvements to the mechanics of the original games; and many more features, both implemented and planned.

	": First off, the hack is acceptable for publication on the site. It look to me like many of the mechanics were changed, which opens the possibility for different routes even if the levels are unchanged. We have dropped the requirement that romhacks must be complete or abandoned, so that is not a consideration in this case.

	"I do have some feedback on the run. As the main draw of the hack is playing as teams like in Sonic Heroes, I loved have loved to see a lot more examples of teamwork. I am not convinced the team mechanic can't be used to provide unexpected strategies and routes. Towards the beginning, there seems to be an abundance of Knuckles running through the level solo. This is a shame, since we alread have

	"That said I'm accepting this as a fastest completion. I'm interested in seeing future developments of this run. If any run of a later version of the hack with comparable gameplay is made, it will obsolete this one.
