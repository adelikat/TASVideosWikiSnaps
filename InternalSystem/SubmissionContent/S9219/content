	"The aim of the TAS was to beat the game as fast as possible without passcodes, leading to the "Best Ending". We save the required number of lemmings in each level, but do not go out of the way to save any more, leading to lemmings dying to save time. We used the NTSC-U 1.1 version as this is the fastest version due to haveing less lag.

		" Destroying steel through various means, often overwriting its trigger area with a blocker.

[div class=p 
	"A downside to this game is that it has a large amount of lag whenever many lemmings are on screen. To reduce lag, we often have to scroll the screen away from lemmings and tool use, so key moments often happen just off screen.

	"As pointed out by the author, sometimes the camera needs to be focused away from the action to reduce the number of lag frames. This is unfortunately a necessary evil, as it would be nice to see what's going on at those times. I hope somebody could come up with a camhack to be able to see the entire level throughout the solution.
