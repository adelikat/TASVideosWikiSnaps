	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Donkey Kong Jr|href=/239G)
	" in 1980s. There isn't really anything too unique about this version of the game. The only thing noteworthy about this run is that I waited a few frames on the title screen to manipulate the movement of the very first enemy in the very first stage...

	": I think this is acceptable. The last level looked improvable but I couldn't actually figure out a better strategy, so the optimization is good for now. Maybe better RNG is possible, but we'll leave that for future generations. The game loops again after the last level, but the only difference I could perceive is that Mario spawns enemies a little faster with each loop. Since the game has a scene that we could call an "ending" (RIP Mario) and all unique content is showcased, it meets our criteria for game completion. Accepting.
