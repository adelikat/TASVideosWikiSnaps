	"The MSX2 Vampire Killer was released in Japan, Europe and Brazil one month after the NES/Famicom Castlevania. While the general outline and many elements are similar, the gameplay has a more nonlinear thing to it. In every stage, you have to collect a white key to open the door to the next. In addition, there is a plethora of other items to be found in chests, candles and walls. This is an improvement of 30 seconds over the old run, thanks to new strategies, shortcuts and general optimization.

Once again, I'd like to thank Quibus and Vampier for their ongoing support and everyone on the IRC channel. With that in mind, I hope you enjoy watching the run and the new shortcuts I found that, hopefully, break up a rather slow game. if you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer!

Now for the most part, it looks like you're controlling the game instead of being subject to it. The time improvement is half of what I hoped for, but that's still pretty good. Accepting as improvement to existing run. May the next run of this game find another 30 seconds.
