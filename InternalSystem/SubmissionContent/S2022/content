	"This is a completely new run which aims for the absolutely lowest realtime, aims to fight no bosses and it also finishes with the absolutely lowest possible number of items, 6. The run in general has been made possible by Kejardon, who discovered both the early tourian break in (though not as early as in this run) and the Motherbrain skip. You can read about his discovery in http://forum.metroid2002.com/index.php/topic,6016.0.html this thread, he has a big explanation on page 2, so go and read it. Entering Tourian without the speedbooster nor enough ammo for a CF was discovered by hero of the day, the mockball has a very big "boomerang" effect when turning around and then immediately turning back again  which made him think that it was possible to use in order to get Samus lodged far enough into the door for the skip to work, and it evidently did. Note that any weird actions before entering a door, or entering a door in a seemingly suboptimal way is done to reduce door lag.

	"The run is completed in 00:12:35 ingame and in 22:01 in realtime (79271 frames). And you might want to fast forward the X-ray climbing when going in to tourian, it is about 3,5-4 minutes long.
