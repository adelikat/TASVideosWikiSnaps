	"The Mysterious Murasame Castle is a fds made by Nintendo. It looks very similar to Zelda made by Nintendo. The background music of the game sounds great. Even Mario Maker 2 has special effects with the protagonist and background music appearing at the same time.

	"Hello it's me ! This TAS improves the previous work 319F (about 5.3 seconds), which mainly depends on the following points:
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		"(1) In the game, every time before entering the next scene, there will be a trigger point. The advantage of triggering this point in advance is that the game will read the next scene in advance, which can reduce the time of scene switching.

	[li 
		"(2) Any weapon action (sword swing, weapon throw) will pause Takamaru's movement for 1 frame. Mothrayas has put forward this one before.

[ul 
	[li 
		"(3) There is also a moving hidden monster in the game, We need to control it to move to a better position, so that the protagonist can avoid detour.
		$LF

[ul 
	[li 
		"(4) Some scenes don't need to kill the enemies in the way. First, it takes too long to switch scenes. Second, killing monsters will prolong the time of switching scenes by 1-2F.

		"(5) The route of taking props is different, which reduces the time of detour.
