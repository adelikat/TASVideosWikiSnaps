	"First of all, about the password glitch usage - it is, as with practically any password glitch, a grey area issue. The behavior in this specific case is that the password sets certain values in memory, but then rejects the password anyway. This means that the run still directly makes use of the password's benefits to save time and make the game easier (by skipping one boss battle and allowing X to obtain the Z-Saber without defeating Vile). This violates the principle that the password rule was made for, using a password's effects to lower difficulty and skip challenges. As such, I'm disallowing usage of this password glitch, for this category and any other speed category of this game.

	"However, another important reason I'm rejecting this submission is because of poor emulation. PSXjin is a deprecated emulator, and pending non-acceptance, precisely because it emulates PSX games poorly. Its poor emulation manifests itself in this game as well, by not playing any music tracks in-game (outside of FMV scenes) and by freezing the game near the end part of the game ending. Historically a few exceptions have been made for this, but that was because of lack of an alternative. Since then, though, we got BizHawk with PSX support, which doesn't have the aforementioned emulation issues with this game, and therefore should be the emulator of choice for TASing this game. Rejecting due to poor emulation where a better alternative is available.
