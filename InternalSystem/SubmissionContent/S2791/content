[pre 
	"  1. 27"13 (because of starting from 0 km/h and double bump on opponent)

	$LF
	"  3. 24"88 (one reason for it is that i got far into the lap,that's why 2nd   lap is 24"89 and this one is 24"88)

	"The World Record on this track is 2'06"96.So there is a difference of 0"29 to this Tool-Assisted-Speedrun.Some of you might think it's not much,but in this Game 0"29 secs are a lot.

	"In order to make the TAS fast i used a new technique on boosts.
	$LF
	"A boost gives you more speed (from 562 km/h down to 486km/h for a while)
	$LF
	"with this technique i short the time of the boost where it has the speed of 530km/h to 486 km/h.Following to that i can use the part of a boost from 562 km/h to 430km/h more often during on boost.
