	"First is the landspeeder/spaceship part. Here you drive around in a landspeeder (a car really) earching for your lost friends. This is the beginning of the game and here you can find and save R2-D2, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Han Solo.

	"Second is the platform part. You can run in this game which is good. On the bad side the controls are a bit slippery and your gun is pretty slow.

	"Third is the "inside-spaceships" part. Here you are in a first-person view avoiding asteroids and/or shooting tie-fighters.

	"Ok, some comments about the run. The first part of the game is pretty big. The idea is that you should rescue your friends and collect shields for the next level where you should avoid asteroids. Well, Luke is apparently evil because I didn't save any of my friends, I didn't have time for it ;P, neither did I collect any shields. I did, however pick up the first gun (it's possible to just turn around in the cave and

	"run out). It allows me to fire more rapidly and even though I don't fire that much it's really handy in the few times I have to use it.

	"Hmm, there is not much else to add. I think it's pretty optimized. In some places I take damage to save time, but I try to avoid this because it screws up the speed. If I were to take damage I'll most likely will be pushed backwards. Therefore I slow down briefly at some places to be able to keep the speed. First example of this is where I take damage from Bobba Fett.

	"Hmm. About the first-person-view parts of the game. I didn't really know what to do here, to make it more interesting to watch. So basically I just shot down everything that needs to be shot down and then proceed. In this part it's impossible to fire just one shot.. In case you wonder.

[div class=p 
	"The last stage is a flying stage. I don't have much to add here.. I can't really speed it up and there is not much room fancy moves. I could have stopped the movie earlier but I figured it was better to stop it when my missiles reach the core of the Death Star.
