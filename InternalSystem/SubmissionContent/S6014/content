	"Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt is a fast paced platformer for the NES. Kidnappers have imprisoned Pugsley's family members in their own spooky home. You are tasked with rescuing Gomez, Granny, Wednesday, and Fester before moving on to rescue Morticia. Strangely the SNES Pugsley game is entirely different and this game is largely similar to the SNES Addams Family game (though that game features Gomez as the main character).

	"Most of the run is a straight forward platformer, but there are a few tricks that are worth describing:
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		" Bouncing off of enemies: if you wish you can hold A to get a higher bounce
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Speed adjustments: You can reduce speed without entirely slowing down by hitting the opposite directon for 2 or 3 frames and then leaving a lank frame. This is useful in some situations where very slight adjustments to speed are required.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Chain climbing: You can jump off of the chain as long as you aren't near the bottom. Climbing is 2 pixles per frame, but jumping starts out as 4. The most efficient way to climb was to jump until the vertical movement is reduced to 3 pixels and regrab.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Ceiling clip: When Pugsley is under warter you can mash A at 20 Hz and he will slowly move into the ceiling above. Once you let go the game will eject you upwards, this is used to get through the underground quickly. A youtube video of this from Piero Piemontese is how this trick came to my attention.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Slope jumping: In the underground you can use a small jump to jump down through a sloped platform. It turns out that solid platforms are still solid underneath so you only go down a tile, but this is pretty useful for platforms that aren't solid underneath.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Avoiding damage: Since you lose the speed shoes when you take damage this run avoids damage in order to keep the higher speed.
