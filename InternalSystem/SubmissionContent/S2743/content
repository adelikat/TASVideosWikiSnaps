	"This run lands in on 6:08.74, which is approximately 59 seconds faster than my last 0%, 45 seconds slower than Lord Tom's any%, and beats the old any% by almost 20 seconds. On a technical notice, I use the U-ROM because actual battles are faster in the american version of this game, since Rygar spends fewer seconds in air, and you have to jump to hit Ligar so yeah. I admit losing 10 seconds on the river crossing, but I regain that on Ligar. Also, in the U-ROM, jumping is faster than walking, while in the E-ROM, it isn't (bouncing on enemies is faster though).

	"So, the basic idea is that the boss rooms in Rygar seem to be linked together. 2 years back, I managed to reach 3 of the bosses from Eruga's Chamber, but I'm only interested in getting to Lapis to grind for TONE at the spawning rolling enemies. Just like Lord Tom, I'm fighting off 4 at a time, making for 28 in TONE per set of enemies. Each 8th TONE gives you plus one Damage. And Damage, you will need. Ligar, the motherfucker, has 4096 in HP. No kidding. So I set up this awesome Excel-sheet for seeing how long it was to my advantage to grind for TONE, so this is how it ended. I have to stop and pick up the items the enemies drop, or there won't be 4 enemies spawning the next time I grind. Also, I have to take damage from the rollers, or else the sun flower boss wouldn't have been able to kill me in one hit.

	"I hope you can bear with me for these a-little-more-than-6-minutes of total brokeness, as it destroys the designer's ambition of the RPG-element in the game. However, I can see and understand if you think this is boring as hell. After all, it's just the same as Lord Tom's any%, except, slower.
