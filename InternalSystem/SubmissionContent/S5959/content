	"CC has only 4 inputs: left, right, jump, and shoot. Jumps have a fixed duration unless you collide with the ceiling (which stops vertical and horiontal momentum) or wall (only stops horizontal momentum). Shooting launches a rocket that accelerates horiontally until it collides with a wall or enemy. Only one projectile can be onscreen at a time, and the explosion from your previous projectile counts toward this if it hits a wall. The upshot of this is that the explosion graphic deals damage like a regular shot.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Each level includes an air pump, which causes instant death if you shoot it. This is a minor routing concern at most, but pretty entertaining in a casual playthrough.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Power-ups to collect include ammo for your rocket pistol, temporary gravity reversal, a temporary super-powered meteor gun with unlimited ammo, a mushroom that grants invincibility, and (in one level) a time stopping tool that causes enemies to freeze and become harmless. There are optional treasures that increase your score but otherwise have no effect.
	$LF
]p

	"There are currently no known methods of RNG manipulation, but there are cheat codes (again, not used in this run) for extra ammo, invincibility, and at-will gravity reversal.

	"As an early DOS platformer, CC relies primarily on solid execution with minimal frills. Each level generally includes at least one damage boost to avoid triggering a message window about earning bonus points for perfect completion of a level, though plenty of levels have sections where damage boosts also inherently speed up the run.

[p 
	"The falling rocks are RNG; I was able to get different patterns by doing stages in a different order, but all attempts to manipulate the pattern by delaying entry or changing inputs before entering the level didn't change the pattern, and modifying level order loses more time than it would save. The jump physics at the very end of gravity reversal pause for a frame while inverting your character and resetting your momentum.

[p 
	"This level is entirely in reverse gravity. I elected to take early damage boosts with fixed locations because the slime enemies are easy to hit mid-jump when required. 2 frames were used to collect the extra ammunition in the upper right of the map to avoid running out in a later level.

[p 
	"Snakes leave a puddle of harmful goo when killed, so you save the most time by damage boosting through them. Gravity reversal has a huge 13-second time waste which I spend moonwalking. Arguably damage boosting on the alternating platforms may save time over damage boosting through the lasers at the beginning of the room depending on movement seeds.

	"Low Gravity - This level introduces recoil from firing your weapon, causing you to pause and move back a frame. Speeding through the ice block labyrinth is a hollow victory because you spend a lot of time waiting for the hovering platform. Moonwalk for solace.

	"The only gravity reversal to really justify its full duration. The inverted jumps by the falling DANGER sign were extremely fun. I made a few attempts to avoid the overhead crossing, but the two robots cause a ton of damage, and jumping over the 4 spikes requires a damage boost, so it didn't work out with this seed. If you only watch one room this run, this is the best.
