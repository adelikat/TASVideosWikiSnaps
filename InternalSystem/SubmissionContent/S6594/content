	"I improved the original run by FractalFusion by 7 seconds with a new route through the bosses. However, due to how poorly emulated timing was in the old run, this run looks significantly longer. I also don't start with control scheme switched,  as I felt this was closer to a clean startup state even though extreme mode is still unlocked from a verification movie. this costs around 30 frames.

This spider was one of the hardest points in the run to get working, taking many failed hours of attempts and reroutes. I also changed the refight order to get good RNG, which is an additional time save over the published run.

	"This was probably the most difficult TAS I have worked on since Double Dragon. RNG was absolutely brutal for the entire run. The only reason I finished this run at all was because of the huge time sink it had become and I didn't want it all to go to waste. If I knew how much of a struggle this was going to be going in I would have done something else. At least it's timed properly and has correct emulation now.
