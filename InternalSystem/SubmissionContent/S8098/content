		" The largest improvement over the RTA is using a Petrify strat on Ren & Tlatchga instead of Suicide. Ren & Tlatchga have a 3% chance of being petrified, resulting in instant death. The base chance of success with the Petrify skill at level 10 is 60%. The game rounds down, so there is ultimately a 1% chance of petrification (or 2% if the skill is boosted). I managed to find a sequence of RNG values that reduces the Ren & Tlatchga fight to 2 turns.
