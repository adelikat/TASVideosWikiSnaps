	"It's been nearly two years since ISM and Mister posted their revolutionary run. The discovery of a (relatively) new glitch means that we can save 48 frames just in the first level. We only started this run due to this bug, but then we discovered other minor improvements along the way. :)

	"The maximum amount of sprites that can be on screen at once is 12. Let's call these #00 - #11. #10 and #11 are reserved for sprites that dropped out of the reserve box, and sprites that come out of blocks (except Yoshi).

	"The goal tape is special in that, unlike other sprites, it will replace other sprites if there are no slots for it to go into. So, in Yoshi's Island 2, we make berries into sprites by eat-cancelling, filling all of the sprite slots available. So when the shell comes on screen, the goal will replace it.

	"Using "Item Swap" or "Item Change" trick, PangaeaPanga saved 48 frames here. This trick was originally discovered by ISM, however I managed to find a way to make it work in this level using 6/5. TheFinalBoss726 then found a way to do it with 49 hop.

	"When entering this level, we gain a frame. But this level was awful to us, really. First of all, we lose a frame before going into the Layer 3 stomper room. For some reason, only by delaying entry to this room by a frame could we avoid a lot of lag after Iggy fadeout. We still have no idea how this makes sense. Then, despite getting the same amount of lag on Iggy, we lose 3 frames after Iggy. We guess this is due to some frame rule, again. Before going into Donut Plains 1, we lost a total of 3 frames.

	"We end input early. This is not so much an improvement (we don't consider it as such) as a stylistic choice, in our opinion. We feel it's better to be consistent, as many other movies on the site use clever ways to end input early. If the majority think that this shouldn't be the case, then we will edit the smv.
