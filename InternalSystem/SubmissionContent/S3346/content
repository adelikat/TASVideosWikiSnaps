For some reason, only by delaying entry to this room by a frame could we avoid a lot of lag after Iggy fadeout. We still have no idea how this makes sense. Then, despite getting the same amount of lag on Iggy, we lose 3 frames after Iggy. We guess this is due to some frame rule, again. Before going into Donut Plains 1, we lost a total of 3 frames.
