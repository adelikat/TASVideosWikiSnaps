	"Just a reminder that a lot of people dislike this game due to the physics, the graphics (I call it GFX), and certain parts of the whole story being cut off.

	"After I kept reviewing all the recent runs I submitted, I noticed that they're quick.  However, majority of them would have flaws.  I took care of majority of my flaws (including unnecessary small stops and punches that would slow the game down) and cleaned up more than I could dirty up.  I saved 384 frames (6.4 seconds) off my third submission, making me able to settle at 6'53.
