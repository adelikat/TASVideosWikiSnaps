	": Hello SonicFan53 and welcome to TASVideos. We do not allow single level runs that do not actually finish the game, as stated 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=here|href=/MovieRules#MovieMustBeComplete)
	". Additionally, we demand more effort than what you have provided here. There is already a published movie of SMS Sonic the Hedgehog 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=here|href=/3904M)
	". This movie is up to site standards, and it will serve as a good reference point showing you which areas you are currently lacking in. Because of these reasons, this movie has to be rejected, but I am looking forward to future TAS endeavors!
