	"Nuts & Milk is a platform game deriving influences from a number of famous Nintendo games, including Mario Bros. (green and red fireballs), Donkey Kong Jr. (spring platforms, jumping from ladder to ladder and fruits) and Wrecking Crew (barrels). And as Kirby shows us, nothing can go wrong when you start with pink blobs.

	"Gameplaywise, it is a simple game. The goal in every stage is to confiscate all the delicious fruits from the wrong-color blobs (they're of different color than you and your girlfriend after all) after which you can enter your girlfriend's house and have cake. In the bonus stages, you don't need to confiscate any fruits, but I'm sure the girlfriend would appreciate still it very much, despite apparently being homeless that time.
