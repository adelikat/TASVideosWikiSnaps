	"Here's an improvement of Gremlins 2. Even though the last movie seemed to be good, I now know it really wasn't. Yeah, sorry about that. I found out it's quite easy to collect two crystal balls in the very first level without wasting a single frame. So obviously, I had to redo the Gremlins 2 run.

	"I managed to squeeze off a few frames in most of the levels. The biggest improvements are most likely stage 3-1, and the last boss, who is killed unbelievable 480 frames faster. That's 8 seconds of improvement right there. The other levels add up to 576 frames (10 seconds) of improvement. So all in all, it's about 17 seconds faster.

	"I bought the "p" weapon upgrade in stage 2-2 in this version, because I thought it might enable me to kill the first boss slightly faster. It turns out it doesn't do ANY more damage, so he is killed in the exact same amount of time.
