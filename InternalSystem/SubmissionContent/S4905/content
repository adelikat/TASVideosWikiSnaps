Specifically, the second to last alien right before the transporter was just awful. I spent hours trying to find ways to to get past him faster, but to no avail. The aliens and drones in this chapter all start firing their lasers based almost entirely on your x position. As long as they're on the screen and facing your general direction they will fire if you even hint at going near them, and their weapons stay out for a long time.

At the beginning you have to wait for the water level to drop before moving on. It is possible to get past all of the water before it rises, but doing so costs about a 1/3 of your health. As a result, you have to go back and rescue the egg before you touch the candle or else its health will run out and you'll lose. By not sacrificing any health in the beginning I'm able to complete the whole level and take a much shorter route back to the egg.

If I keep pushing it to the edge so that it dodges the stalactite, then it will move to far ahead of me at the very end. I would have to sacrifice several seconds to retrieve it. I also abuse two programming glitches in a row on the bottom platform with the ?dragon. The first is that I get hit by the fireball while sliding off the edge which lets me recover instantly from being hit. The second is a bit stranger. If you're pushing a character and you slow down and change direction, then the NPC is still considered connected to you for the frame that you turn around. If you also happen to start pushing another object on that same frame, then the NPC will be dragged along with you regardless of the direction you're facing. This was faster than pushing the barrel and then going back to retrieve the egg.

I slowed down on the rooftop right before dropping the bear down the elevator shaft because there's a pole at that spot that will hurl you backwards if you run into it too hard. No time lost, though, since you need to wait for the elevator to move back up, anyways.

If Eek steps onto the platform the instant it leaves, he starts to fall for a frame but immediately resumes standing. As a result, the box is now facing forward and walking away from me, but it's still stuck to me as if it were facing me. It's rather hard to tell the difference from front or back on the box, but the direction the feet are facing can prove it. Another trick used in this level (and this one is actually useful) is that I get squished by the 10 ton weight while sliding off the edge which immediately recovers me from the sliding animation. Finally, you manage to guide the gift box all the way to the orphanage, but what's inside is actually a little present for you. Enjoy!
