While we don't have the boots right now, we can get a little speed by using slopes that set X's speeds from a value of 2, to 3 and 4 respectively (depending on the steepness of the slopes).  This speed can be preserved if you jump in the air, and is why when we go UP slopes we jump backwards for one frame.  It also weirdly enough makes X jump higher than on flat ground which is strange.

[div class=p 
	"Also once we get the boots, you'll notice we do some backwards wall kicks.  This can only be done if X is doing a wall kick on the right side of the screen, but basically if you do a L+R input on the right frame, the game will get confused which way X is facing and do a wall kick in the air, this is useful when jumping up walls to get instant movement to the right.

A wall lemon shot very low to the ground is fired to get maximum charge and Sigma lands on it for the final hit.

I wanna thank both warmCabin and FractalFusion for joining this project and the work they did.  I did make some rookie mistakes throughout this run that I'm sure many in the MMX TASing scene may have spotted, but I will know what to do in the future in case I ever decide to do another TAS like this.

While there's some early bosses that could've been done faster that would require having to wrangle the RNG to implement that there and everything after, which from experience I can say is a bit too much of a reasonable ask to fix for not a lot of time save.
