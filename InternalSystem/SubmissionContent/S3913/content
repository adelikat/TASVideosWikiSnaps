		"gave me nightmares

	" was a fun little project that I started late January in hopes of submitting it on Halloween. But then I realized that I already have another horror game for that holiday, so I submitted on April First. Why? Because I'm evil and therefore will not spoil the ending for you guys.

	"The ability to 
	[del 
		"run
	]del
	" walk fast is not available until you trigger the 3rd message box, so right after I turn, I move straight ahead to do so ASAP. For some unknown reason, this stage lags very badly when you walk against obstacles. Btw, there's a NES-like segment at the beginning which I skipped because it is time waste.

	"You might have noticed that I moved the camera down during a specific room. It's to reduce lag. Don't ask how it does so, it just does. Also, the 2nd last room here lags like a boss unless you tap on certain parts of the screen. How the heck am I'm supposed to figure that out without blind luck is beyond me. But this is nothing compared to a puzzle (which I skipped) before the hospital level. Anyway, the last room has a set period of time before it forces me to open my

	"This section starts off with a creepy garden filled with statues of past victims who failed to beat this game within a week. Immediately after, you'll notice that this stage is a lagfest; despite moving at the same speed as before, it appears I'm walking since the lag is horrendous. There's nothing much to say about this stage; it's just walking and walking and more walking. Boring as hell, next stage. Oh, and the ghost in the last train cabin actually exists, but it can't kill you, even if you use cheats to bring it next to you.

	"Remember when I mentioned there's a puzzle before this section? Well, it was about finding the IP address for the sender of the game. Since it was never mentioned anywhere before, there's no way anyone could've figured it out unless they were lucky. But at least it's skippable. A room later on this stage requires doing something that defies common sense, but for now, let's talk about the stage. Here you'll encounter 6 ghosts, also known as "Regrets", which you cannot kill and will trigger the gameover screen if touched. 4 of them will kill you, and 2 of them is just there to make you piss yourself.

[p 
	"The 1st Regret doesn't chase after you; it simply moves down the hallway. If you try to walk past it, you'll get caught and die. But if you cheat and changed your position to the start of the hall, the ghost will ignore you and continue walking down the hall until it reaches the end and spins around in circles. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The 2nd Regret chases you as soon as you past a certain point in the hall. You must get it to go after you before you can trot back to the previous room and proceed with the story. Now you might be thinking, what happens if you decide to go back to the hall instead of picking up your NTS? Well, the renevant will appear at the far right hand side of the hall, and slowly walk towards you. Like the previous entinity, trying to walk past it is suicidal.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The two Regrets encountered in the caged rooms is just a cheap scare tactic to make you piss your pants. The one from above cannot, and will not hurt you. Even if you use cheats to bring it to ground level, it'll just walk through you as if nothing. The one in the cage disappears into coordinates 0,0,0 after a while; which in this case, as soon as I open the door.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This. This part with the Regret on the bed just stumps me. You're supposed to move forward 1 step, immediately turn around and go back to the previous room. But then what do you find? The undying horror is now in front of you, slowly inching towards you. So what do you do? Go back to the room with the bed of course! How the heck is anyone supposed to find that out without looking it up or luck? Btw, if you think you can simply ignore it and walk to the other side, it'll say the door's locked. Oh, and moving backwards and turning like I did here is faster than just turning.

	"The girl from the previous chapter returns! Strangely enough, this is the only part where you're forced to

	" run; the rest of the game you can simply walk 
	[del 
		"at a snail's pace
	]del
	" past everything like it's no big deal. Yes, apparently, your ex is the only thing scary enough to make you run. Btw, you're given 240 frames, or exactly 4 seconds very room before she spawns and chases you down. The timer starts at the last frame of lag from loading.

	"Right after the 2nd corner, you'll see the first ghost of this chapter! It won't chase you until you go past it a bit, where it'll then teleport infront of the escalator. Why not just have 2 ghosts in this room? That's because normally, you're supposed to lure it away by running in a loop, and to do that you have to use both paths of the floor. But since this is a TAS, that never happens as you can take advantage of the slight delay the undead one makes before it chases you to skip all that crap. Oh, as a bonus, if you check the memory for it's position after you're on the escalator, you'll see that even though it chases you up; it disappears once you reach the second floor.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The 2nd floor is similar to the previous floor; a ghost appears near the beginning (right before the 2nd turn) and teleports near the end to give you a heart attack. I've tried really hard to bend this floor to my will, but the creepy crawler just moves too fast as soon as it spots you. So I instead decided to mess around during the wait in typical TAS fashion. Btw, as soon as it spots you, you're screwed as it'll relentlessly chase after you until you're caught; it'll never disappear and can even go though walls! 
	$LF

[p 
	"The third floor's demons never chase after you; one just stands there while the other in the shop walks in a set path. Of course, they can still kill you, but with common sense, it's pretty much impossible for that to happen. Btw, you know the store I went in, with the name "Mandarake"? Turns out it is actually a real life chain of stores that sell anime/manga stuff. Who knew?
