My timing either starts when the Stage text goes off-screen or when the screen is fully visible. My timing ends either when the screen is totally black or the Stage end appears, with the exception of the very last stage where I end on last input. Positive numbers are frames saved and negative numbers are frames lost.

This however allows me to totally change the route for this room. I go bottom first and then activate the crouch collision box to get into the 1 tile high tunnel. Then I jump through the block partially and grapple so I land inside it and slide off that block so I can trigger crouch collision again. Then I grapple to the tunnel leading to the key, skipping slow ledge climb animations. Afterwards, I get into the tunnel to the right and immediately slide back out in order to trigger crouch collision a third time in order to get into the tunnel in a standing state to allow me to clip through the ceiling/floor and go straight to the door.

Then I move to the right and trigger the screen clearing move on a specific frame after jumping. The screen clearing move prevents the boss from activating its fire dragon attack and the clone attack. With my positioning and timing, the boss gets hit once, teleports to the left and starts to perform a swing. This provides just enough time to finish him off without having to sit through a flame dragon, saving a whopping 10 seconds.

I said it in the thread, but the tightening of the movement makes nearly every room flow so much faster over both the published run and the improvement WIP, even if you're only a frame or two faster.

	". Needless to say, yeah, excellent work on both entertainment and tech. We've already spoken about the known improvements, and after watching the run a few times over, I see fairly limited usage for them in the earlier stages of the run, definitely not enough to warrant a rejection or a sternly worded "But what if... Redo months of work immediately?" We both know you're coming back someday. You know this because you're you, and I know this because you told me, and also I'm you.
