	"Early in the magazine's life, games were either really good or barely interesting. I never called any of these games terrible...because they were all that I had, mostly. I didn't play this game a lot, but I do believe I typed it in on the Vic-20 first, since my Commodore 64 was coming later that year for Christmas.

Well, I determined a lot and re-did the entire TAS to save 2362 frames! This was accomplished over a 2 months, since I wasn't that eager to get back to this game.
