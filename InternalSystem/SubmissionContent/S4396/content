	"So, this game is pretty simple as it is. You run around the linear world and save the princess. After saving her once, she offers you a new quest.

	"Pretty basic, I run through the level, taking the first pipe I see to save time and hit the flag pole, avoiding 1, 3 or 6 as these add time.

	" World 1-2

]h4
[p 
	"Here it gets pretty different from the average gamer. I start the level and go to the right, avoid as many deaths as I can, finishing at the exit pipe, but instead of entering, I perform a 1-frame trick where I go through the block and run through it, save roughly a second or so, and entering the pipe to world 4.

[h4 
	" World 4-1
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"I run about the level, only performing a few wall-jumps to get out of some holes and pillars, again, avoiding 1-3-6.

	"Now, when I get control over Mario, I rush him over to the vine to the warp zone, but instead I push the screen slightly to the right. I go back to the vine and warp to the other side, I take the first pipe I see as a shortcut, and I head to world 8.

	"Now here, it's different than 8-1 to 3. I go through, first pipe, pretty easy. Second pipe, you walk forward and back. 3rd, you hit a secret block and go down the pipe. Pretty simple for the rest.

		" Wall-jump: Sometimes when Mario hits a wall, he goes deep enough and is at the 16:1 pixel and I can jump off of it.

		" Pipe clip: At 1-2 on Quest A, I pass through a pipe, I do this by jumping while walking at the perfect frame for 1 frame and walk the other way. Hopefully I make it through and run.

	[li 
		" Vine Clip: If you have the vine go off screen for a number of pixels and touch it, you're warped to the other side of the screen. (Seen at 4-2)

]ul
[p 
	"I also never hit 1, 3 and 6 at the flag as I lose time, as XX1 is 1 fire work, XX3 is 3 Fireworks, and XX6 is, you guessed it, 8 Fireworks. Not really, it's 6.

	"In the future of my runs, I'll try to learn a flagpole skip, and minimize time at some places.

	": Hello P0rtalFTW, and welcome to TASVideos. I'm rejecting your run, because it is not up to the standards of this site. Comparing the first half of this run with 
	(__wikiLink|/1715M|1715M)
	", you lose a bit over 1500 frames (over 25 seconds). Your final time for the first playthrough seems to be about 5:23, which is quite a bit slower than the TAS record, or even the real time record. An especially noticable time sink is 4-2, as you spend a lot of time waiting, as well as use a slow strategy to go towards the Warp Zone in general. Other time losses include bumping against walls, or performing unnecessary walljumps, both of which ruin Mario's forward momentum. The second playthrough is not much better, if not even worse than the first.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"To run both quests also not a good category choice in general, as there is not a great difference between the two quests; the second quest has faster moving enemies and Buzzy Beetles in place of Goombas, but in the end it should have hardly any difference in Mario's progress compared to the first run. You end up with two nearly identically-looking runs.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Also, the movie doesn't end when it is supposed to - instead of ending when landing at the 8-4 ax for the second time, you kept on going again, going halfway through 1-1 and ending the movie when a Koopa Troopa hits Mario. What is the point of this?
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Lastly, the way the game is played, as well as the rerecord count, makes me wonder how much, if any, tool-assistance is used. You hit a few tricks, including several wall jumps, but the run otherwise doesn't give an impression of tool-assistance being used. In any case, please read the 
	(__wikiLink|/Guidelines|Guidelines)
	" to see the standard we require for movie submissions to this site.
