	" is an old Genesis RPG that drew me in the first time I played it.  Despite it's technical flaws, it had a certain attraction to its story that I hadn't seen before in other games of its genre.  It wasn't a quest about defeating a dragon, or answering a call to save the world; no, it was about a young adventurer remembering his sweetheart, Traysia.  Even the title theme felt like someone composing a love song, instead of a grand beck and call to adventure.  Nonetheless, it was that uniqueness that inspired me to eventually complete the game, and make this tool-assisted speedrun, as well.

	"Traysia is a traditional turn-based RPG, broken up into five chapters which chronicle the adventures of Roy and his companions Banegie, Magellan, and (eventually) Bellenue.  Battles are random encounter-based, which operate on a constant inner timer.  No matter one's position or movement pattern on the overworld or dungeon, you will always get a random encounter after the same amount of time has passed.  I have not discovered an obvious way to bypass this, save for entering towns or other exits on the map.  Regardless, the encounter rate is refreshingly low and battles are easily fled from.

	"Magic is near useless.  Spells often fail in combat, and rarely do any significant damage.  Some aren't correctly programed, either.  The most powerful and expensive spell, Illi Own, doesn't even register in your inventory when bought!  Additionally, there are numerous chests scattered around the later chapters which supposedly give you a 'Book of Magic', which also doesn't appear to register.  Either way, inputting physical attacks are far faster than casting spells.

]div
[div class=p 
	"Armor in this game consists of certain accessories called 'Sticks' which can supplement everyone's defense.  It was clearly intended to only allow one these accessories to be equipped at a time.  However, a programming oversight allows for multiple types of these items to be "stacked" on top of each other, giving potential to raise your stats high enough to completely nullify damage.  I use this trick almost exclusively with Bellenue, as she quickly becomes the only character used to attack with during boss battles.

To make matters even more challenging, Roy must also be aggressively protected.  Like other main character protagonists, once Roy dies it's GAME OVER.  The strategy began with moving Magellan just above Floyd in order to draw in The Master.  Roy was positioned below Bellenue, and then right beside her, in order to escape The Master's attack priority.  A slightly amusing slap-boxing match ensues, with The Master being on the losing end, followed by the traitorous Floyd (who flees, afterward).

In order, my route consisted of: Iyuve Kingdom > Lyude Kingdom > Selve Village > Mountain Hideout > Event blackout to Iyuve > Master Swordsman's Hut > Lyude again > Iyuve again > Master Swordsman's Hut > Iyuve ONCE MORE > Northern Temple.  Not for nothing, the walking segments inspired me to get more creative and "sync" the party's walking movements, in various different ways, along with the musical score.  I strove to do this throughout the game to create more of an entertaining presentation (plus the soundtrack is amazing).  This chapter, however, is where I believe I did my best work.

Roy, of course, had to be defended at all costs.  I eventually thought of the idea of moving everyone towards the bottom-right in a kind of 'defensive triangle' position, with Bellenue baiting enemies in along the outside.  This ended up working wonderfully, as Bellenue picked them off, one-by-one, in rapid fashion.

This is good in the fact that the primitive A.I. will become "trapped" directly behind them.  However, this also gave me the added challenge of lining Bellenue along with them, while also quickly drawing in the rest of the group.  The strategies I developed here served me well for the rest of the run.  I began by sending Magellan and Banegie forward.  Magellan held off any advancement toward Roy, while Benegie allowed Bellenue to move in just behind her.  After both fell in battle, I used luck manipulation to attract the last crawler inward.

That, followed with some luck manipulation, made the winning difference in this battle.

Since I'm speedrunning through, very little of the actual story is seen; which is an interesting plot.

In the Town of Nobleman, I buy Bellenue a 'Salamander' bow and four 'Water Sticks', bringing her defense up to almost 400.  This effectively nullifies all damage for the rest of the game.

No one had enough time to program a set of stairs?  Once back in the overworld, I escape a random battle only to have the BGM cut back to the 2nd Dungeon Theme (very good theme, btw).
