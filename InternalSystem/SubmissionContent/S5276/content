	[em 
		"Final Fight
	]em
	" is an arcade beat 'em up game (loosely based on the 1984 film 
	[em 
		"Streets of Fire
	]em
	") released by Capcom in 1989.  
	[em 
		"Final Fight
	]em
	" was originally conceived as a fighting game titled 
	[em 
		"Street Fighter '89
	]em
	", a sequel to Capcom's 1987 arcade hit 
	[em 
		"Street Fighter
	]em
	".  Ultimately, it was repurposed as a beat 'em up game to challenge the hegemony of Techn≈çs Japan's 
	[em 
		"Double Dragon
	]em
	" and 
	[em 
		"Double Dragon II
	]em
	" in that genre.  Owing to its fighting game heritage, the game features large, highly detailed characters with a wide variety of attacks.  The game also features an excellent hard rock soundtrack by the masterful Yoshihiro Sakaguchi (credited as Youki Chan's Papa), particularly the rather unfortunately titled "Toilet Gang", which can be heard in Round 5 Part 3.  The names of characters are rife with references to popular culture, and the game's artwork is rife with typical Capcom meta-reference.

	" Tricks and Glitches
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Continuous Attack Sequence:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When a Hero hits an enemy with a normal attack, the Attack Sequence advances by 1.  Each successive normal attack that hits advances the Attack Sequence further.  The final attack in any Attack Sequence knocks down an enemy.  However, if an attack misses, the Attack Sequence is reset.  By intentionally missing an attack to reset the Attack Sequence before it has completed, an enemy can be forced to remain standing while being held in place by the stun effect of being hit.  This technique allows an enemy to be defeated before he is even knocked down.  This in itself is fast, but it also allows sequence breaks against Bosses (e.g. Damnd never calls for reinforcements), which further enhances the time saved.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Double Tap:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When a Hero hits an enemy, the Hit Delay Counter is set to 5 and the Hero cannot attack again until the Hit Delay Counter has expired.  Under certain circumstances, however, a Hero can make successive attacks without the Hit Delay Counter being set.  If an attack can be made that will cancel the first attack before the Hit Delay Counter is set to 5, the Attack button must be pressed 2 Frames before the Hit Delay is set to 5.  If Cody and Haggar are attacking the same enemy simultaneously, Cody can attack 8 Frames before the Hit Delay is set to 5.  This will allow both attacks to hit without waiting for the Hit Delay Counter to expire.  Furthermore, despite the fact that the enemy is hit by both attacks, the first attack is considered a miss by the Attack Sequence Counter, which resets the Attack Sequence Counter to 0.  Unfortunately, this can only be done for 2 successive attacks before the inevitable Hit Delay, hence the term "Double Tap".  The more common application of this technique is to attack twice at a spawn point before an enemy has spawned.  It can also be used against an enemy who has been knocked down just as he is standing back up.  The technique is also used during Boss battles.  It can first be used just as a Boss becomes vulnerable.  It can later be used when Cody and Haggar are both attacking the Boss, particularly when other enemies are also being hit, as this often causes Hit Delay Counter "overlap", wherein a Hero's attack will miss due to the Hit Delay effect of the other hero's attack.  In any application, this technique is quite useful throughout the TAS.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Stomach Punch Double Tap:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If Cody has begun a Stomach Punch against an enemy, but Attack is pressed again after the Stomach Punch animation has begun but before the Stomach Punch has hit the enemy, Cody will begin a Jab.  This Jab will damage the enemy on the same Frame that the Stomach Punch would have.  However, if Attack is pressed 2 Frames before the Stomach Punch has hit the enemy, Cody will begin a Jab, but both the Stomach Punch and the Jab will hit the enemy.  In certain situations, using this technique may be faster than simply canceling the Stomach Punch with a Jab.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Triple Slash:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"An enemy who has been hit by a "knock down" attack can still be damaged by another attack before the enemy has been knocked down by the "knock down" attack.  If both Heroes are using a Weapon, an enemy can be hit by both Heroes before being knocked down.  Moreover, if both Heroes are using a Weapon, it is possible under certain circumstances to hit an enemy 3 times before the enemy is knocked down.  The Heroes must be located to the left and right of the enemy.  The Heroes must be distanced from each other such that they cannot hit each other, but near enough that their weapons can collide.  Both Heroes must hit the enemy on the first Frame that the enemy becomes vulnerable.  Haggar must be the first to attack, such that his Hit Delay Counter is set to 6 when he hits the enemy.  After Haggar attacks, Cody must attack on the correct Frame to synchronize his attack with Haggar's.  The enemy takes damage simultaneously from both Heroes on the same Frame that the Weapons collide.  On the next Frame, the enemy takes damage again from Cody.  If both Heroes are using Muramasa or Masamune, the Heroes can do 90 Hit Points of damage in just 2 Frames before knocking down an enemy.
	$LF

[p 
	"Minimize Enemies:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If an enemy or container is scrolled beyond the left edge of the screen, that enemy or container is destroyed.  The current screen location must be a minimum of 337 pixels distant from the enemy or container in order for it to be destroyed.  This equates to a distance of 1 Screen X Major plus 81 Screen X Minor.  Simply Throwing an enemy to the left while standing at the left edge of the screen is not sufficient to achieve this effect, because the enemy will collide with the left edge of the screen's bounding box and be stopped.  The enemy must be located at the left edge of the bounding box, and the screen must then be scrolled, in order for the enemy to be thus destroyed.  Haggar's Body Splash is a very fast method of knocking down enemies in a small area, and can be done while using Backward Jump.  Throwing the enemy farthest to the right into all of the trailing enemies to the left works very well, but requires several additional Frames.  Manipulating enemy movement AI works well also, and does not require any additional Frames to perform.  For best results, this should be exploited after the last Ambush Point in an area has been passed.  Using this technique, the number of enemies that the Heroes must defeat is minimized.  Obviously, no points are awarded for an enemy or container destroyed in this manner.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Quick Jump:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When the Jump button is pressed, the Hero assumes a "ready" posture, and momentum is suspended for 7 Frames before the jump advances.  However, by pressing the Jump button for 1 Frame, delaying 1 Frame, and then pressing Up, Right, or Left for 1 Frame, the "ready" posture is canceled.  This can also be achieved by pressing the Jump button for 1 Frame, delaying 1 Frame, and then pressing the Attack button for 1 Frame.  Optionally, the joystick can be pressed Down on the same Frame that the Attack button is pressed to execute a Short Knee/Knee Drop/Body Splash instead.  To execute a backward Quick Jump while a Hero is facing to the right, press Left and Jump for 1 Frame, delay for 1 Frame, and then press Right for 1 Frame.  By canceling the "ready" posture, momentum is suspended for only 2 Frames before the jump advances.  Using this technique, a jump begins 5 Frames earlier than normal.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Grabless Extended Range Throw/Suplex:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Normally, a Hero must have an enemy in Grab in order to use Throw or Suplex.  However, if a Hero's next attack will be a Swipe Kick/Uppercut/Side Hammer, that Hero can use Throw or Suplex on an enemy that is not in Grab.  The Hero must be facing the enemy and the joystick must be pressed Up or Down while the Attack button is pressed.  Pressing Right or Left on the joystick while pressing the Attack button may cause the Hero to do a Swipe Kick/Uppercut/Side Hammer instead.  Furthermore, the range of a Grabless Extended Range Throw/Suplex is 127 pixels horizontally--equal to the range of Deathblow.  The vertical range of the Throw/Suplex is not altered (21 pixels).  Because no Grab is required prior to using this technique, Haggar can begin a Suplex a minimum of 22 Frames earlier than he ordinarily could.  Additionally, this technique allows a Hero to use Throw or Suplex, regardless of the Hero's Grab Cooldown Timer.  This technique can even be used against an enemy who has been hit by a "knock down" attack after the enemy has taken damage from the "knock down" attack, but before the enemy has been knocked down by it.  If Cody and Haggar use this technique simultaneously against the same enemy, Haggar will use Suplex and Cody will use Phantom Throw.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Extended Range Grab:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Normally, pressing the Attack button and the Jump button simultaneously causes the Hero to perform a Deathblow.  However, if an enemy is above or below the Hero by a few pixels, pressing the joystick in any direction and then pressing the Attack button and the Jump Button simultaneously on the next Frame causes the Hero to Grab the enemy instead.  The joystick can be pressed for just 1 Frame before the Attack and Jump buttons are pressed.  The vertical range of the Grab in this case is equal to the range of Deathblow (48 pixels).  The horizontal range of the Grab is not altered (71 pixels).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Team Grab:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This technique applies only to J, Two.P, Axl, Slash, Edi.E, Abigail, and Belger.  When a Hero uses Grab on an enemy, the Hero can attack the enemy in Grab a maximum of 3 times, at which point the Grab is canceled and the enemy is knocked down.  However, if another Hero is within Grab range and has momentum on the Frame that the third attack hits, the other Hero will instantaneously Grab the enemy.  This relay can be continued as needed.  Because the enemy is not knocked down by this, Grab attacks can continue with virtually no Frame loss, allowing for a tremendous rate of damage.  Though it is unfortunate that this technique applies only to a limited number of enemy types, it is nevertheless quite useful.  This is particularly true against Axl and Slash, considering the tendency of these enemies to block normal attacks.  More significant, however, is its usefulness against Bosses, as Grab attacks ignore their high defense.  Using this technique, the Heroes can inflict up to 192 Hit Points of damage in just 103 Frames before knocking down an enemy.  It is the ultimate power in the universe.

	""The Grab 'n Go":
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This technique applies to Guy and Cody.  Press Left for 1 Frame to Grab an enemy that is in range while facing left.  Delay for 2 Frames.  Press Jump, delay for 1 Frame, and then press Right for 1 Frame.  This technique allows a Hero to Grab an enemy and then continue Backward Jumps to the right with minimal loss of momentum.  An enemy Grabbed thus and then released is stunned for 40 Frames, and is also moved to the left as many as 52 pixels.  This is useful for destroying an enemy by scrolling the screen, to prevent the Hero from being hit by the enemy, or for AI manipulation.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Pogo Grab:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This technique applies to Guy and Cody.  If Cody or Guy have an enemy in Grab and attempt to jump, Grab is canceled and the Hero will jump.  Under certain circumstances, this is actually useful for destroying Axl or Slash.  After a Hero uses 2 Grab attacks, he can use a Quick Jump up to cancel the Grab and then resume the Grab and Grab attacks after the Hero lands.  This prevents the enemy from being knocked down and also eliminates the need to wait for the Grab Timer to expire.  Because the duration of Grab Cooldown Timer is typically less than the duration of a Jump, the Grab Cooldown Timer expires before the Hero lands.  This allows the Hero to resume Grab with minimal Frame loss.  This technique saves a minimum of 73 Frames compared to using 3 Grab attacks and then using Grab again.  This technique saves a minimum of 93 Frames compared to using 2 Grab attacks and a Throw and then using Grab again.  This technique saves between 21 and 121 Frames compared to using 2 Grab attacks and then waiting for the Grab Timer to expire before using Grab again.  The actual Frame savings in this case is based on which Grab Timer and Grab Cooldown Timer values are randomly selected.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Transition Point:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"As the Hero advances through an area, there are Transition Points at which the screen stops scrolling.  When a Transition Point has been reached, Trigger Enemies begin to spawn and move onto the screen.  Generally, all Trigger Enemies must be defeated in order for the transition to the next area to begin.  Only the Trigger Enemies need to be defeated in order to initiate the transition; all other enemies remaining in the area will simply be left behind when the transition begins.  When the last Trigger Enemy at a Transition Point has been destroyed, the Transition Timer is set to 30 and begins to decrement.  When the Transition Timer expires, the transition to the next area begins.  If the Hero reaches a Transition Point when there are too many enemies on the screen, a Trigger Enemy may fail to spawn.  If a Trigger Enemy fails to spawn (e.g. Andore at the elevator in Up Town), some enemies must be defeated to free up space in memory to allow the Trigger Enemy to spawn, or the Hero must wait for a Timeout Transition in order for the transition to begin.  At certain Transition Points, a Trigger Enemy will spawn after a set length of time, but if a different enemy is destroyed prior to the Trigger Enemy's set spawn time, the Trigger Enemy will instead spawn immediately after the different enemy is destroyed, and the Trigger Enemy will occupy memory space vacated by the different enemy.  At other Transition Points, all Trigger Enemies spawn on a set schedule and do not share memory space, regardless of any enemies that are destroyed prior to the scheduled spawn time of the Trigger Enemies.  Other Transition Points are a sort of hybrid of the first 2 types, wherein Trigger Enemies share memory space if it is available, but they spawn on a set schedule, regardless of any enemies that are destroyed prior to the scheduled spawn time of the Trigger Enemies.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Timeout Transition:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If the Hero has reached a Transition Point, the game will timeout after sufficient time has elapsed.  If the game reaches a timeout, the transition to the next area will begin, regardless of any enemies remaining on the screen.  In most cases, any enemies remaining on the screen when a timeout occurs are simply left behind, but a Timeout Transition into the elevator in Up Town causes all enemies to be defeated, and even awards points to the Hero for their destruction.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Ambush Point:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"As the Hero scrolls through an area, new enemies spawn as each new Ambush Point is reached.  If too many enemies are on the screen when an Ambush Point is reached, fewer or no new enemies will spawn at that Ambush Point.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Manipulate enemy AI:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Enemy AI is affected by the Frame on which a new Round or Segment begins, by the Frame on which an enemy spawns, and by the Hero's location on the screen.  The RNG is affected by the status of containers from a previous Round or Segment.  The RNG in turn affects the enemy AI in the new Round or Segment.  By manipulating the RNG, enemies can manipulated to act more favorably in the new Round or Segment.  The RNG can be manipulated by destroying or sparing a particular container.  The RNG is also affected by Items dropped by Containers.  This can save Frames in a situation where a Hero would otherwise have to stop to stun an enemy before advancing.  The RNG is also affected by the Heroes' total remaining Hit Points.  One useful method of AI manipulation using Hero location is to walk to the right a few steps between 2 Backward Jumps, rather than immediately jumping again on the earliest possible Frame.  This allows for AI manipulation with negligible disruption to forward progress.  The Hero may also move up or down in addition to moving to the right, allowing for even more possibilities.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	""Accelerated Decrepitude":
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When an enemy is destroyed, it flies across the screen, bounces off the ground once, lands, slides to a stop, and then despawns.  When the enemy lands from the bounce, its Slide Timer is set.  The Slide Timer either counts down from 240 to 0 in decrements of 16 per Frame if the enemy is moving to the right, or it counts up from 0 to 240 in increments of 16 per Frame if the enemy is moving to the left.  When an enemy's Slide Timer expires, its Despawn Timer is set to 60 and begins counting down to 0.  When an enemy's Despawn Timer expires, it despawns.  However, this is only a typical example.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Certain enemy types have a Despawn Timer value of only 40.  Furthermore, if such an enemy is destroyed by any attack other than a Throw, Suplex, or Pile Driver, the enemy's Despawn Timer is never set.  Under these circumstances, the enemy despawns immediately when its Slide Timer expires.  This applies to Holly Wood, Holly Wood armed with Bottle, El Gado, G.Oriber, Wong Who, Roxy, and Poison.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Using Suplex or Pile Driver to destroy an enemy causes a shorter "bounce" than any other type of attack.  Moreover, the Slide Timer counts by increments of 20 per Frame, rather than 16 per Frame.  As such, using Grabless Extended Range Suplex instead of Side Hammer to destroy an enemy causes the enemy to despawn 20 Frames earlier.  This is particularly useful against the last remaining enemy in a Segment, as it allows the transition to the next Segment to begin on an earlier Frame.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If an enemy collides with the edge of the playfield or a Container while the enemy is sliding, the slide will be canceled and the Despawn Timer will immediately be set.  As such, the nearer an enemy is to an obstacle when the enemy is destroyed, the earlier it will despawn.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Maximum Treasure:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The contents of many containers are randomly determined.  The range of possible contents in a container is determined by the specific container.  The RNG is modified by the Screen X Minor location and the presence of enemies on the screen.  Interestingly, the RNG is also modified by the input state of the Hero on the Frame after said Hero destroys the container.  By entering input on this Frame, the contents of the container can be modified just before the contents spawn.  Only the input state of the Hero that destroyed the container modifies the RNG for said container.  The input must be entered after the Hero's score has advanced for the attack or for destroying the container, whichever occurs first.  Other inputs can be held prior to this Frame, but only input which had not been held prior to this Frame will modify the RNG.  Any input except for the Attack button will work.  Using this technique, a container will always drop an item of maximum point value (either a Gold Bar or a Diamond).  A rather bizarre Easter egg.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Container Anomalies:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When a Hero is standing on a container, he has a special status.  While a Hero is in this status, enemies can target the Hero, but they cannot attack him.  This can cause the enemy AI to behave strangely.  For example, at the end of Round 1 Segment 1, Holly Wood may not move onto the screen if his target Hero is standing on a Dustbin.  If there is a container between a Hero and an enemy that is targeting the Hero, the enemy AI may behave strangely.  If a Hero is standing on a container when a transition begins, strange things may happen.  If a Hero attempts to Backward Jump off of a container during a transition, his horizontal movement may suddenly be stopped, causing him to land on the same container he jumped off of.  If a Hero Backward Jumps off of a container during a transition and lands at a particular location (e.g. a particular distance from the Transition Point), the Hero may behave as though he has already reached the Transition Point.  This causes a Hero to continue to the next part of the transition, regardless of his location on the screen.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Quick Recovery:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When a Hero is knocked down, he will remain on the ground for 78 Frames after he has landed and come to a complete stop.  Using this technique, a Hero can recover in just 5 Frames.  Entering input while the Hero is on the ground allows the Hero to recover more quickly.  "Recovery" input can be entered only after the Hero has landed and come to a complete stop.  For maximum efficiency, input must be entered on each of the first 5 Frames that "recovery" input can be entered.  This input can alternate between pressing the Attack and Jump buttons, or between pressing a direction on the joystick and a button.  Pressing alternating directions on the joystick alone does not work.  After these 5 Frames of input have been entered, the Hero can immediately begin acting again.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Corner Clip:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If a Hero is walking right or left against a surface while also walking up or down to move around the surface, the Hero will "clip" up or down by several pixels when the corner is reached.  This allows a walking Hero to move around an obstacle slightly more quickly.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Hit Delay Counter:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"While the Hit Delay Counter value is anything other than 0, a Hero cannot move vertically or horizontally on the screen.  Input can be entered during this time, but any attack or jump animation will be paused at the first Frame of the animation and remain paused until Hit Delay Counter is 0.  The Hit Delay Counter is set to 5 when a Hero hits an enemy or container and decrements by 1 per each Frame until it reaches 0, at which point the Hero resumes movement as usual.  The Hit Delay Counter is set to 6 when a Hero is knocked down while he is standing a surface, and does not begin decrementing until the Hero attempts to attack or jump.  The Hit Delay Counter can also be reset to 0 if the Hero uses Grab on an enemy.  The Hit Delay Counter is set to 5 when a Hero is knocked down while he is jumping, and does not begin decrementing until the Hero attempts to attack or jump.  If a transition begins while the Hit Delay Counter value is anything other than 0,  it will not begin decrementing until the Hero attempts to attack or jump.  Strangely, if a Hero is using a Weapon and hits an enemy on the first Frame that the enemy becomes vulnerable, The Hit Delay Counter is set to 6 and does not begin decrementing until the Hero attempts to attack or jump.

[p 
	"Playing with Fire:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"A Hero can hit an enemy who has been hit by Flame before the enemy is knocked down by the Flame.  Using this technique, it is also possible for an enemy to be hit more than once by the same Flame, without being knocked down.  If Bottle lands on ground level, it emits 2 Flames that diverge and move to the right and left for 60 Frames.  It is possible for both of these Flames to hit an enemy, even simultaneously.

]p
[p 
	"Double Destruction:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If an enemy is destroyed by a hazard other than a Hero or by scrolling, such as Flame, points are awarded.  If a Hero destroys an enemy on the same Frame that the enemy is destroyed by the hazard, the Hero receives points for the attack, the destruction of the enemy, and for the destruction of the enemy by the hazard.  Using this technique also causes the enemy to be "launched" twice when it destroyed, causing the enemy to fly twice as far as normal, which is most amusing.  :)

[p 
	"Grabless Extended Range Suplex/Double Lariat Hybrid:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"After Haggar uses Grabless Extended Range Suplex, Double Lariat can be used as early as 16 Frames before the Suplex animation has completed.  If Haggar uses Double Lariat within these 13 Frames, all targets within range will be hit instantly, as opposed to the typical delay while Haggar must first make a full turn.  This technique damages and knocks down enemies as usual, but it scores only 20 points per hit as opposed to 400 points per hit, and it does not reduce Haggar's Hit Points if he hits a target.  Note that this applies only to the initial, instantaneous hit of the Grabless Extended Range Suplex/Double Lariat Hybrid.  Any hit after the initial hit is treated as a normal hit from Double Lariat.

Even better, if Roxy is destroyed by any attack other than a Throw, Suplex, or Pile Driver, her Despawn Timer is never set.  Under these circumstances, Roxy will despawn immediately when her Slide Timer expires.  If a Hero is within range of the spawn location when Roxy spawns, she will do a jumping attack immediately when she spawns.  Because Roxy is invincible during the first part of a jumping attack, she cannot be prevented from jumping after it has begun.  By maintaining a sufficient distance from the spawn location, Roxy will instead walk forward or backflip when she spawns.  Roxy can evade an attack by doing a backflip, during which she is briefly invulnerable.  This backflip is used as an immediate reaction to a Hero's attack.  Roxy does not always use the backflip to evade an attack, but when she enters "evade" status, she will remain in that status for several Frames, and evade any attack directed at her.  Walking toward Roxy can manipulate her "evade" status to end on an earlier Frame.  Attacking with the other Hero can also manipulate her "evade" status to end on an earlier Frame, even if the other Hero hits nothing.  Otherwise, the only option is to wait for her status to change before attacking again.  If Roxy collides with a container during a backflip, the backflip is immediately canceled, and she is placed on the ground at the Y location where the backflip collided.  If there is a container between Roxy and her target Hero, Roxy will not use backflip, and if Roxy's target Hero moves behind a container while she is using backflip, the backflip will be canceled as with a collision.

Drumcan does 30 Hit Points of damage and knocks down an enemy or Hero.  An upright Drumcan has a larger attack box than hit box.  When an enemy kicks a Drumcan to start it rolling, it remains upright and is pushed upward and left for 13 Frames before beginning to roll.  The Drumcan can damage a Hero immediately after it has been kicked.  As such, there are situations where a Drumcan can hit a Hero, but the Hero can not hit the Drumcan.  Such a situation requires that a Hero move nearer to the Drumcan to destroy it, to move farther away to avoid colliding with it, or to delay enough Frames that the Drumcan has time to begin rolling before moving forward.  This applies also to a Drumcan that begins rolling from an edge of the screen, rather than being kicked by an enemy.

More significantly, the delay also allows Axl to be destroyed a few Frames earlier, which in turn allows the transition to the next Segment to begin on an earlier Frame.

Otherwise, the Wheelchair is destroyed when Belger's Hit Points reach 450.  When Belger is knocked down, his Recovery Timer is set to 35 and his Invulnerability Timer is set to 60.  Belger cannot take action again until his Recovery Timer has expired, and he cannot be hit or Grabbed until his Invulnerability Timer has expired.  The first time Belger is Grabbed, the Grab transpires normally.  However, each time Belger is Grabbed thereafter, Belger will cancel the Grab and jump away from the Hero after 8 Frames unless a Grab attack is made, regardless of any time remaining on the Hero's Grab Timer.  This is not an issue for Cody, who can begin using Knee Strikes on the first Frame that Grab has started, but Haggar cannot begin a Headbutt in time to prevent Belger from canceling his Grab.  However, Haggar can begin a Grab Jump on the first Frame of Grab, and so he uses a Pile Driver in lieu of the normal Headbutt/Suplex combination while using Team Grab with Cody.  This combination does rather less damage than is possible with a full Team Grab Headbutt/Suplex combination, but it is still much faster than using Continuous Attack Sequence or even Triple Slash.  Haggar uses a normal, fully delayed Jump and then destroys Wheelchair with Pile Driver, thereby creating just enough of a delay for Cody to land his full Team Grab combination.  Obviously, this technique can only be used once, but it prevents the need for Belger to be hit again after the 3rd Team Grab, thereby saving a minimum of 60 Frames.  When Belger's Hit Points reach 50, he becomes impervious to Grab, and he remains at the right edge of the screen, frantically firing his crossbow.  Belger's crossbow does 33 Hit Points of damage, is allowed a maximum of 6 Arrows on the screen at a time, and is capable of firing once per each 6 Frames.
