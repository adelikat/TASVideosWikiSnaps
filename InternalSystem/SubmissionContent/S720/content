	"I completed this game without collecting any instroments! The only Item I collect is the L-1 sword and the L-1 shield. The method for beating this game seems to be well known, and am shocked that I don't see a time attack for it. Thanks to David Wonn for his well known glitches. ( http://kontek.net/davidwonn/ ). The only differences between what he features and what I did was that when warping to the level 8 in-game warp: You do not have to restart the game then, rather falling on the right hole will warp you straight to that warp! That saves a lot of time.  I also don't wait for the nightmare to go into play after I am done glitching up the final battle.  I found a way to make the game glitch somewhat the same, but made the battle between the Aghanims more difficult.  However it was faster this way! This game was hard because luck manipulation was very random it seemed. I wasn't fighting the game to create just a good path, I was fighting the game to glitch right as well. When I am fighting the Aghanims it appears that I waste time by missing the first set of balls.  This cannot be helped.

	"I took the advice of torbjrn. Thanks! I do feel like a moron though, as I probably should have known this before hand.  Like I said, I'm still new at this.  Kind of like burning your hand in fire.  You do it once and you learn forever, and hopefully you won't do it again. Furthermore I'm sorry to everyone for jumping the gun, of course I probably made myself look more like a fool then anything else...Please forgive me and this is my LAST ONE. I'm not doing this run again unless I am given a real reason to.
