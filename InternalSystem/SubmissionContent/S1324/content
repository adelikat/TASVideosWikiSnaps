This run attempts to obsolete the run by a) pushing the playaround to more extreme levels and b) shortening the length of the run significantly (which also provides more entertainment by being less repetitive).  Also, it attempts to be faster in each section than both of Diman's

This allows me to create a run where the on screen animation becomes a visual pattern resulting in the less & less importance on the game itself. The run transcends the usual gaming logic and becomes a sort of abstract art. The run becomes something unique and emphasizes the potential for TASes to truly be considered art.

	"In Morimoto's run and both of Diman's submissions, they used only 1 warp.  That is the one that result from destroying a boss quick enough.  I discovered that you can in fact warp twice by using the level 1 and level 3 warps.  This shaves almost 2 minutes from the movie, and greatly reduces the repetitiveness of the game.  To warp to level 3 from level 1 you need to destroy 4 hatches while your thousands digit of your score is even.  To warp to level 5 from level 3, you need to destroy at least 10 stone heads.  I tried using the quick boss destruction to warp yet again from lv5 to lv7 but it does not work.  (I tried variations where I do not kill the level 1 & level 3 enemies and kill the lv5 one very quickly).  Apparently only 2 warps are possible in the game.

Therefore optimal upgrades are necessary for fastest time.  Interestingly, this is where Diman loses the 10sec in his 13:25 movie.

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"1) Maximizing speed upgrades.  The irony is that max speed makes the run LONGER.  Max speed means that the ship moves at 8 pixels per frame and has no acceleration or ability to slow down.  As a result the boss fights are each about 10 frames longer due to the poor ability to aim when you are moving in 8 pixel chunks.  The fast speed of the ship is really the whole point of this run so sacrificing 30 frames is certainly OK :)

]div
[div class=p 
	"2) Having both "options" (the orange balls that echo the ships movements) extends the mini-boss fights in level 3 & 5 for 256 frames each (512 total).  Options are necessary in the designs & patterns that I create.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"In level 5, having both options minimizes lag greatly saving about 150 frames, so there is only a net loss of about 100.

	"Morimoto's movie was not just a playaround of the game but a playaround with the concept of TASing and the new tools that allowed it; kind of a "proof of concept".  It is only appropriate that it be obsoleted by a run that is also an experiment with new tools.  To create this run, I used a "macro-editor.  With this editor, I can create a series of button presses and put them together into a single command.  This allows me to push one button to initiate very complex movement patterns.  Writing my name "adelikat" for instance was a large programmed macro (well, 2 actually since there is a 256 frame limit to any one macro :P).  I simply had to find a frame to start it that didn't result in the ship being destroyed.  This feature also allows any button to be a "random" button.  This allows for a more accurate way of attempting luck manipulation in certain sections of a movie.  This feature is currently somewhat experimental and written by miau and can be found

I used cheat search, memory viewer, and memory watch to debug the game and find conditions for this bot to check as well as getting hp values for the lag-creating monsters in lv5 (a real bitch to find because the hp INCREASES instead of decreases, arg).  I of course used frame-advance, and frame counter, read-only toggling, and just about every other "tool" for FCEU.

	"This level has the infamous lag-creating 2-armed monsters in it.  Here, I attempt to destroy the ones that create lag as soon as possible to minimize lag.  Here I had to make a sacrifice in speed.  By having both "options" it extends the mini-boss section by 256 frames.  But not having them would mean defeating them much slower, increasing lag.  I estimate about 150 extra frames of lag would be caused by not getting the options.  But of course they are crucial to most of my complex ship patterns.  In addition, the length of the mini-boss fight isn't perceivable and therefore doesn't look "bad".  While lag is definitely noticeable and would make the run look more "sloppy".

	"I used the boss hp ram addresses to find the earliest frame that I can deliver damage, and to find the most efficient means of destruction.  Note that lag only occurs when two "arms" are on the screen at once, the body has no effect.  As a result I only kill the 2-armed variety as quick as possible.  Actually, I managed to destroy them so fast that the lag is hardly noticeable (only about 2-3 lag frames per enemy).  The one armed ones only need to be destroyed before then next creature appears.  I hold off a little and allow the viewer to at least see the creature before it is destroyed.  The ones with no arms are of no consequence so I simply avoid them or orbit around them.

Surprisingly, dying only costs about 100 frames, giving my a approx 150 frame net savings.  I felt the death is good because it keeps things interesting.  You remember how slow the ship was, and re-upgrading helps keep the intensity of the movie going.  There are more than enough power ups in this level to get max speed and 1 option (which I don't "turn on" until after the boss fight starts).  During the level, I play with the poor collision detection by flying through segments of the "spider-web" stuff in the level.
