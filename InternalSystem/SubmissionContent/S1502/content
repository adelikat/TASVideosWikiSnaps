	"Important Fact
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		"y/x are still pressed in this run, but only for holding items, never to increase mario's speed(except for underwater)
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"Left/right and Y/X are never pressed at the same time on land or in air.  This puts mario's maximum speed at 21, where the normal running speed is 49 and flight is 51.  However, we manage to exceed the 21 max speed on a few occasions through various techniques. 
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		"The first is by bouncing off of a Chargin' Chuck. Usually this slows you down, but since we are traveling so slow, Mario's speed increases to 32.  
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Another way is through left+right while in a cloud.  This speed ranges from 36-52 and you can sustain 52 by jumping out of the cloud.  
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"The third is while holding an item underwater.  This puts the speed at around 31 on average.  This is allowed because it is underwater, not on land or in the air, swimming is extremely slow so we figured this would be ok since it speeds water levels up and doesn't count as running.  
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"The last is from being pushed by Bowser's clown copter.  This brings your speed up to a whopping 64, which is the fastest in the game, and can also be reached by being shot out of a pipe.  It does not speed up the run in any way, but looks cool and leads to a really neat glitch, which will be discussed later.

		"Yoshi is obtained here and not later because without him many jumps in this level cannot be made and would end in a slower result.

		"Jumping off of a p-switch is used to get high enough to bounce off a koopa and have to grab the fence less. The "surviving the stompers" glitch is used in the scroller room.

	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		"Corner boosts are used, as well as walking down a slope underwater to preserve a better average speed.  Going in the pipe is around 200 frames slower, due to the fadeout that occurs from entering pipes. Items are used to go faster underwater.

[ul 
	[li 
		"Mario walks way too slow to be able to jump through stairs.  The P-switch is used to bounce off of to make it up to the high level where the boss door is. The block is thrown right before the end so it appears that mario ends the battle floating in mid-air.

[ul 
	[li 
		"Many doors had the potential to be fast so we had to do some testing. The options were door 1 and door 2 in the first set.  Yes, the scroller room(room 1) in bowser's castle was actually thought to be the fastest method.  This is because we walk so slow anyway that not having to walk to door 2 might save time. Unfortunately the screen only scrolls at ~7 speed so it ended up being slower.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"The options were door 6, door 7, and door 8 in the second set.  Too much waiting was needed in door 6 and the chuck boost from door 8 wasn't worth the walk to it, so door7 ended up being faster.  (door 5 is not possible)

		"A somewhat recently discovered glitch is used in the bowser fight for entertainment purposes.  When mario jumps into bowser's clown copter, he is pushed back at 64 speed. If you alternate between A and B every frame like what you do to "survive the stompers" mario skims across the ground similar to what he does in the stomper glitch.

	": I don't think this movie makes a good addition to the site, because it is basically SMW, but slower. It is presented as a "doesn't run" run, but presses the run button quite often, which sort of defeats the purpose and doesn't make much sense from a viewer perspective, even if it doesn't increase the speed.

	"I think we can accept runs with unexpected and interesting limitations in the future also, but speed-walk is not very unexpected, especially not on 1 April.
