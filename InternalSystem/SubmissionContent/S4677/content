	"Here we go after 5 years there is a new Super Smash Bros 64 run.
	$LF
	"I decided to make a new one because it was a pain to see the old TAS so unoptimized and i really had the motivation to start a new one, and here it is.

	"To avoid desync i recommend to playback to movie file on the "mupen64-rerecording v8" version.
	$LF
	"The video plugin i used for the encode was "Glide64'Napalm WX' release 1" it's the best plugin for Super Smash Bros 64, and removes a lot of graphic errors +  your characters bright if they get hit by an attack.  
	$LF
	"But hope you enjoy the TAS.

		" I used the Japanese rom because, Kirby's movements is in the Japanese version faster compared to the English American one, (walking, jumping, falling etc)

[ul 
	[li 
		" I took damage to avoid getting extra points, so i saved at the end one extra window + a few frames each time i found a good chance to take damage, but obviously it's not faster everywhere of course.

		" I set the timer from having 5 minutes to infinite time, to avoid getting extra points for having time left after a match + the next fight starts faster.

	"I am pretty satisfied with the end result, i saved over 30 seconds to my old TAS record from 2009 by better RNG manipulation like Yoshi Team, Fox, Kirby Team, Metal Mario, Polygons and Master Hand + more optimization, a few strategies looks similar to the old record, but small changes saved often like 20 frames, example Mario Bros match or Samus, the fights are using similar ways but through some movement changes i could manage to save time though. I'd like to post a chart with the time differences to my old TAS record, but unfortunately i lost the .m64 file over the years.

Also is this the first battle where i found a good chance for taking damage, and to reduce to get extra points

This was the best manipulation i could do.

	": Very nice run, it's so fast, you can hardly believe it. Some feedback was mixed, but in the end, it seems this is entertaining enough for its length. Accepting as an alternate fastest run for this game.
