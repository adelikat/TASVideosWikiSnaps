	(__wikiLink|displaytext=runs that forego major skips|href=/MovieRules#ForgoingMajorSkipGlitch)
	" as a standard branch. The branch is meant to be flexible depending on the game and the skips within, and in this case it didn't take long at all for me to see how much more content this run has compared to the glitched (U) run, and how different of an approach both runs take to each other in general. That, combined with the excellent execution of this run, makes it very clear to me that both runs deserve to be published alongside each other, with this run remaining branchless and the published run being re-branched to "item glitch", which I have gone ahead and done.
