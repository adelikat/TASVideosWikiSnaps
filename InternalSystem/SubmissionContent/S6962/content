		"In the 13th century, the Cathars, clerics who preached about the poverty of Christ and defended life without material aspirations, were treated as heretics by the Catholic Church and expelled out of the Languedoc region in France. One of them, called Jean Raymond, found an old church in which to hide from crusaders, not knowing that beneath its ruins lay buried an ancient evil.

		"l'Abbaye des Morts
	]em
	" is a exploration platformer game originally developed by Locomalito and Gryzor87, and released for PC in 2010 with a graphical style emulating a ZX Spectrum game. Since then, various ports have been made by various developers, including an actual ZX Spectrum port (developed by Jerri, 2014), a Mega Drive port (developed by MoonwatcherMD, 2017), and a Commodore 64 port (developed by Double Sided Games, 2019) - the latter two lacking the ZX Spectrum style, but making use of their significantly better hardware.

[ul 
	[li 
		" The main goal is to collect 12 crosses, and bringing them all to the altar at the bottom of the church. Therefore, all rooms that have a cross must be passed.
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" In the middle of the world, there is a "Wheel of Faith" which can be triggered to alter the appearance of all the crosses laying in the world. Square crosses become upright crosses, and vice versa. Upright crosses cannot be collected, but square crosses can. Initially, 8 of the crosses are square, and 4 are upright. Therefore, to minimize backtracking, the 8 square crosses must be collected first, then the Wheel of Faith must be triggered, and then the remaining 4 crosses can be collected.
				$LF
			]li
		]ul
	]li
	[li 
		" There are various levers and other mechanisms throughout the world, which must be triggered to enable access to new areas. At the start, this railroads the game a little bit, but quite quickly the world becomes quite open, leaving a lot of room for routing optimization.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Death warping along with clever triggering of checkpoint statues can be used to minimize backtracking by significant amounts. However, Jean's amount of lives is also limited, although heart objects throughout the world can be picked up to increase this amount. Naturally, a TAS pushes this to its limit, minimizing the need to go out of the way to collect heart objects while pushing Jean very close to game-over territory.
		$LF
