		"Arm Wrestling
	]em
	" is an arcade game by Nintendo, released in 1985.  It is Nintendo's final entry in the "Green-Haired Guy" trilogy, and the last arcade game designed by Nintendo.  The arcade market's loss would be the game console market's gain, however, as Shigeru Miyamoto, Koji Kondo, and company would soon revitalize the U.S. game console industry.  In an interesting twist, this same arcade cabinet design would later be repurposed as Playchoice-10 cabinets to promote Nintendo's home console games at the arcade!  As with 
	[em 
		"Punch-Out!!
	]em
	" and 
	[em 
		"Super Punch-Out!!
	]em
	", 
	[em 
		"Arm Wrestling
	]em
	" again features the familiar dual-monitor design, digitized speech, and early hardware sprite scaling.  Notably, among the digitized audio samples can be heard dialogue clips of Keye Luke's voice-over as Han from the 1973 film 
	[em 
		"Enter the Dragon
	]em
	".  The original voice samples are comical and...inscrutable.  Like its predecessors, the game also features another assortment of zany, wildly expressive opponents, including a surprise from a familiar face!  Having mastered the world of professional boxing, the Hero has decided to also conquer the high-stakes world of professional arm wrestling.  To complete the game, the Hero must win 20 rounds in order to bankrupt a crooked promoter.

	" Tricks and Glitches
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Manipulate "Ready" Timer:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Before a Round begins, the word "Ready" appears in front of the Opponent.  If the Hero attempts a Left Press before "Ready" has been cleared from the screen, the Hero incurs a Foul for a Flying Start.  The duration that "Ready" remains on the screen is random, and can be manipulated.  There are numerous possible results.  The range of variance in duration is quite large (as much as 127 Frames, depending on the Opponent).  Manipulation can be achieved by random input or by Frames of delay.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"For Round 1, manipulation input must be entered on the Frame prior to pressing the Button on "END" on the Name Entry screen.  Only input entered on this Frame will manipulate the "Ready" timer.  Joystick Up input can be entered 1 Frame earlier (Frame 101) than Right or Left input (Frame 102).  As such, pressing Up on Frame 101 is the only option for input manipulation that does not require additional Frames.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"For a Round vs. Texas Mac other than Round 1, manipulation input may be entered during or after the first Left Press input of the previous Round.  The last possible Frame of input for manipulation is the Frame immediately following the final input of the previous Round.  Only input entered during these Frames will manipulate the "Ready" timer for a Round vs. Texas Mac.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"For Round 2, manipulation input may be entered during or after the first Left Press input of the previous Round.  The last possible Frame of input for manipulation is the Frame immediately following the final input of the previous Round.  Only input entered during these Frames will manipulate the "Ready" timer for Round 2.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"For all other Rounds, manipulation input may be entered during or after the first Left Press input.  The last possible Frame of input for manipulation is the Frame immediately prior to the transition to the next Round.  This allows a much larger window for entering manipulation input.   Entering manipulation input is also simpler because it can all be entered after the Round has been completed, without needing to overlap input during the Round itself.  Only input entered during these Frames will manipulate the "Ready" timer.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Manipulate Opponent AI:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When the Hero attempts a Left Press against an Opponent, the Opponent may react in a number of different ways.  By entering random input, the Opponent can be manipulated to react in the most favorable manner.  Manipulation input may generally be entered before, during, or after the Left Press input.  Certain Opponent abilities require that manipulation input must be entered before or during the Left Press input.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Manipulate Resisted Left Press Duration:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If an Opponent resist the Hero's Left Press, the duration of the Hero's Left Press posture is random.  By entering random input, the duration of this posture can be manipulated, such that it is the shortest possible.  There are only 2 possible results, with a difference of 2 Frames.  This is useful against Kabuki 2, 3, and 4 because forcing Kabuki to resist a Left Press allows Kabuki to become vulnerable earlier than by delaying until Kabuki attacks of his own accord.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Manipulate Money Bag:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"After Round 2, the money bag can briefly become caught above the POWER meter when the promoter throws it down.  If this happens, the transition to the next Round begins 87 Frames later than it normally would.  Entering input on the appropriate Frame can prevent the money bag from becoming caught.  Allowing the money bag to fall requires 38 Frames fewer than catching it.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Comments
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"There are many phases during which time does not elapse.  This includes Hero abilities (e.g. POWER phase) as well as Opponent abilities (Frank Jr.'s "Wait!" phase).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The Icon formation with 2 Exclamation Marks, 1 Skull and Crossbones, and 2 Double Exclamation Marks requires 1 less Frame to clear than the Icon formation with 1 Exclamation Marks, 1 Skull and Crossbones, and 3 Double Exclamation Marks.
	$LF

[p 
	"Bonus decreases by 40 once per each 4 Frames.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If Left is pressed on the joystick to cancel "Tap Button" phase, but POWER is not ready, the result is a resist.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Pressing to the left requires 37 Frames for the first press, and 40 Frames for each subsequent press.  If the Opponent counterattacks with a special move, the left press can be cancelled by pressing to the right.  If the left press is cancelled thus, it requires only 21 Frames overall.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The joystick must be pressed Up in order to catch the money bag that the promoter throws down.  The window during which to press Up on the joystick is only 9 Frames in duration.  Pressing up on an earlier Frame does not allow the money bag to be caught on an earlier Frame.  The money bag is caught (or missed) on a fixed Frame.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If the Opponent counterattacks with a special move, there is no immediate damage to the Opponent.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Getting the first movement against an Opponent does 12 Hit Points of damage.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The closer the Opponent's arm is to being pinned, the less energy he has remaining.  If the Opponent's energy reaches 0, the Opponent is defeated.  If the Opponent's energy reaches 144, the Hero is defeated.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"POWER does 16-64 Hit Points of damage.  The closer the opponent's arm is to being pinned, the less damage the Hero can do.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Joystick and Button input during the game requires 2 Frames.  Delay between input can be just 1 Frame.  Note that this does not apply to input entered during the game's menus.  Pulling Mask X's mask requires only 1 Frame of pressing Up per pull.  Wiggling the joystick Right and Left in order to interrupt an Opponent's attack requires only 1 Frame of Right or Left input with 1 Frame of delay between.  Input can overlap in some cases.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"After an Opponent's Hit Points have been reduced to 0, but before his arm has been pinned, Bonus can still be gained.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If the Hero reaches the peak of his jump on the same frame that the promoter lifts the money bag, the money bag will be replaced by the body of the defeated Opponent (which the Hero and the promoter simultaneously possess) for 1 Frame.  Unfortunately, this causes the promoter to throw the money bag 1 Frame later than he normally would.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Pressing to the left during "Tap Button!" phase cancels the "Tap Button!" phase.  Pressing to the left during "Tap Button!" phase can only cancel the "Tap Button!" phase.  The Opponent loses no Hit Points, and no other result can be manipulated.

	"Memory Address 0000D070 indicates the Opponent's Hit Points.  At the start of a Round, this has a value of 95-119, depending on the Opponent.  When this value reaches 0, the Opponent is defeated.  If this value reaches 144 or higher, the Hero is defeated.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Memory Address 0000D0F5 indicates the remaining Time in seconds.  At the start of a Round, this has a value of 192.  On Hardest Difficulty, 1 second of Time expires per each 41 Frames.  On Easy Difficulty, 1 second of Time expires per each 45 Frames.   If this value reaches 132, 60 seconds have elapsed, and the Hero is defeated.  Time does not elapse during the POWER phase of the game.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Memory Address 0000D041 indicates Hero Status.  While Hero Status has a value of 0, the Hero can attempt a Press to the left.  During a Press, this has a value of 128.  After a Press has been completed, Hero Status returns to a value of 0 for 1 Frame, changes back to a value of 128 for 2 Frames, and finally returns to 0 again and remains at 0.  After a Press has been completed, the joystick can be held to the left starting 1 Frame before Hero Status returns to 0 for the 1st time.  This is the earliest possible Frame on which to begin the next Press after a previous Press has been completed.  If the next Press is not started on this Frame, the next possible Frame is 3 Frames later, when Hero Status returns to 0 for the 2nd time.

	"When Kabuki's Hit Points reach 27 or lower, he can no longer be damaged by a normal Left Press or by counterattacking Kabuki's new type of Press.  Additionally, the delay before Kabuki uses his new Press is longer, and the window during which to press Left on the joystick to counterattack is reduced from 15 Frames in duration to only 4 Frames in duration.  Counterattacking this Press while in this status will generate 2 Dollar Signs and 3 Exclamation Marks.

	"Similar to Frank Jr. 2, Kabuki enters a special status for a time after the each "Tap Button!" phase.  Though Kabuki does not counterattack while he is in this status, he is invulnerable.  As such, a delay of 44 or 45 Frames is necessary before beginning the next Press.  However, by using a Left Press while Kabuki is in this status and allowing him to resist it, the status is cancelled and a successful Left Press can begin after just 27-39 Frames.

	[a class=intlink href=/5478S 
		"in this judgment
	]a
	", this is a Vault game. It might be considered a borderline case, but it's in fact below the borderline. We can't fully rely on the votes here, because there was another submission that was competing with this one, and it had a different goal, and was submitted after this one. So some of the interested this run got was due to the novelty, and some people state that the other tun was more entertaining. But the gameplay is still quite limited. End even though the run is short, it's repeating itself after a short while. So Vault it is.
