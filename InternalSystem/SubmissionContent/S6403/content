	"Rotohex is, without a doubt, one of my favorite puzzle games of all time; I decided to see just how fast I could possibly beat it! There's definitely room for improvement, but this happens to be my first TAS, as well as the first TAS of Rotohex I have encountered online. I'm satisfied with how it came out!

		" By holding down both the 1 and 2 buttons of a Wiimote (A and B if you are using motion controls), the tiles will fall at the fastest speed possible in the game.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Using the above tactic and the white powerup which changes all the tiles of the powered-up tile to the adjacent tile's color, I am able to wipe out a "level" in mere seconds.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" While a set of tiles are in the process of changing color via the white powerup, you can rotate target colors into place so that they automatically match after the colors are changed.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" You can move the cursor twice in one frame to speed things up slightly.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Even though cursor has some cooldown after matching a hexagon, you can still move it around and position it to wherever you want.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Whenever the board was filling up and I didn't have much of the target color to work with, I used the black powerup to flush away some tiles and look for more of that particular color or the white powerup itself.

	"EDIT: I canceled this TAS. I got way too trigger-happy with recording this and I rushed it. I do have a new and much-improved one that I'm about to upload. Thanks for understanding, glad to learn the ropes around here! After all, I'm brand new. :)
