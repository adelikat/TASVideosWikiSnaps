	": Hello Qwerty. Unfortunately this movie fails to meet entertainment standards and does not qualify for Vault either. The main problem being the lack of activity going on during the Special Stages after collecting the required rings to pass and the fact that it takes up most of the movie causes it to fall apart. Also the category itself is rather arbitrary in the sense that there isn't a clear-cut way to really make it stand out from either the any% published on the site already or a movie that were to strive for 100% completion. For those reasons, I am rejecting this movie.
