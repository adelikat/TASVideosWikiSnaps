	"The bug boss behaves slightly different when there are two players. The wall is slightly further to the left, which means Wolverine can duck under the last attack. Also, the player’s temporary invulnerability after scoring a hit is longer, which means that we don’t take damage despite ending up inside it. This means we can attack sooner, and the boss fight is about 100 frames faster as a result.

	"The game runs at half framerate with two players. This is compensated by the players moving twice as long every other frame, so the action continues at the same pace. This actually means the game is MORE lag-tolerant when there are two players, since it already updates every other frame. However, the input precision is halved. For some reason, the running scene is twice as long if you are two players. Because of this, we kill off Beast.

	"The clones have 32 HP each and retaliate with regular attacks when they get hit. Psylocke and Gambit have especially long range, and can hit you even if you are behind them. After about half their health is gone, they start to turn into formations of yellow balls for special attacks, and are then invincible. For this reason the two last hits need to come in quick succession.

	"The clones also have a rather long death/explosion animation, and normally the screen scrolling isn’t unlocked until it is complete. If you scroll the dying boss far enough outside the screen however, the dying boss object is removed and the screen scrolling is unlocked directly. Only Beast and Psylocke have boss rooms wide enough for this.

	": Truth be told, I don’t really harbour many feelings for the previous version of this TAS. I don’t have nostalgia for X-Men 2 since I never played it as a kid, The TAS itself while fast wasn’t really something that was noteworthy or unique from other TASes at the time, and personally speaking I was getting rather sick of this game when we were finishing the previous TAS because of all the invisible lag that we had to deal with. So the thought of revisiting this TAS didn’t really fill me with much enthusiasm.

	"With that being said, X-Men 2 has gotten a significant amount of attention with the discovery of multiple different glitches that have cut down on a majority of these stages. Sentinel Factory 3, Fortress 1, Fortress 2 (the Pyramid level), and Phalanx 4 were especially shortened. These are levels that are usually rather lengthy, so to be able to save lots of time on them is certainly a nice treat. This along with the sea of new runners coming in is what finally motivated me to get working on a new TAS. One message to Truncated later, and the dream team was back together for one more romp!

	"I think I’m actually really happy with how this turned out. TAStudio was definitely a neat little piece of software that drastically cut down on the time needed for optimization. Aside from that, the movie has been optimized to a level that I never thought was even possible. The new skips have drastically helped with the overall pacing of the run with the Elevator really being the only “long” level in the run (It’s an autoscroller, so I guess it makes sense.).

	"This run is not only a testament to how much TAS tools have progressed over the years but also the fact that a community of runners now surround the game, some of who have helped advance this run to exciting new heights. We are both very happy with the end product and hope you enjoy our work!
