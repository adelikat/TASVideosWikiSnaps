	"This is a nice and simple top-down platformer. For more info about the game and its speed strats I recommend reading the previous submission 
	(__wikiLink|2333S)
	"; my run really doesn't contain any new tricks. The main improvements come from better damageboosts and a different strat in stage 4-2.
