	"Well, here's my timeattack for Beavis and Butt-Head, finally. This is actually the fourth version I've done, and compared to the third version, the total time was cut by over five seconds (pretty good, considering I thought the third version was good enough to submit). It gets the good ending but not the best ending, since that requires more time.

	"Beavis and Butt-Head have just bought two tickets for the Gwar concert on Saturday, when suddenly their tickets are grabbed and eaten by a dog, vomited back up, and then shredded into eight pieces by a lawnmower. What bad luck! It is your task to track down the eight missing ticket pieces by guiding the boys through some not-so-bright activities around town (Note: Before you go getting any ideas, please read the disclaimer in the opening screens ;) ).

	"This game has a non-linear setup: you can go to any of the seven levels any time you'd like. The catch is that some levels can only be completed with items found in other levels, and the game gives you very little direction on where to go and what to do. Adding to the trouble is that each character can only hold four items at a time, so you have to plan ahead if you want to avoid needless backtracking.

	"I discovered a couple of tricks while playing that came in handy:
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-No-Laggin' Item Snaggin': When you pick an item up, there is an 11-frame delay before you are allowed to move again. However, you can break this delay by jumping. Furthermore, you can break the jump by quickly switching between the characters. When done fast enough, this cuts down the time needed to grab an item by a few frames.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-Switch & A Miss: Although you only control one character at a time, both are always on-screen. Whichever one you aren't controlling follows at a short distance and is completely invincible. When the character you're controlling is about to get hit, you can switch to the other, let the hit pass through, and then quickly switch back. I use this technique to avoid quite a few hits.

	"Burger World: I did this level first since it's quick and easy. Look carefully at the code entry screen for something curious: the finger hits the "2" button, moves a bit to the left, then hits the "3" button which is further on the right.
