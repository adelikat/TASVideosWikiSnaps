	"First, the submission text is there for you to explain the run, not to point people at an email address to ask questions. You are given a space to provide information and answer questions people may have in advance of those questions being asked. This is an invaluable tool for everyone on TASVideos, and it should be used appropriately.

	"Second, I have to mention the filename choice. It's... Not great. It's not the biggest deal in the world, but it provides a bad first impression of the run.

	"Third, and the actual reason I am rejecting this... Every decision feels like it was made on the fly. I'll admit I don't understand the category choice in any way, even after reading Arc's dissections of it in the thread, but I can tell that the routing and the optimization are not up to the levels they should be. The first part of the run collects the hammer using a warp, then does Palace 1, then gets the statue, then gets Jump, and then gets downstab. I feel like this could be greatly improved by starting with the statue, then getting Jump, then taking the warp, getting downstab as a slight detour on the way to the hammer, and then going back to Palace 1. Should be one less S+Q, less walking overall, and you have downstab for the boss which would make it significantly faster than it is here. On top of that, overworld movement doesn't look fluid at times, often moving into unnecessary tiles seemingly to avoid encounters when it should just be possible to manipulate them out of your way.
