This movie uses a lot of carpet glitch which consider of to do a phantom grab to spawn a platform.

	"Furthermore, I have an issue with using the 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=password glitch|href=/2059M)
	" for this hack. The main issue is that it skips a majority of the hack. When we showcase a hack, we want it to actually be showcased in a way that differentiates it from the base game. Using a glitch to skip several stages doesn't quite make sense to me here, especially given how different the level layouts are. I'm aware the reason is likely just "fastest completion under any circumstances", but it comes at a detriment since about half of it isn't even touched. The second issue is that the main draw of the published password glitch run is removed: You are given the dash upgrade automatically at the end of the intro stage, so it actually can't be skipped in this hack. There's a possible third issue in that this run goes for the helmet and body upgrades when they don't appear to be necessary. It's possible the hack does a check for them at some point in the Sigma stages, but it isn't immediately obvious to me if there is.
