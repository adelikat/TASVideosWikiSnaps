	"If you press button B on a blank space in the main character's equipped list, the last (6th) item in the backpack list changes. The item ID is reduced by 1. The Useless Item, what you get for using all the charges on a plain item, is FF, and the two key items of the game happen to be FE and FD. This glitch is also used to get a high-value sellable item from junk, a flying carpet, and a King's Pass.
