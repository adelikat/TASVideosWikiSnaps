	"Castlevania Symphony of the Night is arguably one of the best 2D platformers ever made.  While most know of it from the PSX release, it also recieved a port on the Sega Saturn in Japan, and is considered to be one of the worst ports for the game due to its poor performance in lag.  However it has an exclusive maria mode, which allows you to play as Maria Renard.

	"This movie is around a 12.05 second improvement to the publicaion, as shown in the comparison encode.  the time appears longer due to better saturn emulation in bizhawk compared to yabause-rr, which includes an extra 12 seconds of bios start up time (overall a 20 second time difference due to loading, which is also reflected in the comparison encode.)

	"So right off the bat you'll notice some different movement compared to the previous tas, you can cancel out your forward kick by holding the opposite direction during the kick, this allows me to continuously dive kick and forward kick in quick succession.  It is faster than just down dashing.  some areas I still do down dashing because I either cant do a forward kick there or it puts me into position to start a high jump.

	"Screen Transitions in the Chapel in general are pretty broken.  if you back dash into the middle of a transition you can confuse the game into placing you somewhere else on the screen, the first room does it in the save room to save a little bit of time.  for the Medusa fight, I dont use the KameHameHa as it would waste valuable energy that I need for the next room, so instead I stomp on her until she's dead.

	"once again, by using the broken screen transitions, I can get out of bounds and avoid any other obstacles that would normally slow me down.  Axes are important here because your downward kick will lose speed after awhile, but if you throw an axe, you can preserve your current speed, this allows me to quickly get under some steeples.
