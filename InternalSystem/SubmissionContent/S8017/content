	(__wikiLink|displaytext=my old Pick-up Spares run|href=/4398M)
	" as a test canvas to see if I could use the Player 2 controller to manipulate RNG on the various spare layouts.  While messing around with P2 inputs, I discovered that pressing multiple number buttons on the P2 controller had various effects on the run that weren't possible while only using the P1 controller.  The following are the 4 effects that I discovered.
