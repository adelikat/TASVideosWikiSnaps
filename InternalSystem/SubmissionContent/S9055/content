[ul 
	[li 
		" Both movies are sufficiently optimized and publication-worth.

		" The two movies are very similar, it comes to me as largely redundant to publish both. A decision has to be made as to which category prevails.

	[li 
		" For IGT: The game does provide an IGT timer, so it IS a valid metric and it seems a natural way to measure how fast you can beat the game.

	[li 
		" For RTA: Thesolution is hilarious. You just hit Heihachi and just drop the controller until the time runs out.
		$LF

	[li 
		" For RTA: Requires no categorization: it is objectively faster in terms of frames.
		$LF

	[li 
		" For RTA: It is an improvement over the current publication, whereas the IGT movie is effectively slower than the current publication. A stronger argument has to be made as to why it obsoletes it.

From what I could gather, there was no strong opposition to my proposal to accept this as a replacement of the current publication and publish 9056 to playground, for future reference / archival purposes.
