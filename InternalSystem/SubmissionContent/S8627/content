	"While this game has multiple versions, we, CoolHandMike and RiYAN, chose to use version 1.11. Version 1.11 was better than the previous versions since the older versions handled collision in most slopes very differently.  Older versions like 1.0 when going through slopes at high speed would essentially put you in a near endless falling state (you fall for something like over five minutes in the older version) where you cannot interact with level in any way for cutscenes or forced battle sequences. While it would not always put you in that state it would block useful shortcuts.  Also the down thrust had less height and less invulnerability which is very important in many instances and would render some strategies and skips unusable.  The Mantis boss takes no damage from the down thrust move at all in V1.0.  For the curious there is a post on steam regarding V1.11 release notes.  There was an additional unannounced release of 1.14 which you can realize by looking at a rom dump using a hex editor program.  We know of no real differences between 1.11 and 1.14 so suspecting it was a very minor update.  The bin file should contain the string “DEMONS OF ASTEBORG v1.11 - 30th Sep 2021JUE”. We use the name DemonsOfAsterborg_v1.11.zip with the file inside named the same.

		"Dash Slash – Dashing off a ledge and slashing with the sword will keep a constant x speed while using the sword..  Using the sword immediately afterward will result in a small decrease in speed but has a high rate of speed overall.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Super Jump – By performing a jump at the ledge at the start of the Dash Slash you can perform great leaps over normally uncross-able chasms. Jump height is controlled through holding B for more frames.  Jump can also be delayed for several frames when going over a ledge. Unfortunately this does NOT work on movable platforms. Any kind of platform that moves does that all the Super jump.  The Dash Slash works fine however on those types of objects.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Super Bounce – Upon landing on a platform by pressing the buttons of slash and jump at the right time you can continue keeping your speed.  Modifying height using Down+Jump while slashing in order to hit the ground to chain Super Bounces is useful to try to keep your speed for as long as possible. Ideally this is used when going up a positive slope with enough graduation so that you would bounce before your slash terminates which causes speed loss. So on such a positive slope you would be able to Super Bounce off the ground without ever losing speed.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Backwards Super Jump – This is an extension of the Super Jump but where instead of jumping over to ledges in the direction you are facing you can now perform the Super Jump in the opposite direction. This is done by essentially tricking the game into thinking you are going one way then switching the directional to go the other way.

		"Screen Transition OOB – There are not many, but some screens are slightly off alignment.  We ruthlessly abuse this whenever we can.  The ones abused in this are TAS are all ones where jumping from one screen to another results in getting into ceilings, there is a potential to get under the floor on a screen transition.

		"Lag Extra Damage – By deliberately causing lag, certain magics and environments can be used to cause massive damage.

		"Crouch Space Invasion – There are several spaces designed to crawl into, but there is a way to get into them with careful input.  Need to get into the wall at least a pixel on the same frame that you would normally land on the ground of the crawl space. On the landing frame have to turn around and on the next frame to the roll input into the wall. Then you are in the crouch position and can roll in.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Escape Wall OOB -  Strange series of inputs that essentially puts you under the floor so you can perform a wall jump against the ground while OOB.  Frame Perfect and some require a certain falling speed.  One stage 8 wall escape requires one bounce, then immediately followed by another since just once does not push you enough and the game is pushing your character back into the wall.

		"Dialog Escape – Pausing and unpausing can delay dialog from happening. This is useful in stage 1 to skip a pretty long cutscene.

This is used to extend the mid air attacks to get closer to ground or to extend the attack when transitioning between screens.

		"Screen transitions have unusual speed and state keeping when transitioning. Depending on what state you go in, you could potentially keep speed a good amount of time or potentially lose almost all of it.

		"If you act quickly enough on a screen transition you can wall jump off of some screen edges. This is useful for getting into places. Example of this is in a OOB skip in the cave. On the previous screen you need to have an  frame without a B jump input while pressing in the direction you intend to jump in. This seems to move your character slightly into the wall on the next screen. Rarely useful since the jump off the screen edge needs to wait around 20 frames during which you are falling.

This allows a full speed bounce to be done off of the ground on the next bounce if the ground is not drastically lower than the initial bounce.  This can only be done while moving off an edge in the same direction.  Additionally the down slash can be interrupted with a LAB or RAB a couple frames after using the down thrust to get much more distance than normal.

The third attack is one where the hand stays over your character and then will  grab after a period of time. That grab is the best move to get since the hitbox is directly over you and allows you to attack another hand at the same time easily.  The fourth attack type is a single ground pound where a hand hovers high then comes down on the ground. This single strong pound attack is good to manipulate to occur when possessing a hand.  Once the hand's health is reduced to 0 you can then stun and possess them.  Once possessed you need to punch the boss in the face. The maximum amount of times you can punch per possession is twice.    Unusually the hands may be the only enemy in the game where the down thrust does not actually push you up vertically.

Another attack is this long screen spanning swooping attack, another poor attack for doing damage to him.   Yet another bad choice is one where he will start flipping his chain and ball across the full length of the screen.  The attack where he mostly stays in place and flips the ball and chain around is the one we want.  While it does damage the damage is small and his downtime is significant afterwards.  After about half his health is gone he gains another attack which is the best one to randomly cause.  This new attack has some sort of freezing wind, but if you avoid the head and use down thrust it will miss. That attack also drops a health potion.

The main reason for his differences is because of the animations lengths, recovery delays, his fourth attack includes a speed boost forward, and his down air attack is like a ground pound move.  As you may expect his fourth move that includes the speed boost is susceptible to being abused.  The way to do this is to jump right after it begins, use D then B to decrease your height a couple times, then press RAB or LAB upon landing which will make you bounce at high speed.  Then you can repeat the steps starting from the jump after the attack.  The knight has a high speed opposite super jump near ledges, but his normal forward super jump off ledges is slower due to needing to jump later.  He has the same restrictions where on certain platforms you cannot use the super jump, instead it will be high speed angle downward diagonally.  While on the ground he has an interesting fast roll where you can roll, then on the next roll have it be an attack, roll, attack and he will dash forward while attack, then another roll can be performed at the end, and that can be repeated.

Using the super jump from the Knight some additional hits can be gained while the miniboss plays keep away.  He has an energy ball attack where he plays keep away from you and throws them out. Another is full screen lunge where he flies you into the wall.  The Lightning attacks render him invulnerable and stationary afterwards on the ground and would be a good choice. However there is also an unlikely action and that is for him to just teleport to the ground. While on the ground for the start you can also manipulate him to laugh. The Laugh action gives you about double the time to beat him up.   The positioning of where he lands needs to be near the center of the stage.  This is necessary since he will teleport to the side and start charging up.  Letting him fully charge would give him an additional attack with a ring of lightning balls.  After a couple hits however the charging breaks and he is vulnerable for a while.  It is a tight window but with the Knight the down attack can be used to do some good instantaneous damage.  There is a glitch used right at the end where there is a one frame invisible hitbox from the disappeared enemy.  When he teleports from standing it remains in place, but right at the end is the only spot to use it without timeloss.

	"There is an infinite jump glitch that is only possible with this demon form. While hovering in demon form, the magic constantly decreases and if the magic runs out there is a single frame that allows you jump again. This can be chained since after jumping you can hover again and decrease your magic to 0 then jump again, etc. About halfway through the stage there is a minotaur that the game intends for you to defeat which spawns a platform to advance. However we use this infinite jump glitch to not only go right past the minotaur but jump into the next screen's wall, looping up and left skipping 90% of that other screen which has a lot of platform waiting.

	"A major skip in the last stage can be gotten by clipping through the floor and bypassing a gate. After hovering and flying to the next screen to the left you get a checkpoint.  Since there is no way to recover from this position you have to die. If you advance the screen while too low and do not die on the first fall you can will be soft locked in an endless loop.   Normally this gate requires a lengthy detour to first unlock his father which is this slow powerful character who will then break the gate and then you have to play with him for a couple more screens.  Then normally you have to replay those sections with the first character.  This skip avoids all that.

	"The next screens are mostly just bouncing along trying to preserve as much momentum as possible. After more screens there are these stairs, then a cutscene with the father which we never freed from prison.  This screen has a lot of spikes and the intended route is kind of S shaped.  However with the double jump and then the infinite jump we get into the portal from an unintended side. Normally it is not possible to go up the right side past all the spikes for the final platform.

	"The boss of the stage is very similar to the giant skeleton boss in a lot of ways. He is a large background boss that uses two hands to do various attacks for the first phase.  RNG is manipulated to get certain attacks. Some attacks are absolutely terrible to get and waste massive amounts of time. They make the hands invincible or out of reach below the screen.  The best one is the dual swipe on the first phase since you have a chance to attack them both at once.

[div class=p 
	"The way to advance through the first phase is by rapidly hitting the hands the best you can.  Unlike literally everything else in the game the hands require a set number of hits.  On this Hard difficulty the first hand requires 40 hits, the second hand 23. The remaining 12 health is for the third phase.  With the rapid attack and cancel the first phase goes by very quickly.  The random lag is a minor problem though.   The second phase starts when the first hand dies, and it really has the same attacks only with the single hand. Here there is a glitch that is used to great effect. On the last boss there are these lag spikes in between forms that seems to reset your current move. So while hovering in demon form if there is a large enough lag spike on the last boss it is possible to jump in mid air. This is separate from the infinite mid air jump. The boss is manipulated to use an attack that puts the hand up near the top of the screen, but with that lag spike we can jump yet again and continue attacking finishing the third phase.

[div class=p 
	"The third phase is usually something of a waiting game where you have to use magic fireballs on these spiked balls that spawn then get him to hit himself with them.  However here there is a way to skip the last phase of the boss since there is a developer oversight you can hit the last boss during its last phase with the down thrust equivalent.  The down attack does 10 damage but he has a little bit left. The first downthrust is actually canceled due to a lag spike on the transitioning to the third phase. Then lets us do the second one immediately and finish him.  This saves a large amount of time, after it dies there is a single dialog box then the game is over.

	"On the last stage there is a way to climb walls until you can loop over the top of them, but it requires careful horizontal movement since excessive movement will reset the y height.  It is not used since the height needed is extreme. Some areas are 32K pixels high and others you have to loop under them to get under a platform on the current viewable screen which is near 64K pixels.  Takes a long time so not used.
