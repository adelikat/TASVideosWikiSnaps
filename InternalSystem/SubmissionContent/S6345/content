	": This game is too trivial to competitively TAS. It is not a superplay puzzle to look at a memory address and press the button the frame before it changes, once, a hundred times, or a billion times. It's not an achievement to always be able to press this button optimally, if a movie doing this can be 
	[a href=/forum/p/225870#225870 
		"generated within 30 minutes
	]a
	"..There's no TAS value in an hour long run if 2 people can independently have known-to-be-optimal movies that even have the same length.

	"I should say that of course a TAS of this game quite boldly stands out from unassisted play where a human requires to see the duck and is unable to guess where it spawns behind the bush. But I still can't agree that the 
	(__wikiLink|2166M|current publication)
	" was worth accepting, because of how easy it is to push this game to its limits, and there's no entertainment in the result, as

	".
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Given the above, it doesn't make sense to accept yet more movies of this game that do the same thing for a longer amount of time, even if we want to see the kill screen. Yet this movie only plays one mode instead of all 3 that the current publication does.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The first round in this movie has the same length as in the existing publication. If you can manage to improve the latter, by all means make a new submission. Until then, rejecting for boring gameplay coupled with game triviality, which makes it ineligible for both Moons and Vault.
