	": The viewer response to this run has been overwhelmingly negative. The main complaint seems to be the lack of completeness and I can only agree. Merely playing the normal mode puzzles, the easiest in the game, quickly is not entertaining and it remains to be seen if the run would become any more entertaining if the other puzzle modes (Hard, Special and Mania) were to be included. Therefore I am rejecting this submission.
