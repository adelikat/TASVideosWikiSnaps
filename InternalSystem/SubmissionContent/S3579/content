	"Link’s Awakening is a game where our hero THIEF becomes stuck in the worst nightmare of his life. The world he is in makes little sense; you can teleport almost at will, going into caves and houses can take you to nightmare hell, and creatures such as banana throwing lava alligators are after him. Luckily for THIEF, he makes a few friends including an undead rooster, a starving Chain Chomp, an annoying Ghost, a mysterious young girl named Marin and of course the insane Tarin. In this nightmare, THIEF goes around collecting what he believes to be musical instruments in an attempt to try to wake up the magical Wind fish which would allow him to escape from this horror.

There is first frame warping (usually the fastest), second frame warping (faster in certain situation to clear out lag) and third frame warping (rarely used but it positions Link further from the side of the screen he is warping to which is sometimes useful).

	"I decided to return bow-wow since the final fight just got too laggy. Nearby I screen warped the fisherman up a screen so that when I paid to go fishing, he took me to underworld 2. At first I just reset, but, I decided to mess around in there. Mambo showed his true form as just a bunch of rabbits and Mamu freaked out. After freaking him out, I found a way to freeze the screen but still have link be moving behind that. I got another power brace and reset.

	"Since the last place I entered was from the fisherman, it still kept me there, but with normal tile physics. I then warped to the final boss and warped him into an interesting nearby room.

	"I tried to be creative here, using the shovel to reflect attacks, and just making link look as crazy as possible. It felt great just destroying the Ganon form though since I’ve gone through some pain trying to optimize him in the any% run (I will submit an improvement eventually, I just have a few more things to test…). I then messed around with the rooster and boomerang and defeated the nightmare. For a final twist I warped up a screen making the staircase that leads to the Wind Fish extend across the screen.

	"This was probably one of most interesting TASing experiences I’ve had. Learning about all these glitches and finding ways to apply them to make an interesting run proved to be quite entertaining to me. Sure, I had many frustrating moments making this (hexing desynchs, etc), but it was probably the most fun I’ve had TASing. Regardless of whether this gets accepted, I am very happy with the results, and I hope you enjoy it too!

	": For years I've been thinking a run like this would be excellent. Unfortunately, most people I spoke to didn't think so - till now. Due to this, I thought I would be one of the few who would really appreciate this run, and wasn't sure what audience response would be like.

	"Based on response, it seems almost everyone is wildly enthusiastic about this run. The run itself also surpassed my expectations for what this kind of run should be doing. Therefore, I am gladly accepting this as a new branch. May I also offer early congratulations for glitchy TAS of 2012, funny TAS of 2012, and probably gameboy TAS of 2012.
