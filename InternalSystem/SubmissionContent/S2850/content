	"Unfortunately there is no real time-saving glitches available to this stage, I can glitch out of the stage in several places but never manage to get back into the level before the ring count is depleated from being in the fire. It also seems not to matter how fast you try to move through the level, it has a pre-determined length or something. Although for the sake of simply making things interesting to watch, I deliberately kill a Badnik on the way out of the level this causes a interesting graphical glitch!
