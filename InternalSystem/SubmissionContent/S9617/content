				"Do NOT Press the Yellow Switch is a 2022 hack by Daizo Dee Von for the 72 hour Questionable Level Design Contest where it won a "Cool Level" reward. The level is about not pressing the yellow switch for an expended period of time. This single level hack has multiple proper endings and keeps track of the longest reached ending.

				"The goal here is to reach the first proper ending without any in-game cheats, giving me a way to show off the majority of the gags in this hack as well as maintaining some level of playaround. Despite all that there's also just minutes of doing nothing since it's both easier for me on the creative front of being entertaining about nothing and also slightly amusing. There's also an in-game cheat to change the timer to have seconds changed to frames which is effectively a 59-60X speed multiplier but I decided against it for the purposes of this submission.

The submitted input ends on hitting the switch but that leaves the game playing an irritatingly loud and off-putting noise. The extended input closes out of the ending so that the noise only plays for a brief bit before fading to black and returning to the world map.

The player must face very tame challenges during the wait. The author here manages to squeeze some entertainment value of out this interactive movie. I reckon the masochistic among our audience will thoroughly enjoy this.
