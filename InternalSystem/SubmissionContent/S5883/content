	"Overwriting the bytes in a savegame is not an instant process. Resetting halfway through can result in a corrupted savegame. To try and avoid loading faulty data, most games use a checksum, so does SMW. The checksum is 16 bits and thus can only hold 2^16 = 65536 different values. This means a working corrupted savegame can be created with a well-timed reset.

	"However, a corrupted submap value will make the game load graphic bytes from various locations (and one of those locations can be SRAM itself). Having corrupted graphics doesn't crash the game, but important here is how the game first decompresses the data into a buffer in memory ($7E:AD00). There are no checks for the bounds (only 0xC00 = 3072 bytes are allocated), so we can buffer overflow bytes all the way to $7F:8000 where SMW stores its OAM clearing routine, which runs every frame when there are sprites on the screen.
