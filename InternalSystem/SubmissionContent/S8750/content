	"Anyways, Bonk's Revenge for gameboy features some very wonky game physics that I guess kinda make sense, maybe. I will start out explaining the base mechanics and then go over individual tricks/glitches (even some glitches that didnt make it into the TAS)
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"First of all when you start the game you are in basic bonk form. You have a speed counter that you can track that moves bonk a certain number of pixels based on what the speed counter is. In this basic form your speed counter will max at 3, but let's back up and explain what this means first. Speed counters go as following: 1, 2, 3, and 4 for the entire game. This only affects your horizontal movement. 1=1 pixel every 4 frames or .25 px/f  2=1 pixel every 2 frames or .5px/f  3= 1 pixel every frame or 1px/f and 4 = 1 pixel followed by 2 pixels for consecutive frames or 1.5 px/f. So therefore this game does seem to have subpixels but I wasn't able to locate it myself, which probably means this run is improvable in areas I thought were optimized.

[div class=p 
	"The good thing about this game however, is that it is very easy to sync as I've only had the game desync twice during improvements due to an extra lag frame randomly. So any improvements could in theory be added relatively easily.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The next thing to note I guess is that jumping from flat ground sucks. Every time you want to jump while you are still on the ground you will come to a full stop and have to accelerate back up to the max speed again. For this reason, dropping below ledges and using the wall kick does force us to come to a stop but we kick off the wall at max speed immediately which turns out to be just slightly faster in most cases. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Very early in the run we grab the first powerup which will stay with us for the entire game. The powerup that makes you look like a krillin/spock hybrid is the fastest form in the game in terms of both running and jump height. The other forms are one that eats enemies when you attack them and the prison suit which lets you enter those special doors for various bonuses. Because the powerup takes so incredibly long to acquire and it's so fast there is absolutely no reason to damage boost anywhere as it will lose the powerup instantly. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"And in typical bonk fashion if you press B while in the air you will do an air twirl.. roll.. whatever you wanna call it. I will explain this more in the tricks section.  Whenever you twirl in the air your speed drops to 3 for a single frame, so actually some speed is lost by twirling. However, since landing and jumping is pretty slow in most cases twirling is sometimes preferred, unless there is excess lag while in the air.
	$LF

	"If you crouch while running along the ground you will do a sort of faceplant maneuver that lowers your hitbox and you move at 3 on the movement counter, a slightly slower speed than the 4 from the full form speed. You can also press and hold up when jumping into certain ceilings and do a similar maneuver on the ceiling.
	$LF
	"This might not sound useful since you move slower but actually is it's uses in a few places. If you are standing still for instance, and do a face slide on the floor you will immediately jump to 3 speed, there is no acceleration. This is useful at the start of every stage where you begin on solid ground to start off at a speed of 3. Another useful place to use this is whenever you have to land on a designated stage exit pad or ground. There are a very small number of places that this occurs, but for whatever reason pressing down while you land will keep your speed up higher.

	"So pretty much every enemy and boss has a rather large hitbox and can be damaged from underneath simply by jumping into them. But because this is so lenient, you can just jump right next to the enemy and land the hit. Jumping from beneath an enemy does 4 damage while bonking them with a head bonk from above usually does 8. Most enemies only have 4 hp but there are some exceptions. Jumping directly next to an enemy cuts your jump immediately short, and then you can combine it with the faceplant slide from the previous segment to start moving almost immediately at max speed again.

	"This trick was originally found by Memory when viewing earlier WIPs. As mentioned before, jumping sucks. There is a mechanic in the game that also lets bonk grab the sides of walls for *most* of the walls. I will point out which exceptions there are in the individual level notes below. But since jumping stops you it is usually more advantageous to drop down a ledge and grab the wall. When you're stuck to a wall you have several options of what you can do. Firstly, you can simply press the opposite direction away from the wall and you will get a small jump. This is basically never used as your speed starts off at 3 for one frame and the significantly lower jump height doesn't offer as many options. Secondly, you could press A which will attempt to scale upwards on the wall, unless you are very close to the top of the ledge. Next, you could press down which will slide bonk down the wall. There is a glitch involving this mechanic that I will list in the useless glitch category later. Lastly, you can press B and jump away from the ledge at max speed of 4 instantly and also a higher jump. This is the preferred method used every time.

This can only be used to get one block below the surface, and is actually seen in one of the alien boss fights where I show it off briefly.

There is a robot enemy that spawns down below just after the bird if you kill the bird first and he causes a ton of lag. The original method was to drop down and kill the robot but that was slow and there's no good way to deal with him. Later, I found out that the bird existing in the same plane as the robot whenever we reach his spawning point would cause him to not spawn at all. Luckily, head bonks on the ground also kills air targets so it turned out to be just slightly faster to do this. There is another example of this despawning a robot in one of the last few stages. I drop down and kill another robot later because again they cause a ton of lag.

Near the beginning of the stage this is the first and only use of the waterfall trick where you get a jump off the side of the waterfall. This puts your y speed at -4 while climbing the waterfall normally moves at less than half that speed (-1, -2 alternatively). This stage also has destructible blocks which luckily can be destroyed using a mid-air flip. The very bottom block seems to not be destroyed by mid-air flips so I can use this one to land higher up for a better jump. You can destroy the bottom block but only by pressing b while on the ground doing a ground head bonk (you stop in place when doing this particular attack so it is never used). These little spikeball looking enemies die by jumping into them, so by timing the hit with colliding with the wall (air flips near a wall will cause bonk to bounce off of them) you can smoothly kill them while climbing the walls.

	"Round 6 is a weird stage that is a combination of new stages and a boss rush. This stage is very simple for speedrun purposes. Simply avoid as many clouds as you can. Unfortunately an enemy placement here prevents me from being able to fall completely unhindered, as a twirl is necessary to reposition myself. Nothing else notable about this stage.

	"This stage is kind of like an upside down version of 1-1 but it's still very different. didn't bother killing the very first enemy as for some reason it doesn't really cause that much lag here. Instead I just drop down since being lower to the ground in this stage seems to be less laggy, since a lot of the enemies are at the top of the stage. I do go back up pretty soon however, and there's a very good reason for it.  It turns out that you need this tiny squid enemy to drop down and for some reason that causes a robot on the next room to not spawn. This is great because robots are the laggiest enemies in the game. I wasn't able to find any other cases of despawning enemies in this stage, but it would be nice since there are several more enemies later on.

	"This is another train stage just the cars are in different orders. Also, it introduces new enemies such as the giant car enemies that surprisingly aren't as laggy as you'd think. They still need to die however as they take up way too much room. There's nothing really new about anything in this stage, it's just about using the known tricks and avoiding as much lag as possible. Lag mitigation is different for various parts of the stage, as sometimes being on the ground is less laggy. Unfortunately the game forces you to do a lot of jumps.

	"Yet another vertical stage where we're goin upwards. Surprisingly killing the first enemy wastes too much time to be worth it. However, you'll notice shortly after I do a ground pound which seems like it's random. But actually there is a car off screen that happens to be right where we need to crawl through a small space. There is no way to kill the enemy while you're crawling and damage boosting through it would lose our powerup. Both of these reasons are unacceptable so I have to pick a spot to use the ground pound where he is still off screen. Unfortunately it's not enough to kill the other enemy nearby which has 8 hp.
