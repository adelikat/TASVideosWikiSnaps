	"This TAS abuses a glitch that makes skipping cutscenes skip entire levels. Skipping 
	[em 
		"every

	" level isn't a good idea, as it makes the ending not play at all (which is why I still did part of scene four and a bonus level). I've accidentally triggered the first level skip on real hardware while button mashing through the menus before (I thought the cartridge had some sort of hidden save feature because of this) but it's still really precise. Just a few wrong button inputs can softlock the game in an infinite bonus level screen loop.

	"Bugs/exploits that were used here include the one I mentioned previously and the scene four pool skip. Pressing down and B on the same frame at the end of each animation cycle (after reaching the ledge at the end of the pool) allows Buzz to go under the map. I then climb so Buzz is standing to trigger the level end sequence. Going under any map and standing still (in the idle animation) with an already active goal area just finishes the map instantly. Some maps don't work this way because you need to collect an object before the goal is active.
