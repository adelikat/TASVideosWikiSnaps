While this is sort of understandable given some issues with some online Japanese BIOSes being labeled as being USA BIOSes, as well as the fact that current BizHawk versions happily take a JPN BIOS for running USA games, it doesn't change the fact that this is an improper combination of game and BIOS versions which is
