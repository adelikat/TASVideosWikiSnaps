	"Juste could warp to 2 places from Shadow's room, but both of the places are far away from Maxim's room in castleA. Besides I can't perform quick-save once a boss battle begins till defeat it. (The condition will continue even if Juste warps to another place.) Therefore I concluded that defeating Shadow and resetting the game is the best route.
