	"I toiled away at this for countless seconds, possibly even minutes. The game lets you start with 500 chips but caps your bet at 300 for some reason. To hit 1k chips and break the bank it's more prudent to bet only 250 then double down. Splitting is an option as well but is way slower. Blackjacks are right out! Thankfully we can manipulate an 11, double it down to 21, and break the bank in seconds. Not shown is the hidden 1080p FMV cutscene showing us getting banned from the casino.

	"Well, I dunno, maybe it isn't a surprise to anyone else, but it was a surprise to me upon watching it. I figured the short run time was way too low to have some sort of satisfying ending or conclusion, but by golly, this game managed to actually end in some fashion! It even falls in the obtuse "my kind of humor" range of video game tool assisted speedrunning experiences! I love pleasant surprises like that. They're quite pleasant!
