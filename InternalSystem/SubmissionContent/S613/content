	"Oh well, this is over a minute faster than my old version. The improved time comes from more aggresive play. This time I take damage to save time which I didn't do that much in my old version.

	"The good thing about taking damage is that you get invulnerable for a moment, which allows you to bypass annoying enemies. Also it gives you a minor boost. This means I could have taken some more damage but I wanted to keep it sort of fluent without blinking all the time.

	"I also played a lot more aggresive against all bosses because I could sort of skip being careful. Most noticable is the robot-squid boss (or whatever) but it really payed off in time and it doesn't look that bad I think.
