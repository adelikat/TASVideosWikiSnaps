	"Regardless, a look at this movie reveals several instances of suboptimal play, both in terms of gameplay execution and goal-related planning. With some research (DKC2 is one of the best documented speedgames out there, thanks to an active speedrunning community and several publications on this site among others), this movie can be greatly improved both in terms of overall movement and goal.
