[p 
	"Bible Buffet a turn-based board game with action stages and bible quizzes.  It is simultaneously the best and worst game in its genre, and the only consequence for failure is having to continue playing.  It has an incredibly frustrating RNG and a lot of unnecessary delay, but it also has incredibly tight controls during the action stages, and the most chipper announcer of any Bible-based game about buffets.

	", I was fairly certain there was a better way.  This took me down a rabbit hole that I would not escape from for three days.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I attacked this initially by reading disassembly, and with p4plus2's help, was able to make sense of the RNG.  However, I wasn't able to read the required memory to accurately predict the RNG, so I decided to move on and look at other parts of the game.  At about the same time, Spikestuff poked me in IRC and what came out of that conversation is the collaboration we present to you.  Hand-checked RNG, hundreds upon hundreds of failures, and eventually workable results give us this video.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Veggie Land is ten spaces long, with a bonus spin at space six.  Because the easiest way to waste time in this game is not landing on bonus spaces, we do exactly that by spinning the smiley face and having it move us forward ten spaces.  The smiley face could have also either given us a Key (useless) or a Bonus Health (marginally more useful, but it would mean not moving, which is the worst thing of all.)  Some damage boosting is used to shove us to the exit and win us some frames over Meerkov.

[p 
	"The bonus spin is five spaces away from us, and they're the way to travel in style.  Not requiring an action stage when you land on them, they're your fast track out of the Land and out of this game.  It was possible (three ways) to spin a 5 earlier than we do, but each of them resulted in more spin time, ultimately being slower.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"From the bonus space, we spin a 10 to leave the Land.  There were a couple of other 10s that took the same time to start spinning, both of which were ultimately 18 frames slower.  We go from bonus space to bonus space here, which is the fastest method of travel as it does not require playing a minigame to progress.  The reason we don't do this from Veggie Land is because the bonus space there is nine spaces away and there's no way to move nine spaces in one spin.

	"As Meerkov noted in his submission, it's possible to press Start and Select (Ss) at the same time to exit a stage.  You have to do this three times to be allowed to advance, but it turns out to be much faster to do that than to try to beat this maze of a level.  We do that, and spin another 10, moving into Bar-B-Q Land

[p 
	"Here's where we thought we could most improve the previous submission.  We were hopeful that taking the Quiz here (the question mark) would be faster than exiting out of a stage in Liquid Land and things were looking great.  With no waiting at all, we spun a 4, landed on the Quiz, failed it in epic, time-saving fashion, and used its reward to send us forward another four spaces.  And, if the spinner didn't take forever to spin and move the character, that would have been the end of that.  Unfortunately, all of our time savings (six seconds worth!!) got flushed away by the game's inherent take-foreverness, and we found ourselves back here, looking for a fashionable 10 so that we could mimic the other submission in movement around the board.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"We found a 10 pretty quickly (having to check ~100 possible inputs before getting a workable 10), but continued to search for a faster one because that's how this game works.  We didn't find one, went with our fast result, picked up some more time and ended up in ...

	$LF

[p 
	"The next spin yielded a 10 pretty quickly but we searched more of the space and saved three frames on our initial arrival time, catapulting us into Fruit Land and a level.

	" Fruit Land
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"It turned out to be faster to play this level (as with the previous submission), so we did.  What followed, however, was the biggest disappointment we had faced when working through this game.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Idling for four frames and pressing A, there it was!  A 10!  Alright!  And, by the time the character stopped moving and we started the victory ceremony, our 80-frame lead had turned into a 90-frame loss.  The RNG was determined to shut this run down right at the end.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Frustrated, we kept searching every possible sequence of input until we found something: idle for three frames, hold anything for three frames, release for two frames, and press A.  1658 frames spent in transit compared to Meerkov's 1706 and our initial 1880!  Success, victory, we've finally managed to reach the buffet.
