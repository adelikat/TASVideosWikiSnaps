	"Bible Buffet a turn-based board game with action stages and bible quizzes.  It is simultaneously the best and worst game in its genre, and the only consequence for failure is having to continue playing.  It has an incredibly frustrating RNG and a lot of unnecessary delay, but it also has incredibly tight controls during the action stages, and the most chipper announcer of any Bible-based game about buffets.

At about the same time, Spikestuff poked me in IRC and what came out of that conversation is the collaboration we present to you.  Hand-checked RNG, hundreds upon hundreds of failures, and eventually workable results give us this video.

Because the easiest way to waste time in this game is not landing on bonus spaces, we do exactly that by spinning the smiley face and having it move us forward ten spaces.  The smiley face could have also either given us a Key (useless) or a Bonus Health (marginally more useful, but it would mean not moving, which is the worst thing of all.)  Some damage boosting is used to shove us to the exit and win us some frames over Meerkov.

We go from bonus space to bonus space here, which is the fastest method of travel as it does not require playing a minigame to progress.  The reason we don't do this from Veggie Land is because the bonus space there is nine spaces away and there's no way to move nine spaces in one spin.

We were hopeful that taking the Quiz here (the question mark) would be faster than exiting out of a stage in Liquid Land and things were looking great.  With no waiting at all, we spun a 4, landed on the Quiz, failed it in epic, time-saving fashion, and used its reward to send us forward another four spaces.  And, if the spinner didn't take forever to spin and move the character, that would have been the end of that.  Unfortunately, all of our time savings (six seconds worth!!) got flushed away by the game's inherent take-foreverness, and we found ourselves back here, looking for a fashionable 10 so that we could mimic the other submission in movement around the board.
