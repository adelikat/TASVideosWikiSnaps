	"The Grant path, again, but this time it's about two minutes quicker!  You may wonder why before you view this movie so I'll tell you.  As soon as I get Grant I change to him, that's pretty much it.  Turns out that Grant is a total power-house when he is used properly (glitchy/tricky describes using him better).  This will probably be my final revision of the Grant path since most likely only mere frames would be picked up (if I knew exactly where then that line of text would be obsolete) so enjoy this one as it is very special to me.

	"Through out the movie I abuse certain tool-assisted abilities that only Grant possesses (most of them are only usable frame-wise).  There's one for falling quicker (most only used on high platforms because, even at a two-block height, there is always the strong impact of the fall.), one for canceling out the weapon animation which allows for more attacks and attacking time, and one (which Trevor can also use) to cancel out the strong impact of a long fall.  I also learned in this run through that Grant can climb walls quicker by pressing the jump and also he's able to jump off a wall which is relatively useful.  With those abilities (which I'll go into depth later on in the text) abused this game is very manipulatable in reaching quite a fast time with Grant.

Well, without the glitches/tricks that Grant mostly can only use then I'm sure the fight would only be a little faster (just minus the 556 frames from changing back and forth and you'd notice Trevor is actually quicker in the fighting if such glitches/tricks didn't exist though).

You'll see I drop a crap load of objects on one of those skeleton knights, to precise it was a dagger and two axes (a glitchy maneuver I might say as I believe you cannot drop axes while hanging upside down but you can throw them with the right combination of inputted buttons).

	$LF

	" Canceling the Attack Animation

[p 
	"Canceling the attack animation can be done by everyone, it's really useful for Grant.  The basic way to do it is to jump in the air and just as you touchdown, on the correct frame, hit the weapon button and there should be no animation but the sound effect.  This is useless with Trevor's and Sypha's Melee weapon but with there Sub-Weapon it becomes increasingly useful.

	$LF

[p 
	"With Grant, if you duck with him and let go of duck a frame later and use the weapon button on that frame he shouldn't do the animation of himself throwing the dagger.  This only works with his standard attack and not his Sub-Weapon.  Also with Grant, while his hanging upside down or holding the side of the wall, he can cancel the animation out.  If it's the Sub-Weapon you want to use, while upside down, let go of up for a frame and then on the next frame hold up again and press the weapon button.  If it's his regular dagger, let go of up for a frame and on the next frame don't press up but press the weapon button, then you can press and hold up again.  With the Sub-Weapon on the side of the wall, let go of either left or right (whichever you are holding) for a frame and then press up and the weapon button the very next frame.  With his regular dagger attack, let go of either left or right for one frame and press the weapon button for a frame then carry on holding left or right.

Thanks to Phil's and Genisto's runs which outlined nearly a perfect first level.  I'd like thank anyone who takes the time to watch this run or read this text.
