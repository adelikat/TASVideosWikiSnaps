	"Stele for TIC-80 was inspired by Celeste and its mechanics.  There is a way shown here that quickly gets to the end by exiting the first screen up through the ceiling out of the main area of the stage, which allows quick movement to the final cake which ends the game.

[div class=p 
	"The fastest way to move around dash, jump, then after a short period to dash back to the ground, and repeat that movement.  This is not used, but there is a glitch with the movement on the ground though where the author does not take into account if the player is pressing opposite directionals + Dash.  If that happens then the game resets the dash status and immediately allows another dash.  Unfortunately  dashing on the ground is quite slow.  Perhaps there is another bug that could make use of that for someone to check in the future.

This allowed me to save, and then just run the modified game in Bizhawk. The inputs made for the modified game also worked for the original game.
