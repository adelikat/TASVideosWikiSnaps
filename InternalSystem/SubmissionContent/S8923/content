	"The torturous hairpin turns and high-speed straightaways in "Rally Racer" promise to separate amateur racers from the pros. Here, there is nothing like driving a race-car. The scenery is a blur as you drive by at high speeds. The wind in your hair, your foot heavy on the gas pedal. Just when you're getting used to the calm of the straightaway, your foot's on the brake for a dangerous hairpin turn. Watch out! Will you make it in record time?

	"I remember this game very well. It was one that I had to get loaded up, but Quolerus was first on my list, of this magazine. I wasn't disappointed with it, except that it was purely a two player game. So all I did was try to get the best time possible. I have no idea what time I got back then, but I surely can tell you that this TAS is probably twice as fast as my best effort....maybe even more!

	"My experiences with TASing C64 games has helped in creating this TAS very quickly. The only thing that I had to figure out, was the correct "Driving Line". You would think that hugging the corner as close as possible would be better, but not in this game. After helping out with

	", I was recalled to my youth when I had typed this game in. It's very similar, except the physics are a bit more detailed...as in gear shifting, and having a route to determine. In any case, I play both sides where the blue car has the advantage over the white car. (Its just the way the game works).
