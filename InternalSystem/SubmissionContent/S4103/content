	"You're going to watch the most hyped run of the year. Actually the run is such an incredible boring shitload of crap to watch, it deserves to molder in the vault. Half of this game are jump'n run levels, the other half are autoscroller levels. This movie is 2:13.346 minutes faster than

	"This level is pretty much straight forward. It is not possible to drop a dynamite from an enemy to get rid of the small backtracking in this level. No frames were saved in this level compared to my testrun, I actually managed to save a frame, but I lost it due to lag in the beginning of level 2 and even more frames would be lost due to bad enemy RNG in level 2, so I kept the inputs from my testrun.

	"In level 4 there are those flying ghost which can hardly be avoided without a massive time loss, however if Luke jumps before they start moving into his direction they move in the opposite direction. Also some glitching is used, on the lamps if the other direction on the D-Pad is pressed on a specific frame Luke will shot a away at high speed, but he can't move off screen, so I needed to wait until the camera catched up. 164 frames were saved in this level.

	"In this level two wooden boxes need to be collected to see the boss of this level. I tried to jump there with subpixel perfect jumps, but it won't work, so two boxes are needed. Before the boss fight I put a dynamite near him, so that he won't hide soon and can hit him more times in the first part. I couldn't fight the boss in one part. 11 frames were lost, mostly because of the boss.
