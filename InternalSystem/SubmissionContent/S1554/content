	"The map is structured in a main map that called the Castle and 5 submaps that called the World. To open the doors that are led to next Worlds, we have to find the Keys in the Castle and Worlds. The 1st Key is obtained at once, but the other Keys are defended by the bosses in each World. Therefore, it is necessary to make the rounds of the Worlds.

	"I took damages as shortcut by using bat and the balloon bomber like Castlevania series. The direction that blows off by the blast of the balloon bomber becomes the same direction that blew off by the enemy last time. The position where I touch the blast is not related. Even if there is no enemy, I can blow off to right and left by this characteristic. In addition, I used 1 programming error in this game. It is possible to go through the floor by pressing Up and Down key under the ladder. These were very useful for the creation of this speedrun.
