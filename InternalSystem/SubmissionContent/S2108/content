	"It is an improvement of 4493 frames or 74.9 seconds over Acmlm's previously published run of the game. The improvements came mostly from altered routes in the levels, or playing the same route more efficiently (keeping your speed for a longer distance, or just simply getting to a higher speed). Some time where also saved from trying to avoid as many yarn balls as possible, as each one adds 1 frame at the end of a level, but often it takes as long to get them as it does to avoid them, so not very much time is gained there in the end.

	"A big problem with this game is that Bubsy handles like a drunk refrigerator, he accelerates very slowly, has a very high minimum jump heigh, looses half of his accumulated speed when jumping, which you have to do constantly since EVERYTHING kills him in a single hit, oh and the collision detection is also bad. It is absolutely impossible to play in realtime. This also makes pretty much everything you do look unoptimized, no matter how you do it, which is annoying (but at least got me looking for better options all the time, which did result in improvements every now and then :p ).
