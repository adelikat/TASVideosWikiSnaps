	"Finding Nemo is a common platformer game based on the movie of same name, released in 2003(wow, that's already 10 years ago). The movie features a clownfish named Marlin, who lost his wife and thus being too over-protective on his only son, Nemo. Feeling awkward by his dad's excessive nagging, Nemo decides to deviate from his dad, but captured by a diver merely after 30 seconds. Marlin, along with Dory who has short-term memory, embarks on a adventure to search for his son.

	"The game was release for several platform. GBA port of Finding Nemo, however, skips lots of plot in the movie, so it doean't really provide pleasure as the movie does. Developers should have put more efforts on this...

	"There's a obscure rule(I presume) when falling a pearl touchs floor, on which the direction and speed of pearl after colliding depends. I failed to find its RAM address, but I found out that this rule is very arbitrary; even a small, unrelated behavior(like player's current speed, direction, etc) somehow affects pearl's movement. After lots of trial, I gave up figuring out how it works, and I just abuse savestates again and again to manipulate luck.

	"Generally the speed while carring pearl is slower than normal. But if you release and grab pearl alternatively, you can slightly get more speed than usual. This tricks doesn't work on Marlin part, because Marlin's speed grabbing is fast enough and his speed decrease instantly when doing this trick.

	"This game has 12 levels, which consists of more sub-levels. Boosting is usually the fastest way to move, and it's crucial to check x/y speed RAM addresses to do this. However, these addresses differ each sub-level. Although searching these is quite easy, it's still annoying to do. You can use my RAM addresses list, though(download it from

There are three kinds of tests(bouncing ball to goal, popping bubbles, kicking pearls), again consisting of three trials. First trial gives you 3 shells, second gives you 2, and third gives you 1. Because third one is the hardest and only gives you one shell, it's fastest to achieve every first, second trial of each test.
