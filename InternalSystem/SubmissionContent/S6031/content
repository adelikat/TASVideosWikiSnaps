	"Top Gear 2 (released as Top Racer 2 in Japan) is the sequel to the 1992 racer Top Gear. First released in August 1993 for the SNES, May 24, 1994, for the Sega Genesis and in 1994 for Amiga. It was developed by Gremlin Interactive and published by Kemco for the SNES and by Vic Tokai for the Genesis. While more realistic than its predecessor, Top Gear 2 maintained the arcade-style gameplay the series is known for. The game was well received by critics and fans alike.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Using this trick, I am allowed to skip to any country in the game, albeit that I am wanting the United States as it is the last country in the game.  For some odd reason, if you quit out of a race (I soft reset at password given screen) which has the same effects, it tells the game that I managed to fail the race, although I never even started the race, to begin with.  After I reset, I go back to Continue Country to select what country I want, then the game will give you an allowance of 150,000 dollars, which is just enough to buy the upgrades needed in order to win against the other cars.

	" Manual Transmission
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"I use Manual transmission as it is the fastest way to speed up in the game.  Since I am using Manual I have to very carefully know when I should gear up to get the most amount of speed from the nitro.  There are 1 - 6 gears, 1st gear when using Manual makes you accelerate a lot quicker, and 4 gear allows you to build up enough speed, before transitioning into 5 & 6th gear respectively.

	" Wall Glitches 
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The reason behind this, is this: If an object, whether it be a stick, a shrub, or a piece of grass, makes contact with your car, and you hit the wall at the same time, the game freaks out and can’t spin you out, and it can’t bounce you back due to the angle and the speed at which you are traveling.  The game, however, needs to do something in order to make you continue playing, so it decides to finish the race for you.  This is where the word Wall Zip comes in.

[p 
	""Turn Throttling" works as follows: on ¤most¤ semi-sharp turns where you would normally slow down to deal with car sliding, (e.g. most snow levels) You will want to quickly tap the input for the direction you're heading instead. By doing this, you are effectively abusing the turn timer that triggers your car to slide if you're holding a turn at too high of a speed for too long.

[h4 
	" Extended Speed (or EX Speed for short)
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Extended speed is a "trick" that allows me to keep my speed on a certain downhill to uphill tracks.  If I manage to gear up at the right time a little later than normal as I do on San Francisco, I am able to keep my speed around that corner with the downhill speed bump in the middle and avoiding the roadblocks on the sides.

	"Since I am comparing against USA% Wall Glitches, I don't have to worry about getting anything better than 1:51.05 as I manage to get 1:51.21 which is 3 milliseconds faster than RTA for this category.  Everything you see is basically self-explanatory, finish the race as quickly as possible without crashing.

[p 
	"Now I have something special for you, especially if you were looking for a glitched version of USA%.  Unlike the regular USA% for Los Angeles, I keep on boosting until manage to crash into the grey wall near the finish line.  I have to have enough speed for this trick to work, however, I don't want a lot of speed, and I don't want to little speed, as going too fast will crash you into the side and not the front, or to little speed will bounce you back, there really isn't a consistent way to set this wall glitch up in real-time, however of course, in TAS I can keep doing it over and over again until I get the result I need.  This wall glitch is kinda hard to explain, as it basically throws out all the previous knowledge that I know and makes it into its own thing.  I wanna guess that, it is speed dependent and not object contacted on hitbox dependant, however, there really "Isn't" a good explanation here.

	"Frosty the snowman came for a visit, and he brought Snow with him! Unlike the previous 2 tracks, New York will finally be the last track to have snow on it.  New York, (just like other snow tracks in the game) you are able to use Turn Throttling to your advantage, (Turn Throttling explanation above).  Just like Los Vegas, finish the race as quickly as possible without hitting anything or slowing down in any way.

Just like the 3 previous tracks, manage to keep your speed, and finish first to be the world champion!
