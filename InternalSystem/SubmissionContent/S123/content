	"I wasn't planning on doing another because I really began to hate this game during the making of the first one.  But, I was tired of having my name attached to such a pathetic attempt so here it is.  There is still room for improvement, but this is a much better video than the curren one.

[div class=p 
	"- I really abused the Super Arrow.  At times I may have relied on it a bit too much; I just assumed it was always faster than sliding, but this is only the case on longer distances.  And I had to get a lot of refills for it.  Overall, though, it saved a lot of time.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- Unlike some other Mega Man games regular enemies have a period of invulnerability like bosses so many of them can't be killed with the regular weapon without slowing down.  For this reason there is a lot of selective killing of enemies, especially in the first couple stages.

[div class=p 
	"- You can't charge up the Mega Buster while sliding so if you're wondering why I don't use it that often this is the reason.

[div class=p 
	"- Pausing during the fights with Charge Man gets those stupid stones off the screen.  They hang around for a long time and you can't reuse it until they're gone.  I didn't time it, but I'm pretty sure it's faster this way.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- Some of the hits I take are probably unnecessary, especially on the first two levels of Proto Man's fortress (it is such a pain; I hate those tigers).  If it was too difficult to dodge or kill an enemy without wasting too much time I just ran through it.  I didn't do this in all circumstances, though.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"- I probably should have tried to make the Proto Man boss fights more interesting.  The last two in particular.  If you stand in the right place and continually hit them they just stand there.

[div class=p 
	"- I wasn't planning on getting a Crystal refill in the Wily stages but I miscounted somewhere along the way and would have been short for the second fight with Napalm Man.

[div class=p 
	"- There are a few screens with lag that can be eliminated.  I'm not good at judging it while playing and by the time I notice it I don't feel like going back.
