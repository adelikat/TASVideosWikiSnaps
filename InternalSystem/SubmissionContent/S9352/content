	"Using the early exit strat is much quicker than just having to wait out the whole kissing anims to play out and having to see such cursed level complete screen. Not only is it faster to early exit, but also saves your eyes. :)

	"I remembered how jank the collision physics are in the game, such as having the heart either not collide with moving objects, clip through them, or it bouncing off the direction it's not supposed to. I have used those glitches adding on with perfect frame timing to abuse the game's physics.

	": A cute little Flash game where you need to launch a fire ball (Fireboy) to reach your love interest (Watergirl). The solution looks pretty well optimized and it doesn't seem immediately obvious thet there might be a better solution.
