		"The game has planes that unlock as the player beats levels.  Each Level has Targets that need to be defeated before the level can be completed.  There are different paths to take, but the path this tas takes is the quickest.  On Hard the player only starts with the F-4.  After the first two missions the MIG-31 is the next best plane to get since it can defeat enemies with two missiles.  After the MIG-31 the F-15 is the last and best plane. 
		$LF

		"The main advantage for the tas is that it is possible to hit enemies without lockon.  The general strategy for hitting planes is to line up as best as possible before firing.  For smaller planes the firing jet needs to move to the side and sometimes slightly up and down so that the second missile can hit, because the missiles fire alternate left then right.   The real issue is stationary planes on the ground.  For some reason stationary planes are extremely difficult to hit with strange collision areas around them.  Very few of the stationary planes in the tas are hit without lockon.  In fact sometimes the missiles that are fired and hit the stationary planes do not actually hit.  A couple other stationary objects have strange hitboxes like the oil rig, and the small towers in that stage where the actual hitbox is just a square on the ground. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"The plane can fire missiles but only two can be in the air at the same time. There are machine guns as well but the range is around 500ft or less. Missiles behave very strangely at the most extreme range where sometimes they will miss if you plane moves in a different direction.  It seems sometimes the missiles move a little, or they can go out of range since moving the plane can sometimes cause the speed to drop slightly.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"The plane can increase or decrease speed, but there is a cap for both.  When the speed reaches the cap it won't increase any further, however if the speed decreases too much then the plane stalls and starts fall. Note that increasing speed is much slower than decreasing speed. This means that in almost every case slowing down is slower.

The next area has stationary planes, which are very hard to hit on the ground. Luckily I was able to hit the first one without lockon somehow.  The other two planes I was not able to hit them without lockon, but the plane is moving so fast the time loss should be minimal.  Ending the stage a frame away from death by ramming into the cliff.

	"The flying fortress has four main engines that need to be destroyed before the main Target that is in the center of the flying fortress.  The flying fortress has ports on the top that are firing missiles backwards which limit the height your plane can reasonably go up without getting hit.  There are turrets on the extreme ends of the plane that also regenerate.  The turrets also can shoot through collision boxes of the other fortress objects in what looks like a full sphere of range.  The hitbox of the flying fortress is much larger than it appears. Every time an engine is defeated it breaks off and slowly falls.  Note that the falling engine can kill you if you bump into it.  The stage has a F-22 which constantly is on your tail firing missiles at you.  The F-22 is also rather pointless to kill since immediately the level spawns another fighter that does the same thing.  There is an option to bring a wingman, but it is pointless since it has no effect on anything.

	"At the start I destroy the two turrets to give me some time and to avoid damage while getting into position.  Once the plane passes the flying fortress and start following it from behind the F-22 will start firing at the plane repeatedly, and the turrets start up once they come back.  The trick is to try and get close enough use the machine guns when possible since it can do a missile worth of damage.  Getting in close helps massively with speed since only two missiles can be in the air at once.  Hitting enemies quickly lets missiles fire more quickly.  However due to the engines falling once destroyed, some space to dodge is needed. Also space is important to juke left and right, and increase or decrease speed to avoid missiles from behind and the turret shots.

	"Once the four engines are dead, the main section becomes possible to damage.  Machine guns and missiles at very close range take it down.  Oddly enough surviving after the boss is technically dead is also tricky. The "Dead" flying fortress keeps firing at you, and the F-22 still hounds you firing missiles. I do a little maneuvering for entertainment at the end here where I move at ultra short range right on top of the falling flying fortress.
