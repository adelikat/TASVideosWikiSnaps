To me this warp feels similar to using a convoluted level select code to jump to the final area which to me doesn't fit either of the Standard or Alternate categories. I'll say that this fits perfectly in the Playground category, although I'm fine with any other judges in the future who wish to look this one over for themselves if they see it differently enough to rejudge it.
