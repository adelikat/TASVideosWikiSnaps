[div class=p 
	"First of all, I figured out that the initial seed (which is set on frame 5) can be controlled just by setting the date, as explained in 
	[a class=intlink href=/Forum/Viewtopic.php?p=262235#262235 
		"this post
	]a
	". The fact that there are 65536 different starting seeds means that I can do stuff like manipulate 31-IV stats in three categories while controlling nature, or get a shiny, or stuff like that. In fact the test run has a Mudkip with three 31-IV stats (Atk, Spd, SpAtk) and a nature with Atk+ and SpDef-. Unfortunately, I ended up not being able to control much other stuff, notably an optimal Lv 8 Taillow, which I sought to change in the final run.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"(For those wondering: I obviously do not find things like "Mudkip with three 31-IV stats" by hand but I use things I call "simulation search programs" written in C++. I did it with Monopoly years ago.)
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Using scripts that cover how many times the RNG was called in the past frame, and which values, I was able to find other stuff. Starting Pokemon stats is easy enough to find. Of course, I was looking for stuff that could be applied many times in the run. And I found a lot.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Critical hits was by far the most important in my mind. In general, an attack results in a critical hit if the fourth digit of the RNG value at the time of determination is 0. Easy stuff there. Furthermore, 7 RNG values later is damage variation. I know "damage variation" sounds like peanuts compared to critical hits, but believe me, it is very important in this run. Damage variation works as such: The fourth digit of the RNG value functions as a damage scaler. If it is 0, damage is applied at full 100%; if 1, 99%; if 2, 98%, and so on (if F, 85%). 0 is the only digit that gives the max damage; all others reduce it by at least 1. So if manipulating critical, or max damage, alone is hard, imagine manipulating both of them together.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Another thing I wanted to find is how Zigzagoon's Pickup worked in order to get free Rare Candies. Easy enough, I figured that a pair of RNG values had to work out to get Rare Candies (same for other items). The top half of the first RNG value (this is integer part of the value divided by 65536) has to be 0 mod 10 to get any item, and the next RNG value determines the item. The probability of Rare Candy Pickup (including when no item is obtained) is 1/100, and for King's Rock, 1/1000.

It isn't intuitive at all, and one has to wonder why the wild encounter mechanic is more inefficient then one should expect. (Is it Gameshark foiling? Synchronize ability (in Emerald)? A glitch? Just because?). I also figured out something similar for the Ralts tutorial (the part where Wally catches a Ralts) which is very important. If you think that only insane people think that the Ralts tutorial is very important, go watch the run *points*.

The reason is that, first of all, mid speed can be scrolled as fast as possible just by pressing and holding buttons. But beyond that, the problem with fast speed is that the text speed cannot be scrolled at will. Then you have to manipulate a whole bunch of events all together as a group, rather than separating the events by mid-speed text that can be sped up and slowed down at will.

It takes at least 4 seconds to take a Rare Candy from Zigzagoon and use it (even among using other stuff). I only use Rare Candies to learn useful moves or evolve before an important battle. I also have a different strategy for Wattson that saves X Attacks, since I only have 8 of them.
