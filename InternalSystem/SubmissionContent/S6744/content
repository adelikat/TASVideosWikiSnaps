	"Super Turrican is a game I dont know how to describe, or how to explain the plot.  But what I do know is this game is pretty brutal sometimes.  However the only reason I even did it was due to a newish glitch that lets you clip into any wall, which saves almost 3 minutes from the current publication (12,465 frames in total).  I will get to these tricks in the stage by stage.

[div class=p 
	"The other things I should mention is the powerups.  there are 3 different powerups for your weapon.  for the majority of the run we are using the Red powerup that gives us spread.  the blue powerup is a straight fire, and yellow is a bouncing bullet that can bounce off walls.  each time you collect a weapon powerup, it's damage will increase up to 5 times, and it seems that these upgrades carry through even if you pickup a different weapon.  The only way they get downgraded is if you die, and it only downgrades you by one damage.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The other important powerups include a shield that lets you roll through enemies with no knockback, bombs which deal damage to everything on screen and mostly useful for boss fights, and health refills.

[div class=p 
	"One befitit to dying in this game is you can refill your bomb count.  The game can only display 3 bombs at a time on the hud, but you can realistically carry as many as you want.

	"Throughout the game, there are hidded platforms that appear if you shoot them.  they can sometimes lead you to secret areas that contain 1ups and secret exits.  You can also shoot them again to get some item drops, which we do that in 1-1 to get a red weapon upgrade.

	"in 1-2, it shows the first instance of wall clipping.  the way it works is if you shoot the laser and alternate turning without shooting the lazer, it makes the character move to the right by a few pixels, and for some reason it doesnt check to see if you are near a wall.  it can get really easy to softlock the game using this trick.  also when you are in a wall, you can repeatedly press the jump button to zip up walls.

I tried my best to make it work but this game can be really bad with consistent enemy behavior.  stuff like during the wall clip in 1-3, you can avoid taking damage from the enemy on the ceiling by waiting for it to fall.  Other things inlcude small optimization things like jump heights and stuff.
