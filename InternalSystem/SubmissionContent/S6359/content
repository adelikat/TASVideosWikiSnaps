	"Let me explain a little about the boss since it came up in the forums. The first boss first has an invincibility period.  Once over you can damage him and the boss will run off screen and can not be damaged.  The position he reappears is based on your position.  This specific position from the previous author allows the boss to appear closest to you and then become vulnerable the fastest.  As the boss moves towards you after rushing off screen he blocks kunai.  Running strikes can damage him, but it is slower by about 10-20 frames than throwing a kunai at him.  At the exact frame the kunai would strike the boss he stops blocking and begins an attack animation.  Ninjitsu is an option to damage him, but he has just enough health to survive two ninjitsu, so getting the extra killing hit after those would be slower.  The method Dammit used is optimal.

Each jump then jump kick adds 2 to your height, and if you constantly hold the direction you want to move in while holding down you can slowly work your way into the wall.  I believe Musashi here is into corner of a wall and ceiling, that is why you need to do continual jump kicks to stay zipping and not fall out, but you can also move slowly into the wall.  Using jump kick while zipping in the wall uses a kunai.

	"I would like to also point out that it is possible to use the ceiling clip before the boss and fight the miniboss above the conveyor belt with a clearer view.  However I was unable to find a faster method doing it that way.  The brains spawn at the top of the area some distance above you, and you have to either jump up to kill them or wait for them to fall down to you.  If you try to jump attack them you have to hit them twice, once to destroy the cage and another time to kill the brain.  Not doing the clip and walking on top of the conveyor belt allows you able to be essentially right near the top of the screen where they spawn and fall.  Then run slashing to kill one completely as well as multiple at once is the faster method.

	"Doing Zips needs you to be overlapping near the edge of the wall to zip with jump kicks.  Vertical Zipping gets complicated.  Performing zips through ceilings with varying wall positions requires some finagling to get it to work and to fit as many jump kicks as possible without going to much into the wall or getting popped out of the wall and still keep good vertical speed.   Each jump kick adds 2 pixels to your height in most cases.  When in the wall pressing a directional will move you in the opposite direction ex: L moves you right.  Up and Down do nothing when you are fully in a wall, but while clipping they can pop you out so we don't press those unless doing jump kicks.  Also if you hold down you can work your way into a wall while doing the jump kicks, which is not always desirable since you need to be on the cusp of falling out to get the most vertical speed.  When colliding with a ceiling after a vertical zip you lose some speed while you go into the object.

This game internally divides up the levels into sections and will load them when you hit triggers as you move through the level.  Most levels have several loading zones.  In Traps all the areas are no different from any other level.  As you move through the level horizontally the next section will load. You can see this if you clip out each section and travel through Traps.  By going to a room that is adjacent to the boss room we clip out then travel right quickly using a jump kick to the right until we hit the next loading zone...which is the boss.

	"This whole massive issue of the section loading really pissed me off.  Basically the game loads in sections as I explained in Traps, but there are some detrimental effects as I encountered hundreds of times here.  The game does a check to see if you are in the camera area and if you are not it will change your position.  If you are too far right then you wraparound and start right back at the start of the newly loaded section.  Normally these loads are transparent and you see nothing.  If you are too far up you will load two screens worth down.  In this case it means death and we want the height for jump kicks anyway.  Jump kicks move you faster than running with enough height.  Further complicating things the small platforms at the bottom of this section load a bit after the full section loads in.  Jump kicking at the furthermost possible right at the highest possible height and landing on the platforms was challenging.  In the previous movie Dammit is able to get to the most extreme point right and up due to the super run jump coming out of the wall while zipping.  I was not able to get that extreme point, but fairly close.  It also appears that not doing the double jump like the previous movie is a couple frames faster.

	"Unique wall jump clip.  The area here is vertically challenged so I use an oddity I noticed before. Musashi needs to be near the wall on top of a ledge you can Down + Jump to fall through to do this.  Pressing down and jump will not have him fall through the ledge but kind of hover with a decreased height.  Then it is easier to perform a wall jump clip.  However here he does a standing attack a frame or two after wall jumping when you throw a kunai quickly.  Holding left keeps your height low which I wanted for the next part.  Moving through the wall bumps you lower which in turn allows you to get into the non wall section a bit to the right.  It is faster than just travelling through the wall right from this point.

	"Now we need to gain a lot of height to go through the invisible ceiling.  We are aiming for the 0xFE subsection with a height as far down as possible nearest to 0xFF.  Again I use the jump then jump kicks here to gain height faster as well as to continually move towards the exit.  Holding Left to move right since I am in the wall and that is how it works.  There is a door trigger there. I do not understand this section very well except that it may be related to how the loading sections work.  The game would load your two screens down, which probably translates to where the door entrance would normally be.

Randomness is not reset and is carried throughout the game.  Input UDLR,A,B,C are all checked and have an effect on various elements.  The kunai count also seems to change randmomness as well. Modifying the kunai count resulted in different actions in an autoscroller section.  Ex: Pressing an extra button in the beginning of the game is almost 100% to desync all the random elements that occur after.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Shinobi III lets the users off quite easily.  The game will buffer actions then perform them later.  Very commonly in this run you will see Musashi jumping off mid air immediately after running off of it. Commonly here on pipes  Musashi jumps after moving off a pipe to the right.  One of my favorites is from frame 19000 where it looks like Musashi performs a running slash in mid air after doing a dive kick.

	"23. Power
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Forgetting one of the most basic and important things for last.  Normally Musashi does 1 damage, but with the power you do 3 for kunai and short range attacks.  Your close range kunai attack turns into a sword attack.  Jump kicks do 1 damage everywhere power or not with the exception of the last boss where oddly enough Jump Kicks do 3 damage if you have power. Getting hit will remove the power until you get a power pickup again.  Power stays with you across levels.

	"25. About Loading Sections and Wraparound Glitch
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This game internally divides up the levels into sections and will load them when you hit triggers as you move through the level.  Most levels have several loading zones.  As you move through the level horizontally the next section will load.  
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The game however treats you unusually if you are outside the camera area by changing your position.  If you are too far right then you wraparound and start right back at the start of the newly loaded section.  If you are too far up you will load two screens worth down.  Normally these loads are transparent and you see nothing.

	"25. On Screen Kunai Limitation
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The number of allowed kunai on screen is limited to what looks like 8.  You can see this on the surfing level first boss form.  8 is the max allowed on screen at once.  Trying to perform more Kunai sprays during a double jump requires the other kunai to despawn.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This is more of a hindrance, but something that needs to be considered at some points.  While ascending if you throw a kunai your overall jump height can be impacted if you are not near the apex.  Throwing a kunai before the apex can reduce your overall jump height.  This has implications when performing the wall jump + kunai throw clips, as well as moving through certain areas with enemies.

	[li 
		"Would have liked to show the floor clip on the Body weapon boss.  On a certain frame of a kunai throw near the end if you get hit the game pops you up a couple pixels, which allows you to double jump really close to the ground.  Double jumping close to the ground and on the last possible frame if you use a ninjitsu you can clip through the floor.  Alas I could not find a way to fit it into the boss without losing frames.
