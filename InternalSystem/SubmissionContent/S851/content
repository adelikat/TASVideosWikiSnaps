	"My fifth submission of this game... I was pretty happy with the previous version of my movie, but right after I submitted it, BagOfMagicFood pointed out two levels that could be slightly improved. I always felt like improving them some day, but I didn't want to write in the submission form: "two improvements, both thanks to BagOfMagicFood".

	"Those who actually counted all frames will notice that the movie is 2 frames faster than accounted for in this list. This is due to the fact that the length of the black screen is sometimes a frame longer, and sometimes a frame shorter. It's completely random and cannot be influenced. In this version I lost 4 frames due to this in different levels, and saved 6 frames, in six other levels. There 2 frames added make a total improvement of 305 frames.
