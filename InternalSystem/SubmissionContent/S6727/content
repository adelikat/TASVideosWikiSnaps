	"A kingdom built of crystals came under attack by the reptilian troll-like Saurians whose leader, Zok, desired the powerful crystals protected by the Empress. Zok broke into the castle and reached for the crystals only to see them explode into pieces and fly to Earth.

	"After being thrown out the back door of a New York City club, an awful rock band known as the Rock Detectors found the five magical stones which gave them troll-like appearances and special skills (not the least of which is playing good music). This put them at odds with the music-hating Zok and his henchman Zink, collectively known as The Protectors.

	"Throughout the run I will be using Cornelius the Singer, I will be using his Musical Move which is to sing, with this Musical Move I can scream at enemies, and defeat them before they are even allowed to be spawned into the game. Previously I did a run with Chester the Wrestler, and while he may be the strongest of the group, he is certainly not the fastest when it comes to using his musical move which was the saxophone twister. Cornelius not only has a faster Musical Move than Chester does, it's so much faster than it beat the previous submission by 6 minutes & 21.09 Seconds.
