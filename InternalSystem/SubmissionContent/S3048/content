	"Crash Bandicoot is a platform video game published by Sony Computer Entertainment, produced by Universal Interactive Studios (now the defunct Vivendi Games) and developed by Naughty Dog for the PlayStation. It was released in North America on August 31, 1996 and in Europe on November 1996. It was re-released for the Sony Greatest Hits line-up on September 15, 1997 and for the Platinum Range on March 1998. It has since been re-released as a downloadable game for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable via PlayStation Network in North America in 2006 and in the PAL regions in 2007.

	"Crash Bandicoot is the first installment in the Crash Bandicoot series, chronicling the creation of the titular character at the hands of the series antagonist Doctor Neo Cortex and his henchman Doctor Nitrus Brio. The game's story follows Crash's effort to stop his creators' plans for world domination, clean up any pollution they have caused, and save his girlfriend Tawna, a female bandicoot also evolved by Doctor Cortex and Nitrus Brio.

	"Rolling Stones is interesting because they are almost identical in both runs save for the fact that the spinning is not optimised in this run. It is a short level and the later levels get much longer, therefore one can infer that losses from suboptimal spinning could be up to a second per level throughout the run. Jungle Rollers is interesting because a couple of timed objects are not reached quickly enough (due to suboptimal spinning) and this can snowball into a greater loss. Native Fortress is directly comparable and is indicitive of the more complex levels in the game and in this run it is a considerable 8.5 seconds slower. It should also be noted that the current run has some frightfully bad randomness halfway through this level and so can be faster still. In the Lost City both runs use a gem route though this one is almost two seconds slower. The run was getting better by this point and the author was certainly improving, but it is still far from optimal.

	"This is certainly a far better effort than your previous submission and you are certainly becoming more skilled at TASing. A run of this category can certainly be published here but 
	[em 
		"please
	]em
	" post WIPs in the thread so that mistakes can be spotted before this point. My own personal estimate is that close to another minute can be shaved off this and I hope that you make the effort to effect these improvements. As this game already has more optimal site precedent this run is not acceptable. Rejected.
