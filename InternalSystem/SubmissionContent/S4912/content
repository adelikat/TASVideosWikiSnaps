It remains faithful to the original, minus the Mountain world and with obviously downgraded graphics and music, although both are still quite good for the console. Pac-In-Time is in turn a re-skin of the game Fury of the Furries for DOS and Amiga, which was licensed to Namco and rereleased with Pac-Man instead. This game is a departure from normal Pac-Man gameplay involving mazes and ghosts, and is instead a platformer.

East-facing walls can be partially clipped into without ejection, provided there is a way to enter them from the top or bottom. While as far into the wall as possible, doing specific inputs with the rope activates the wall zip. This glitch zips Pac-Man to the next available open tile above the wall, and if this extends all the way to the top of the level he's either stuck at the top or placed out-of-bounds.

Once out-of-bounds, Pac-Man will automatically start zipping to the left, although the direction can be reversed by holding left (not a typo, the game doesn't want to obey you). Zipping speed can be increased or decreased by using the rope on specific frames. On certain out-of-bounds tiles, using the rope on top of them will trigger an exit.

The boss is still vulnerable before he gets the crossbow, and is actually killable, which skips the second phase! This produces the strange effect of a floating crossbow, and you have to be careful because the game doesn't agree with any of this and will severely glitch and lag if this isn't handled properly. Getting behind it and firing away is the safest thing to do. The third phase takes 12 shots normally, although some jumping has to be done so two stronger shots are charged while airborne. The jumping prepares us for the final phase, which is shooting the cage down. It's at around the maximum jump height and has 6 HP, so two minimum shots or one weakly charged shot will take it down.
