I do the smallest possible jump out of the WB logo and then do a small jump off the ledge to fall down fast. Using the paddle makes you fall quicker so I do that on the way down. The reason you want to fall fast is because you need to push the box from the left.

On paper the best strategy would be to turn around and hammer which gives you more horizontal speed and less height – perfect for getting under the light. However in practice, it was better to not hammer. I turn around when I hit the spikes to damage abuse to the right. I would like to damage abuse more but you will die I you get hit twice.

	"This was the most complex section of the TAS. To hit this boss, you kiss Pinky with Dot to stop Pinky lighting the bombs. Then you push the bombs with Wakko towards the boss then hammer them with Wakko to detonate them and damage the boss. I was usually able to shorten the push by positioning the character over the spot where the bomb will spawn, clipping it a bit to the right. If you’re quick enough you can get all 3 bombs from every set the boss throws and avoid waiting.
	$LF
	"The first half of the fight requires 8 hits on the boss. I get these by detonating bombs on it, and this phase is fairly limited in terms of timesave, just because I’m waiting for the bombs to spawn. The only thing to make sure of is that you don’t get too close to the boss, otherwise it will kick (slowing it down). Before landing the 8th hit on Phase 1, I wait for the 9th bomb to spawn. This lets me take it into phase 2 to save 17 frames over waiting for an extra bomb in phase 2.

	"Phase 2 is the bulk of the optimisation. You can damage the boss by detonating bombs, which is locked in speed based on how quickly the bombs spawn (like phase 1). But you can also make the boss take damage by having it kick itself with the legs.

	"The leg movement is very predictable. It will walk then jump forward after a short amount of time. But if you stand just in front of the legs you can get them to kick. The kick stops movement, so it usually slows the legs down, but you need them to kick to damage the boss.
	$LF
	"When the boss enters phase 2 it can go to the left or the right (it goes to the opposite of the side you’re on). If I made the boss go left, I could get the kicks in sooner but going to the right meant that the legs ended in the right spot to kick the boss. The legs kick the boss after you beat it to deal the finishing blow, so it’s advantageous to finish the fight with the legs close to the boss.

[div class=p 
	"My strategy was to have the boss torso fly to the right, then do damage with bombs, apart from 2 of the hits done with the legs. I can only get 2 because I get one hit on the way towards the boss, then make the legs jump past the boss then get one more hit on the way back from the boss. It’s extremely tight to get 2 hits and almost impossible to do without taking damage to get inside the torso. While all this is happening I also have to be optimally hitting the boss with the bombs. The boss has a large invulnerability period after being hit, so I had to delay the last bomb hit on the boss as it was too close to the leg hit.

[div class=p 
	"The last optimisation was in the path manipulation of the legs. They will always go left then right but if I just left them alone they would do a jump just before they turned around to the right. Normally they turn around quite early but this jump sends them way further left than they would naturally walk to. After the jump they still have to turn around and walk that entire distance right again, losing time. To solve this, I made them kick as soon as they spawned by standing in front of them. Since a jump always follows a kick, they jumped to the spot where they would normally turn around to the right. This was a much earlier turnaround then just leaving the legs alone and saved 160 frames over leaving them alone.
