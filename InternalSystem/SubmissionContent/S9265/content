	"It's a simple hockey game for Atari Lynx. Most games the player loses heavily, usually 2-8 or something like that. Winning is difficult because 1/5 of our players stands idle the whole match. But we got to do what we got to do to end input early. The outcome can be affected by selecting different teams. There are 20 teams to choose from. I tested all combinations starting from the quickest one until a winning solution was found. Because of a frame rule we can change teams 6 times while not losing any time. A winning solution was found in 4 changes, so the TAS is optimal.

	"{RR,RR} A SOFT LOCK! The game is frozen... Is "fastest soft lock" a viable category for publication? I think it is funnier than the normal category. Soft lock happens around frame 5233, but the input ends at 702. Link to the fastest soft lock run:

	"{RRR,L} WIN! Thanks to the frame rule no time was wasted on anything, so the input ends immediately when the game begins. The player uses no input after starting the match. No input was ever used on that ice ever again. I am not going to test more team combinations because input can't end any faster.

	"Some of the untested team compositions with 4-6 changes may or may not provide a more entertaining match (or shorter encode) while keeping the input length the same, so if a solution like that can be discovered then it would be preferred as the encode. If somebody wants to put the final nail to the coffin, then the combinations can be tested further up to 6 team changes before we lose one frame, but it is unlikely that a significantly more entertaining match can be found. Most of them will end up losing the match anyway.
