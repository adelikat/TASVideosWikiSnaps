	"Hedgehog Launch was a flash game released in June 2008, developed by Armor Games and programmed by jmtb02. This TAS uses version 1.1 (afaik, the latest version). The SWF file seen here was taken off of BlueMaxima's Flashpoint flash game archive, which contains the version released on Newgrounds. This is a bit of a silly TAS and simple to explain. Usually, you are restricted to the game window pull the launcher band down to launch the hedgehog, but with the libTAS input editor, you can set it to any coordinate value. In this case, I set the value up to the max mouse y value of 99999999 and lowest x mouse value of -99999999 (don't know if that's exactly how many nines there are but basically there's a lot of nines). Throwing the hedgehog at an angle does not lose any time as it will still take only one frame for the hedgehog to each the high enough altitude to trigger the final cutscene. It was mainly done to make it look more entertaining as the screen scrolls really far to the side to catch up to the hedgehog. So basically, the game does not limit how far you can pull the band... So... You can pull it 
	[b 
		"EXTREMELY FAR DOWN
	]b
	" and it will launch the hedgehog out of the atmosphere 
	[b 
		"INCREDIBLY FAST
	]b
	", beating the game within about a second after starting. Most of the time spent is waiting for the menu transitions and band to launch the hedgehog.

	"Also, for the one frame of actual launching, the hedgehog sprite is stretched really far across the screen because it stretches the sprite to the speed of the hedgehog (you can see this effect when you play the game normally). Because of the absurdly fast speed, the stretching takes up the whole height of the screen. It's horrifying. I may try the sequel to see if the same thing can be done. If there's enough support for the sequel, I can try to TAS that as well if I can. I may also try an alternate category of any% where launching must be done within the bounds of the game screen, which is normally how it should be.
