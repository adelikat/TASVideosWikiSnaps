]h3
[p 
	"Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge (known as Rockman World in Japan, and also known as Mega Man I or Mega Man World) is the first installment of Mega Man on the Gameboy. The plot is minimal - after being defeated in Mega Man and Mega Man 2, Dr. Wily swears revenge of Mega Man (again) and brings out some old Robot Masters from the aforementioned games, as well as the first Mega Man Killer robot named Enker, to do the job. Obviously, Mega Man defeats them all, defeats Dr. Wily yet again, and the world is safe again until the next game is released. Yes, it's a really plain plot.

[h3 
	" Improvements
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Bag of Magic Food's run, even though it's dated 2005, was very optimized. Most of the individual improvements here come from heavy subpixel optimization, and occasionally lag management, shaving off mere frames at a time. There are only a few instances where I saved time through changing strategies, and even those would save only small amounts of time.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There are some very significant improvements, however: it turns out that pressing A or B during certain frames of the pre-Wily Castle and pre-Wily Space Station cutscenes allows you to speed up some events of the cutscenes. In the latter case, it's even possible to skip a large part of the cutscene, saving over 15 seconds.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The next big difference is a change in boss rush order. Instead of Bag of Magic Food's Bubble-Heat-Quick-Flash route, I opted to go for Quick-Flash-Bubble-Heat instead. This was so I could use Quick Boomerang against Bubble Man to defeat him faster, saving several lag frames. However, it means the Quick Man fight became longer.
