	": JWinslow23, you have been submitting too many subpar TASes and no form of constructive discussion has taken place. Do not submit any more movies for the next week or else we will have to take away your submission privileges. You have the opportunity to discuss any game in the relevant game discussion thread so there is no need to make any submission for the next little while.
