	"You don't need to get Lucky (the cat) to beat the game. I guess I figured since Twisted Eye went out of his way to collect him, he is necessary. But yeah, he's not. In addition, not getting Lucky adds another death warp when I leave the cavern for the last time.

	"ALF's swimsuit generates in a random place (3 spawning locations). I had no clue it was random, so the past two TASes settled for suboptimal locations. Luckily, the new Master System boot-up screen changes the RNG to the optimal location on its own. Bonus.

	"It's a shame the last 2 minutes of the game are so boring. I think the rest of the game is pretty good for a TAS. It's pretty strategic and requires some mild luck manipulation and decent optimization. Too bad the game itself is horrible. In addition to the music being shit, the controls are super stiff. And sometimes the game just unavoidably freezes for a few seconds for no discernible reason.
