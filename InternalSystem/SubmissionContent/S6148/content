	"Top Gear is a racing video game for the Super NES, published by Kemco and developed by Gremlin Graphics in 1992. The objective of the game is to become the fastest driver in the world by racing other drivers across several nations. The franchise is unrelated to the TV series of the same name.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"It marks the first game in the Top Gear racing game franchise, and it is one of the first racing games to be released on the Super NES. This game and its next two sequels were created by the same developers as the similar Lotus series of games released earlier on the Commodore Amiga and Sega Mega Drive systems.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"The game became very popular in Brazil. It inspired Brazilian company Aquiris Game Studio to create Horizon Chase, whose soundtrack was scored by Top Gear composer Barry Leitch.

Even if some of those places have actual flaws, and tightening them up could lead to significant improvements (possibly), implementing those improvements won't be easy, as I said. This movie is already so much better than the previous attempt, and it beats my test times.
