	"Unlock Everything is a game where you play as a robot who has lost almost all functionality, and you must regain your ability to see, move, jump, and more throughout the game. This TAS aims to complete all three stages, beat the boss, and unlock the ending in as little time as possible. This TAS also completes the game starting from a new file, as opposed to beating the game in "time trial mode" which is how the RTA runners play the game.

	"Before we can start the game, we have to go to the options section of the menu and unlock the "start game" button. I press the s and down arrow keys on alternating frames in order to navigate through the menu quicker. After selecting start game, there's a long cutscene I can't do much to speed up.

	"This level is very slow paced compared to the later levels. There isn't anything super interesting I do to save time here. At the end of the stage, there is an unlock that increases your max health from 2 to 20. As you'll see later in the TAS, it is possible to skip some unlocks, but this one is too important to skip. Damage boosting in stages 2 and 3 saves more time than it would save to bypass this unlock.

	"The beginning of the stage has lots of cannons which are tricky to avoid hitting. Cannons can point in three different directions, and they will always try to point towards Libra. I time my jumps precisely to manipulate the cannons into missing me. After skipping the background images unlock, I do a damage boost to avoid waiting for the enemies to move out of the way. Enemies knock you back in the opposite direction you're facing, so I turn around the frame before I get hit to get knocked in the direction I want to go. I then pick up the buster cannon and buster ammo unlocks. In order to clear this section without slowing down, I have to carefully time my jumps and buster shots to be able to barely kill both cannons on the last possible frame before getting hit. After that there's a vertical section. It doesn't really matter how fast we do the first half of this section since there's a cannonball that we have to wait for it to move out of the way. Cannons aren't able to shoot downwards, so as long as Libra is below the cannon it will always shoot straight forwards, so there's no way to manipulate the cannons. After getting the key, I unlock the door and progress to stage 3.

	"Most of the platforming in this level takes place on conveyor belts. Doing each section optimally is usually pretty simple, I just walk on the right-moving conveyors and jump on the left-moving ones. The section with the crushers was tricky to do optimally though, and there are some counter-intuitive tricks used to save time here. I do two damage boosts to get through this section, and the rest of the level is simple up to the bossfight. I jump over the health refill unlock, which isn't required since I don't take any damage in the bossfight. The boss himself is also easy to optimize. He has a lot of invincibility frames after getting hit, so instead of constantly shooting the boss I just shoot him on the first frame he's vulnerable again. Sometimes the boss jumps into the air, and when that happens I shoot at the peak of my jump to hit him as soon as he's in range of my attacks.

	"It might be possible to go a frame or two faster in stage 3, but I don't think any major improvements are possible. Maybe there could be a route improvement where you skip the buster ammo and use extra damage boosts to get past the cannons in stage 2? That's the only way I could see any meaningful time being saved.
