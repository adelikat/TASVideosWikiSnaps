	"This is a TAS of a Fairly OddParents game... self explanatory. This is also the first sub (i assume) that uses endrift's new mGBA core on BizHawk... syncs just fine. The TAS is technically sub 37, but i can't seem to skip the BIOS intro...

	"This TAS uses a Gyro, which saved a bunch of time, and also screws up the Bronze Knee Cap.

With that said, after watching this movie multiple times and considering the feedback given in the thread, I've gotta be honest in declaring that this run needs another pass through to be up to site standards for publication.
