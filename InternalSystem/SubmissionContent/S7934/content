	"This submission is for WWF Wrestlemania for the NES, a "wrestling" game (which is really just a fighting game.) A pretty mediocre game overall which was saved by the composing prowess of the legendary David Wise. Come watch as Hulk Hogan squashes everyone and everything in his path.

	"We choose the Huckster for two reasons. One, it means we don't have to fight him. Two, his moves are well rounded between damage and speed. (Technically Bam Bam Bigelow has slightly stronger attacks but his critical flaw is that his kick is 4 frames slower than Hogan's AND for some reason BBB can't bodyslam anyone.)

	"We make liberal use of the bodyslam and pepper in some strikes in between. 0x0084 is a knockdown byte that counts upwards (and they heal 1 per 16 frames. Once it hits a certain number (variable by opponent and their health status) the opponent is knocked down. This is generally a *bad* thing because we can't hurt them when they're on the ground, and we can only pin when they have 0 energy. The bodyslam is technically an instant knockdown but they get up way faster from it so instead of using strikes to knock them down and get the long delay, we time attacks accordingly to get a few hits in and use the extra damage from the body slam as the move we would've knocked them down with anyway.

	"Another important mechanic is the "rage" meter. When you do a lot of damage in a short time the opponent gets enraged and starts to flash red. In this state they do more damage and take less damage from you. However, their attacks will cost them health in this state. This is most prevalent in the Andre fight where I get him red, dodge attacks and make him damage himself, hit him back to red etc. I also occasionally take hits that don't knock me down for positioning purposes.

	"The pinning in this game is a little wonky. The opponent has to have 0 energy and sometimes even if they do, you can't pin them. I think this is due to like, having slightly above 0 health but not enough health for it to display a bar. On top of that, the opponent can kick out randomly at any point. In the TAS we can influence that by adding inputs (I used select for this purpose) to ensure that they stay down. Pins are also subject to framerules of 70 frames per. If you see the 1 count disappear to the 2 count almost immediately, it means you barely caught the framerule. The longer you see the 1, the closer you are to the next one.

	"It's not shown in game but the characters have their own strengths and weaknesses. Ted DiBiase is a pushover with the worst stats. Bam Bam has higher than normal defense which is why he actually takes the longest. HTM and Macho Man are fairly standard, and Andre is strong but susceptible to making him miss often.
