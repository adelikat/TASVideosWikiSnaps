	"Mari0 is an exciting game about using portals to move a character named Mario to the end of the level. What many don't realize about this cute little puzzle game is that portals aren't even required to beat the game! This exciting TAS uses complicated tricks like walking quickly (henceforth known as "running") and flying into the air (henceforth known as "jumping") to beat the game in a surprising 2 minutes and 6.92 seconds.

	"We have to wait for all the piranhas because I can't run faster than they appear, and their hitboxes are larger than the pipe entry radius. Anyway I jump out of pipes on the first frame to reach running speed as soon as possible (can't be done while in midair) and narrowly avoid bowser to complete the game.

	": Hello noellekiq and welcome to TASVideos. Here, we strive for perfection in every aspect of our movies. It's not rare we get people submit their first movie as a badly optimized Super Mario Bros. movie. As is obvious to see, this run beats the current record by 170 seconds, so this is wrong. Next time, please submit a badly optimized SMB movie so we can brutally reject it and properly revoke submission privileges. Accepting to Gruefood.
