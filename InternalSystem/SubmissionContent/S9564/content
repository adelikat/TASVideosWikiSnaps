The only real difference I noticed between the versions is the text.  The english version of the game's text is slower overall. While most text can be skipped, certain parts cannot be.  One speedrunner estimated 10+ seconds on text speed loss alone compared to the Japanese version.  I do choose the default name Todd.  Time loss is minimal since there are only a couple sentences that fully spell out the name that is not skippable.

		"Size - How large it is in the photo.

While the "Red Dot" photos are sure signs of getting the Technique 2x multiplier, it is not necessary.  Positioning the camera very close to a pokemon but not getting the Red Dot lit up can still give the 2x multiplier as long as some part of the pokemon is within the larger white circle of the camera cursor.
		$LF

		$LF
	]li
]ul
[div class=p 
	"Square Head Theory - This is the idea that distance to parts of the pokemon in a photo are not relative to the view, but instead to the cameraman's head.  It is easy to see this in action by first taking a centered photo of moderately distant pokemon, then comparing that photo with one that has the pokemon off center.  In almost every case the off center pokemon gives more points for Size and possibly Pose.  Maximum off center points tends to be when an off center photo has the pokemon more towards the corners of the frame.  This off center method of taking photos is used for the majority of pokemon camera shots in this TAS.  
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Often when trying to get a larger size, line up the red dot with the furthest available pokemon part on the opposite side of the pokemon.  For instance with Pikachu, its head and tail are a good distance away from each other, but not all parts are good candidates to get a large Size score.  The tail is angled up and to the right which means the tip of the tail is the most distant part from the rest of its body.    
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"One notable example of this is Kangaskhan in Beach where both the size and pose can be much larger than normally taking a centered shot. In fact getting a Pose score at all is only possible using a very carefully positioned camera shot.

	$LF
]h4
[div class=p

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The main causes of lag are when there are wide area views with a lot of objects moving around.  The second part of Beach has a lot of grass with multiple pokemon moving around and is a laggy section.  Another particularly laggy section is the Tunnel room that can have many Electrodes and Kakuna at once.  River in the area with the Slowpokes and Shellders is quite laggy too.  In Cave, there are sections with multiple pokemon moving around in large areas which cause a good amount of lag.  So any part with lots of pokemon in wide open areas makes it important to limit the time spent looking at them.  Looking Up, or down while Zoomed in is the usual way to stop looking at laggy areas.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Also pokemon themselves can do actions which cause lots of lag.  Electrode's explosion usually causes a big lag spike.  Certain pokemon evolving like Charmander or Weepinbell cause particle effects that contribute to lag.
