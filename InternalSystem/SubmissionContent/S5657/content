	[a class=intlink href=/1741M 
		"Squirrel King

	", and a pretty bad one at that. The first two levels are edited, and the whole rest of the game (which is about 80%) is exactly the same as the linked publication of the game. Due to the amount of similarities, we can't accept this hack to the site. While this is enough of a reason to reject this submission, I also want to point out that the movie was made on a fixed dump of the ROM and does not sync on a good dump. The goal choice is questionable as well, since this run plays the 1 player mode of the game. The 2 player mode of the game is faster, more entertaining, and shows off more of the game overall.
