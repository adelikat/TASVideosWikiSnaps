	"Im guessing this is a lesser-known game, but ive seen a few people that wanted a movie of it. Its basicly a one(or two) player platform game except you kill enemies with your club or club + stones, cant step on ememies unless you have a special 'hard feet' power-up from one of the shops.(I never bother with this in the movie)
