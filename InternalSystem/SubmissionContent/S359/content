	$LF
	"Therefor it looks a bit strange in some places. For example

	"in the Dam I change to Don just before the end and then a
	$LF
	"bit later I change to Leonardo for a couple of seconds. Why
	$LF
	"didn´t I changed to Leo in the first place? This is because
	$LF
	"Don is the strongest turtle and I needed him to kill this

	"one enemy which I couldn´t manipulate. Ok, I could have
	$LF
	"avoided/killed/him with Leo but with the cost of time and
	$LF
	"fluency of my run. So I simply choosed the smoothest way to
	$LF
	"do it. Oh, also you might notice that Leonardo only takes one
	$LF
	"half square of damage! So why did I even bother to change to him?
	$LF
	"Simply because I had to. Those darn robots takes 1 whole square
	$LF

	"2. Those turtles jumps pretty far even with the low jump. So the other reason why I didn´t jump as much

	$LF
	"result of more waiting in mid air at the end of those conveyor belts.
