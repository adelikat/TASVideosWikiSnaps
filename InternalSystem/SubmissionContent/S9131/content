Now, I've decided to get this one out of the way. I know it is probably to dullest TAS I've every submitted, but I want to get the library completed for this magazine series.

	[li 
		"Play the game until you get the color right. By doing so, I had the pattern and entered it on the first try.

		"Buffer the inputs. (You can enter the inputs very early, which gets buffered into a specific range of addresses). I was able to back up the inputs, very very close, to the point where the game was initiated by the "Run" statement. This is the largest buffering cut that I have ever made in any B.A.S.I.C. written game.

The only way I can imagine this being faster would be to find a way to buffer the inputs even earlier; even then, that may not qualify as a gameplay improvement.
