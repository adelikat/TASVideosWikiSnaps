	"Most of the improvement came from luck manipulation. The block sequence is affected by operations (slide, rotate, drop) or pressing Select to show/hide the next piece. This makes it possible to get some but not all kinds of tetrimino you need without losing any frames. Actually, I just tried hundreds of fastest (or at most 1 frame slower) inputs of the single placement. I also made the platform like NES Tetris, so that I could save three frames per tetris. It's a small improvement, but entertaining to watch.
