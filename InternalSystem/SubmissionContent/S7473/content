		" A trick since New Super Mario Bros. Called wall kick to differenciate from wall jump - the glitch. To wall slide, be in air, have 0 or downwards Yvel, be near the lower part of the wall and face the wall. Wall sliding sets Mario to have 24 Yvel and can be used to fall down faster (0->24) or slower (69->24). It initiates a 5 frame window allowing wall kick. To wall kick, Mario must not be stuck in a wall and press A. It sets Mario to have 31 speed in a direction depending on which side on the block he is (not which side he is facing or sliding off), and -46 (upwards) base Yvel. Being close enough to wall slide but not bonking (1 pixel window) allows the bonus upward boost when you jump normally at high running Xvel to be added to the base Yvel (adding -2, -4, -8 for 3 Xspd levels). Used to scale walls quicker.

When Mario is moving at >=48 speed, the shell is kicked with a low low Xspd of 48, intended to allow Mario to catch up and shell jump. Regular SMB3 "Shell Ninja" is still used a lot in this run though. Additionally, being able to grab shells without kicking them when falling from above is extremely useful and stays in line with New Super Mario games.

	"This is definitely improvable. Just it takes a lot of time to do so, and save like 1 frame from better wall kicks. 1-6 is known that the 1st time can use the ducking wall jump used in the 2nd time. Not sure if 1-7 is the best place to take damage. In 1-9, maybe somehow there is a way to get the red shell to be in a spot where I don't have to slow down and avoid the wall kick. In 1-Castle, Bowser fight could be better but out of my knowledge. It might be stalling Bowser in the air for longer. Also I think I can skip getting the fire flower mid-level. At last, some lag might be able to be reduced. The improvement is up on you!
