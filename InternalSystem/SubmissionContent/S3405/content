	"I made this TAS to see how certain minigames would look. It could definitely be improved, but it is my first TAS. I did all of the minigames I unlocked minus the hard modes and I fooled around a little bit. I got good Brain Ages though. I did not have any objective in making this video; it was mainly for fun. In later TASes, I will make sure to improve this one. This game is based on the works of a Japanese man who studies the human brain, and it seems like the mascot of the game is this same man. You complete seemingly random exercises to get a rating called a "Brain Age." This is based on your speed and skill with memory and mathematics. I do not know why this game is so fun to TAS though, but I believe that it is because the game's glitchy input detection on the touch screen. And honestly, I cannot come up with anything else to type into this, because no matter how much I put into this box the content is always "Way too short." I really hope that that was enough filler right there to make the description not way too short. I do not have much more to say about the TAS, so I'll give it a try. *ahem* As I said before, this TAS was not meant to be any completion of anything; I was just having fun with TASing the game.

	"First, from an entertainment point of view, a TAS of this type of game cannot simply draw in the correct numbers or play the correct notes and call it a day. We already have a 
	[a href=/1734M 
		"Brain Age
	]a
	" publication as well as a 
	[a href=/3135S 
		"Brain Age 2
	]a
	" submission, both of which strive to be impressive and abuse the touch system to draw pictures. Because the TASVideos community has already been exposed to these movies, another movie would have to leave a relatively large impression to be accepted.
