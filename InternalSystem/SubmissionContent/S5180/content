	""What does this mean?" You may ask. Well, simple. It's time for more menuing shenanigans to get the AI to do what I damn want. The only issue in this game, is besides being 30fps, is that the start menu shows up much later, so there's the higher possibility of the AI attacking before I can reach the menu.

The timing I ended up using was frame basis so I can be able to compare the difference in fights which there wasn't any difference from what I found.
