	""What does this mean?" You may ask. Well, simple. It's time for more menuing shenanigans to get the AI to do what I damn want. The only issue in this game, is besides being 30fps, is that the start menu shows up much later, so there's the higher possibility of the AI attacking before I can reach the menu.

	"The second part of the manipulation is entering the next fight later than usual. This is why you see some "YOU WIN" screens for a little longer than expected just so it's possible to manipulate the AI in the next fight better.

	"Heck there's a 37"94 in there as well, and I was going for mainly 37"91 and 37"94 on the original v2 version of this TAS, but it wasn't working out. The timing I ended up using was frame basis so I can be able to compare the difference in fights which there wasn't any difference from what I found.
