	"Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame is a platform game originally released on PC (DOS) by Br√∏derbund in 1993. Unlike the first game (which has ported of a dozen other systems) this second game has only 3 ports: Macintosh (Released on 1994), SNES (Released on 1995), and a cancelled/unreleased Genesis version (This game is almost finished, except for one flaw/forgotten of Stage 9).

[div class=p 
	"The SNES port Prince of Persia 2 is generally regarded as a bad port of a very hard platforming puzzle game. The controls are clumsy, the puzzles are seemingly random, and the player dies very easily. The port also leaves out the last level. Fortunately there is a major bug in the game that allows large parts of it to be skipped. And this new TAS shows for the first time, new bugs exclusive of this SNES port!

	"Some days before submitting my Prince of Persia SNES TAS, I remembered of a glitch (discovered 6 years ago) that works only on lava when rising. And activing this glitch, it's possible to skip most half of Stage 5! And during my research to finding new ways to activate this glitch without lava, accidentaly I discovered 2 big new shortcuts! One of Stage 6, and other of Stage 7. After this findings, I started this TAS. During this work, I found much more improvements on this game than when was working on Prince of Persia 1.

In addition, the Sega CD version, if you pause during the game, you can change the speed of the game and the battles of 3 to 1, making the game faster than any other port.
