	"Here is my first submission using FCEU, played on the game Ninja Gaiden. This game is the first in a series of three games about a ninja named Ryu. The game follows Ryu's adventure as he sets out to avenge his father, who was killed by an unknown ninja. My main goal with this movie was to make this difficult game seem as easy as possible. I planned to acheive this by making my way though the game as quickly as possible, without ever slowing down. This however, is more difficult than it sounds; the developers of the game put enemies in locations where under normal circumstances would get in your way, and likely knock you down a pit. Infact, the developers went through such lengths to make this happen that some monsters in the later levels have been programmed to wait for you to get close enough before moving in to hit you down a hole!

		"The first bug which I exploit in the game can be found in stage 2-1, where I jump inside of a wall and use an invisible platform to boost me ontop of it. I use this exploit again later in 2-2 to jump to the top of the screen instead of climbing up the ladder. There is s similar trick where you jump through the corner of a wall and grab a ladder coming from the wrong direction, but I don't really see this as a glitch, but more of a feature.

		"A second major error in the game is the way the hitboxes are handled. This works both for me and against me. The hitboxes on the birds are higher than the sprite themselves, which creates some instances where I seem to jump threw, or even stand inside of a bird without getting hit. Most other enemies however have a hitbox which is much bigger than the sprite, which sometimes only leaves a window of one or two frames where I can jump over them without being hit. I get screwed again by the craziness of the hitboxes at some of the bosses; the best two examples being the boss of act 3, and the second last boss. The boss of act 3 can only be hit in the lower portion of the sprite, and the second last boss can only be hit in the upper part, which explains why I am not always hitting them.

		"In alot of places you can climb up and over the top of a wall. I use this to my advantage in 5-2, but most walls you can do this type of thing with. Some of the time you end up grabbing onto something in the inside of the wall, landed on an invisible platform, or even falling down a pit. Give it a try, it's easy enough to do on a console! 
		[b 
			"Of course, there are other walls which you can't climb high enough to get over/ontop of. These are usually the ones that I need to get on top of. An example of this can be seen in such places as 2-1 where instead of climbing all the way up a wall I must jump off of it onto another platform to get enough height to get ontop of what I was climbing

		"Some might think this isn't as entertaining as collecting/killing everything, but I beleive this is the type of game where this is not the case. If you have played the game you know that you can't just run through it, you must sometimes pause for enemies. Dodging these enemies can be extremely hard to do, such asthe birds, oh how annoying the birds can be. With this in mind, dodging and weaving through enemies without ever slowing down is quite a feat, especially in the later levels. Plus, killing an enemy takes a frame anyways, so technically dodging is faster, heh.

		" No enemies don't just die when they touch me! I'm using the button combination of down+b! Pushing these two buttons at the same time midair causes your sword to extend for a frame, which is how I kill some of the bosses so quickly. This also lets me save my jump-and-slash move, the sumersault move which I use to kill most bosses, for later instead of it being automatically used when I slash.
