		"Pac-Land
	]em
	" is a classic platformer in which Pac-Man must travel across his colorful cartoon world to return lost fairies to Fairyland. This isn't as leisurely as it sounds, as his rivals, Blinky, Pinky, Inky, Clyde and Sue are out to get him along the way.

[p 
	"A colorful platformer with simple physics. The original arcade game was released in August 1984 (before

	]em
	") and was quite popular from what I hear.

[p 
	"The game is divided into "trips". Each one is a trip to Fairyland to return a little lost fairy and go home with some super boots the Fairy Queen gives you.

[p 
	"Pac-Man can walk, run, and jump. When he is running, his jump goes twice as high, allowing him to reach platforms and ghosts that he otherwise wouldn't be able to. I always run in this TAS unless I need to slow down to land on a platform.
