	[a class=intlink href=/227M

	".

[p 
	"In 1990 another (Japanese) Konami team produced Snake's Revenge, without Kojima's knowledge, for Famicom. For whatever reason it only got US and Euro NES release. It was later revealed in an interview that Kojima was pleased with SR, and that it was SR that drove him to make Metal Gear 2 for MSX. He went on to develop the much more famous Metal Gear Solid series.

[p 
	"Complicating matters, Ultra Games, the US publishing arm of Konami, made up their own story for the instruction manual, including the laughably named character "Higharolla Kockamamie." They even mixed up their own portraits for two of the characters. Look at some other Ultra Games manuals, including the Metal Gear manual, to see the same practice of cavalier rewriting.
	$LF

[p 
	"So Snake's Revenge is not second-string spinoff produced to cash in on naive roundeye enthusiasm. It's a fangame that happens to be licensed, and produced by the same development house as the original.
