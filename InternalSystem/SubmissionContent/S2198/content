	"Improvement exist in levels 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7. In all these levels I managed to find shortcuts or timesaving route changes, with the most major one in level 3 where my route to the contact person was about twice as fast as in the previous run.

	"There where also some frames gained from better precision throughout the, this added up to a very minor gain. Some levels also could've been faster by a frame or two but due to frame rules they would've been canceled out.

	"Genisto for his run which was really impressive since I assume Memory Watch wasn't used. I also thank Walker Boh and Cheez whose heavy competition long ago on this game surely has done good for the later runs. Also thanks to TenguMan at vgmaps.com for maps of the levels that made my life much easier.
