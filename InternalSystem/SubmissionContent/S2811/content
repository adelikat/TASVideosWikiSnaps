	"I started hacking this game sometime in 2005, before I even joined TASvideos.  (In fact, it was the first game I ever hacked.)  When the subject of TASing it came up, I quickly came to the conclusion that the final boss would probably require a level somewhere in the 30s. While this is considerably less than what is needed in normal play, it still meant that the grinding involved would be excessive, and thus any TAS would probably be too boring for the viewers. Still, I supported any TAS attempts in hopes of being proved wrong.  Finally, in early 2009, Kirkq found that Gorsia could be defeated at a level in the early 20s, which meant that the required grinding would no longer be excessive. After numerous route discussions, we decided to collaborate on this TAS.

	"Here is a rough timeline of my experiences with the run.  I first TASed this game in December 2007, eventually performing a test run up until R Pison.  Around November 2008 some speculation began again on the thread and continued through February 2009.  In February 2009 Nitrodon and I began formulating a route.  This took a substantial amount of testing and planning to see what sort of levels and supplies we needed to beat bosses.  Around March 2009 we had a complete route for a TAS.  We reached Pandam in the run in June 2009, revised the route, and I killed the S Brains by August.  Due to the RNG manipulation needed to beat the Dragon, progress was halted for much of the school semester and then resumed in February 2010.  The last few bosses or the run were completed over the summer of 2010.  I apologize that progress was strung along over such a large time span, but it became very difficult for me to work with such tedious manipulation in large doses during school.

Nitrodon provided all of the game mechanics information necessary to allow the run to be played with a high level of precision.  While I may have done around 60-70% of the testing and execution, Nitrodon supplied 90% of the information.  It was a pleasure working with you, and I learned a lot that will help me to tackle future runs.  Hopefully we both learn to procrastinate less in the future.

	"On the overworld (or to a lesser extent in a dungeon) the RNG will increment very radically.  Differing step patterns create differing enemy patterns which cause differing incrementation patterns in the RNG.  Changing the path from point A to point B, while still maintaining a shortest path, is the best way to prepare the RNG for the next use.  Brief pauses can be a very useful way to only lose a few frames while preparing the RNG.  A suitable RNG is selected for engaging boss battles and recruiting apprentices with high stats.

	"Once a boss battle is entered, the RNG is no longer random; it is entirely deterministic.  It will ONLY change based on character and enemy actions.  Enemy action types are on a purely deterministic number generator initialized at the beginning of the game and dependent only on previous enemy action types.  Essentially the boss is set on using a certain attack type unless you adjust the previous battle.  We can only adjust the increment by one action at a time.  Typically, one extra action in the previous battle means that the next boss will start on what would’ve been his second attack.

He is easily the strongest early game character.  He and Wilme the Alien are the only characters that can beat Pison and Red Pison at low levels.  Lux also gets a large stat boost at the end of the game to help with the final bosses.  After some testing there was no doubt that Lux is the best main character.  Selecting the name "E" wastes no frames since there is one frame for free directional input before the 'A' button can be pressed.

The whistle kills Romus in one hit gaining us two levels.  It is much faster to kill Romus with the Whistle than it is to level up enough to fight him.  We look to acquire primarily power and speed in this run.  When leveling, Lux can get anywhere between 3-5 power and 2-4 speed.  We get max power and speed from these two levels.  Romus drops the Key of Earth, which opens the door in the next cave.  We expend about 30 seconds acquiring a Power Seed (raises power by 4 when manipulated) from a chest in the basement and a Potion 1 nearby.

Crossing a threshold in speed can mean the difference between a 30%, 50%, or 61% hit rate against a much faster boss.  Inside the next chest we open is an enemy Trick.  A Trick is next to impossible to beat at level 3.  It would kill Lux in one shot, and it has a 98% chance to connect.  The only way to kill it is B Power, Defend, Attack, Defend, Attack.  Defending increases the power of the next attack.  (Someone in Lemele tells you this.)  We would need it to miss us 4 times, which is impossible when the RNG is deterministic in battle.  We use the mirror from Lemele Castle to reflect a petrify by the trick, and it is manipulated to last 5 turns.  This was sp00ky’s idea originally.  The trick gets us to level 4 and drops a random gem.  We manipulate the 1/8 chance for an emerald (sells for 5000 Gold.)  We heal before engaging the boss Pison, our arch-nemesis or something.  The Pison fight is fairly straightforward and not too probabilistically unreasonable compared to the trick fight.  It gets us to level 5.

Apprentices are recruited with level-representative semi-random stats at your level plus or minus one.  Thus, we recruit Wilme at level 6 with the best stats possible.  Wilme’s stats were based on what RNG we entered town on plus each increment by an NPC walking.  Pauses in towns are used to manipulate the RNG either for apprentice stats or to get an NPC to move a different direction.

We choose to grind near Brush because the enemy spawn rate is higher than around Luze.  An S Brain encounter occurs 1/8 battles around Brush.  A vacuum has a 30% chance to connect against S Brains multiplied by our attack success rate based on speed (71%-98%).  Accounting for all of this gives a (1/8)*30%*71% =  2.6% chance of success.  We must also take into account that the overworld RNG is on a continuum, so we must manipulate the RNG in between each battle to get to the next successful kill.  Sometimes after entering a fight, we have to wait for the overworld RNG to increment on a ~1.5 second timer, so we mess around in the menu.  In the middle of this we we were required to set up apprentice locations and apprentice reactions.  We we able to manipulate the RNG to give us the perfect apprentice locations value out of 4096 possible combinations.  On the first trip we make our way towards Bilthem.  The encounter zone walking towards Bilthem ends roughly where we stop engaging S Brains, so we avoid enemies the rest of the way.  Perhaps we could’ve walked to Brush from Tiffana while engaging S Brains, but due to the mountains and water enemies don’t spawn as much.  Our encounter rate doing this would’ve been lower thus losing most (if any) time to be gained.  We grind S Brains around Brush from level 8 to level 20 with some extra experience left over.

	" Pison.  He spends most of the battle trying to lower our defense and eventually remembers to raise his own.  When playing this game normally, one can stall M Pison pretty heavily just by countering his debuffs with the Star Rune every turn.  Killing M Pison takes us to level 22, which bumps our next apprentice up a level.  This is the main level the run planned for.  We acquire the Moonlight in the cave.  The kind folks at Guanta would now remove the curse they placed on us, but that won’t be necessary.  Lux’s magic is pretty terrible at these low levels anyway.  We Wind Rune to Patrof.

	"Monmo the dragon is the next boss.  He is practically immune to everything but fire.  We use the Light Rune to increase Lejes’s magic power and the Sky Rune to constantly recharge him.  This is quite a long fight.  Because this fight had such limited strategy, Nitrodon was able to solve for a flawless fight with a script.  Later in the dungeon we finally fight Gariso.  Gariso possesses the final rune, the Wizard Rune.  We must use the Moonlight to make Gariso visible and vulnerable.  Gariso foregoes an action every time he turns invisible, so it is to our advantage to use the Moonlight as often as possible.  Lejes’s F Shield allows one character to completely block a magic attack (Not Vacuum or Effect spells.), making Lejes invaluable for the rest of the game.  We allow Gariso to heal at the end of the battle so that he doesn’t use more dangerous actions.  Healing is a bit separate from the traditional action increment.  We brought all the runes together and of course something terrible has to happen.  After the fight Gariso/Gorsia/Lemele knocks us out causing a fate we will learn later.

	"Well I guess the game isn’t over yet.  Now our runes have been taken away, making the game even harder.  We purchase Potion 2, Potion 3, and B Power.  Potion 3 heals max health.  We grab the hidden recovery near the shop and exit town.  A long walk to Ligena later we talk to the village elder and learn that Gorsia knocked us 5000 years into the past.  We manipulate the hidden cave in Ligena to be in the closest room, and sneak aboard the rich guy’s airship.  A couple slightly different scenarios can occur here with different characters.  We are on our way to the wealthy city of Melenam 5000 years ago.  Wait, wasn’t this city in a cave underwater?

	"Lux gets a power boost in Melenam.  We forego the "Infinite Stat Boost" glitch we discovered when we reached this part of the run.  We head to Palsu to get a letter for Tafuro in Melenam.  We buy the best weapons in the game in Melenam for Lux and Lejes.  Tafuro takes us to talk to Dr. Fail to discuss his project to fight Gorsia.  With a name like Dr. Fail, nothing could go wrong, right?  All we have to do is leave the lab and talk to one person in town and things have already gone bad.  Foma will wreak havoc on the world unless we destroy him now.  This battle involves a 50% hit rate with Lux and Lejes and a lot of F Shield.  The battles in this game now all require max buffs and plenty of F Shield.  Any magic attack at this point in the game will most likely kill us.  Foma was set up with a pretty terrible string of magic attacks.  This is offset later by some actual good luck.  The city sinks underwater like we found it.  We escape on the airship.

She does nothing but attack and petrify for the battle.  She has a fair chance to use deadly magic attacks, but the sun hath shown towards the end of this run.  Saro is the legendary guy of the past who has been fighting off Gorsia.  Now he leaves his problems to us.  We death warp back to the airship.

	"We planned extensively for this run, and it was very difficult to precisely predict our stats and how well we would be able to manipulate the final battles.  At the end of the run, we outdid our expectations to the extent that one of our earlier decisions proved flawed.  It ended up such that it was not necessary to return to the airship for a shopping trip at the end of the game.  Since this was finalized so late, and since we did not have an exigate to leave the penultimate dungeon, we were already committed to returning to the airship.  This lost us around 40 seconds.  If we had needed even one more potion for any of the final three bosses, the shopping trip would have been absolutely necessary and we would've made the correct choice.  With even more insane manipulations and boss executions, a non-glitched run could feasibly be achievable in under 1:45, but not much less.
