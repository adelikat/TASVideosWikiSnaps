	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"You can miss a maximum of four rings in the beginning then later on it is a maximum of three rings. 
	$LF
	"Due to the nature of a TAS, I didn't have to worry about missing any rings so I could use these rings to my advantage to save time by cutting corners and skipping the rings. In about 1-3 ring stages, I forget about missing some rings due to either being super far ahead to make any changes or time saved would have been minimal due to the monstrosity I have been dealing with to make this.
