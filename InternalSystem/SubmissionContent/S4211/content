	"To improve this movie ... Improved optimisation, save times in the input, Improved tactic in Mission 11 within training and better use of the glitch called "Design map glitch" and "Force surrender"

		"View-map-win
	]b
	": This trick saves me many time frames to implement it ... Step to explain: Operates when a mission is won, appears the display of "Win" and "Lose", then of counting the coins, before proceeding to the next screen to save the game or not ... it should view the map of the mission and not make animation for switching screens.

	": This means there is less delay in time to play the training missions and the campaign and with the help of mtvf1 find fewer delays to further improve the movie

		"Force Surrender
	]b
	": I took a better way to abuse this bug in the selection of some "Objects" or "Tanks", you should select the color of the enemy to this glitch work. In addition, after the first 2 missions, the object "Delete" is used and another glitch occurs for the glitch "Force surrender" continue to perform... However, to fight other enemies in particular, take an alternate color to work again this bug and win the game

	"There are several improvements that will be working right now, but I need to start again the run from the use of "Design map glitch" And at the end of a mission, I can improve the input ... It is working ...
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Also I am working on another run of Advance Wars, but without the use of "Design map glitch", a normal run, doing all the campaign missions, so do a little more entertaining the missions and the best strategy possible ...
