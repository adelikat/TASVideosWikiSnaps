	": This trick saves me many time frames to implement it ... Step to explain: Operates when a mission is won, appears the display of "Win" and "Lose", then of counting the coins, before proceeding to the next screen to save the game or not ... it should view the map of the mission and not make animation for switching screens.

	]b
	": I took a better way to abuse this bug in the selection of some "Objects" or "Tanks", you should select the color of the enemy to this glitch work. In addition, after the first 2 missions, the object "Delete" is used and another glitch occurs for the glitch "Force surrender" continue to perform... However, to fight other enemies in particular, take an alternate color to work again this bug and win the game

	"There are several improvements that will be working right now, but I need to start again the run from the use of "Design map glitch" And at the end of a mission, I can improve the input ... It is working ...

[p 
	"Also I am working on another run of Advance Wars, but without the use of "Design map glitch", a normal run, doing all the campaign missions, so do a little more entertaining the missions and the best strategy possible ...
