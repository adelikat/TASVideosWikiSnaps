	"In this game, you takes the role of Pitfall Harry Jr., son of the hero of the original game, who has to find his kidnapped father. Genesis and Super Nintendo versions of game are different because there are level layout changes and the Super Nintendo version has boss skip glitches.I think the controls of Genesis version are very good and responsive in difference from Super Nintendo version.

	"I used powerups, jump tehniques, tricks and shortcuts to do this speedrun more fast and entertaining. Also I used every collected exploding stones, boomerangs and sling stones. In level 8 (Mine Ride) I collected 150 gold coins (I think it is maximum possible result).

	[a class=intlink href=/1253M 
		"SNES published run
	]a
	" which is very similar to this. I don't think the inclusion of two extra levels is noteworthy enough to warrant a publication of this game on another console, so I'm rejecting this run. Better luck next time.
