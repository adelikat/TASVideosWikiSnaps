	"For a first TAS this is a very good and ambitious effort, but as people more familiar with TASing the game 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=have noted|href=/Forum/Posts/458261)
	", there are several issues with routing and optimization; especially the mashing (mainly using autofire at various speeds) loses a lot of time over the course of the run, often visibly so. There are also other occasional flubs, including sometimes stopping movement for no good reason. Because of these issues, I'm rejecting this run.
