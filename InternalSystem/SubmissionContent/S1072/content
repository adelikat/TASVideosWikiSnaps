	"If you don't count the four runs I've done for Super Demo World, this is my first run of Super Mario World.  I actually went back and forth on doing this project because the existing run was one of my favorites, even though it had a few places that could be improved.

[div class=p 
	"This is the first time I've done a run to obsolete an existing run that wasn't mine, which made me play a bit differently.  In addition to aiming for entertainment, I aimed to do things differently than the previous run where possible.  I also had to tailor my actions to make sure that the score I was getting was optimal for fadeout lag (this is described in more detail below).

	"The main sources of improvement came from a few new discoveries:
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		" Abuse of oscillating speeds
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[div class=p 
	"When Mario reaches a top speed and the direction is still being held, the variable that represents his speed actually oscillates between 3-5 different values, depending on the type of movement.  When in the air, the directional button can be released and Mario's speed remains constant.  This is heavily abused in the first four levels with continuous jumping (the hopping glitch), but also used in a few other places where there isn't enough space to get up to full running speed.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Another related technique that can be used is called 8/5.  (Credit goes to jimsfriend for this idea.)
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"It's a way to partially abuse Mario's oscillating running speed, while still keeping the "P-meter" charged.  In the air, releasing the direction for 8 frames, and then pressing it for 5 (together with X or Y) will bring Mario's P-meter back to full.  During the first 8 frames, the speed can be manipulated to the highest value, and the 5 frames afterwards simply go through the cycle of values once, putting it back at its highest value.
	$LF

[ul

		" Better understanding of fadeout lag
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[div class=p 
	"There are three different types of "fadeout lag".  The first is after a normal exit, when the black circle closes around Mario.  The second is after a boss, when the screen fades before giving the time bonus.  The third is during a key exit, while the keyhole is opening and closing.  The first two types seem to be determined by Mario's score, while the third is a combination of the score and the current sprites that are on-screen.  Although I don't understand completely how fadeout lag is determined, I believe I understand it well enough for the purpose of minimizing it.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Since score is a determining factor in fadeout lag, I would poke different values into the game's RAM to see what scores would help me the most.  Although I was already planning on doing the levels in a different way than the previous run, this gave me another reason to do so.

This happens because of the height they are at - Mario can fall through them, but not jump up through them.
