	": The amount of work one has to put into a TAS is not a reason in itself to accept of reject a TAS. Having to deal with a lot of routeplanning, lag reduction, luck manipulation and other things however does usually set the TAS apart from the speedrun. This TAS only differs from the speedrun in reaction time, which is even less of a difference than for instance minesweeper, where also the thinking time is avoided, and luck manipulation required. This is not the fault of the TASer, but the game. Rejecting due to bad game choice.
