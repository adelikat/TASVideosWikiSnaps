	$LF

	"This was a fun and pretty easy game to work on. I was thrilled to discover that you can zip and wrap when you are on a ladder. when you zip, you simply press left + right and to wrap you press left + right and up/down (depending on which direction you wanna move to). I think these glitches made the run more entertaining.

	": Unfortunately, these glitches only works on ladders and not on ropes and other materials.) About the last boss, maybe you wondered why I did not move towards him earlier for the second round so I could hit him early. The answer is that he will move cowardly backwards so I moved on the earliest frame to prevent him from doing that. Oh and maybe you noticed my swimming was not entirely optimal. Thats due to me manipulating those yellow ninja swimmers because they throw daggers at you and I obviously could not take another hit because I had only 1 HP left.

	": Thank you very much plusminus. Thanks to your suggestion, I managed to get rid of that long idling in the final area. Your idea saved me 898 frames :)
