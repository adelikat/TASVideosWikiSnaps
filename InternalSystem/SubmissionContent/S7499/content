This is the first game in the Wolf Clan series which is set in Native America, however, no sequel has yet been released. Nevertheless, the wolf swiftly makes it's way through this first trial in record time (without abusing the use of the

	"The idea is pretty simple: a wolf that can run, jump, throw a tomahawk and walljump - a fairly interesting set of abilities. In each level, the wolf has 4 lives that are refilled after completion. They are all basic platformers where the player must get from A to B except for the mini-boss fight halfway through in which tomahawks must be thrown at it when it is vunerable and the autoscroller of the final boss fight (see below for an explanation).

	"Despite being an autoscroller, there isn't actually any collision on the right side of the screen, making it possible to just skip past the entire thing (which I start doing towards the end to end the stage earlier than it's supposed to). I choose not to skip it all, purely because I have no way of seeing where the wolf is and knowing that what I am doing is close to perfect. It would also be not nearly as exciting to watch but if anyone would like to have a go at this, you are more than welcome; I would be very intrigued to see the final result.

	"Neat game, I like seeing these good quality homebrews get TASed. Not skipping past the autoscroller is fine as a speed/entertainment tradeoff, but I think a run that completes it as fast as possible off-screen would obsolete this. This game is just a demo, but there is no full version yet, so it's fine. If a full version is TASed, it would obsolete this movie. Accepting.
