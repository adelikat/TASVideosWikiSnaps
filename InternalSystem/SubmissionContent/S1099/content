	"This run beats Sonic Advance with Sonic+Tails, aiming for the 
	$LF
	"fastest in-game time on each level, then fastest real-time. 
	$LF
	"(No emeralds.) Sonic+Tails isn't a normal character option, they 
	$LF
	"are selected by pressing Up,Down,L,R on the other characters, so 
	$LF
	"technically this uses a cheat code. It makes it more interesting 
	$LF
	"to have a second character, I think, with manipulating a second 
	$LF
	"character on boss fights being good for a TAS. Besides boss fights, 
	$LF
	"Tails has no effect at all (he just gets left in the dust 
	$LF

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This was quite difficult to make because so many precise actions 
	$LF
	"have to be made while the character is far offscreen in order to 
	$LF
	"beat the levels as fast as possible. I worked around that by 
	$LF
	"watching Sonic's position in VBA's memory viewer, and eventually by 
	$LF
	[a class=intlink href=/Forum/Viewtopic.php?t=3938&start=13 
		"hacking a "sonic cam" option into VBA
	]a
	" 
	$LF
	"to keep Sonic always onscreen (this was pretty complicated to do 
	$LF
	"without desync because the camera position drastically affects the 
	$LF
	"gameplay). It's possible to make an AVI with this of what it looks 
	$LF
	"like when you can actually see Sonic all the time, for example,

	$LF
	"There are a lot of opportunities for glitching this game in a TAS. 
	$LF
	"Most of the glitches involve doing an ultra spin-dash 
	$LF
	"(hold down and press the A button 11 times as fast as possible) 
	$LF
	"and are mainly good for horizontal movement, making vertical stages 
	$LF
	"relatively slower. You might be surprised at how well Egg Rocket 1 
	$LF
	"turned out, though (if you've ever played it before, you'll know 
	$LF
	"how ridiculous a sub-1-minute time on it is), and I was definitely 
	$LF
	"surprised by how that level ended...
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Depending on the path, it's possible to skip the loading of the 
	$LF
	"collision boundaries for the rest of the level. Usually that's bad
	$LF
	"because it means you fall through the level to the bottom and die,
	$LF
	"but I manage to take advantage of this in Egg Rocket 1. That glitch
	$LF
	"required extremely precise positioning, by the way (it needed to be
	$LF
	"literally subpixel-precise, and was very unlikely that I found it).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Interactive objects in the level, such as springboards, enemies, 
	$LF
	"item boxes, or the goal, don't have any effect offscreen. Thus, 
	$LF
	"I can't bounce off of springs, be harmed by enemies, get items, 
	$LF
	"or complete the level until I allow the camera to catch up. Loops 
	$LF
	"and other places where Sonic is supposed to pass behind part of 
	$LF
	"the level also don't work offscreen (they count as walls then, 
	$LF
	"completely halting Sonic although they can be glitched through 
	$LF
	"like other walls). When an interactive object is onscreen, it makes
	$LF
	"it impossible to glitch through it into a wall (the game teleports
	$LF
	"Sonic back to where he started a little while after going through).
	$LF
	"Somewhat surprisingly, rings can be collected offscreen like normal.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In Angel Island 1 and (more noticeably) Cosmic Angel 2, I'm able to
	$LF
	"move up or down a small amount by spin dashing or attacking while 
	$LF
	"inside a wall. Normally this doesn't work, but it worked there
	$LF
	"because I had entered the wall directly from a sloped surface (which 
	$LF
	"is rarely possible).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Different wall tiles have different properties for glitching. The 
	$LF
	"Angel Island ones were especially bad for having lots of the tiles 
	$LF
	"that cause you to get stuck. The hardest levels to do were: 
	$LF
	"Egg Rocket 1, Casino Paradise 2, Cosmic Angel 2, Angel Island 1. 
	$LF
	"Besides exploiting programming errors in the game, this run also 
	$LF
	"manipulates randomness on most of the bosses. The final boss in 
	$LF
	"particular was a pain to manipulate.
