	"This is a run using Bass on Hard Difficulty. I installed the DLC that unlocks Bass as a playable character, and started from a save that has completed the game once already in order to allow access to Hard Mode. For this run, I use Bass. He has several abilities that contributed to the speed of this run.

	"Obviously, this is definately the best ability for speed. Bass' dash is alot faster that running, and his increased speed is retained during jumps.

	"Bass is equipped with an 8-directional automatic buster, and up to 4 shots can be on the screen at once. However, the damage is halved, and he cannot fire while running. He must jump or remain planted.

[p 
	"I use the same tricks that I used in the run with Mega Man. Please refer to http://tasvideos.org/3157S.html for more information. There are a few tricks that are specific to Bass.

	" Treble Buster
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The damage on Bass' main arm cannon has been halved in order to balance the upgrades. But there are times I need the full power of the buster. In order to achieve this, I switch to the Treble weapon. After calling Treble, every shot is the same as Mega Man's buster. As long as I don't touch Treble, I can use this alternate buster.

	" Knockback Cancel
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"As I mentioned, Bass suffers no knock back effect when he takes damage while in Treble Form. to take advantage of this, I simply fuse with Treble slightly before I need to take a hit, cancel out of Treble form, and continue.
