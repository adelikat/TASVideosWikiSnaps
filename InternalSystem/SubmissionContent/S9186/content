	"Putting 4 bombs in a 2x2 square causes them to fuse together into a big bomb, which always explodes in a 10x10 square. However, the game checks for fusions after checking for detonation, so creating a 2x2 square while simultaneously completing either of the lines it occupies won't get you a big bomb before it blows up. If there are multiple possibilities for a 2x2 big bomb (e.g. a 3x2 rectangle of small bombs) then the game fuses the highest 2x2 possible, with ties within the same rows broken in favor of the leftmost square. Creating a big bomb also adds 1 point to your score for the level.

Just note Just note, any future submissions that include all 60...will obsolete this TAS. It is weird though, how this game provides a credit screen after 30 rounds.
