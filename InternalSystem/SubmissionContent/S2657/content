	"Luck was manipulated for the purpose of directing the norsa soldiers in desirable ways like firing later, and all of them standing to fire, where ever possible.  Also was used to manipulate the code, to have 4 as the minimum digit.  (Saves 24 frames over 1 as minimum digit.  for my purposes, 0 counts as 10, since it is on the far right.)  The Ideal door code for any given room, is 7-8-9-0, as it takes the fewest frames to enter.
