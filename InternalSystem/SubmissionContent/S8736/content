	"B.C. Story is a 1997 arcade game, made by Korean company SemiCom. It is essentially their go at making a Track and Field game, but set in the prehistoric era. It consists of ten challenges, ranging from sprinting to blowing air up a dinosaur's... Anyway, I aimed to get the highest score possible in this game, while also accounting for time. This is why most of the second attempts are me messing around or just failing. I will be playing as Sonlo the caveman, as he is the first option, the character selection makes no difference, and I want the internet to see as little of Milo as possible. I will be comparing my scores to those found on lvlupscore.com, as that is the one place I can find high scores of this game. the link to the page is

The highest I got was 829.73m, and that's all well and good, BUT the page I was comparing times to on lvlupscore.com, has a score of 830.27m from Siliconian, a trusted member of the website. Trust me, I toiled long and hard with trying to match or beat his score, but it doesn't seem physically possible. My best guess is that it's improper emulation, as the music is very slow for some reason. If I have missed something, tell me, and I will fix it immediately, as I do have a track record for messing stuff up somehow. In the second go, Sonlo falters for too long and is squashed.

If you do this three times in a row, you get two free climbs that do not require the gauge. You have to press 1 for the left gauge, and 2 for the right. I managed to get 259.07m, which is higher than my record on lvlupscore of 243.58m. In the second go, Sonlo is having trouble climbing, so decides to wiggle back and fore on the vine. For some reason

	"In this game you blow up- okay you know what I'm not actually gonna say what happens, watch it for yourself. To do this, you pump the gauge to the top by pressing the 2 button, and blow into the "balloon" by pressing the 1 button, putting the gauge back to the start. The "balloon" travels for such a long distance that the counter loops back to 120.32m. It's actually 1203.2m, but the score counter acts strange when it runs over. This is higher than the lvlupscore, which stands at 1112.85m. In the second go, Sonlo feels a bit... uneasy, and so hyperventilates and eats his hands, while the dinosaur makes an escape attempt.

In the second go, Sonlo feels a bit more generous, and lets Milo win. Despite winning the second go, Milo still cries at the end. Also, Sonlo's tool suddenly drops further into the log at one point for no reason. How odd.

You need to jump as late as possible on them to maintain lots of speed, except for the last one, where you should jump off as early as possible to reach the end sooner. Sonlo reaches the end in 7.78, faster than lvlupscore's 8.28. For the second go, it seems Sonlo only read the first step, and so plummets to his doom in the fastest time possible.

	"This minigame relies a lot on RNG. You hold the 1 button down to aim your throw, and let go to drop the rock. You want to kill green dinosaurs as much as possible, as they are worth more points. Therefore I prioritised them. You want to hit the dinosaurs square in the middle, as that is what gets you the most points. Also, you want the dinosaurs to be as far down the screen as possible, because despite the fact that dinosaurs further down the screen give you less points, the quicker charge up time means you still get more points per time. In the first run, I originally got something around 84,000, but in the next go I got 92,500. I changed the first go so that I miss the shots slightly, meaning my score is not a new high score, meaning we don't need to do the New High Score animation twice, saving 4-5 seconds. 92,500 is far better than the lvlupscore of 52,800.
