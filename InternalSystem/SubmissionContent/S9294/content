	"The third period referee manipulation does not matter. We can make a goal at the end of the 2nd period when the timer is 0:00. There is a 4-frame window, so it is not super hard to do. Now the cheering animations and the face-off are skipped and the starting of the 3rd period is not delayed. Since we already made the goal we can end input after pressing start to begin the 3rd period. This saves about 160 frames compared to making the goal in the 3rd period. I almost get a headache. These games are almost too complicated.
