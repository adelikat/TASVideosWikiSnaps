	"King's Bounty is a turn-based strategy game. The objective is to recover the Sceptre of Order. Map pieces that reveal the location of the sceptre are gained by defeating villains and finding special artifacts. A normal play session would involve exploring four large continents and battling hundreds of creatures, but in this movie nobody gets killed and everyone is happy. After the game begins (at frame 585) it takes 25 frames to complete it.

	"{11,5} would be the perfect coordinates, but a) I'm not sure if the sceptre can be under the starting location and b) it may take more time to manipulate that than it takes to walk to the location I got, {11,4}.

	": Accepting this run.  The response is good and the run shows amazing luck manipulation.  This should be the easiest job an encoder will ever get :p  Hell, compressing the .png screenshot will probably take longer than the .avi.  Come to think of it, there isn't much to choose from in the screen shot considering only 25 frames of gameplay :p
