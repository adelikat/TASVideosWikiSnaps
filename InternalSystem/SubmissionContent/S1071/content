	"No hits taken. Aims for fastest time, entertainment. Hardest difficulty.
	$LF
	"A variety pack of interesting levels. From football to western to space, this has it all.
	$LF
	"The speed burst makes for both an interesting speed run, as well as a great attack. Notice that while jump/speedburst, you can be practically invincible by manipulation. Also, when speedburst is out, walk and attack is much faster than normal walk.

	"Level 1: 
	$LF
	"Manipulated Dizzy so he could be fed three snacks in a row, before he went hyper. This was the max.

	"Level 2:
	$LF
	"Somewhat boring level. I tried to make a few things interesting, like hitting the robbers both on the same jump, doing a few cool tricks.

	"Level 3: 
	$LF
	"My favorite, for good reason. A few tricks are used, If the teetertotters are used properly, buster can manipulate himself to be a red ball, and rocket upwards without having to wait for the ball to come back down. 
	$LF
	"The boss took the most manipulation of the game. He throws both screws and bulbs, however only screws hurt the machine. He throws as soon as he is hit, so I have to hit, wait for 3 screws, hit him again, and then hit all the screws so they fly back at the machine. The machine takes 5 hits at a time, quite an accomplishment.

	"Level 4:
	$LF
	"The ball is downed at zero yard line. This is so the counter only counts 10 stars, and not 110. I purposely jump around to maintain the "No hits taken" may add a few frames, but I think worth it to keep in the feeling of the video.

	"Level 5: 
	$LF
	"Originally, at the begining of the level, Hampton would pilot a plane in circles, handing out bubbles to jump on. However, since Rabbits can fly, this is completely unused. 
	$LF
	"Also, note that once I leave the slow moving blimp, I never return. This was purely for visual affect.

	"Level 6: 
	$LF
	"Flying was used again at the beginning of the level, saving on ladders and lots of useless level. The final boss seems to have "misses" in it, however, he is invunerable after a hit, until he drops to the bottom of the screen. Once he leaves the gun, he never returns. No misses happen when he is vunerable.

	"Bonus Levels:
	$LF
	"Really annoying. Hampton level was manipulated every time, to end the bonus as quick as possible.
