	"Pepper II is an arcade video game developed by Exidy and published in 1982. Despite its name, there was no predecessor named Pepper or Pepper I. As in Amidar by Konami and Stern Electronics, the goal is to color the lines on a grid; each rectangle is filled-in after being completely surrounded. Coleco published a port of Pepper II for its ColecoVision home system.

	"I've been looking at this game for some time, and I finally decided to sit down and get this done. It was a fairly easy TAS, due to many other Colecovision games I've TASed, and other similar strategy games. In addition, this game had very limited AI control which fortunately was enough to make this game do what I wanted it to. One point to making this faster, was to avoid attacking the enemies...as it paused for a moment.
