		" The automated section that surrounds a loop path has a special property that pulls Sonic if he performs a jump dash while in its area. However, if Sonic is not above the loop’s platform in the moment this happens, the game fails to pull him to the loop and keeps pulling him down (relatively to his gravity) while the jump dash is still active. The speed that Sonic is pulled down grows quickly and allows him to cover great distance with it. As there are a lot of different spots that the game tries to pull Sonic into, the trajectory that Sonic goes looks quite random.

	[dd 
		" Normally when a teammate is hit while in the flight formation, they will be knocked out of the formation and fall on the ground. However, if the player performs a flight and gets Sonic hit on the first frame that Knuckles touches the ground, a weird state occurs. Sonic will be knocked out of the formation and fall on the ground, but performing another flight will cause Knuckles to attempt to latch back onto Sonic, as if he is still in the flight formation. Within this bop boost, there are several different mechanics that allow us to save time.
		$LF
	]dd
]dl
[ul 
	[li 
		"Instant speed - After getting Sonic knocked out of flight formation, performing another flight and holding A will cause Tails and Knuckles to warp back to wherever Sonic fell. Once they are teleported, Tails’s vertical speed is translated into forward speed. This can be used to more quickly navigate to a setup for the next component of the bop boost.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Wall interference - As was mentioned, performing another flight will result in Knuckles and Tails warping back to Sonic’s position. However, if there is a wall in the path between Sonic and Tails that is interfering with Knuckles and Tails warping to Sonic, then an unusual behavior occurs. Tails will begin to move away from Sonic perpendicular to the wall of interference, proportional to the distance between Tails and Sonic at the start of the flight. Tails will stop moving once Sonic is no longer stunned on the ground. This means that the distance that we can get Tails to move is limited, however it can be extended even further.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Multiple wall interferences - If we perform a bop boost and get a second wall in the path between Tails and Sonic, the aforementioned proportionality will reset, and the new wall will be used to calculate how fast Tails moves. In other words, we perform a bop boost and Tails moves at a certain speed; causing a new wall farther away from Sonic to get in the way causes Tails to begin moving faster and therefore farther. This is used in a few stages to skip much more of the stage than is normally possible with a single wall.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Sonic&Knuckles bop boosts - Causing both Sonic and Knuckles to get hit on the first frame that we land on the ground causes certain behaviors to change. It’s important to note that this aspect of bop boosting is still not entirely understood. For one, flying after getting Sonic and Knuckles knocked out of formation does not cause Tails to snap to Sonic’s position. In addition, the flight hitbox is smaller, as Knuckles is no longer in formation. This allows us to squeeze through the bottom of a wall at the end of Grand Metropolis. In addition, the Sonic&Knuckles bop boost allows us to instantly translate our forward speed to negative vertical speed upon hitting a wall above the Grand Metropolis goal ring. This variation is only used during Ocean Palace and Grand Metropolis.
		$LF

]ul
[dl 
	[dt 
		"Door Clip
	]dt
	[dd 
		" After building up enough speed, you can kick with Sonic and then swap to Tails to clip through doors. This occurs because Tails just barely goes through the door, resulting in Sonic and Knuckles being brought through the door with Tails.

		"Pinball Table Character Switching
	]dt
	[dd 
		" Whenever you switch formations on a pinball table, rather than continuing from your current location, you are instantly warped to the position of the character you are switching this to. We can use this, in addition to a few other mechanics, in Casino Park and Bingo Highway to skip tremendous portions of both stages.

[dl

		"Rail Acceleration
	]dt
	[dd 
		" By holding B on a rail, the current character starts crouching and boosts forward. By switching back and forth between Sonic and Knuckles while holding B (with one frame of delay so the crouch animation happens), it’s possible to use both character’s acceleration for a greater resulting acceleration. Furthermore, after getting around 9 units of forward speed, the best method to keep building speed is by switching between these same characters with no frame of delay. However, when the forward speed reaches around 13 units, it’s optimal to stop switching characters and crouch as Sonic.

		"Triple Punch Cage Clip
	]dt

This will result in the player obtaining a lower in-game time for the boss fight when using the same exact movement as with the original timer start. RTA individual level runs abuse this mechanic, however it is not faster for real-time. This trick results in our boss fights sometimes having a slower in-game time, namely the Team Rose and Team Dark fights.

There are quite a few gaps in the beginning of the stage that can easily be traversed by building up speed and then gliding. Likewise, there are several times we need to build more height, which can easily be done by gliding into or jumping into slanted wall collision.

For the next section, we were able to use a flight accel jump to quickly get up to the next platform. 23 seconds into the stage, the slanted ground allows us to jump up faster than normal as the gravity vector is shifted sideways. As for the bop boost, we were able to move Tails to one of the turtles up ahead.

After clipping through the next few doors, we can perform a bop boost. Because we are on the ground when Sonic is no longer invulnerable, we instantly jump to a speed of 32 units/frame, though it’s short-lived due to the spring pad. To cancel our height after the spring pad, we can do a triangle jump and cancel it. Instead of using a blue tornado with Sonic to get onto the pole, we made sure to get level 3 Sonic, which allows us to simply jump dash to activate the pole. To get off the top of the pole, it’s fastest to perform a jump dash, as the normal animation is slow. At the end, we performed a bop boost with Sonic and Knuckles. This allowed us to squeeze underneath the bridge wall, allow that wall to get in between Sonic and Tails, and make it to the goal ring. In addition, as was mentioned in the bop boost details above, we were able to turn our forward speed into downward vertical speed.

To skip the looped paths, we can glide and bounce off of the top of the loop to maintain our height and speed. As we flight accel jump our way throughout the rest of the stage, we also want to reach level 2 Tails before the elevator sections. Level 2 Tails can one-shot the elevator enemies, allowing us to clear them out in just enough time without the elevator slowing down. The elevators were fun to work on because we could mess around as much as we want, including seeing how far below the elevator we could fall and still get back up. At the end of the elevator sections, we use thunderboosts to get back up to a fast speed. At the very end of the stage, we were somehow able to somehow cancel the vertical speed from the spring and instead land on the floor right away.

	"Explanation for the second pinball table: This setup is similar to the first one. We let Tails fall for a bit, then we jump with Knuckles and press B right before landing. This causes Tails to very briefly spin around Knuckles far out-of-bounds. Punching then allows Tails to continuously fall at an incredibly fast rate. Jumping then causes Tails to spin around Knuckles in a circle, with one caveat: Tails is snapped to Knuckles height, and the radius of Tails spinning around Knuckles is proportional to the distance between Tails and Knuckles right before the jump. Since Tails was incredibly far below the map before the jump, Tails spins around Knuckles in a circle of radius ~7258 units. Once we land on the pinball table, Tails stops spinning. Thus, we timed the jump such that Tails is in a position that is very close to the goal ring, such that we can simply land right on top of it.

	"To first get Tails to start falling, we had to switch to Sonic right before hitting the spring. Though Knuckles lands on the ground earlier than Sonic, we need Sonic to be near Knuckles in order to start a triangle dive. Otherwise the triangle dive will not start for quite some time. Once the triangle dive has started, then Tails will be brought towards Knuckles. Then he can begin to fall downwards. This skip is very similar to the second table of Casino Park, however the goal ring is much farther away, and as such we need to account for that when setting up Tails’s rotational radius. Tails will only fall for about 1400 units before ceasing falling. To compensate for this, we can remain on the pinball table, which allows Tails to continuously fall until we land on a platform. Once he is far enough below, we again translate his difference in height into rotational radius and fall onto the pinball table to teleport to Tails. With all of this set up, we can simply fall straight to the goal ring.

For the first two waves, our fastest strategy is to perform a series of jump dashes such that Tails and Knuckles follow behind Sonic to finish off each enemy. After manipulating two Tails level-ups, we can just use a thundershoot to one-shot each enemy in the third, fourth, and fifth waves. By this point, we’ve now manipulated level 3 Knuckles, so from this point onward we can triple punch to kill all enemies in each wave. Towards the end we got out-of-bounds of the stage, but sadly we couldn’t fall off, as the boss fight would reset.

Interestingly, we didn’t have to go into a flight for the second bop boost. Seemingly, a bop boost state can be obtained without flying because Knuckles rejoins the flight formation on the frame that we touch the ground. From there, we can bop boost directly to the goal ring.

This bop boosts allows us to quite literally just skip to the end of the stage. The bop boost setup takes a small bit of time, as we need to lure to egg pawn close enough to the edge of the platform to allow Sonic to fall below onto a lower platform. Only then can we cause a wall to exist between the path of Sonic and Tails. Unfortunately, the cannon is cycle-based, so this stage can’t be optimized very much.

Because we got part of the sloped wall in our way, we were actually able to build height throughout the bop boost, since the normal vector between the wall and Sonic is upwards. This height wasn’t completely necessary, but was a nice touch to make it to the goal ring. Aside from that, we also needed to make sure we activated the bop boost in a position that barely made it still work. This makes the game think that we landed back on the platform where the bop boost was initiated, preventing the flight state from activating.

We’re not quite sure how, but we managed to clip straight through the floor of the loop to perform this. We then spent several days trying to land on the next platform to skip a few vines. When the gravity vector is shifted, you have to maintain a speed of 5 units/frame, or else the gravity vector resets to normal. We had to do precise movement midair to maintain this speed long enough. After gliding through a portion of the stage, we were able to set up another bop boost. We angled the bop boost such that we can land inside a tunnel up ahead. From there we can set up another bop boost that lands us inside the vine section. This bop boost took a few days due to avoiding invisible walls and to get a good landing spot.

	"There’s a possible bop boost at the start of the stage, but due to the amount of falling after the bop boost, it’s faster to just take the teleporter. This stage is interesting in that to allow for the teleporter stage-flipping mechanic, there are actually two parallel versions of the stage. We can take advantage of this and bop boost through normally unexplorable portions of the stage to land back on an up-right portion of the stage. 25 seconds into the stage, we can use a fire dunk right before approaching a rail to instantly cancel our vertical velocity. From there, we can glide and use an inverted bounce to reach the next teleporter. Afterwards, we can use a thunderboost and glide off the downward-slanted path to maintain a pretty fast downward velocity into our next bop boost. We had a theoretical bop boost angle that would allow us to skip the tunnel before the end of the stage, but the bop boost drops us off very far away from the stage such that we fall for too long to save time. Approaching the downward section, we can latch onto the rail last minute to avoid falling away from the ground. We were able to clip through the first quarter-pipe to save a few frames, however after days of work we were not able to clip through the remaining two quarter-pipes. These pipes seem to have identical collision, so it’s theoretically possible to clip through those too.

It was theorized that we could reach the Team Chaotix section from this bop boost, which would allow us to reach the last section of the stage right away, however that room cannot even theoretically be reached due to the angle that the bop boost sends us. However, we were able to clip through the next few doors to reach a room not normally accessible to Team Sonic. It drops us off right before the bobsled, saving a few seconds over the normally intended route. After the rail section, it was faster to switch to Knuckles and rotate Tails around to trigger than bobsled than to take the rail normally. At the end, we can use a triple punch cage clip to activate the teleporter much earlier than intended.

	"For the first wave, we had to simply jump dash to kill all the enemies. This was a bit tedious, as it was a bit harder to control Tails’s and Knuckles’s movement due to there being so many enemies in close proximity. For the second wave, a simple triple punch is enough to kill them off. For the third, we initially thought that a triple punch would work best, however jumping on top of the cage and then fire dunking ended up being substantially faster. The turtles were quite tedious to deal with, as a triple punch won’t take them out. Instead, precise jump dash movement allows us to take out each of the turtles instantly with level 2 Sonic. For phase 4, we had to do several fire dunks since the egg pawn spawns are staggered. We were able to finish the wave a bit earlier by flying up and hitting the last pawn with Tails. The next few waves can be quickly finished with triple punches. Once we take the last teleporter, we can one-shot all enemies with precise thundershoot movement. Afterwards, we can do a triple punch with some jump dashes while riding the rail to take out all enemies. For the wave before the final cannon, it ended up being faster to use a team blast than to repeatedly triple punch. This is because the egg pawns spawn very high up in the air, and a team blast is able to reach the last egg pawn earlier than a triple punch does. After taking the cannon, the team blast cooldown allows us to do a series of jump dashes incredibly fast to damage all enemies of the next wave, thus ending Robot Storm.

From there, we can abuse level geometry to make it to the top of the ship. Kicking along the perimeter allows us to avoid having to flight accel jump above the door. After the first fan, we were able to jump before gliding to gain a bit more height than normal, allowing us to reach the next fan a bit quicker. From there, we can bop boost directly to the end of the stage. We finish off by using team blast the frame before the ship blows up, resulting in the stage going black.

If we fall out-of-bounds but the Egg Emperor dies while Tails is falling, the death sequence is interrupted and we can reach the credits.
