		" Main objective here is to show an alternate way to complete all levels in the unlicensed version of Felix the Cat, especially in levels 1 and 7 where you normally have to beat the boss in order to finish them. This method implies exploiting a glitch where if the player is close to go off-screen to the right, it'll autofinish the level.

	"How the 'glitch' method was used in the movie: basically the player requires timed jumps while moving forward, plus using the attack button while jumping in most cases. As long as it is done properly (by avoiding walls where possible), it'll place the player at a farther distance than the normal centered position, slowly reaching the right border of the screen.

	"Sadly the glitch cannot be done at the 4th level (underwater) because of the high amount of walls and enemies covering some narrow paths there. Damage was intentionally taken to save time by completing the level with Felix's initial form.
