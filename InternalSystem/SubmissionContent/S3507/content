	": Hi and welcome to TASvideos.org. Your run is not really up to our standards. You do not use all the known tricks. Additionally, Super Mario Bros. is rather played out, and pretty much every doable category has been done. I'd suggest choosing a different game if you plan to submit in the future. To prevent this category from being submitted again, I'm rejecting on goal choice.
