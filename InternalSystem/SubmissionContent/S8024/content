	"Little Green Blob is a 2023 homebrew game featuring a blob's adventure through a series of 20 rooms. As it makes it's way to the finishing flag at the end of each level, it will shrink in size when moving or when falling. Shrink too much and it's game over. This isn't an issue for the TAS which completes all levels in record time.

	"After most jumps, there will be a lag frame when landing. There are some rare cases where this doesn't happen but there didn't seem to be a way to control this. Where possible, the blob jumps on top of the flag and hits the end hitbox from above to prevent triggering the landing lag frame. The blob also tends to generate a moderate amount of lag frames, more so when rolling and I also couldn't find any particular way to reduce this lag.

	"Has two large blocks made of many timed platforms over spikes. The fastest way I found was to jump into the first block so the blob is trapped at the peak of its jump then mash A to jump out just before the blocks disappear. The second block disappears before we hit it. I did come across something strange while playing casually where the blob got trapped in the block but it continued moving. I tried recreating this in TAStudio but I unfortunately couldn't find a way to do this.
