	"Whomp Em is a really fun Mega Man clone. You are an indian

	"boy who is gonna collect 6 totems (I think). These are very 
	$LF
	"much like Mega Mans weapons because each boss gives you a 
	$LF

	"It´s a fastpaced and fun game. The controls are a bit 
	$LF
	"slippery if you play it on normal speed and only that makes

	"Edit: Oh!! One thing that I forgot. I takes pretty much damage vs 
	$LF
	"bosses. This is because I had to to be able to kill them as fast as possible. For example 
	$LF
	"at the first boss. I say at the left side of him until he transforms into leaves,
	$LF
	"and then I take some damage. If I would have been on the right side I could avoid it but
	$LF
	"that would have changed my pattern and thus made me kill him slower. Hope that made some sense.
