	"This is a minimalist run of Megaman X, version 2, which uses no passwords and collects no extra upgrades or items. (Except Dash and Z-buster which cannot be avoided) Damage is only taken when necessary to advance the plot of the game. (Vile in armor requires you to get down to 3-4 bars to get stunned and continue with the game.)

	"This is a really streamlined version and much smoother than my previous run. I exploit a roof-running bug in Flame Mammoth, a weird sprite pushing trick in Storm Eagle, the Vile-Zero Battle dialog bug, and others.

	"Also, I only use invulnerability once, and that was the place that Boco stated that it was impossible to speed through without using it. In comparison with Frenom, I have to use more creative tactics in dealing with the 4 other places where he used invulnerability because I no longer use invulnerability there.

	"Also, I take full advantage of "dashing while shooting" which doubles the power of 1st uncharged bolt fired while dashing. This means that 90% of the places where Frenom stops because of the tornado weapon, I go without stopping. This also gives me a faster time dealing with Storm Eagle, where this trick does the same amount of damage as a fully charged bolt, while allowing me to fire within his invulnerability cycle.

	"Lastly, I manipulate luck and the movements of all of the bosses to favor me. In other words, no more off screen bosses, no more invulnerable bosses! I also make some battles more interesting than Frenom, like Armored Armadillo and Sting Chameleon, which addresses one of Boco's complaints.
