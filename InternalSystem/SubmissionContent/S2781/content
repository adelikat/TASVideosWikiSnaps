	"Some comments on how things are working:
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		"Stage 1, theres a frame rule on each mini-boss, and they wont spam until a certain ammount of time, either i can go wait do nothing when the screen stop to scroll, or i can kill some guys (i choosed later option for entertainment). The boss is dyeing quickly and very simple, punch or flying kick only, taking no damage on any boss allow to warp in the next stage.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Stage 2, starting with this stage, i always use warps, simply by doing a high jump right at start, the boss wasnt easy to manipulate, there is a waiting period, but theres not realy anyway around that, on my first test run the boss did ran away behind me, this time i could keep him near the corner, and it was indeed faster to wait instead rushing him, kick until bar is 3/4 off then can use punch (or keep kick).
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Stage 3, this boss is only vunerable on the head, jumping is required, alltho if you jump straight, he will also start to jump... so instead i just go back and forth jumping, this prevent him from moving at all, with good timing on the kick i hit him for every jump.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Stage 4, is the hardest boss without hesitation, you need first to attack him, he will dodge and counter attack, then only hes vunerable to a counter-counter attack... phew.. annoying boss to manipulate, plus you dont kill him, and your forced in a walk back script, this one may be further optimized, im not sure.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Stage 5, you have to hit him in the right order, first head, then torso, croch, and feets, after 2 cycle to finish him you have to let him jump and hit him in air, major shortcut to wait hes near the floor so you "catch" him quicker.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Stage 6, oh well, corner stuck and low kicks... booya... this boss suppossly hard, because in reality he can strike back much faster than all others, hardly avoidable if you dont attack him with correct timing.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	[br 
	]br
	"The only damage taken are in stage1, on all mini boss i get hit in air, you do recover and can use a flying kick, this quickly hit twice and stuck them in the corner. One guy hit me before first mini boss, this is just to quickly dispose of the 2 guys.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"I didnt checked exactly the detail, but most obviously more than half of the movie is loading level, waiting time/scores bonus ect... the actual input is very small, this will explain the (relativly) low rerecord count (and quickness of making this tas).
