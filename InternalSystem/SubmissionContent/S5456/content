	"When Terra wakes up in Arvis house and leaves the house to escape through the caves, there is a invisible NPC placed in front of the backdoor to prevent Terra from entering the house again. The flag for this NPC is located at bit 1 of address 
	[tt 
		"$1F41
	]tt
	". However, this flag is not set before the Whelk fight, where there is a save point. Also, there is another save point in the caves after leaving Arvis. So by overwriting the NPC flag from the second save by the value of the first save, we obtain a save where we can go back and enter Arvis house. This gives us access to the whole Narshe town and we can leave the town.

[p 
	"To get faster gameovers, we will also build a dead party. In the first save, we have a 3-characters party, so we take this opportunity to let Terra die before saving. This was not a trivial task, because enemies are obviously weak in the very beginning of the game. Also, we absolutely need Terra to get the fast Whelk kill. Several options were considered, but in the end it was faster to let Terra die during Whelk fight and backtrack to the save point.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"By the way, we used the non-assisted setup for the Whelk fight by leaving Battle Speed at 3. This is the slowest setting where Whelk shell takes 2 rounds before going inside. This gives us time to manipulate our damage as well as giving Whelk two attacks to kill Terra.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In the second save point, we have a solo Terra party, so we combine the two saves to get a solo dead Terra party. Actually, Terra's HP are not relevant to consider her dead, what matters is the Wound status. This trick was done in the continuation of the Arvis NPC trick, to save time in resets and to remove the save overwriting dialogs.
	$LF

However, it's still the same method as before with the 52 game-overs, meaning a significant portion of the run is quite honestly boring to viewers. Because the time that was saved compared to the previous publication was during regular gameplay, even more of the run is considered to be of boring gameplay. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the glitch, this is ultimately unavoidable.
