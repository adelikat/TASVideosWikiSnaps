	"When Terra wakes up in Arvis house and leaves the house to escape through the caves, there is a invisible NPC placed in front of the backdoor to prevent Terra from entering the house again. The flag for this NPC is located at bit 1 of address 
	[code 
		"$1F41
	]code
	". However, this flag is not set before the Whelk fight, where there is a save point. Also, there is another save point in the caves after leaving Arvis. So by overwriting the NPC flag from the second save by the value of the first save, we obtain a save where we can go back and enter Arvis house. This gives us access to the whole Narshe town and we can leave the town.

This was not a trivial task, because enemies are obviously weak in the very beginning of the game. Also, we absolutely need Terra to get the fast Whelk kill. Several options were considered, but in the end it was faster to let Terra die during Whelk fight and backtrack to the save point.

Because the time that was saved compared to the previous publication was during regular gameplay, even more of the run is considered to be of boring gameplay.
