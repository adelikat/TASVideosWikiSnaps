	"This is a TAS of The Lucky Dime Caper starring Donald Duck, a colorful SMS game with quite some catchy tunes.

	"It starts out with "Unca Scrooge" having a present for Donald's nephews: a single dime each! As it turns out, those are lucky dimes that Scrooge himself once used to start his fortune. Magica De Spell watches them from outside and later on steals the dimes and kidnaps the nephews to become even richer than Scrooge. The good guy that he is, Donald goes after the boys to rescue them.

	"There are two major version of this game, one on the SMS (this one) and one on the GG. The games differ a lot, as the GG version has slightly different graphics in the beginning and has powerups spread across the levels, which one would have to kill enemies for on the SMS. Also, the levels themselves differ in a way that they basically only share a common theme each (the woods, Egypt, Hawaii and so on), but have only vaguely similar layouts. Due to those difference and the fact that there appears to be only a European version of this game on SMS, I chose to use the (E) ROM and not the (U) ROM on GG.

	"If requested/needed for judging, I will further elaborate the differences, though.

	": Somewhat of a substandard game, without too much action, but it was entertaining enough for me to just barely give it a pass. You also seem to have given some good answers to the technical level of the run in the discussion. Accepting.
