[p 
	"The project was started in 2012 on a very early version of BizHawk, pre BKM, pre BK2. The extension for the movie file was .TAS and was a single plaintext file with a small header for sync settings followed by an input roll, instead of a zipped set of files. TAStudio, amazingly, was included with the version of BizHawk that I was using, and I looked at this tool in awe, it was exactly the interface I wanted to use to create the run but unfortunately it was not very functional at the time. Additionally, I did not know how to properly use traditional rerecording tools at the time so the run was constructed by editing the .TAS file in Notepad with the inputs I thought I needed and playing back the result from the start every time, checking for style, desyncs, and deaths.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I never finished the game using this technique, probably due to the ever increasing time needed to check my work as the run got longer, and as such the project was put on hold until 2015 when TAStudio was much more mature. My first run that finished the game was based on Jok-R's run and the faster Level 1 WIP with a final time of 5:38.65, although because of significant optimizations across all areas of the run almost none of the inputs from those submissions remain today.

		$LF
	]li

		"The Japanese version adds an extra level between Level 1 and the rock autoscroller, adding roughly 1300 frames of movement and an extra score screen to the run
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"The Japanese version adds Easter Eggs in most levels, the triggers are always loaded increasing the likelihood of lag on the Japanese version
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Boss fights are roughly 10 frames quicker per level on the Japanese version, I believe it’s because they move faster than their US version counterparts and thus appear on screen and become vulnerable to damage sooner
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"After the cliff level, the Scroll screen can be skipped 168 frames sooner on the Japanese version
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Some Green Scroll placements are different on the Japanese version, this causes Level 8 to be 66 frames faster in the Japanese run due to less backtracking and Level 9 to be 53 frames faster in the Japanese run due to the Scroll being placed lower on the cliff
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"I completed a test run with the Japanese version and the result was slower by 965 frames, mostly due to the extra level. Most of the levels without different Green Scroll placement synced with the inputs lifted straight from the US run, but I needed to redo a few for the reasons outlined above. If the extra level didn't exist, and provided the US hit ratios could be matched, the Japanese version would have been over 5 seconds faster than the US version for this run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I decided to use the US version in the end because this run is aiming for the fastest completion time and the Japanese version does not suit that goal. A run that defeats all bosses and possibly activates all in level Easter Eggs would be better suited to the Japanese version.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The game limits the number of enemies loaded to 7, it is faster in every measurable way (lag, hit ratio, and movement) to avoid the first 7 enemies that spawn at the start of the level, and eventually outrun them. This prevents enemies further along in the level from spawning. The levels become essentially pacifist up until the boss fights where possible.

	"Shot Spam
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"At the end of every level is a score screen that takes a variable amount of time depending on your enemy hit ratio achieved throughout that level. Each percentage point of hit ratio adds 200 points to a bonus that takes 1 frame per 200 points to count down with no method to skip or speed up the countdown. So the fastest strategy is to fire as many shots as possible that do not hit enemies to reduce your hit ratio. Note that 0% hit ratio gives a massive bonus of 10,000,000 and would take almost 14 minutes to count down, so 1% hit ratio is optimal.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There are many techniques used throughout the run to cram in extra shots, the most effective of which involves moving to the top of the screen or the bottom of a wall or obstacle in a lagless area allowing 60 shots per second using a repeating 1-2-1-2-1-2 pattern. This situation is very rare to come across outside of autoscrollers and is mostly seen in levels 2 and 7.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Another technique more commonly seen involves using the L + R + U + 1 trick shot that spawns to the right of the player and moves upwards without causing any time loss due to sideways movement. This trajectory allows the shot to hit an obstacle, commonly a tree or rock, that causes it to despawn sooner than if it were to travel all the way to the top of the screen allowing the next shot to be fired sooner. Level 6 is the most notable use of this technique shown at the start of the level to add in extra shots that narrowly miss an enemy, and again at the end of the level to fire many extra shots that hit the trees. A downside to this technique is that holding L + R + U is more likely to cause lag than simply holding U, this was taken into careful consideration when optimizing shot spam. Unfortunately if you're not already braced against a wall or obstacle on your left, there are no trick shots that spawn to the left of the player without losing time to sideways movement, otherwise this technique could be used in many more situations throughout the run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When optimizing a level I firstly block out minimalistic inputs for optimal movement and boss fight, then work backwards from the fight to implement shot spam, bruteforcing every possible shot input on every frame and checking for the highest possible shot density while avoiding extra enemy kills, and desyncs due to added lag frames. I considered automating this process but was already well over halfway through the run before I thought of the idea to do so, so I decided to just push on and finish the run normally. If anyone is interested in attempting to beat this run I would highly recommend investing the time into automating the shot spam process, it will save you many tens of hours, and your wrist and elbow.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Lag Reduction was very important throughout the run as this game becomes extremely laggy when many objects are on screen at once. I initially relied on TAStudio's ability to display lag frames as red and non-lag frames as green in the input roll. BizHawk's Automatic lag detection is generally fairly reliable for this game, but unfortunately there were both false positives and false negatives so I ended up writing a Lua script that measures the player's change in position to detect lag frames. Lag frames cause dx and dy for that frame to be 0 instead of somewhere between 1 and 3 depending on the level, and whether the player has the Blue Scroll. This more accurate lag detection brought my time down by several seconds and allowed me to improve on my initial approach of optimizing the inputs for a completely green input roll in TAStudio.

	"The Red Scroll
	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"There has been talk within the TAS community for this game about skipping the Red Scroll, I opted instead to collect it in Level 2. There are a couple of arguments for skipping this pickup, firstly collecting the Red Scroll causes the music to change to the same track throughout the run instead of unique tracks for each level. Secondly is the fact that shots without the Red Scroll despawn once they hit an enemy, instead of piercing through the enemy and allowing multiple enemy kills with the same shot, which is not needed for a TAS player according to people who argue to skip the Scroll.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I generally agree with their arguments and would have preferred to skip the Red Scroll in my run. I can however, make the case for piercing shots being useful in a TAS. During Level 8, right after I backtrack to the Green Scroll after spawning the boss, I am greeted by a cluster of enemies from the start of the level. Keeping these enemies on screen causes significant lag so it's necessary to kill three of them. The problem I faced, is that firing multiple shots to kill them causes significant lag, and waiting until the last possible frame also caused more lag than necessary. The optimal solution in the end was to abuse the piercing shot mechanic to kill 3 enemies with 1 shot and then despawn the shot with a projectile that was conveniently located between the three enemies I needed to hit and the extra enemies I did not want to hit for ratio reasons.

Firstly, a lower score is generally more difficult to achieve in this game, it's a fairly good indicator of a fast, high quality run. Secondly, since I had been shot spamming throughout the rest of the levels I wanted to keep things consistent. Thirdly, spawning extra enemies by killing enemies earlier in the level caused more lag than outrunning them and spamming shots. And lastly, a shorter bonus screen makes the ending appear sooner, with the final score being displayed on the “Game Over” screen for those who want to see it.
