	]b
	" There's four different card games you can play - [1] Five Card Stud, [2] Seven Card Stud, [3] Five Card Draw, and [4] Blackjack. Blackjack is by far the most optimal game to play as rounds are insanely shorter, and up to $999 can be bet at once compared to $99 in the other three.

[p 
	"Pressing [5] on the gamepad chooses a game at random and [6] chooses the game last played. [6] is the best means of selecting a game because it skips the dealer announcing what game was selected, saving 160 frames each time. Additionally, pressing [6] for the first game automatically selects Blackjack for some reason.

	"Since each outcome requires a different number of frames to play out and can award different multiples of your bet, we need a way of estimating each outcome's relative advantage. Effective frame cost divides the frame cost by the bet multiplier, and estimates just that. A Blackjack is clearly the best hand, but is also fairly rare, meaning depending on how long we must wait to manipulate a Blackjack, it may be more optimal to choose a different outcome:

	" Some dollar amounts wagered in this TAS may seem rather odd. For instance, in round 9 why did I bet $769 instead of $775? In order to type out two numbers consecutively, the game must recognize two separate inputs, which requires pausing for three frames. To avoid this, I instead bet the highest amount which does not contain consecutive numbers, 769.

	" This TAS is the best result of the logical approach detailed above. However, with any TAS that's super luck-dependent like this one, it's always possible that nonintuitive choices early in the TAS could manipulate great luck later on. It's not possible for me to test every one of these scenarios (although I did test several), so I'll leave that task to other TASers should they decide to investigate that.
