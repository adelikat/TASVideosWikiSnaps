	"Well, after 5 years of waiting, it's finally here! Me, LegnaX and Mirky are proud to present the new Abe's Exoddus 100% TAS made on the Bizhawk Emulator! I started this TAS about a year ago and now that we have an active Oddworld speedrunning community the run is finally done! This movie beats the previous movie by 40 seconds thanks to some new strats and glitches that me and Dooty didn't know about back in 2014!

	"By timing this glitch perfectly you can make Abe stop and turn. To set it up, Abe needs to be standing near a ledge (pressing up whilst turning around) you will be able to make Abe do a backwards jump. Notice that when you press the opposite direction to where Abe is standing at the incorrect frame, Abe will just jump up and stand. But if you time it perfectly, Abe will jump backwards and possibly jump to another screen. This will allow you to jump backwards to areas and skip certain areas. Sligfantry's video can show you how this glitch works:

And now that Exoddus 100% PSX is done, me and ViGadeomez can look forward to TASing the Linux version of New 'n' Tasty! That TAS will probably need a verification movie as I can complete the game really fast and skip Scrabania - but in order to do this I need to have a save file in slot 1 at the menu on which has completed both Paramonia and Scrabania and then I input the glitched run! ViGadeomez also got the MS-DOS version of Abe's Oddysee working on JPC-RR and I feel like since the PSX runs are starting to be inaccurate against older emulators, the PC versions may be better to compare against. Who knows, maybe a better Windows TAS tool will be made so I can TAS Exoddus any% on PC which has more glitches than the PSX version which include Advance Relocation Glitch (ARG) which allows Abe to relocate to another location on the map!
