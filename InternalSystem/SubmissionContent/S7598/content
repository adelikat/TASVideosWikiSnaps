	(__wikiLink|displaytext=any% comments|href=/7502S)
	" that the (PSX) bootup can affect the sync of the first level. Well, that's pretty much what happened here due to the bootup taking a few frames longer and along with entering more levels, it caused the any% inputs to desync after around 100 frames or more, I had no choice but to create similar inputs to Any% for the entirety of it, so if there’s any differences between the two, that’s why.

	"The JP release was the second version of the game and because of that, there’s a lot of changes to the game as well as making the difficulty easier for Japanese players. There're only 3 major changes that are notable in a TAS setting, there's a lot more changes that benefit RTA runs but aren't worth mentioning here. First of all, Krome Keeper (the 5th boss) takes 6 hits here instead of 8 which saves a few seconds. Second of all, health refills after completing a level which is useful for this branch as there's a lot more damage boosts throughout the run. Lastly, the charged dot throw only requires 5 Pac-Dots instead of 10. Also, the butt bounce on the title screen is something you can do in the other versions if you remap (in-game) jump to any of the bumpers, here you can do it with the default mapping if you mash quick enough.

I can't really go as fast when I'm trying to stay out of bounds because if I'm not careful with the movement, then I'll be pushed back into bounds or getting pushed out would take longer. For the gate clip at the end, all I'm gonna say is that it held back progress for way too long but I'm very happy to pull it off.

	"I didn’t explain what the deal with the camera is in the any% comments since it was only relevant for two levels, so I’ll explain it now since it’s relevant here and for some of the later ones too. As funny as the camera being very behind is, it comes with its own set of problems. If I don’t let it catch up or if I’m too far away from it, everything in the level including Pac-Man himself despawns essentially softlocking the game so there’s intentional moments with either slower movement or a couple of frames with no inputs, the ending of Far Out shows off what I mean to some extent. Another thing to talk about that applies here and some later ones is the rev-roll near the cages, I have to slow down right before I get to the cage, charge up the rev-roll, and pray that I’ll get close enough to release the friend and also get launched far enough to be away from the cage. I wasn’t able to get very far into the end token for this level due to the awkward camera angle.

The second part of the boss is probably the most infamous one in the whole game, this is primarily due to how unfair the last two phases are, not that you see them here since there's a TAS strat for this boss. So after the mummy chase, there's a specific spot I have to align Pac-Man in once I've opened the heart by rev-rolling on the four plates. Once it's opened, I have to get behind the heart, make sure to get stuck behind it, and time the rev-rolls so that I can hit it multiple times.
