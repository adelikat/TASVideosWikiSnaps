	"This is Konami's little platform shooter game released in 1991 for Gameboy, it's just the same as Contra except for the title. There's 5 stages to go through and 3 weapon power-ups; I chose Fire Shot because it's the strongest weapon.

	"I decided to go over this game again, I knew it was improvable because I didn't get around to look at enemies' health in memory. Now I did this time ;) And also I ensure that it's fastest possible.

	"This new improvement is 272 frames (4 seconds!) faster than my 
	[a class=intlink href=/Forum/T/4755 
		"cancelled

	" submission. The area where I improved was less jumping and viewing enemies' health. The jumping cost 1 frame behind. Viewing enemies' health helped me to find when to begin shooting and make sure shots are landing each time.
