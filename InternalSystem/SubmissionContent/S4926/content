	"I have to thank dezbeast for his marvelous Mega Man II TAS. Basically all Stages are similar to his old TAS except from Top Man onwards.

	"Since after we have achieved the "Hard-Knuckle" we are able to twist time and space and screenwrap through ( almost ) every screen we fall.
	$LF
	"This is done by shooting a Hard-Knuckle on the last frame before the screen transition happens ( you can also screenwrap from a ladder up/downwards - seen in Needle Man stage).

	[small 
		" big health refill

	" ) and thus I have some downtime in the finished TAS.
