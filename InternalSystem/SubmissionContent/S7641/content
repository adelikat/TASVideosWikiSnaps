Collisions in this game are not just giant rectangles, but sprites, so it matters how you run into a client or a car, and from my testing, positioning in this run looks optimal. Main direction input is held down all the time, so dodging the dogs doesn't waste time, aside from a couple places where "hot dogs" seem to be moving on a scripted pattern. Accepting.
