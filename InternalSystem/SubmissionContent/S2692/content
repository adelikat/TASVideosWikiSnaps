	"Since it is obviously shorter than FFVI, I didn't perfectly optimize it. But I managed to get better luck manipulation and improvements than him, except for early part of the game. Silly me not to avoid Breath Wings at the first boss battle. I also failed to encounter White Serpent and Black Goblin on the way, so I took extra steps. I'm sorry I didn't perfectly know how to manipulate luck at that time. Other bosses are better, I think. The time beating Melugine is faster than in samurai goroh's run. I'm sorry that adjusting time after beating Melugine may be boring. (Note: When entered the Phantom Village, the mosaic animation didn't occur. It's emulator glitch.)
