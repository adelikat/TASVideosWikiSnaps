	"This is yet another Sonic Advance run and yes, it is with Knuckles again! This is a 2193 frame improvement over the previous run. While it doesn't make use of the Ultra Dash, it also uses its fair share of glitches that gives Knuckles a pretty good chance at beating the game in record time.

	"Ohh Egg Rocket, how I still and forever will hate you so! This run made use of a glitch that pushes Knuckles through the floor and causes the level to lose solidarity. Thus making it possible to complete it in one go. A route change was made here as well, which made it possible to complete it even faster than the previous run.
