	"Warning! This movie fails to beat the current published input time, due to playing on the new emulator, Bizhawk. According to Spikestuff, this movie is 32 frames faster over the cancelled PCSX movie. Comparing to the published run, this movie is 
	(frames|amount=7691)
	" faster than the published run.    This TAS has been going for quite some time now and Dooty has been stuck with a missing ring since 2014. In October 2015, I discovered a way to bring the ring back to life, by simply reseting the screen closer to the problem. There are also a lot of changes done since the previous published run to speed things up along. Since 2014, a new trick called the Multiple Backwards Jump was discovered by Shunpuk. Dooty managed to find ways on accessing secret areas faster. Although this saved some time, this caused the missing ring to disappear. Every rescue has been improved over the published run. I hope you all enjoy my run and I will look forward to the improvements in the Hourglass emulator so I will be able to TAS New 'n' Tasty.

	"I would like to thank Dooty for all his efforts in trying to TAS this update which he didn't quite succeed. I need to thank once again, Sligfantry (for finding the DDg and the Stop 'n' Turn and Backwards Jump Glitch), Yartitana (for finding the Quick Portal Closure glitch which was the reason for making this update) and Shunpuk for finding the Multiple Backwards Jump glitch which make our run faster on PCSX but slightly slower on Bizhawk due to accurate loading times.
