	"Well, I'm presenting here a TAS of a nice game known as Hammerin Harry, it is about a guy who takes his adventure to rescue his girlfriend by beating some bad boys using his hammer. He goes through 5 levels, after each one there is a bonus stage except for the last 2 levels, there isn't anything new in the first level, but what's new is in the bonus stage, you may or may not notice it while watching the movie but the timer count decreases instantly from 30 to 29, which saves around 2 secs, well that is due to the pause at the very first frame where the in-game timer starts counting down, also I tried to keep the bonus count on 0, even if I kill many of enemies but that only for entertainment, this also saves around 48 frames, next there is the second level, at the very start, I didn't take damage because I want to save it for later, that cost me like 20 frames but it deserves it thanks to previous bonus stage, although I optimized the stage a bit later on. The next 2 bonus stages are the same as the first one. The 3rd level technically hasn't anything new except for a small lag reduction at the beginning and a funny glitch that allows hovering in the air while pressing left or right rapidly, also allows going to left from right (crossing the globe?!), unfortunately, it is completely useless but it worth to talk about. In the 4th level, I saved much time by taking the giant hammer that deals double damage than the normal one, it saved around 4 sec or so, however it isn't much useful in other stages as it needs time to take it while it won't save more, it is a lose of time. The final stage as well isn't different too, but I reduced lag here and finished the game with a time below 7 minutes.
