	"This is a TAS of a Blue's Clues game for the Gameboy Color. It was released in 2001. It was developed by Vicarious Visions, the same developer who many years later would make the Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy.

	"It was a good call for Nintendo to rerelease this gem on the 3DS Virtual Console, I have it myself:

	"At the main menu of the game you can choose to play one of the 6 mini-games or look in Blue's alphabet book. Upon choosing Blue, you can select 1 of the 8 pages of the book or look at the collected pages & credits.

	"When you select a page, the game will start by showing the same cut scene of Blue showing Steve that all of the pages of her book are missing, and that they have to play Blue's Clues to find them. You will proceed to play 3 of the 6 mini-games. After getting all 3 clues, you'll automatically proceed to the next page of the alphabet book. It gets progressively harder and LONGER.

	"In this game's case, I only did one page. The reason I did this is that doing the whole book is extremely repetitive and boring, and even if I do all of the book, after finishing the last page, it just sends me back to the main menu with no credits. The credits are actually in the book after the last page by using the d-pad.

	"So I beat all 3 minigames and get all the clues in record time... for some reason.

	"Blue goes through a maze to slide the big letter all the way to the end. She likes to wait for a few frames on corners just so you can move her again. On the later pages, the maze becomes much more complex and more corner heavy, having to wait for blue to stop at a corner and move again.

	"The fastest minigame. What can I say? Blue really likes her soup. You have to choose the right letters in the letter soup so Blue can eat her soup. The very frame every letter fully shows up you can start moving the spoon. When moving the spoon, you're able to move it with just one frame. You have to wait for the spoon one frame and then press A to choose the right letter otherwise you'll choose the letter the spoon was on previously.

	"A "100%" run might be possible. The entire alphabet would require some insane RNG manipulation and it would be really, really repetitive. But it would be interesting regardless. 
	$LF
	"The only improvement for this movie would be better RNG in all 3 minigames. I have no idea about that.
