	"This is Donkey Kong Country for the Gameboy Color, released in 2000, completed as quickly as possible. This video highlights the unique physics and exploits present in this version of the game to traverse a familiar levelset in potentially unfamiliar ways. The emulator used is BizHawk 2.6.2 with Gambatte core, and the goal is to defeat K. Rool from a new file (any%). The original document, written in LaTeX and compiled to a PDF, is available here:

	"Starting sometime in early 2021 I came back to my childhood Donkey Kong Country game, the 8-bit Gameboy Color remake of the original. As strange as this game probably seems to everyone who grew up with the original Super Nintendo version, or even the Gameboy Advance port, I have many fond memories of the Gameboy Color game and I always enjoyed it. I spent about 3 months running the game RTA on emulator and keyboard, and after achieving a run to be proud of I decided to start making a TAS. I had found some interesting possibilities and wanted to put some strats together to see what would come of it. I remember one of the first inspirations being that I found that it was possible to roll off the tires in Mine Cart Madness but it was quite difficult, and I wanted to see what the speedrun could look like if I could put these kinds of strats together. I had never made a TAS before, my only experience was some messing around with Celeste's TAS tools. I had no idea what I was getting into.

[div class=p 
	"What began as an experiment to find cool strats turned into a project to make a masterpiece. For over a year I worked on this thing. There were a couple long breaks, but I legitimately put hundreds of hours into it. My first draft of the TAS which defeated K. Rool was fast, but there were many suboptimal strats and the bosses and autoscrollers were boring. I couldn't settle for a mediocre video, I had to make it 
	[em 
		"perfect
	]em
	". I went back, discovered new tech, saved every frame I could find and tried to make every idle moment interesting. In this document I'd like to share all the frame data and tech I've found, as well as some detailed commentary about each level. Some of the information here can be relevant to RTA runners as well. I hope you enjoy the video, and find the information useful and interesting as well.

	"A note about units:
	$LF
	"Lengths are stored in two separate bytes measuring pixels and subpixels. There are 256 subpixels per pixel. For position in the level which requires more than 256 pixels, another byte is used to store superpixels. When I started working on this TAS I made the decision to keep my subpixel and pixel addresses separate and measure as a sort of a 256-decimal. This has the advantage of making the significant figure easier to see and reference, but the disadvantage of making computations and comparisons harder. Furthermore, with the subpixel value unsigned, to read leftwards and upwards speeds you have to add the negative pixel value to the positive subpixel value, making them harder to think about. In hindsight I probably should have switched to using subpixel only measurement, but I got set in my ways. In this document I primarily give measurements as pixel_subpixel, these units will be denoted with an underscore to separate the place values. In the following table I will give measurements in these units as well as in pixels as a rounded decimal, and pure subpixels, to make them easier to think about for anyone who prefers those units.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"I included a lot of values for anyone who is curious, but some are not super relevant so I highlighted the important ones in bold. Animal buddy speed and acceleration values are the same as the Kongs' when not mentioned. For some reason, Expresso and Winky also get their speeds set to 0 when they land from a jump.

	"The "status" of the game is stored in memory variable 0800 in 4 bytes. The first 2 bytes seem to store general information like whether we're in a level or on the overworld, while the second 2 bytes describe the status of the player. Below is a list of many relevant values of 0802 as 2-byte hex and what states they correspond to. There are other states relating to the overworld, the Kong Family, various menus and loading screens, and even Funky's Fishing and Crosshair Cranky, but these are less important so I didn't include them here.

Many of these mechanics are useful for RTA running, and the rest are interesting for understanding how many puzzle pieces have to be put together to make the movement as fast and fluid as possible.

	"DK and Diddy are more balanced in this game than in the other two versions of it. They have the same running speed and initial rolling speed. DK has a bigger hitbox and can stomp Klump, Krusha and curled-up Army. He also has the hand slap attack and holds barrels over his head. Diddy is smaller, jumps slightly higher, and maintains slightly more speed during rolls. He holds barrels in front of him like a shield. For some reason DK also swims much slower than Diddy in all directions except up, where his water jump produces slightly more initial upwards speed. Diddy's advantages are small, but enough to make him the optimal choice throughout most of the run. However, DK has a few specific uses in the TAS, and RTA runners should not fear losing Diddy as much in this game because Donkey is generally not that bad.

	" Basic Rolling and Jumping
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"Like all DKC games, the fastest way to travel in this game is rolling. Rolls in this game are incredibly overpowered - they are much faster than running or jumping, last a very long time, and the speed and duration are greatly increased when rolling through enemies. For this reason, the general strategy for this game is to spend as much time rolling as possible, and roll through as many enemies as possible. Since the duration of a roll is very long, it's usually best to land early and roll immediately. It's possible to roll through barrels in this game without releasing B as long as right (or left) is also held. However, there are many interesting nuances and limitations to rolling, which are covered in the next 8 sections.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The other basic move is of course jumping. You can jump out of any roll even if you're in the air, and even casual players know that roll-jumping is the most effective way to achieve great mobility options while maintaining control. After jumping, your vertical speed immediately begins to increase at the rate of gravity each frame, giving you a simple parabolic jump arc. However, holding jump keeps gravity at a lower value, causing you to jump higher.

[h4 id=SpeedLock 
	" Speed Lock
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"Rolls normally decelerate every frame, but during the first few frames of the roll your speed does not change. The horizontal deceleration is 0_1 (1 subpixel) speed per frame, which is small but significant over the course of long rolls. Rolls also fall at the rate of gravity, but your vertical speed also does not change at the beginning of the roll. This is what allows you to "float" over gaps when you roll off a ledge. Rolling off flat platforms locks your vertical speed at 0_0, while rolling off slopes can cause the roll to slant donwards with a vertical speed of +0_64 or +0_128. Flat platforms can be slightly sloped or curved at the end, allowing slanted rolls, and either type of roll can be beneficial depending on the situation.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Speed lock lasts for 15 frames for DK, and 20 frames for Diddy. Horizontally, this causes Diddy's roll to go about half a pixel further for a full, normal roll. However, the vertical effect means that Diddy can float longer after rolling off platforms, which means he can cross wider gaps, and spend more time rolling during roll-jumps.

	" Dead Rolls and Stamina
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"If you let a roll expire on the ground without jumping out of it, this is called a "rollover." Sometimes when you rollover you can get a 10 frame penalty where you can't move or jump, this is called a "dead roll." Whether or not a dead roll occurs depends on a variable I call "stamina." You begin each level with full stamina, and when you rollover your stamina is depleted. Each frame spent walking or standing still recovers 1 stamina up to the maximum of 10, at which point it is fully recovered. If you rollover before recovering all 10 stamina you get a dead roll for 10 frames, and then your stamina is fully depleted again.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"On flat ground, it's slightly faster on average to connect rolls with 10 walking frames than with 1 frame jumps (which move faster but last about 27 frames). Stamina does not have to be recovered immediately nor sequentially. Therefore, many levels present the challenge of finding the best places to recover stamina between rollovers, since there may be a more advantageous location to take the walking frames instead of immediately after the rollover. Since stamina is reset between level and bonus transitions, it's not necessary to recover it before exiting.

[div class=p 
	"Rolls normally last for 47 frames unless canceled (usually by jumping), but they can be extended. On the final frame of the roll, the game checks to see if one of the extend conditions is met, and if so then the roll continues into an extended roll until canceled or the next end frame, where the process is repeated. The most natural way to extend rolls is by hitting enemies - this gives you a speed boost of 0_144 per hit and the roll will be extended as long as B is held through the entire roll. For DK, extended rolls gain an extra 41 frames, while for Diddy extended rolls gain and extra 43 frames.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Rolls can be extended multiple times, each adding another 41 or 43 frames. However, another enemy must be hit after each extended roll starts in order to get another extension.

However, if you jump out of the roll, or release B and rollover, this credit is not reset and the extended roll can be stored and used later. You can only have up to one extended roll credit, hitting enemies when you already have one does not give extras, this applies both to normal and stored extended rolls.

[div class=p 
	"You can change the direction of a roll by simply pressing in the opposite direction. This can be useful for stalling or for simply changing directions when necessary. This also resets the speed of the roll to the starting speed, which is usually undesirable for boosted rolls, but long rolls which have been extended using storage or ledges will lose so much speed over time that it can be beneficial to sacrifice 1 frame of rolling backwards in order to reset the speed. Reversing does not affect speed lock or change the camera, but it does consume your extension credit if you have one. Therefore it's necessary to reverse after the end frame if you need the extension.

]h4
[div class=p 
	"When starting a roll, the camera moves forward and locks in place, positioning you towards the back of the screen. However, "forward" is defined by whichever direction you're facing (or turning towards) before starting the roll. By pressing left for 1 frame before pressing right and B, you can lock the camera behind you, putting the Kong at the front of the screen. Since most entities spawn based on the camera's position and not the Kong's position, this can be used to manipulate entities to spawn later in any situation where it would be beneficial. For example, this can be used to stop Zingers or Mincers from getting in the way, or to prevent Kritters from jumping out of the way so you can roll through them. It can also be used to re-position ropes and moving platforms, sometimes making cycle skips possible. It can even be used to simply reduce lag frames. The one significant exception to this manipulation is Mini-Necky, for some reason he seems to shoot based on the player's position rather than the camera's. However, it seems to be barely possible to manipulate him with the camera in a couple critical locations.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The first application I found for this tech was to delay the rope above the K in Forest Frenzy to allow jumping over the gap without waiting. I found a total of 3 RTA uses of this tech before I started working on the TAS. Originally I though this would be a niche mechanic with a few uses, I had no idea how overpowered it would turn out to be. At the cost of a small slowdown for 1 frame, you can manipulate spawns to create much more favorable routes. The TAS currently abuses camera locking over 80 times, up to 8 times in some levels.

[h4 id=GravityGlitch 
	" Gravity Glitch
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"During normal platforming, gravity can be one of two values: 128 or 80. This represents downwards acceleration per frame in subpixels while airborne. 128 is standard gravity, while low gravity occurs after pressing A to jump and while holding the initial A press during the jump, and also during the "spinning" state 56C3 after bouncing off enemies or being shot out of a barrel cannon. If A is released during the jump, it's not possible to regain low gravity by re-pressing A in midair.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"If you hold A through an entire jump, the gravity variable will not be properly reset to 128 and can get stuck at 80 after landing. You can then release A and it will persist while walking and through the next roll, causing this roll to be more floaty than usual. This can be useful for setting up rolls to cross extra wide gaps, or for connecting descending platforms with a single roll. Since it requires a maximum height jump to set up (and therefore spends lots of frames in the air and not on the ground rolling), it has a cost associated with it. However, in situations like jumping out of pits or waiting on moving platforms, this cost can reduced or negated.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Gravity glitch does not only apply to rolls. It's possible to run off a platform with gravity glitch active and fall slower, although this isn't really useful at all. Normal jumps can also have their upwards starting speed increased by 48 = 128 - 80 if gravity glitch is active, indicating that jumps are essentially applying gravity on the first frame. Since the Kongs are automatically put into the "spinning" state with low gravity after bouncing enemies, holding jump does not affect how high they bounce, and it's not possible to get gravity glitch after landing from spinning even if A is held the entire time. Landing from spinning also sets your speed to 0. However, holding jump can cause Rambi and Winky to bounce higher off enemies. Interestingly, gravity glitch applies to mine carts as well, causing them to fall down off the tracks slower.

Repeated stabbing is the fastest way to travel horizontally, but there are some strange technicalities with this mechanic.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The cooldown of the stab depends on the animation timer, but this timer is reset at the end of the stab rather than at the beginning. Since the animation timer typically goes through a 5-frame cycle with Enguarde, this means that the cooldown varies within a 5-frame interval, which turns out to be between 28 and 32 frames. Since the animation timer resets after the stab ends, that means that if the next stab is started immediately it will have a 32 frame cooldown, but it can be started any time within the next 5 frames and it will still end at the same time. Since 32 is not divisible by 5, this means the phase of the animation timer can be offset by stabbing, and it can also be offset by turning around. This can be useful to manipulate the animation timer during vertical sections to set up the next stab to have a short cooldown.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Stabbing gives Enguarde an initial speed of 3_127, which decelerates by 0_16 each frame to his base speed of 1_240, which is maintained until the cooldown is reached, regardless of if left or right is pressed. However, if you press A or B to stab without having left or right pressed on the frame before, you can cause Enguarde to enter a state which I call "slow lock." During this state he decelerates to 1_207 instead, at which point he is free to move. If the next stab is initiated immediately after the cooldown ends he will remain in slow lock, which means that a long sequence of perfect stabs stuck in slow lock can lose a lot of distance. This is usually easy to fix by simply pressing left or right before starting a stab sequence, but if you stab immediately after spawning out of the box, you get slow locked for one cycle and must delay the next stab by at least 1 frame to break slow lock.

	"Necky and Master Necky are the only instances of RNG in the entire game (not including Funky's Fishing and Crosshair Cranky, of course). The random number generator is stored at address 300 in 3 bytes as a linear shift feedback register (LSFR) which generates on every frame of the overworld. The RNG sits still during most levels which is great because it means that saving time anywhere does not disrupt the boss pattern. The exceptions are during the Necky bosses where it generates once each boss attack phase to choose a position, and during water levels where this memory address seems to be repurposed entirely. In these levels it ceases to be an LSFR and instead takes other values, but after exiting the level it resumes its function from whatever value it ended at. Changing the movement in water levels does seem to change this address, even if the level is completed in the same amount of time. Therefore, assuming perfect overworld movement, Necky's pattern is determined by Coral Capers, and Master Necky's pattern is determined by Poison Pond. Perfect overworld movement is actually easy to achieve RTA since you can hold directions to move and hold A to enter levels immediately.

If this is indeed the case, then some RNG manipulation could speed up this boss by a few frames, but while I was working on it I was under the impression that it made no difference so I just took whatever pattern I got.

This causes subsequent changes to position, causing the route to diverge, which means that a small change early in the level can require a long re-syncing process and can gain or lose several frames over the rest of the level.

	"Another issue in cave levels is the crawlspaces, which can't really be skipped in this game. Crawlspaces have a barrier blocking rolling, if you would pass the barrier on the next frame then instead you don't move at all. Since roll speeds are typically over 2 px/f, this means you can be 2 or more pixels behind the barrier, and therefore 2 pixels behind the optimal position after jumping into the crawlspace. Since crawl speed is 1 px/f, this would lose 2 frames. To mitigate this we sometimes need to slow down a little to control our position without sacrificing time. Usually the best way to do this is to time stamina recovery walk frames, since we need to recover that stamina at some point anyways.

The camera lock used to delay the rope by the K and jump straight over the pit is the first application of camera locking I ever discovered, it's an RTA strat I call "The K Roll." At the double rope section with the Zinger, we can jump off the first rope to push the camera forward to spawn in the second rope early, saving about 48 frames. After jumping off vertical ropes (not swinging ropes), your speed is set to 5_0 and decreases at the normal rate of air acceleration (0_64 per frame), regardless of what direction is held.

Although this skip is pretty easy in the other versions of the game, the Neckys are positioned poorly in this version and simply holding right does not work, the final Necky just spawns too late and is too slow to catch. In order to make this skip possible I had to find the exact camera positions where each Necky spawns, then turn left to turn the camera around at precise positions to delay the spawns of specific ones to create a bounce chain. I spent an entire day trying to find this and almost gave up, thinking it was impossible, until I finally managed to reach that last bird and make it to the end.

It's nice that he gets some screen time during an autoscroller to show off his moves. In contrast to Trick Track Trek, I tried to hit every enemy, oil tank and banana here. A couple oil tanks have to be skipped in the interest of saving lag frames, though. For some reason DK's minimum ducking time is only 17 frames compared to Diddy's 22, so he can duck dance faster. I made sure to include a lot of DK hand slaps as well, and show off his ducking and idle animations at the end.

	"There were several route options to compare and choose between in this level. First we have to decide at the beginning of the level whether to use DK, Diddy or Rambi. The Rambi option is the slowest by around 2 seconds. We can get Diddy for free by using switch glitch in the previous level. However DK turns out to be fastest at the beginning of this level since we can exploit the Krusha roll glitch to plow through the Krushas by hitting them during extended rolls. During the long empty section under the star barrel we keep a stored extended roll which we space perfectly so that it extends right before hitting the next Krusha. We also reverse the roll for one frame after it extends to reset the speed, and ledge extend it again before reaching the pit.

[div class=p 
	"The next routing decision comes at the moving platform after the N. Rambi can take a damage boost to bypass the second Mincer, but this isn't enough to make up for the time he loses earlier. DK cannot roll under the Mincer, so our options are to either damage boost through, switch to Diddy, or wait it out. Damage boosting is fastest by about 13 frames but this time is lost when we eventually reach Necky and are forced to pick up a DK barrel, losing about 40 frames to unlocking our buddy (buddy unlocks usually take 31 frames, but it seems to take longer here for some reason). The next fastest option is switching to Diddy and doing the skip, this saves about 3 frames over keeping DK and waiting. That makes this the only place in the run where we switch Kongs without using switch glitch. DK still saves enough time in the beginning of the level to make up for the switching time here. At the end of the level we get a hexakill through the Gnawtys, making this the fastest boosted roll in the run, achieving 5_205 speed after the last hit.

	"This level is basically hitting lots of enemies and extending lots of rolls, the route is pretty straightforward overall. The first rope can be skipped by bouncing off the Gnawty, it's fastest to hit him with an uppercut. The bonus saves about 2 seconds. This level has a unique tech which I call the "dead roll bounce" where a roll ends on a tire which is able to cancel the dead roll frames in some way. I haven't figured out exactly how it works though, it just seems to work here. Camera locking at the end causes the first Slippa to spawn twice so we get a pentakill for a lot of speed.

	"The Gameboy Color's unique level! This level is a mix of different entities and obstacles, as well as an interesting mix of tech. There is a unique tech which I call the "barrel crawl," by picking up the barrel and entering the crawlspace we can delay crawl speed and also block the bullet from the Mini-Necky. The barrel is automatically thrown when we enter, but we still get to travel further through the crawlspace at running speed. This turns out to save exactly 0 frames due to the time taken picking up the barrel, but I think it looks cooler than doing it normally. By camera locking through the next gap and optimizing our position entering the crawl space we're barely able to get through and have exactly 1 frame to jump over the nut, saving 40 frames. This is the only other place in the run where camera locking works against Mini-Necky. Unfortunately, we can't do it through the next crawlspace because the Mini-Necky is positioned higher up. It's slightly faster to go up top over the N than to take the barrel cannons below the map. At the end, it's slightly faster to use gravity glitch to roll under the Neckys instead of bouncing off them.

	"The Klaptraps in this level react to A presses, not jumps. This means you can press A while still in the air to make them jump. Therefore the routing in this level is mostly about deciding whether to go over each Klaptrap, or to jump in front of them and press A before landing to make them jump again and then roll under. You can also use pause buffering to jump without the Klaptrap jumping, but this means not moving for 2 frames which is slower. We make sure to roll under the Klaptrap at the end, since there is a banana above him which would banana block us.

	"We save the best for last! This level is an absolute gauntlet of tech, including multiple uses of nearly every main trick in the game. This level holds the record for most gravity glitches at 6 (excluding autoscrollers), for connecting rolls between platforms and crossing gaps. After hitting the second Army we actually release B to rollover in order to fall down to the moving platform and prepare to roll off it. On many of the moving platforms it's faster to run for a few frames instead of rolling immediately. It was hard to find the best places to roll and it's probably possible to find more frames here. We can Krusha klip through all 3 Krushas to avoid having to pick up any barrels, this is also faster than doing the "suicide jump" over the first one. The area around the second Krusha is quite laggy so we turn around and look away from the lag in order to reduce it. We need to stall for a moment at the end to refresh our roll in order to not get bounced back by the Klump.

Optimizing him is pretty straightforward, just hit him on the first frame he becomes vulnerable.

	"This boss actually has some nontrivial optimizations. During the first and third cannonball phases there would be another cannonball firing at the end if you go to the far end of the stage away from K. Rool, but by going towards him we prevent this cannonball from spawning which causes him to throw his crown earlier and end the cycle faster. This doesn't seem to work during the second phase if you try to run away from him. After the fake victory fanfare, the camera has to scroll over to a specific location before the kredits start, but by turning at an exact moment after getting the seventh hit we can position the camera to be in the correct location, starting the kredits immediately. Finally at the end we use dead roll tech to release input earlier and save TAS frames! Dead rolls don't cancel speed, you continue moving once it ends, so we can first burn our stamina, then precisely position a roll and release inputs to coast into a dead roll and then skid into K. Rool, taking damage and allowing DK to score the last hit. He even punches him in the face before he goes down. Good job Donkey! The Cranky cutscene and real credits scroll automatically with no inputs so the TAS is legitimately finished after this roll.
