	"HISHE adds about 4 hours of new content (for the average player) on top of the vanilla Super Metroid experience. HISHE stands for HISHE Is Super metroid but Hella Embiggened. With that in mind, I think the author of the hack, Scyzer, did an excellent job seamlessly integrating the new content and blending it in with the old. I almost forget that vanilla Super Metroid doesn't have a Swampy Norfair or a Tertiary Maridia.

	"Unfortunately, due to some advanced TASing techniques, most of the extra content is missing from this run. I highly recommend playing the hack yourself if you're a fan of vanilla Super Metroid and the Mike Hammer series of books. You can find the hack here: http://metroidconstruction.com/hacks.php?h=h181
