	"Squirrel King

[p 
	"Squirrel King is a platform video game produced, without license from Sega, by the Taiwanese developer Gamtec for the Mega Drive. Gamtec is also responsible for the development of a number of other games, including many for the Gamate handheld system.

[p 
	"It appears to be loosely based upon Capcom's Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers video games for the Nintendo Entertainment System, sharing its gameplay mechanics, although it is not licensed by Disney. As in the aforementioned game, the main charecter must to throw crates at the enemies in order to defeat them.Sometimes crates have helpful things like extra fireballs, extra lives, and health boosts. Other times, they have "power-downs" that reduce the player's health. Despite some animation issues, this game is considered to be of professional quality.

	"This game was eventually used as the basis for the unofficial Mega Drive Super Mario World game. Some of the levels in this game have their background music based on that of the Super NES video game Donkey Kong Country.

[h3 
	"Super Mario World
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Super Mario World, also known as Super Mario Bros. (both titles appear in-game) is a hacked version of Squirrel King that uses ripped graphics from Super Mario Bros. as well as newly drawn sprites to make the Squirrel King characters look more appropriate in the Super Mario world.Despite its overhauled appearance, the gameplay was unchanged, so - unlike the original Super Mario Bros. game it resembles - Mario and Luigi are unable to stomp on enemies, and must instead throw crates at them. However, the producers only managed to finish the first two levels. The rest of the levels are identical to Squirrel King with Mario and Luigi sprites.
	$LF

[p 
	"Since the game is in the English language, it is assumed that it was intended for an international audience. While Bowser is still breathing fire, the boss screen involves split screen gameplay instead of using a single screen. It takes at least eight hits from randomly appearing crates and/or fireballs to defeat Bowser. The music in the boss fights of the game are not reminiscent of any Super Mario Bros. game and were leftovers from the Squirrel King ROM.

	" Good two player action, good audience response. As much as this game ripped of from Chip n' Dale Rescue Rangers, Donkey Kong Country, and Lion King, the game play was unique and interesting enough to make for a good run. Accepting.
