		"Performed a leftwards door check to enter the last room in Ceres without losing speed, after having changed the strategy for entering the tile room from the stairs room (which may or may not have helped here, but is at least equivalent in speed). This was accomplished by colliding with the ceiling and performing a backwards input at the same time of the transition occurring. This actually saved 2 frames before the first Zebes elevator due to reducing the amount of loading time of the transition by 1 frame, and due to 1 lag frame being removed from the last room in Ceres due to better RNG caused by the previously-saved frame. However, a frame was lost at the first Zebes elevator due to the elevator frame rule, amounting to a total of 1 saved frame here. (explanation of elevator frame rule coming soon maybe)

This prevented the screen from warping from position 0 to position 4, which is what normally happens when Samus collides with a ceiling while morphed. This cost 1 frame to perform, but reduced the transition length by 4 frames.

Excluding inputs related to the improvements above, all inputs were copied from the previous run, including Total's arbitrary code inputs.
