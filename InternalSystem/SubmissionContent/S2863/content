	"Shinryuu's Comments:
	$LF
	"Rockman 2 has been my main project since 2005. This project was started both aglasscage and me, we had many kind of plans, ideas and problems in the beginning. My motivation wasn't that high but aglasscage tried to keep things up and succeed in that task pretty well. aglasscage found many different tricks and techniques while going forward with this run. I feel a bit detached from this run because I couldn't show my true self, respect and innovation towards this precious pieace of insanity but I still hope my previous TAS attempts motivated and helped other people to understand things more better. This game isn't not a simple piece to run because there's many different kind of frame rules and they exists almost everywhere, the most annoying example is _item1_ positioning. I worked together with aglasscage with Flashman and Heatman stages, I optimized Airman's fight and my previous Wily 3 play through got copy pasted. I feel a bit relieved this run is completed and optimized outstandingly well because I'm "unable" and "unmotivated" to change back to myself I was a few years in the past. I hope people are going to ask many questions about this run and be open-minded about things they don't know so well. Feel our ambitious masterpiece which makes your soul to tremble in awesomeness.

	"aglasscage's Comments:
	$LF
	"I began this project with Shinryuu some time ago after I discovered some small improvements to heatman’s stage. After working together we were able to break the frame rule and improve the stage by 8 frames. Our movie originally began at this point. I worked together with Shinryuu mainly for the first three stages and then FinalFighter joined our project. From then on I worked directly with FinalFighter due to the fact that Mr. Shinryuu had many things going on in his life and little time to work on the TAS. pirohiko  joined our project some time later to help with the woodman stage and the bubbleman DownScroll.  Together pirohiko and I were able to improve the DownScroll over the previous movie (pirohiko succeed).

	"Flashman: 8 frames are saved in the flashman boss fight by using a previously known technique in a different location. The previous technique used in wily stage 1 of shooting twice so the second bullet hits the egg 1 frame faster is now applied to the flashman boss fight.
	$LF

[p

[p 
	"Airman: 8 frames are saved due to different item-1 usage and also better optimization in general especially over the long cloud section. 4 frames of lag are saved by using DelayRight from the bottom of the screen instead of the top and scrolling with 1xitem-1. Near the end of the stage, left is pressed for 1 frame and the egg is killed before the birds can pop out saving a few frames of lag as well.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	$UNPRINTABLE TEXT!!!
]p
[p 
	"Quickman: 18 frames are saved due to better item-1 rise manipulation and also slightly better lag manipulation. The last wall zip in the Quickman stage was very hard to do/manipulate. This is the largest possible jump from one item-1 to another once you have already entered the wall. Normally when you discuss item-1 rise you talk about the item-1 rising after 0, 1, 2, or 3 frames. However, in this case the exact values (0-255) of the item-1 rise must be manipulated correctly so there is a correct relationship in the item-1 rise between the second and third item-1 that are thrown. This makes the wall zip here very difficult and FinalFighter helped me on this greatly as well.

[p

[p 
	"Bubbleman: Due to some improvements early in the stage, which consist of item-1 manipulation and a different method of using 3x-item1 on the first zip in the stage, pirohiko and I were able to find a better frame for the bubbleman DownScroll than the previous TAS (pirohiko succeed). After I entered the boss gate I noticed that I lost frames compared to the previous movie because of the time it takes bubbleman’s health to fill. I talked about it with FinalFighter and he investigated it and came back with a memory address (water flag) which influences the rate at which bubbleman’s health refills. I manipulated this by turning for 1 frame to the right immediately before the last item-2 zip. Even though that may look like a lost frame it does not matter because we will have to wait some time before the bubbleman DownScroll anyways, and it correctly manipulates the water flag as well.

	"Wily 4: 8 frames are saved due to better item-3 manipulation. Also, in the room with the platform where 3xitem-1 are used to zip, the item-1 rise is manipulated perfectly from wily 3 so we can perform the fastest zipping possible. The second item-1 immediately pushes you up to the third item-1 where after 1 jump you are where you need to be in the ceiling so you can turn left and zip to the ladder. It is possible to manipulate it so the third item-1 immediately pushes you to the ceiling without needing to jump, but then the zipping is not possible.
