In brief, the foundation is built in a different way; clubs, hearts, spades and diamonds, instead of clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades and the following cards are moved in a different order: the nine of spades, the six of clubs (when moving to foundation pile) and the nine of clubs. 13 frames saved.

	"I was actually expecting someone else to figure out these flaws a long time ago. Oh well. Anyway, after playing the first 75 different layouts, I'm really starting to believe that the game cannot be solved any faster than this and this is the only layout that allows the game to be beaten in less than 38 seconds. It is a challenge to beat a game where every move except one either exposes a face-down card or moves a card from the waste. And in my experience, the game generates pretty bad decks in general.
