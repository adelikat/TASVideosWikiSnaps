	": This run has had mostly negative feedback in the thread. While the run seemed technically acceptable the main issue cited was that the autoscrollers were uninteresting and too many. Furthermore, the platforming stages are bland and don't make up for the autoscrollers in a run of this length. This falls under bad game choice and so I am rejecting this run. Best of luck with future submissions!
