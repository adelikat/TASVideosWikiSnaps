	"Mercs is a shoot them up where you play a soldier against an army. you can use your rifle gun which can be changed into flam throwe, rocket launcher... and megacrash bombs. like smash tv, you r in a big field and choose where you go. it was made by capcom, adapted by sega on genesis with two modes : arcade like the coin up and original, much longer with differents stages, boss and music.

	"this run aims the fastest time.

	"it is much much better that the previous one I submitted as I accurately shot only what's needed and use megacrash bombs and vehicles and saved lots of times with several tricks.

	"I use one bug which is in stage 2. usually, when your vehicle explode, you're blown away, but against tank 2 in stage 2, if your in a certain position you are on your foot,able to run.

	"usually, getting hit freeze the character but it give invincibility for some seconds. I got hit twice in stage 6 in order to save some times and pass through an electric field which usually kills at once

	"what is hard in mercs is :
	$LF
	"- 8 way moves and no scrolling : you have to choose the right path. because of bullets, you cant walk straight. the no scrolling make you the only one who set the speed of your run unlike usual shoot en up like thunderforce or r type.

[p 
	"- enemis appearances. enemis are randomly spawned and randomly shoots so sometimes, depending on where you are, they shoot or they dont shoot or they appear or they don't appear. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- vehicules . vehicules save time but are bigger so they get hit faster. sometimes I got hit by bullets so that I m invincible and am able to avoid tank missiles 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"this time, in the menu option I used a cheat code to enable hardest mode. enemis are faster, in fact as fast as the player, bullets are master and boss are tougher.

	"I hope you will enjoy that movie. mercs is quite fast, with a lot of actions. I also used the rocket launcher which is very hard to use in reality because it can shoot only three rockets at once. I developped few tricks that make it an amazing weapon. the music is also nice.
