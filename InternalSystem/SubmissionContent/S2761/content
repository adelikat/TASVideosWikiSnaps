The published movie was the first TAS I ever made and it's nostalgic for me to look at my old submission text and see how I improved (my English and TASing skill). This improvement was achieved by better optimization, better strategies and lag-reduction.

This would have saved about 10 seconds but sadly VBA doesn't emulate it. I found making this improvement pointless for a long time due to this since I didn't want to leave out an improvement which an upcoming emulator version would be able to emulate properly. But I still made this improvement anyway.
