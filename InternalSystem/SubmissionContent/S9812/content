	]em
	". Now you would think this game has something to do with the movie, right? Well, no and not even close. Remember when Dorothy floated in the air with her ruby slippers? Or instead of using water to melt the Witched Witch, the Tin Man just straight up kills her with his axe? Doesn't ring a bell? Well, when its a game developed by a company called Manley & Associates, you never know what you are gonna get.

He can throw gems like the others, but he has the axe attack. This does 3 damage compared to the 2 that gems do and the 1 that the wand, kick, and pitchfork do. His only time to shine is the Rat King and Witched Witch boss fights, where he just spams his axe and his enemies are defeated within seconds.

	"The bosses (except the Witched Witch), 2 Toto mini-games (Only one out of the three shown in this TAS), and enemy patterns/movements are all dependent on RNG. You can tell what RNG seed you have for bosses by looking at the memory address 
	[code 
		"0x0053
	]code
	". Now, the seed resets on each level enterance, so playing a level with a boss fight, playing the same way, and entering the boss fight room on the same frame will always yield the same result. All of this was found by lightbulbsun_dev on discord. Sadly, the Toto mice mini-game seems to be dependent on a different memory address, so right now, you just need to be really lucky and hope you get the fastest pattern (This will need more research and digging through memory addresses).

	"You first start off in Yellow Country in Shy Village and collect 2 tickets (one from a Toto mini-game and one from going through a maze of doors). The next level, Gamboge Gorge, I use this game's terrible floor detection to clip through the floor to get a ticket. Then, comes our first boss fight in Maize Meadow, a giant crow wearing a vest. I slow down by a frame to get the fastest RNG seed (In this case, it is 
	[code 
		"180
	]code
	"). At this point, the fastest way to defeat the Crow is to throw the yellow gems. After defeating the boss, we free the Scarecrow and have him available as a character. The rest of the country is not really interesting, just good platforming and then we go to Red Country.

	"The first part of Red Country is again, boring, just using Dorothy's shoe charge when it is appropriate. Then, we get to Carnelian Forest, this is where you fight a train to save the Tin Man. Before entering the boss fight, you can see that I slow down at the mouse for a bit. I did this because I wanted to get the fastest RNG seed for this boss fight (which is 
	[code 
		"55
	]code
	"). Now, the Train Boss has 19 health, so at this point, the fastest way to kill it is to use the yellow gems. The Train can stand still, jump, slow charge, or fast charge at you. We obviously want the Train to fast charge at us without jumping. I get a fast charge on this RNG seed and by doing frame perfect inputs to kill the Train, I prevent him from jumping. Defeating the Train unlocks the Tin Man.

	"The next interesting level is Crimson Caves. Near the end of the level, we come across a rotating gem platform. By jumping on it at the right time, you can perform a jump, making it faster than waiting for the platform to stop rotating. I thought of doing this because I wanted to know if you could just stand on the rotating platform. Finding out that you could jump off the rotating gem got me really excited because no human has ever done that in speedruns of this game, currently making it a TAS only trick and my first big find while TASing this game.

For the rest of the level, Dorothy uses her shoe charge to collect blue bricks and a yellow gem. The next interesting level is Smalt Furnace, where our next boss fight is. Using Dorothy and the Scarecrow, I damage boost through this whole level, getting to the boss fight with an RNG seed of 
	[code 
		"68

	". the fastest known seed for the boss fight. We switch to the Tin Man because I want to reserve gems and his axe does more damage. The Tin Man just swings his axe and defeats the Rat King, unlocking the Lion.

	"In the final country, we find ourselves near the Witch's castle (Called Mauve Castle). The Scarecrow shows his amazing tanking ability yet again in Mallow Marsh. Then, we enter the castle. We switch to the Lion to again damage boost through the stage at first. Midway through the level, we switch to Dorothy. I use her shoe charge to float over to a ticket and then jump down near the entrance of the boss fight. Yet again, I switch to the Scarecrow to get through the last part of the level and enter the Witched Witch boss fight. Again, the Witch doesn't have a RNG seed, she can either spawn on the left or right side of the boss arena. This is determined on which side you are further away from while you are on the platform going up to the arena.  Using the Tin Man yet again, he defeats the Witch with ease. Now, you would think this would be the end of the game. "Wait, why is there another 5 minutes to the run?", you may be asking yourself. We need to get to the Emerald City, which is coming up soon.

	"In Lavender Gardens, there is a Toto mini-game where you get a ticket for completing it. It is faster to tap the buttons rather than holding them down. This was found by the current WR holder of this game, Koffingrockz. Tapping saves around 3 seconds over just holding down the buttons. After the border crossing, we arrive at the Emerald City.

You collect 4 keys to go through the emerald vault doors to get to the final room of the game. In the final room, all you do is collect the tickets on the top left and right of the screen, with the Wizard being in the middle of the room.

I assume the mix of not having the RNG address(es) for the Toto minigames, the absurd luck needed to get the minimum 7 rolls for fastest completion (6 rolls of 12 + 1 roll of 6, or the slightly more likely 1 roll of 12 + 6 rolls of 11), and the time for the minigame to complete even under optimal conditions meant that doing the door maze in the tree was going to be faster.
