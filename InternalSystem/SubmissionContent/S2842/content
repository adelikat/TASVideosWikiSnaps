	"This is my first TAS ever! It's been done on Magnetica (also known as Actionloop and Shunkan Puzzloop), which is obviously Zuma. The goal of Challenge Mode is to get to level 100, by breaking marbles and creating chain reactions. This movie features the biggest chain reaction I could make, which is 18. I could also manage to get some 10+ chains in the highest levels! To close a decade of levels, I had to shoot a rocket that appears in the last level of a decade and that pushes the marbles.
