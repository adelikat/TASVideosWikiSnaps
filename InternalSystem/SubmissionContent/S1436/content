	"I get a Cotton Robe from an early enemy to get more INT, which let me have the DSS-combos active for a longer time, and also gives me a slight DEF-increase. This robe allows me to take a different route, which is a great timesaver. I also visit one less save room than the previous run does. I take a smaller detour in the first room of the Machine Tower, where I have to wait next to a Fox Hunter for a couple of frames (Around frame 23850, where I have to wait for the moving platform to lower itself). This move itself gains me 22 frames.

		" I slide and kill a few Skeletons on the way to the Eternal Corridor and the Underground Waterway, this saves me about 5 frames per Skeleton.
