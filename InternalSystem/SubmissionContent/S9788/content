		"This is the infamous incomplete Batman Prototype for the SNES that was formerly known as "Real Shitty Batman".  This was an idea for a beat em up game, and the prototype only has two levels, with the second level only having six enemies before the game just returns to the title screen.

If you select a 2 player option and start the game there is an additional Batman that appears, but no buttons will move it so it cannot be played past the initial start screen for those two cases.

		"For the very little mechanics that exist, Batman can move, , jump, punch, and kick.  The kick is stronger than the punch but is used much less.  The reason for that is that the punch is very effective at almost always stun locking the enemies in place.  Jumping is not used since it is a couple pixels slower.  Jumping is also bugged where if you get hit in the air you can then jump again, and can keep looping that.  Attacking also has a bug, where if you start an attack and get far enough into the animation there is a lingering hitbox that will damage the attacking enemy.

		"Enemies come out randomly from the left and right in groups of two or three. The trick is to manipulate them to all come out at the same side.  They come out at specific points in the levels.  The enemies are rather obnoxious since when they appear they always try to pincer you while the third one will go above or below you.  They also follow your movements which is exploitable.  If you move the character up then when they get closer move towards them and down at the right point you can punch them before they start moving around you.  They move at your speed so after a point it is not possible to catch them unless they get closer.  They also tend to move away from you if you move towards them.  The punch stunlock is very important to keep them in place.  The stunlock is not perfect, so sometimes slight movement adjustments are necessary. Also note that the "bottom" of the screen is not an area Batman can move to but the enemies can.

		"The "boss" Joker is not complete. When the Joker attacks the Joker turns into the standard enemy in the rest of the stage.  If you wait to attack at the right time then kicking does 5 or 6 times more damage than if you try to attack while it is in the "Joker" state.  This fight makes use of the odd lingering hitbox where if you press attack, but the enemy attacks you first then they will still take the hit.  Normally the Joker gets in close, hits, or gets hit, then moves away. However if you are able to get in very close the enemy script just continually attacks which is the fastest method here.

		"The first group of enemies appear on opposite sides of the screen. Found it is faster to just move forward a bit then backtrack and move up.  Then both enemies will move towards the punch area.  Then there are some rng manips to cause all the enemies to appear from that area run into the fist.  After six enemies the game resets.
