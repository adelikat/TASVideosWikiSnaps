	"Dragon Fighter looks at first to be a generic sidescrolling platformer action game 
	$LF
	"where you play as a fighter guy with a sword. But, you can also transform into
	$LF
	"a dragon during the levels, at which point the game becomes an autoscrolling 
	$LF
	"shooter game for a while. Despite that, this is in fact a generic platformer 
	$LF
	"action game most of the time (with the emphasis on dealing with the enemies), 
	$LF
	"but at least it's a well-made action game that's challenging and too short to 
	$LF
	"become repetitive for how varied it is.

	$LF
	"I press AAAABBBBABABABAB before starting the game to put it into hard mode. 
	$LF
	"Hard mode makes it so enemies don't drop items, and they fire a dying shot at 
	$LF
	"you if killed while you're a dragon. Also, their positions and actions are a
	$LF
	"little different. It doesn't seem like a lot, but those changes are enough to 
	$LF

	"I jump at the start from midair, because I can. I don't kill the first enemy

	$LF
	"killing an enemy normally gives. I jump when attacking to avoid having to wait
	$LF
	"on the ground while the sword swing animation plays out. Some of the enemies
	$LF
	"here take two hits to kill, so I hit them with the end of one attack and the
	$LF
	"start of the next to kill them without slowing down. There are supposed to be
	$LF
	"a bunch of annoying snowflake enemies attacking me; you can see them on the
	$LF
	"top-left part of the screen, but they get lost off the screen when I move as
	$LF

[p 
	"Partway through the level I get enough dragon points to transform into a 
	$LF
	"dragon (by holding up at the peak of a jump), so I do that as soon as 
	$LF
	"possible because the dragon moves very quickly. But, it also puts the screen 
	$LF
	"into a slow auto-scrolling mode, meaning that staying as a dragon is much 
	$LF
	"slower than simply walking. So, I transform back before bumping the right edge 
	$LF
	"of the screen, keep moving and building dragon power while the screen catches 
	$LF
	"up, and repeat throughout the level.

[p 
	"Some of the enemies shoot hard-mode projectiles because I transform into a

	$LF
	"Killing an enemy while already in dragon form does not give any dragon power.
	$LF
	"I don't use the dragon form for the last stretch right before the boss because
	$LF
	"the boss is activated by the screen's scrolling position and I was already

	"I hit it with a charged shot for 12 damage, then use the dragon form for

	$LF
	"for a sword swing. Also, the dragon can fire another shot sooner than usual
	$LF
	"when the center part of the previous shot goes offscreen quickly, so I hit 
	$LF
	"the boss with the diagonal parts while missing with the center part in order 
	$LF
	"to damage it much more frequently than normal while it's on the right side

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"It's impossible to face leftward in dragon form.
	$LF
	"Charged shots aren't used after the first hit because they take a long time

	$LF
	"keeping it there with the fast consecutive dragon shots that allows for.
	$LF
	"It looks like I knock it too high up, but I would have to wait while it's 
	$LF

	"and time-wasting compared to enemies of previous levels. I skip the armored

	"guys on top of 3 wheels because they take 5 hits to the back to kill. The
	$LF
	"flying green ones that drop invincible wheels are worth killing, though,
