	": I has to optimize the routes that WSR and qwerty were taking so that I can get all of the chaos emeralds in both acts. One glitch I kept was in act 2 where I take damage from spikes which leads me into a wall and I can zip out of it. I managed to figure out a feel for it and managed to squeeze in the 7 chaos emeralds so that, that part is over.

	": Act 1 has a level wrap where if you jump on a certain frame on the loop on the top at the start, knuckles on one frame can glide into a portion which zips him into the end of the act. Act 2 was very glitch heavy, I may of lost 1 frame from the y-subpixel positions, the loop glitch where I clip into the ground was a struggle because of how precise I needed to be with my inputs, but I eventually made it to the end in very fast time.

	": Hated Act 1 but figured out the level wrap and boss mechanics, but getting pushed into the floor with the item box when the goal post comes down was PAINFUL, took me about 6 hours just trying to get in the right position to where I start to stand up enough so that the item box puts me into the ground. Act 2 was just why I never gave up the item box glitch because of the level wrap I needed from it. Had to wait to 6 seconds because if I didn't, the wrap would put me in the wrong position and I'd be stuck in the level.
