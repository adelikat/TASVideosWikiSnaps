The Fountain of Dreams collected the hopes and dreams of all living things. It was also responsible for the sweet dreams and rest that come from deep sleep. But one day, everyone in Dream Land lost the ability to dream! King DeDeDe was bathing in the Fountain of Dreams!

Now, Kirby must embark on an adventure... to restore peaceful nap times to all the residents of Dream Land...”
