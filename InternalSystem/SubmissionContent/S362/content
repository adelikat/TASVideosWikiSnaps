	"This is my first run, and I started it after reading a request on the board. No warps or passwords are used (there are none), no damage is taken (didn't want to lose the Pan sword), and I try to make the run not only fast, but "artistic", meaning I use the edge animation "pose" when I don't think it will waste time. I think the hardest part was leaping over some of the enemies--the hitboxes were larger than expected. The reason why you see me attacking so much is that the "run" button is linked to the attack, so I have to do that to move quickly.
