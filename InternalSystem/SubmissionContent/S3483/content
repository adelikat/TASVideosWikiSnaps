	"This is an improvement of 1559 frames over mmbossman's currently published run of Vectorman 2. The improvement consist mostly of a generally higher level of optimization, and there are few points where I gain a really big amount of time in a specific place. Over 100 frames of lag where removed as well. The only new trick I found was that if you jump just as you walk of the edge of a platform, you can make a second jump within ~5 frames of the first jump without activating the booster, which enables you to do a sort of triple jump. This allowed me to make some otherwise impossibly high jumps and probably saved a couple of seconds in total throughout the run. Also, shoting diagonally upwards directly after landing makes you regain max running speed faster, but if you already have a high speed when landing you only gain a very small amount of speed, and it's therefore not always worth it due to lag.

	"When getting the rhino powerup I managed to increase my max speed in the same manner as the roller blade levels, though the increase was a bit greater in this level. I manage to navigate more tightly around corners after getting the powerup too, which saved a decent amount of time. Also, while having this powerup my speed is maintained even if I touch a wall, which is why I sometimes hug the wall when falling down a shaft while I have this powerup.

	"This stage was really weird to optimize because breaking a block starts to destroy more blocks in a somewhat random chain reaction. This made it tricky to quickly destroy blocks while leaving ledges to jump up on. On the boss, I manage to get in a little extra damage while he is still fazing in and out, which in combination with some extra shots was enough to reduce the amount of boosts needed to kill him by 1

	"Pretty uninteresting level. Jumping continually is faster, and you can get a slightly higher speed by jumping at the right moment when going up or down a slope (this boost in speed can the be kept until you stop or do a damage boost, no matter if you keep jumping or not. I run in to a wall at one point and lose my speed, but this doesn't slow me down as I have to wait for an elevator. It was needed to do in order to get to the point where the elevator was triggered as fast as possible.

	"The boss was quite tricky to optimize, as it's legs was constantly in the way. I managed to do more damage on average with my boosts and managed to do them more frequently. The second platform breaks when his HP hits 36, so I made sure to get his health to 37 before the last boost to minimize the amount of shots it took to kill him from the ground.
