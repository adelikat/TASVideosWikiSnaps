	"The Mario Artist series of games are creative art programs for the ill fated Nintendo 64 Disk Drive add-on. Mario Artist: Polygon Studio, released on 29 August 2000, is the one where players can used prefab parts, including unlockable ones, to create their own machinations to use in the various game modes and also other Mario Artist games. This game has three game modes that aren't just modelling objects and sets: the Experimental World mode where the player can use their models to explore and collect new parts, the Sound Bomber mode where the player's model is put into 8 microgames and whose concept was later expanded with WarioWare, and Go-Go-Park where the player's goal is to wind up their model to reach the goal area without going over. This TAS plays though the 3 stages of Go-Go-Park and reaches that game's credits as fast as possible.

	"A small note about the branch name, Go-Go-Park. The fan translation names it Chicken Race to match the WarioWare minigame with the same concept. The Super Mario Wiki names the mode Go-Go-Pack as it matches how the Japanese name of the mode can be romanized: Go-Go-Pa-Ku. I went with Go-Go-Park as it both closely matches the Japanese name and conveys the goal of the game of stopping at the right place.

	"Holding down quickly lowers the wind up to near zero. I say near zero as releasing down does give a small rev-up. Waiting gradually lowers the wind up which can  be used for potentially more precise wind ups.

	"The main note for speed is to just barely reach the goal area with the minimal amount of winding. Winding up as fast as possible for the minimal amount usually gets just enough. However, there are cases where waiting some frames after the final input before pressing the A button. This can be used to get to the goal faster by going a little less farther than rapidly winding up and immediately pressing the A button. This is used for Stage 1 since when I tried that for the other stages I ended up too short for waiting to be beneficial compared to just getting the minimal wind up necessary via rapid inputs.
