		" Bald Bull 1: 53.82 (was 55.25) The sole reason for this submission. McHazard and Zallard1 found new strategies. McHazard told Zallard1, who didn't really remember the ins and outs of the strategy, but found out that with a 19 on the clock for the first knockdown, Bald Bull could take an extra punch after around 0:30 with this strategy. I'dd recommend looking at the previous run's submission notes (
