	": So I did some testing for myself trying to tackle 3-1's 4-6-7-9-10 split AKA the Greek Church split. I could only find one recorded instance of a Greek Church split being picked up compared to 4 different 7-10 split pick ups being recorded on television, so this frame is kin of cruel. After an hour of testing I couldn't find a way to get all of the pins since at best the 4 or the 6 pins remained as I couldn't get the opposite pin to slide across. Either this would need a lot more time to figure out or the game engine isn't built in a way that allows someone to pick up that split. As for the rest of the frames the optimization looks solid. Nice work!
