	"So this movie is actually something I completed back in 2021 but had plans to remake using analog controls with Samsara, but it just never panned out for a multitude of reasons.  However my version that used the standard d-pad controls wasn't too far off of what an optimized analog stick run would look like, though I could see some more frames being shaved off.  But at this point I think having this version of the movie out and published is better than keeping it under wraps, so that's why I'm deciding now to submit it.

	"So we pretty much can abuse the game's weird bounds correction that causes Jackie Chan to teleport to the rooftop ares of the main hub world, then with a clip into the wall we can make our way to the final level, by doing a backflip and pausing the game at the right moment we can trigger the entrance into the last level of the game.

	": This is really good execution. Because this is such a short running game, I didn't expect to see such a cut over the WR. If I'm not mistaken, it appears to be closer to 1 minute faster over the best human run. As stated in the thread, multiple tricks were used to help in this optimization and certainly added to the watch-ability. Great job EZ!
