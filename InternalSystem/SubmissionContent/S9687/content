		"In chapter 12, where the big exposition dump happens and the truth about Future London is revealed: right before the "London Warped" mystery is stamped with "The Whole Story," I skip some frames in text mashing just a little bit. If the text mashing was done perfectly, the stamping animation would play without any sound, which does happen earlier with certain other sound effects during voiced dialogue, but also have an extra 2 or 3 seconds of waiting before being able to tap "OK."
