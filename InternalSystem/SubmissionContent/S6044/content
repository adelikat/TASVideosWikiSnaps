	"I was not expecting this TAS to be particularly entertaining, perhaps due to my distaste for soda, but I ended up liking it a lot more than I thought I would. I found it strangely charming and the audience appears to like it as well. Of note is that the last submission was hurt by a lack of BGM present in the emulator and it had to be added in through editing. The current TAS is at an 
	[a class=intlink href=/Rating.exe/2542/Details 
		"average entertainment rating of 6.4
	]a
	" which is relatively close to the border between Vault and Moons. These two submissions are admittedly fairly similar but the existing TAS had some fairly superhuman play as is and the new strategy in stage 3 scene 1 where you run between the trucks is the exact kind of thing that pushes this movie over the edge.
