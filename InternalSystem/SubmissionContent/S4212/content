	"It appears nobody has TASed this yet, and for good reason:  It's bloody boring.  But still, we have the vault now so there's still hope it seems.  The game features a cycle of 5 levels which get repeated on 4 increasing difficulties, thus 20 levels total.  Each level will be failed if you don't accomplish enough of the goals, with a special bonus awarded at the end for getting all of them.  In this run, each level has all goals completed, which are broken down as follows:

	"Destroy enough stuff on the way down for victory, destroying everything if you want the best ending.  This also includes using all banisters, even though the occasional one could be skipped with proper speed control.  Each canopy can be bounced on up to 5 times for extra points, but going straight through is obviously faster.

	"Collect enough air canisters to survive the crash, in a car which moves equally fast both straight and diagonal.  This means all paths take the same time, so collecting all doesn't really cost any extra time.  One exception is during the 4th level, where a bit of backtracking was needed.

	"Tag enough poles, while avoiding trees.  Fastest means of movement is jumping, followed by going straight, then of course diagonal movement.  Jumping is viable if there's huge gaps between poles, so as little diagonal movement as possible is needed here.

	"Get enough safe bombs into the boxes, without packing any lit bombs in.  Feel free to smash the bonus parts while you're at it, but nothing too taxing.  Super trivial to TAS, thus super boring to watch.

	"Very easy to reach terminal velocity, and in space there's no friction to slow you down.  This means flying to the end just turns into another game of flappy bird, and the only thing needed for the best end to these levels is crashing your vehicle in the vertical position.  Super easy to TAS, thus super boring to watch.

	": The bombless courses aren't bad the first time around, but with five similar variants of each the run gets boring quite fast. Accepting for publication in the Vault as the "best ending" branch, which is Vault eligible.
