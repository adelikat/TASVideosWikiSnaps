	"I used JPN version though I think there are a lot of visitors who played USA version. If you used to play USA, this movie may look a little strange. There are some differences in JPN and USA. The block of JPN is harder than that of USA, so we need jump a lot in order to break the block. In this respect, JPN is unsuitable for speedrun. But in JPN, we can collect many Secret coins which are needed to see the best ending by using death in Round 7. This is because the arrangement of the item is different.

	"Jack can jump high and do Power-up to 3 levels by using Mighty coins. The length of this Power-up is based on the number of times we press A button. The more A button is pressed, the more the length of Power-up shortens.

	"In the bomb rooms, when we touch the first bomb, another one is lit. (It changes by the bomb taken first.) We can warp to the bomb room of next Round by taking this lit bomb last. However, to see the best ending, we must collect 2 crystals and at least 5 Secret coins. So I don't use this warp in all Rounds in order to collect them.

	":  I am rejecting this submission due to sub-par technical quality.  Also, this game seems to have a very small following.  While I kind of enjoy the run, I think the majority of the TAS community will not.  Therefore, I am not so sure that an improved movie would be accepted.
