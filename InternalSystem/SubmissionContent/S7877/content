	"The combat is also rather simple, with few enemies actually fighting back, the game becomes more about hunting down the opponents and not letting them slip away rather than a challenging fight. The most important thing to keep in mind optimization-wise is that one is only allowed to proceed to the next screen once all enemies from the current screen have disappeared, and they only begin disappearing once they're on the ground, undisturbed. This means that any attacks that send the enemies flying can be detrimental when used incorrectly.

	"The name should be pretty self-explanatory. This combo, which does not have a special animation, stunlocks any enemy until I stop attacking. This combo is very useful in taking out tankier enemies, as well as dropping enemies directly to the ground once the combo is over.

	"This combo fully depletes the health bar of a standard enemy and is faster than chaining the stunlock until said enemy dies. The downside to it is it kills the enemy in the air, making them fly quite a while before hitting the ground. This makes it very useful in getting rid of enemies quickly, but should not be used on the last enemy of the group.

	"A large portion of the movement in this run relies on RNG and so there's certainly lots of room for improvement on enemy patterns alone. Getting them to bunch up in one spot and be hit all at once is the biggest timesave one can hope for throughout the run, and while I believe to have done quite well manipulating what I could, I'm sure there's many better patterns to find.

	"As for execution mistakes, at the end of the third screen I accidentally sprint into the pile of dead bodies, knocking them over and making them bounce. This unnecessarily delays the screen transition by 22 frames. Unfortunately I only noticed this while rewatching the TAS after finishing it, and attempting to fix it lead to an RNG desync two screens over.
