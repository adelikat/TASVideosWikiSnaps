	"I have been looking for improvements to popular games for a long time. Recently, when I tried to do the flagpole glitch at walking speed, andrewg_ came up with the PAL version and also pointed out an useful 
	[a class=extlink href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YklSnam0w-Q rel=nofollow 
		"glitch
	]a
	" that only works on that version. I started working on this run as a fun project to take a break from my other projects, which I'm not very motivated to do.

	"The trick above never got used since I managed to do the flagpole glitch with Mario stuck in front of it, so there was no need to enter a floor (and no need to use a bullet bill in 8-2 either). Later, I also managed to enter the wall in 1-2 which prevented me from continuing on this project for a while. Chances were good that this run would save much time over the NTSC TAS.

	"I'm not sure about the attitude of people towards this TAS which uses the PAL version in order to save time. I don't think it would be very well-received, but since there's no harm in submitting a finished TAS, here it is!
	$LF

[p 
	"Since this was only a fun project, I didn't bother much about the 21-frame rule. There is also a lag frame in 8-1 that I couldn't remove. I think it's still a pretty good run. I wanted to make this run a little different than the published TAS and I used some different ways of doing things. Maybe you will like it.

	"So I will leave this one here. Maybe it can be linked from the published movie.

	"(I would like TASvideos to change its way of presenting its runs in the future.

	" and 
	[a class=intlink href=/Forum/P/239012#239012 
		"here
	]a
	" for places where I expressed this. This PAL TAS would be a candidate to put onto a page along with other Super Mario Bros TASes)
