	"The answer is entered using up or down on the joystick. Up cycles through the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, … whereas down cycles down through 9, 8, 7, … Once the desired number is reached, the button is used to select it.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Clicking up/down to reach 0 or 9 uses one frame, then clicking B uses another frame. This means that the minimum frames used is 2. Every time the number gets further away from 0 or 9, it will take another 2 frames since the joystick must be released, then pressed again. Continuing this pattern leads to 0 = 2 frames, 1 = 4 frames, 2 = 6 frames and so on. It is worth scrolling up if you have 4 as your answer but down if you have 5 and above. Continuing this pattern gives the below table, and checking each entry shows that it aligns with the formula stated in the theorem.

	"It is worth getting single digit answers close to either 0 or 9 and manipulating away anything that does not fit this trend. Different questions can be obtained by delaying the answers to the previous questions by a single frame.

[div class=p 
	"Sometimes it is worth tracing back 3-4 questions, to get on a different manipulation seed and therefore better answers.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"A good example of this manipulation is the division random pattern (mode 8) as many of the answers are 1 and without manipulation, they can be extremely messy and involve entering remainders.
