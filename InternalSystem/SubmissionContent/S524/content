	"This is a single game of Tecmo Bowl on the fceu emulator (first week). This is not tool-assisted and isn't a speed run. Rather it aims to win by the largest margin possible. Since the final score is 98-0, it comes pretty close to the best possible. As a note, be patient on the kickoff after the first touchdown. I was having problems with another application popping up over the emulator.
