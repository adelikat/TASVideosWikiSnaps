	"This is an improvement of 2,054 frames (34 seconds) over the published run. This time was gained through a new glitch in which Samus can travel across multiple rooms while in the background of the game. This trick is used to complete Kraid first, which also eliminates the need to collect any missile tanks. A secondary improvement was made in the statue room. Samus no longer has to wait for the enemy to defrost; she simply jumps through the ceiling from underneath.
