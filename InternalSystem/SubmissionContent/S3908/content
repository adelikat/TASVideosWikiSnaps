	"The "randomize digit location" is @ $CC84. It uses 5 memory values (from 0080 ~ 0087) that changes multiple times within a frames and the input (0047) also influences them. Usually the "randomize digit location" called by $D930 for the 1st digit, and $CB7E for the remaining ones for 1 time. This TAS manipulates these values before this function calls to spawn the digit. This results in digits spawned at the nearest spot to complete the levels inhumanly fast. Generally, it has a very low chance to get even near to your snake.
