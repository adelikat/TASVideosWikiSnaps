	"This game is a puzzle platformer in 3D isometric view. Pinocchio has to go through 100 rooms, where he has to walk on the arrow tile every time.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"What's fun in the run is that a lot of rooms are solved without using the regular way. Also the 3D isometric view makes that sometimes you don't know where Pinocchio is.
	$LF

	"Maybe a word on Pinocchio's movements. They are very simple. Pinocchio doesn't move up/down or left/right when you don't press these keys (there is no acceleration). Running up for 10 frames, then running right for 10 frames, will get you at the same position than running up and right for 10 frames. He can only jump one unit at a time. Running in diagonal looks like Pinocchio runs faster, but this is due to 3D isometric view.

	"The game is lagging quite a lot, which forced me to readjust my inputs once I finished a run, after I redid level 33.

	"Even though the run is fast paced, it is most of the time self explanatory. I will only comment on the levels which need some explanations, or those who introduce new mechanics.

	"Room 6 : You can push blocks in 2 directions at the same time if you have the right position

[p 
	"Room 7 : These guys run straight at you, and faster than you. There are slower and faster ones
	$LF

[p 
	"Room 23 : You can pick and drop the marked blocks by pressing B. You have to stand on them to pick them, and cannot drop them while in the air
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Room 33 : Ghosts move randomly. I manipulated this one by waiting 1 frame before the start of the level, so that the ghost comes out faster
	$LF

[p 
	"Room 34 : The arrow is under the block
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Room 41 : Once you've entered the castle, a new music is available, but to listen to it you have to pause the game. I lose 8 frames on purpose to pause/unpause, for the sake of your ears
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Room 79 : You can decide where these high moving platforms go by moving on the edge of the platform towards the direction you want to go
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Room 88 : The marked block is under the regular block
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Room 90 : I manipulate the ghost by waiting 1 frame before the level starts. I push the block to the left while going a bit down. This is done by alternating left+down and left, otherwise the block goes left+down
