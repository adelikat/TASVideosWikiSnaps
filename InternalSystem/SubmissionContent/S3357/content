	"Amagon is a game about a soldier sent to depopulate a remote island for future colonization and resource exploitation by the western powers. The game, however, is so infamously difficult that its underlying message becomes one of the futility of standing up to the unwavering forces of nature. Mankind's unquenchable thirst for resources and land will have to stop somewhere, and if the enemies in this game have any say in it, it will stop with Amagon. The game ultimately becomes a critique of the substantial natural cost of "slash and burn" capitalism. Also, you can turn into a muscleman and punch stuff.

[div class=p 
	"When Amagon or Megagon jumps, you lose a frame, but edge boosting off a corner will gain you a few frames, depending on the nature of the corner and which form you are in (Megagon gets better boosts than Amagon). Thus, no unnecessary jumps are made in this run. There are a few instances in which I jump to kill a seemingly non-dangerous enemy. This is for one of three reasons: it will become dangerous momentarily, its presence on the screen will cause more lag frames than the jump will cost, or to manipulate the order of item drops at the end of a level. Edge boosting is a bit more complex than it should be in this game. Megagon's boosts are slightly longer than Amagon's, and he has an extra frame (or two, sometimes, for no obvious reason) in which he can jump following a successful boost. Not all edges can be used for boosts: any platform you can jump through from below cannot be used for boosts.

	"In this run, I transform into Megagon as soon as possible at the beginning of each boss level. This is because Megagon gains a frame over Amagon for each second of forward movement. There are a few tricks to playing as Megagon, though. His attacks (uppercut and power-wave) are on an 8-frame cycle that counts down as you move. If you attack outside of the one optimal frame in the cycle, you'll lose as many frames in forward movement as it takes to reach the end of the cycle. Therefore, Megagon can only attack once every eight frames at best. Doing multiple attacks in a row takes longer, so unless you want Megagon to plant his feet and stand around for a while, you have to wait out a second cycle before attacking again. There is also a glitch involving his two attacks: if you try to execute a power-wave during the cooldown cycle after an uppercut, Megagon will do the animation for it but the attack won't happen. By autofiring B, you can keep Megagon in this position indefinitely, and hitting enemies while in this state does more damage than the uppercut.
