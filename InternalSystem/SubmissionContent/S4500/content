	"STAGE 1 has a lot of things to wait for: cars and bikers. Most of the time breaking a wall involves jumpin on the last hit so i can move as soon as it is destroyed and no longer obstructs (unless i have more obstructions later).

	"Mirror Maniac is pushed back as fast as I can so he can receive a very timing-specific infinite combo in the face. In the start, mashing will get you through the OoBs combo but after a while he tends to escape easily, you can't restart punching as soon as possible but if u wait 1 frame he stays there getting hit.

	"Morphed just for fun, it's what I can do to entertain you in the autoscroller.
	$LF
	"Morphing before the boss is useless since I won't have time to fill the meter but I did anyway.
	$LF
	"The boss will teleport if he isn't committed to a move yet, hence the reason why I kept not hitting him in the first frame he's vulnerable but the first attacking frame. I couldn't get him to do the correct attacks at the first possibility so I just made him start over with the upattack (the one that juggles him into another lane).

	"Morphin freezes time, so I use it to kill the midboss (I'll have do it anyway sometime).

	"It also gives invincibility and replenishes life, which is also exploited sometimes. You can jump with the other character to move a little while morphing.

	"There was luck manipulation on the first part to make sure the robots drop BIG power cores. I only lose a few frames and it's better than farming along the way, which requires more enemies and more positioning for the drops.

	"In the second part not only the platforms of this game, but now the robots and smashing pillars have wonky collision boxes. Don't be fooled by the video/sprites, as they're much bigger and I couldn't get better chances of jumping around them.
