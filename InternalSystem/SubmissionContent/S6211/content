	": The game manual seems to be blatantly lying. I found room counter that resets after 5 rooms ($7053) and some counter that increases every time the rooms counter resets. ($70A6). That counter seems to initially store the difficulty you've chosen (4 in this run). But despite of having played through 11 rooms, I failed to find any trace of increasing difficulty. Everything remains the same, only random behavior of enemies changes, and the speedy ladder climb timing slightly changes. Well, lag too. None of that looks like internally defined difficulty really.
