If it is truly an emulation issue, then we'll take arguments in the future and look at another submission. Regardless of the frame count (within reason though), it will obviously obsolete this submission...mainly because we want true emulation of the NES console.

	"We all understand that Action 52 is a horrible package of rushed developed games. Many of them don't have a true ending, which leaves us to determining an ending point that meshes with our rules. In this case, it does appear that the game is so poorly designed and can be tricked into showing content that wasn't intended by the developers. This is sorta like the SMB Minus World runs, where broken coding generates wild and bizarre layouts to explore.  Bubble Gum Rossie appears to be a similar case, although achieved much differently. Just note that because of broken code, there are always situations that can be generated that don't make sense. Even I have discovered things like this among recent TAS I've done. So it is not uncommon that breaks happen in this fashion.

	"I want to state that I have actually enjoyed seeing TASes of these games. As an RTA run, they don't provide much for analysis; however, TASing is certainly exposing mechanics and glitches that aren't necessarily capable human strats. So, its been a fun and interesting ride. I look forward to more.
