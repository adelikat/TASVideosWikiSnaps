	[em 
		"Pokonyan!
	]em
	" is based off old Japanese anime and manga 
	[em 
		"Pokonyan!
	]em
	", which is about a magical tanuki (raccoon-dog). Tanuki are widely believed (in myth) to have shapeshifting abilities. But for some reason, this tanuki (Pokonyan) eats a lot of fruit and ends all his sentences with "nyan". And is not a cat.

[div class=p 
	"Anyway, the story starts off with Miki having all her precious candy stolen by five good-for-nothing squirrels (actually, they're supposed to be kitsune, but I still call them squirrels). It's Pokonyan to the rescue! Of course, you never actually see this because I skip the intro cutscene, but trust me, it's there.

[div class=p 
	"The gameplay is almost designed for children. It is impossible to die, and there is no concept of damage in this game. You can get hit, but that's about it. The game includes a timer, yet nothing happens when it runs out. Of course, it's still possible to go quite fast through each level, so it makes for a good TAS.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Since Pokonyan needs to have a healthy diet, he must collect (at least) 15 fruit in every stage. Of course, I aim to have exactly 15 since any more would lengthen the sequence at the end by a few frames per extra fruit.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The physics in this game are a bit weird. First of all, Pokonyan has a double jump. Now Pokonyan goes faster when he runs off a ledge. Normally, jumping from ground slows you down, but when jumping in mid-air after running off a ledge, he maintains very fast speed. Furthermore, after hitting an enemy, Pokonyan may take an additional mid-air jump (think Super Mario Bros. 2 (USA) double-jump, except not a glitch). This leads to chaining jumps off of enemies to go far.

[div class=p 
	"Pokonyan can drop down to the area below by down+jump. This is useful in a couple areas, but nowhere else, since it drops speed.

	"As a magical tanuki, Pokonyan has four transformations, but since it takes a prohibitively long time to transform, the only time this issue comes up is on the third squirrel boss fight, which I will describe in the level info below.
