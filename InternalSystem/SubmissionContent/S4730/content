	"This is a TAS of Pingu for the GameBoy. A (for some reason) Japan only game consisting on minigames that happen each day, like fishing, hockey and the normal routine of stop-motion claydoll penguins. Pingu is some hardcore MLG pro swag penguin that noot noots all day by pissing of his family and wrecking everyone at either dancing or snowball fightin'.

	"This TAS beats the current RTA record held by werster by 1 minute and 7 seconds. It also has tradeoffs like glitching sprites or going out of bounds to bring some entertainment. I like Pingu, even though I didn't grew up with it I think it's hilarious. Also hyped to officially start adelikat's All Platforms Challenge, that could kill me if I get too lazy at doing stuff.

	"Fishing wasn't too easy to figure out. It relies on your movement and X position rather than RNG. I got the fastest solution I could come up with. Some fishes can make you lose a bait since they're going too fast, that's why I don't catch some big fish on the stage.

[p 
	"Here's where I try my best to entertain. This minigame relies on platforming and very specific jumping. There's this up+down glitch I use to bring some entertainment, which glitches Pingu's sprites a whole lot. The down side to this is that it slows down the game, but man is it fun to see Pingu morphing into Japanese letters and splitting his body in pieces... even though doing that too much freezes the game. The ice platforms themselves are weird though, since it will be safe to jump into the edge, but no, you fall. Even by glitching the game a bit, it still beats the segment by a couple secs.

	"Hockey was very easy. Not much to say since it relies more on the timing of when do you shot. Other than getting out of bounds it's pretty optimal and beats the segment by few frames.

	" Day 4
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Optimal snowball fights in this game rely on your actions. It's not RNG, rather specific AI patterns. For example, you see I take a hit after I throw a snowball, this makes the penguin I want to shoot go to the direction I want him to go. Manipulation is easy once you get the gist(incorrect word) of it and lets you kill faster. Destroys current RTA record by huge amount because of this.
