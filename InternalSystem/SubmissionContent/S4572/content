	"Here is how the game works: you start off in a random location with a random set of 3 tasks to do before you can find Patti. I'm almost certain that this is the fastest route despite the relatively long autoscroller in the middle. You almost always get some kind of autoscroller and most of the routes waste a lot of time running between multiple locations.

	"In an RTA, it is possible to get this set of tasks AND spawn immediately in the mall. However it took me so many frames of waiting at the title screen to manipulate this scenario that it was faster to pick an earlier frame placed in a different spot and travel to the mall instead.

	"The two "boss fights" (Klotzilla and Robo-Bone) are simple, just hit the targets at the first possible frame. I tried my best to optimize movement.
