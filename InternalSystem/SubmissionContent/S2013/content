	"this was a run to get familiar with the emulator. less desyncs than oot and much more fun. after i saw slash star dash's run on speedruns.net, i tried a hitless run to gain experience and basic knowlegde about tasing. now i see that its 4seconds faster than slash's run, because i found a new shortcut at the end. its a really long jump where you save some seconds, more seconds than  than i lost with "takes damage to save time" tactic jumps. the game is very entertaining so i just submit the run and hope it will be accepted since theres no previous one. please watch it with mupen or at youtube before voting no :P

	": The general consensus seems to be that this is played somewhat poorly, and I agree. A much higher degree of precision could be achieved by using a tool such as the TAS input plugin, as was mentioned. Rejecting.
