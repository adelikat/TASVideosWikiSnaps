	"Animaniacs is about three creatures of undetermined species who hang out in a water tower over Warner Studios, only coming out when they want to cause trouble, much to the irritation of Ralph the security guard. Pinky and the Brain are two mice, the latter super-intelligent and bent on conquering the world, the former just dumb. In this game they're carrying out one of their plots, and the animaniacs have to stop them for some reason by heading through four studios of varying genres, collecting pages of scripts, and then going to the editing room for the final showdown. How any of these events correlate story-wise, I haven't the foggiest, but it really doesn't matter.

	"In this run I collect only the script required to end the game and take nothing that could be construed as damage, as this game is a one-hit kill thing, and whatever I do hit just stuns me. I dash most of the time, which can't be done consecutively without any interstitial frames. Out of the three dash cancellation methods I tested (waiting, braking and jumping out of it), waiting took the least amount of time before the next opportunity to dash was available.

[p 
	"An odd thing about this game is that vertical movement is rather restricted and is split into three "lanes". They can't be switched while dashing, so (sometimes particularly ugly) pauses in movement occur occasionally as various unjumpable obstacles rely on this lane structure.

	"This is my first TAS, so this movie probably isn't as optimized as it should be (the rerecord count is frighteningly low), but I used frame advance for the whole thing and I think I know the game pretty well, so I did the best I could do.

The squid can't be hit until it turns pink, after which it re-emerges and turns red again unless you're precise enough to hit it before it fully rises (which is, of course, what I do). The developers didn't give me much help in the way of "creating art while waiting."

	"Boss - The coconuts can't be picked up until they stop bouncing, which is why I wait. I also get to show off the ridiculously flawed pattern used for the gorilla hands by sitting in one position for a period of time without dying. This game features the most random boss placements I've ever seen.

[p 
	"Part 2 - In normal play, the water below the platforms equals instant death because the alligator is practically unavoidable due to its speed. Fortunately, normal play isn't the case here. I can't dash in either situation and the platforms require some Warner-stacking (see opening stage for an example of that), so this is faster by default.
