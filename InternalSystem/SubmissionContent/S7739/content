	"If I'm being honest, this wasn never submitted before here because of... well, me thinking about certain parts of the run and how they could be optimized like at timestamp 1:12:57. It was unintended, but I thought the simplest mistakes, and sections that could be optimized weren't submission worthy. Saying this because I was thinking of my previous submissions... when now I'm realizing it was because of my game choice.

	", I had some concerns at first because 1-6 is noticeably slower in the TAS. You mentioned a delayed punch on the world 7 ending as well. However, as I kept going with the comparisons, it seems your understanding of the game improved and the run maintained a good quality of optimization after that. Every run this long is going to have some mistakes in it, and the great parts of the movie are redeeming enough that I think this should be published. Accepting!
