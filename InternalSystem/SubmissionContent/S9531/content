		"Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian
	]em
	" is a 2009 game based on the movie of the same name. The DS version was developed by The Fizz Factor and sees Larry Daley, a former night watchman, in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C. This museum, now hosting a magical, golden tablet makes all of the exhibits come to life at night. Kahmunrah, the evil brother of the pharaoh Ahkmenrah, steals the magic tablet, scattering pieces of it across the museum, and plans to use his powers to raise an undead army. It's up to Ben Sti- I mean, Larry to put a stop to it in this 2D platforming game!

I then discovered that by equipping the Moon Ingot and holding back, you can immediately slow down your horizontal momentum. This didn't end up being super useful here however. Since we have to jump over the enemies anyway, how much of each corner we cut doesn't really matter. In fact, it's actually better to slide down the walls, as there's a small slope on each corner, allowing us to land sooner and charge our dash again quicker. I only use switch to the Moon Ingot to avoid landing on one corner, as that one in particular is quite janky, and forces Larry to land on it twice.
