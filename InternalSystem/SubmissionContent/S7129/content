	"Black Castle is a homebrew game made by User0x7f in 2020. As described on its download page, Black Castle is a action platformer for the GameBoy. It is inspired by "Castlevania" or "Fortress Of Fear". There are four levels to fight through and also four different weapons. All have their own pros and cons. At the end of each level there is a boss fight. You can download the game here:

	"Levels aren't too complex in themselves. The hardest part is just getting through every level and having full health for the boss fight. The game refills health after winning a boss fight, which takes some time, so full health is desirable to avoid this refill.

	"There are also some weird quirks with this game that have to be kept in mind. Occasionally, the player will lag after landing from a jump/falling down. I'm not exactly sure what causes this weird lag, and efforts to figure it out were futile. I've reduced it as much as I could without this knowledge however, and overall the result came out fairly acceptable. Another quirk I've noted is horizontal moving platforms going rightwards seem to move the player slightly faster than typical speed. This is abused in all applicable locations.

	"For some other notes, the mace(?) seems to be the strongest weapon in this game, so once it is obtained it is kept throughout the game. Using any weapon seems to have a cooldown for 3 frames before it can be used again. And 3 weapons on screen at once seems to be a cap placed on the game.

	": Even with 75% (9/0/3) support in the poll and most posts pro this movie, I'm not personally convinced that this run is entertaining enough for Moons. But since it's a vaultable category, there will be no harm in getting some definitive amount of ratings and adjusting the tier if we have to.
