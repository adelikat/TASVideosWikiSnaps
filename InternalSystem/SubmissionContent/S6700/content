	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Previously, it was thought that the fastest way to get all the weapons was to play through every single stage and defeat all the bosses. The humble PASS WORD screen never crossed our minds as we toyed with zips, delay scrolls, framerules, lag reduction, Item 1 timers, quantum shots, double death, straggling throw animations, weapon hitbox persistence, flicker-elongated animation timers... But recently, a hacker (who preferred to remain anonymous) discovered that this screen was actually intended as a means of entering stored save data into the game and continuing from where you left off. With a bit of assembly knowledge and much trial and error, we were able to isolate a specific pattern you can punch in that immediately gives you all 11 weapons and takes you straight to Wily 1. You can think of this movie as a bit of a tech demo to show off this new trick, which has major implications in any%, zipless, and even the

[div class=p 
	"Now, on to the actual run. When it comes to wasting weapon energy, you pretty much mash them at 30 Hz or run the timers down. In order to get a perfect rate of fire, you must be at the edge of the screen so the projectiles will despawn immediately. Leaf Shield, Crash Bomb, and Item 2 have interesting caveats, which are detailed below, in addition to some other things.

	"Well, most weapons in the game use an amount of energy that evenly divides 28: 4, 2, 1, 1/2, 1/4, or 1/8. The one exception is Leaf Shield, which uses 3. When you have less than 3 energy, you can't use Leaf Shield, and you're stuck with that sliver of shame. To rectify this, I collected a small refill, which gives me 2 bars of energy and effectively allows me to waste 30 energy with 10 shields.
