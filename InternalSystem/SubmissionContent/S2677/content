	"The key to the run was in the little-known address 0x623, also known as a timer. I had to carefully manipulate so that the delay between actions was as short as possible. Note that even after performing some action as fast as possible, I have to move the cursor to luck-manipulate.

	"For a while, I was stuck on a time of 489 frames. It was only after I reduced the delay to almost nothing that I managed to get the dumb AI to make its last move soon enough. One good second saved.
