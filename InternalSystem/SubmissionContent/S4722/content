	"Well... I improve the published run by 28 seconds. How? Well... On mission 9, you're supposed to follow the arrow to find your teammates that Herbert kidnapped, but somehow I overlooked this: you can skip all this by not following the arrow and going to the Tallest Mountain right away. So either Gary is a liar, or the devs forgot to block it by accident.
