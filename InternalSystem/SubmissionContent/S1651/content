	"About the game:
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Shadowgate is a so called "storybook game". This means that you have an interface with several commands that you can do. Basically, you first click on what you what to do, and then click on what you want to do this on. For example, you can first click on "OPEN" and then click on a door to open it.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The story of the game is that you play as "the last of the line of kings" who got a mission from a druid to defeat the evil warlock in his castle Shadowgate. The warlock will summon a behemoth, and only you can stop him!

	"About TASing this game:
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"There are essentialy 3 parts of TASing a storybook game like Shadowgate:
	$LF
]p
[h4 id=Theroute:
 
	" The route:
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"What rooms are you going to visit and what items are you going to pick up? This is the most important part of TASing a storybook game. This TAS basically uses the same route as the published run, with a few tweaks here and there. I'm positive that it's the fastest route.
	$LF
]p
[h4 id=Cursormovements:
 
	" Cursor movements:
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This is the hardest part of TASing these games. The fastest cursor route is usually not obvious. Instead you have to do some testings to find the fastest cursor route. I always used frame advance when moving the cursor around.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"You often have to plan ahead when choosing how to move the cursor around. Sometimes a certain cursor route is faster for room X, but will make you loose time in room X+1 because the cursor starts in a bad position for that room.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Another things that makes the choise for cursor movements non-trivial is that you can both open and enter doors both via the mini-map and via the main picture. The cursor moves twice as fast on the picture, but on the other hand, t greaterlly a little longer.
	$LF
]p
[h4 id=Textmessages:
 
	" Text messages:
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This is the most trivial part of TASing these games, but they can be a pain to optimize. Back when I made the first runs of these storybook games, I had to trial-and-error to optimize textboxes. I had to try my way to find the first frame I could press the B button on to make the box disappear, and so on.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This time around, I had memory addresses telling me when to press the B button. This means that I could scroll through textmessages without having to use one single rerecord! You bet that saved a whole lot of time for me when making this run. Of course, I still used savestates on textmessages if I did a mistake, but all in all, textmessages were handled without any problems at all.

		"In the last room with the wizard and behemoth, you'll see me hesitate before the lightnings come appear. This is because I found that how many lightnings appear is actually a random event! Between 3 and 6 lightnings may appear, it depends on when you press the A button. It pains me that I have to waste time in the last room to manipulate luck, but the only way for  me to avoid this would be to enter the last room sooner, and to do that I'll have to find more improvements, but I haven't found any...

	$LF
]h3
[ul 
	[li 
		"Q: So, what do torches do?
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"A: Torches are necessary for me to stay alive. Each torch has 60 charges. You use up these charges when performing actions, such as opening stuff and picking up stuff. If your torch reaches 0 charges, you will die. That's why I have to light new torches now and then. Interestingly, actions only drain charges in certain rooms - well lit rooms don't drain charges at all! There is no real use for this though, but it can be fun to know.
