	"Ok, this is nothing hot, supergrafx library is only composed of ... 7 games! :p
	$LF
	[br

	"Granzort is a small plateform game, taking advantage of supergraphx capacitys by using 2 scrolling at the same time (woooho!)
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"I have no clue whats the story is about (if any...), since theres not a single line of dialogue or whatever, i think granzort is a japanesse manga (with robots), but that all i know
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"Its far away from ghouls'n'ghosts greatness (the big hit on sgx), but its quite a good game, very hard too (never could beat it myself back when i was a kid...)
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"You have control of 3 robots that you can swap with run button, eatch robot having his own abilitys and weapons.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"Red have a sword and earthquake attack, Green have a bow and wings, Blue got a stick and a super shield.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"Theres 2 button, attack and jump, if you hold the button (jump for green, attack for others) you start the ability.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"Basicly I take green one for stages using his wings to speedup, blue one for bosses with tricky shield attack, except last boss where i need red.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"Like in mario, you die from any hit, and you can jump on ennemys heads.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"You get power up like in rtype, but its limited to 3, i dont die so i pick em up only in stage1.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"Theres another kind of power up, purple stones, basicly its like mario mushrom, you can get hit 1 time after picking it up.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"I do get hit to save time, you get a sort of boost, this is limited by number of purple stone on the way.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"There is also gold stones, those give you temporary invulnerability, you still get "tossed" by ennemys, but that doesnt kill you.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"I dont use gold stones since they are not realy on the way, also its kinda useless for speedrunning this game, purple stones sound enought.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"Theres no shop or whatever, its a very basic game, theres not much place for improvement beside frame whoring or finding some zip or whatever, tough its so simply made, i doubt theres much place for glitching.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"Theres is a input code at title screen for level selector, that way you could be in stage7 directly... i hope this will not be allowed.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"Stage6 by itself is 1/3 of movie lenght... silly level designers.

	[br

	"Ah yeah, the rerecord count vanished for some misterious reasons... i got ~1100 backups file so it should be the real ammount.

	"Ill try to improve the run when i got some free time (theres probably place for improvements), but i doubt somebody else gonna give it a try that why im submiting directly.

Several people in the thread have posted about sections of play that seem sloppy, and I particularly found the platforming areas (i.e. the sections that weren't flown over) full of bumping into walls. I think this will be a publishable game, but it will take a more refined version than this.
