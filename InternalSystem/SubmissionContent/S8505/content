	"Gnop is the first game by Bungie. It's pong spelled backwards. It was released on the Mac in 1990; this version is a faithful recreation in Flash (apparently, I haven't tried the original). You can still play it at

	"This TAS does not aim for speed. I choose all of the hardest options and don't always win the point as fast as possible. The first point is quick, the second one scores with a slow shot, the third one goes out of bounds, and the last is a long rally that ends going out of bounds again. I switch up the paddle movement between shots a bit. I think this is a good showcase of TAS ability, though I couldn't find anything very interesting to do other than get the ball out of bounds.

	"It's clear from your submission notes that this is a playaround, and as such, it required some threshold of entertainment feedback to be accepted. Fortunately, the community response has been overall positive. There's only so much that can be done with a game as simple as Pong, and yet your movie delivers well with good pacing and escalation, and it showcases some quite amusing glitches of this little game.
