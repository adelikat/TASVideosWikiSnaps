	": This run is very unoptimized, even by the standards of an unassisted run. With a quick test, I've been able to save nearly 15 seconds before gameplay even starts, and save over 20 seconds before this run even reaches the first minute mark - and that was without even using slowdown. Rejecting due to being severely suboptimal.
