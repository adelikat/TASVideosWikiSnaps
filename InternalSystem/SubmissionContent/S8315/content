		" They built a C-based reverse engineered version of the game, yielding enourmous speedups compared to a using a lua on top of bizhawk. My approach, simply compiling my bot against quickNES (C++) is a bit less sophisticated, but by no means slow. The fact that it took them a year of execution on a 6-core machine but took me a month to do this one on a 64-core machine gives an idea of the relative performances.

		" They built a decision tree based on the 8 possible angles a ball can take, I went full brute, allowing any x position for the paddle when a ball is in the 'hittable' layer. To compensate for the impossibly large exploration space, I pruned the action space to either pressing "L" or "R" -- standing still was not an option. This paid off pretty nicely, I must say.

	"The main difficulty during making this movie was the bonus score screen. After finishing some levels, you get 'punished' with extra score -- I believe this has to do with the amount of enemies you killed, but so far haven't been able to decode it (nor did I spend much time to research it either).
