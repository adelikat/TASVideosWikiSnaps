	"A while back, mklip2001 said to me that an improvement of this game wouldn’t be hard to do, since it is quite an old run and all. At that time I took a really close look into the published run but couldn’t find any mistakes. After working on Pitfall - The Mayan Adventure, I decided to give this game another try, and to my surprise, I was able to save some time right on the menu. So I thought it would be easy to find more mistakes as I played the game, well I was wrong, Mitjitsu made sure to optimize every movement pretty well, bosses being hit on the first possible frame and every known trick abused to the extreme. I was about to give up the project when I decided to take a look at Donald’s X velocity when the glitch to run up hills is active. It took a while to realize that by pressing Up+Down+C Mitjitsu was able to keep Donald’s top speed even going up hills, I was lucky to find out it is possible to use that same trick on flat surface. The other tricks that gave a boost on my motivation to work on this run is the midair jump, found on those moving platforms of Mexico, and the clip trick found on the Pyramid, but I think it’s better to explain those tricks in the next section. Well, once again I hope you enjoy the run and see you on my next project, thank you.

	"Not really a new trick, the published run and the one obsoleted by that already uses this trick, but I’m using it a lot more on my run. Press Down+C to start the belly slide, as soon as you reach the maximum speed press Up+Down+C and you can keep that speed for 19 frames. Sometimes the maximum speed will last for up to 40 frames, but I still don’t know what the requirement is.

I also changed which enemies to stun by the Plunger to save a few frames here and there. The midair jump trick avoided the need to wait for the moving platforms, so this section was also improved. The Corn, used to stop the blocks on the Pyramid, was kind of on my way, so nothing special here.

The new tricks made it impossible to collect enough corns to defeat the Tiger, but the Bubblegum proved to be a pretty good substitute. Switch to the Plunger here is not only for entertainment, like I always thought when I watched the published run; it’s the best weapon for the next stage, and it’s faster to switch to it here.

Later I decided to not use the corns on Pete, but it didn’t waste time to use the plunger here. The midair jump changed the way this stage used to be played forever. The mine cart section was also improved a little.

I was testing the pause trick found by Mitjitsu on the Viking key when I accidentally called the plane and picked up the key afterward, not using the pause trick is faster though.

Another difference between the rom revisions; the first guy, the one who looks like Pete, is a little to the left on (REV01). Nothing much new here, a few changes in the strategy here and there, but it’s pretty much the same. The boss of this stage is the only one in the entire game who needs to be manipulated; get too close and personal with him and he stays invulnerable all the time.

Donald’s hit box changes considerably if he’s facing left or right, I mean, his butt is smaller than it looks and it’s easier to clip a little into the walls if you’re facing away from them.

The Up+Down trick works here too, but the effects are different. The strategy on Pete is completely different; his invincibility time does not increase like other bosses in the game when you hit him with the Plunger.

Mitjitsu told me about a possible way to beat the last boss faster using the plunger. I tried all possible combinations of weapons, but the Plunger increases a lot his invincibility period. So I changed the strategy a little to make the boss throw his sword as far as possible. This way I’m able to finish him in just three phases instead of four.
