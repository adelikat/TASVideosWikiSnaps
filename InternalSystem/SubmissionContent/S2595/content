Mario soon catches wind of the news and decides to save her (again) and by doing needs to collect 8 keys and defeat a whole bunch of bosses. The game has randomised weather. Mario also has a plethora of new items, most of which are never actually used during the run.

	"The basic strategy was to get the magic suit as fast as possible. At the end of a level, there is a Boom Boom instead of a card, and the magic suit disposes of these bosses extremely quickly. This also meant I could complete the run relatively quickly because there was no card manipulation, and very little hammer bros. manipulation.

	"I got to chose between world 4, world 5, and world 7 for my starting world. This was because these have short hammer bros. levels, which means that it is not worth buying a music box for. Also, music boxes cost 300 coins each, which can only be gained in the levels, so I needed sufficient money to buy them, which you don't have at the beginning of the run.
