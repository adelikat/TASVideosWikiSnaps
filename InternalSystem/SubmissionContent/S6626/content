	"This TAS is based on the RTA speedrun category called 200%+, meaning that we complete the main game mode and the Time Attacks, both as Donkey Kong and Diddy, as well as beating the single player Jungle Jams, which are the minigames that this game proposes.
	$LF
	"The 3 passwords that we enter at the very beginning of the run are to unlock 3 Jungle Jams that are only unlockable via entering a code. These Jungle Jams do NOT add anything to the percentage counter, however skipping these in a maximal completion run that has to do the other Jungle Jams  wouldn’t feel as satisfying and as coherent as unlocking the Jungle Jams with a password and beating them.

	": I was waiting to see a full-completion TAS of this game, and I must say that it turned out more entertaining than what I expected. Despite its total length, the movie keeps being interesting and diverse. The main story levels are played four times, however each time they feature many differences in gameplay and optimization challenge. These differences are the physics of the character used, the amount and position of the bananas, and the health points available. All minigames are also beaten in order to achieve full-completion, which is denoted in-game with the 200% percentage.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Apart from what already mentioned, the movie also features 3 secret minigames unlockable by passwords, which is 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=allowed|href=/MovieRules#WeAllowPlayingUnlockableContentUsingInGamePasswords)
	" in this case. Beating these doesn't increment the in-game completion percentage, however they feature unique contents and thus including them gives a better sense of full-completion, without detracting anything from the rest of the movie (hence the "200%+" label). Additionally, the speedrunning community considers these secret minigames as part of 
	[a href=https://www.speedrun.com/dkkos/#200%2B rel=noopener external nofollow 
		"their
	]a
	" full-completion definition for this game, which suggests the presence of general agreement, in accordance to our 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=full-completion rules|href=/MovieRules#ClearConsensusIsRequiredOnWhatConstitutesFullCompletion)
	". For these reasons, including these 3 additional levels doesn't count as a speed/entertaining tradeoff, and the movie goal is applicable for Vault.
