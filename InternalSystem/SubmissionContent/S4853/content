]div
[div class=p 
	"By removing all of a character’s items, going to the central tower and withdrawing an item from their ‘empty’ inventory we can underflow it. You first must select a character that actually has something in their inventory then select the character with no items. By doing this it allows us to access the “items” that are below slot 16, which is the last slot of a normal inventory. What we access below that are various things corresponding to the characters in the party, including stat values, equipment, items and even their names. Exploiting this allows for us to get every item we need to beat the game. Whose stats/items you can access is determined by natural party order. For example, Rolf can access Nei, Nei can for Rudo and Rudo can access Amy. You can go to a maximum of 3 characters ahead of you in the natural party order before the inventory ends.

[div class=p 
	"This requires a group of 4 to accomplish. If up is held while hitting C in the reorder menu, the game creates a variety of glitched characters who contain some important items for the run: the Glassgear, Neislicer and Neisword. The Neisword from the glitched character acts like it was in the spaceship Noah, allowing for a warp to the final dungeon of the game. This glitch is exclusive to the Japanese version.

[div class=p 
	"We name Rudo “ケフ” to get the fire staff and Neishot from his name. After this we get our full party and get the glitched characters we want. It’s interesting to note that doing the glitch with all 4 characters actually crashes the game occasionally in Bizhawk, which never happened in Gens. Additionally, it saves time only using two slots to perform the glitch. We get the items we need from the glitched characters and get our normal party back in order to prevent the game freezing later.

	"Underflowing Rudo’s inventory is much faster than having Rolf go down to Amy’s stats in his glitched inventory, so we do that here. His boots are additionally given to Amy for later use.

[div class=p 
	"After grabbing the items from Rolf and Rudo’s names we can begin manipulating Nei and Amy’s attack stat (inventory slot 54) to get important items. By (dupe) equipping the Ceramic Claws Nei’s attack value now equals the value for the Neiarmor. Similarly, a single firestaff on Amy will give us the Neimet. After this, Amy is equipped with a Knife and Laser Knife, which gives her the Neicrown.

[div class=p 
	"The next step is to get the rest of the items from Amy’s defense stat (inventory slot 56). Some equipment setups require two fire staves. Unfortunately trying to dupe equip these essentially softlocks the game, so that’s the reason we had duped one earlier. The setups are as follows:

Watching through, it was interesting to see how an improved understanding of the item underflow glitch saved so much time (and the fact that it cut out the need to grind, entirely).  The 'broken Teim' cutscene gave some added amusement to things, as well.  Overall, impressive job here, and congrats on your first published run!
