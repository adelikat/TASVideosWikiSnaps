	"Spider-Man 2 on the DS was a launch title for the Nintendo DS in North America.  Developed by Vicarious Visions and published by Activision, this 2.5D side scroller loosely follows the plot points from the Sam Raimi films, as it sometimes deviates from the movie plot to fill in missions with other spider man villains such as Mysterio and Vulture.

	[a href=https://tasvideos.org/1638M rel=noopener external nofollow 
		"https://tasvideos.org/1638M

	" .  It is the only speedrun for this game I could find as there is no RTA runs from what I could find anywhere on the internet.  But luckily this run was enough to base my efforts on this TAS here.  The previous TAS's author, adelikat, provided many useful tips and addresses in his submission, which if the judge needs to use for this run, they can be found in the first link at the top of the submission: 
	[a href=https://tasvideos.org/2832S rel=noopener external nofollow

	"Also on the note of memory addresses, this game uses pointers for things like speed, meaning the addresses for speed will change in each room/level, so I asked RetroEdit to help make a lua script that could always display these values regardless of where the pointer points to, which was a huge help and I highly appreciate it.  Here's the link to that:

	"Anyways, back to the run.  This run improves on not only movement speed, but also in the combat.  I slowly figured out that this game has an ISG type glitch (ISG is for "Infinite Sword Glitch" from Ocarina of Time, but here it's the Infinite Spider Glitch).  If spiderman shoots a web-line (either direction) then does a web swing, he will be in a state where touching an enemy will do damage on every frame.  This ends when Spiderman touches the ground, and can't be performed in areas where you can't shoot a web-line.

	"Doing forward swings provides a value of 500 for speed, and you loose a bit of that when performing another swing, so it's best to limit the amount of swings as possible, usually I try to swing as close to the ground as possible, also holding the up button while swinging makes spiderman gain a bit extra height.

	"The web-line can actually make spiderman move at 512 speed, but it has a shorter acceleration.  These can be faster in areas where I can web-line for a long period of time, usually in rooms with a high ceiling or something, it would only safe a couple frames at a time.  Also if you web-line at the edge of a ceiling, sometimes spiderman will just go flying and not stick to the ceiling, which can be good for some areas, but can be tricky to perform.

There's also a weird issue with the web-line in levels like this where doing a diagonal one will cause the camera to pan up rapidly, only to correct itself later.

	"I take the right side first as it's faster to deal with the enemy on the left later.  You'll see me utilize an early version of the ISG before I started to understand it a bit better.  But the main benifit to it is that I can start my swings away from the enemies early while killing them in the process.  Also worth mentioning is kicking the enemies can deal different values of damage depending on the timing.  It seems that kicking them on the first possible frame doesn't deal as much damage as kicking them a few frames later.
