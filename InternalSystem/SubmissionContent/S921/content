	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"The reasons I started running this game are
	$LF
	"1) I own it and know it fairly well,
	$LF
	"2) Taz moves extremely fast, way too fast to handle for a player normally, and
	$LF
	"3) it is one of the few games that can (almost, I found out later) be played optimally using two buttons simultaneously, which is what my crappy laptop keyboard could handle when I started. I've upgraded since.

]h2
[ul 
	[li 
		" Spinning cancels upwards momentum fast, this is used for boarding low platforms.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" You can do a small hop while spinning. It's only a few pixels high, but because you're moving at such a high speed you can pass quite wide gaps without stopping for a regular jump.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" If you "rev up" the spinning for a few frames, you can start going forward at max velocity at once.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" While spinning you can change directions and stop instantly. This is the fastest way to turn even though it involves spinning a bit longer.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Bouncing on enemies gives quite a vertical boost. Useful in several places.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Under some special circumstances you can clear a ledge which you are clearly way below. Very useful in Caves 2.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" You lose a lot of speed if you spin into an enemy/object, but jumping over them is usually even slower. Only the rats are low enough that you can jump over them with one (double-) frame of jump. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" You can try to fall trough the ground (down+C) even when you are standing on solid ground. Useful for the rubber elevators.

	"Peculiarities
	$LF
]h2
[ul 
	[li 
		" Sometimes the enemies hurt you when you spin into them, sometimes not. It's related to which frame of animation they are in, I think.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" The music changes according to which area of the level you are in, how fast you are going (with the minecart), which actions you perform and what enemies are on-screen.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" I try to do something interesting with the waiting time at the end of each level, minus the ones before flame glitch levels (see below), because that trick doesn't seem to work when I do.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" One of the sound effects - the "tink" sound used in the intro music - is emulated wrong and sounds horrible. Fortunately it's not heard very often.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"This game lags. All the time. The animation updates at 30 Hz, with the exception of a few levels (first boss, minecart level). This doesn't mean that the game runs slower. It just updates the graphics and accepts input every other frame. Thus, this movie was made by fiercly doubleclicking the frame advance button.
	$LF
	"I don't know if this has some effect on the encoding, I could specify between which frames the game switches to updating 60 Hz if that's wanted.

[p 
	"Here is the reason this run was stuck in limbo for so long. This stage is hell to optimize, especially the elevators. There are sooo many ways to jump onto and off them. And it's very hard to evaluate if some way is faster than some other, in particular the second rubber elevator, which I would say is the second part I'm not confident about finding the best solution.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This stage still has some nice tricks, with a double rubber bat jump, and getting on an elevator shortly after that even though I completely miss it. I skip the last elevator and take a leap of faith in the very end.

	"The small stops in the spinning is to press up or down, otherwise you miss the platform. When jumping normally from a log you get a speed boost in the wrong direction, so I keep that to an absolute minimum.

	"Throwing the bags at him does twice the damage as jumping/spinning, but the other two bags are too far away and you can't spin while holding them, so I only use one. You have to delay one hit on the boss (but it's barely visible), if you hit him as early as possible every time he never gets a chance to turn around so you can get him closer to the bag.

	"I don't quite know what the heck going on here (because the screen is still nearly all black) but I think that spinning right at the first possible frame gets you inside the flame above Taz (you can hear the sound effect of it), and that somehow warps him quickly to the right.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I hurt the boss before he's even active (you can hear it and he's in the ouch-animation when he comes in). This means that Taz is stuck in limbo state afterwards until he's hit, so I park right under the boss to make sure that I get hit as soon as possible.

[p 
	"Taking damage directly allows you to hit the boss the first time she's in, which is impossible otherwise. After that the temporary invincibility is used to endure the claw attack, which is slightly faster than the wings. I use the same trick again later when she goes up to 6 attacks per round.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If you wonder why I don't get hit by the wings/claws sometimes, it's because the boss is still temporarily invincible from the last hit, and she can't hit you during that time. You can see the wings/claws flashing.
