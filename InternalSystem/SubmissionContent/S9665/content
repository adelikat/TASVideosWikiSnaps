	"Happy Easter TASVideos! Fist of the Neverwake is a 90's styled 2.5D platformer made for the Platformer Challenge jam. In a world put to sleep by creatures unknown, Ase The Caffeine Addicted Jerboa must reawaken it by traveling to the sacred bell tower in the center of the city. Assisting them in this process are their trusty magnetic gloves, which will boost her forward whenever they land a punch.

	"The fastest way to move is to spam the Magnet Punch. You can't normally spam it that fast, but jumping cancels the Punch and lets you throw another right after, if you're on the ground. I believe the fastest way of doing this is to press S, and wait at least 7 frames before cancelling and throwing another punch. Depending on the terrain I can't spam the punches as fast. On steep downward slopes, jumping takes Ase off the ground. On steep upward slopes, throwing the punch makes Ase bounce off the ground. For downward slopes, I'll instead spam it without jumping, which is slightly slower. I also have to do this on falling platforms, as jumping makes them fall and remove the floor faster. The punch is also used for turning around quickly. When you press to face in the opposite direction, you have to decelerate enough before you can turn around. But the punch makes you turn around instantly.
