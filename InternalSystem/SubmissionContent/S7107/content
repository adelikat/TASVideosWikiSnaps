	"This is the Any% TAS of DKC2 Unveiled, a romhack of the 1995 game Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest. It aims to beat the game as quickly as possible. As such, any and all parts of the game that aren't necessary to achieve the objective, such as bonuses and DK coins, are ignored.

	"As the description says, DKC2 Unveiled is a romhack of DKC2 made by emptysys which completely changes every level in the game with the general exception of one aspect, most commonly the tileset or theme, but the game's engine and physics is unchanged, so expertise on such from vanilla DKC2 can and was applied here. This romhack is widely considered to be the best romhack of any DKC game, and is the only one with submitted runs on speedrun.com. This, along with the facts that it was so recently released and that I've been a big fan of both watching and making TASes was my motivation for creating this TAS.

	"I started working on this TAS in July 2020 and finished in April 2021, but the rate of progress was extremely varied. In fact, the latter two-thirds of the movie was done in the last month and a half of the development of the TAS.
