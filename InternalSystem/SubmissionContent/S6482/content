	"Time was saved by jumping before going down ledges, also better boss optimization.  One thing I do here on the boss was of course get close, but not so close you bounce off of his head or die which helps damage.  Then at the very end if you glide towards him a couple frames then move away you can kill him slightly faster.  Almost every boss has that tech.

	"The boss had better movement and positioning.  This boss has several oddities.  First is that for the first couple frames you can actually be inside the boss, but for this boss it is not effective, since we want the shots to spread out and hit multiple heads.  At the end of the stage I found that there is about a 4-5 pixel range near the center of the stage that allows you to avoid the bosses colliding in the middle. Normally you die but I jump and jitter around inside that and make sure I land right near where the door opens.
