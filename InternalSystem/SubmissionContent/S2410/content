	"Hard to believe but this game was once one of the best psx fighting games around. A few things the game is notable for is having the two bosses of the game be females and completely non slutty ( not that this game is lacking in the slutty department ), and having a character that fights with guns that are just a good vs sword-fighters as you might guess.

	"So I just watched the golden ax tas and the level with all the falling monsters inspired me to try a pacifist run of this game.

	"So Uranus is the obvious choice because of her flying ability. It also keeps you from having to fight her later. The code I use to select her is R1, L2, X, L1, R2, Circle when the menu is flying in. I've never been able to do the code by hand which is a pain because you can't save your game.

	"Most of the characters here have the same strategy. Mondo and master are much harder because most of there moves are slow long range moves and they are happy to stand still and spam them all day.
