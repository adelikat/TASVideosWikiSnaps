	""The Legend of Zelda and the Lampshade of No Real Significance" is a Newgrounds flash game created by "Super Flash Bros". This looks like a basic Zelda game as a shitpost and a lot of references are included. I saw this game while watching a "Shortest Speedruns compilation" video and I thought that I would be cool if this game was on this site.
