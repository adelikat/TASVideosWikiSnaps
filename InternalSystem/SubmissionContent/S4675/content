	"About the Run
	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"First things first, I want to give Credit to ElectroSpectre. Without his foundation I never would have succeeded at creating this movie. ES did an incredible job optimizing boss fights and stage segments alike. Also, The RTA player Broedgeman for discovering the "mercury cancel" and pointing out several improvements over my original submission.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This run has been some 4 years in the making. While playing  on console circa 2011,I discovered the "statue bump" - frame perfect trick - in stage II (saves ~80 frames) and set out to break the TAS record! At the time I produced a ~1,500 frame improvement to the currently published run although, due  to extenuating circumstance, I never got around to submitting the run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Fast Forward . . to ~january 2015: 
	$LF
	"I'm casually watching Speed Runs/TAS movies and I stumble upon an RTA World Record of Demon's Crest by BroedgeMan and he's  doing some cool tricks to save time. I'm immediately inspired and decide to get back to the grind. I head over to TAS vids and, to my dismay,  SNES 9x 1.43 is deprecated and all the work I'd already done was basically worthless. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Around this time the new MMX 100% run was published and seeing it was completed on BizHawk I decide to check out the new emulator. My computer is seemingly unable to operate BizHawk above ~20 fps. At this time I get on IRC and Chat with Adelikat and a few others about my options. MasterJun scolds me into shape and I resolve to start from scratch using Bizhawk.

[h3 
	"Differences
	$LF
]h3
[ul 
	[li 
		"Route change: The bulk of improvements between this and the currently published run can be credited to route change, which accounts for over 1,000 frames. simply put, I play the stages in their intended order (I, II, III, IV...) while ES plays (I, II, IV, III...). In stage III I acquire the Platform maker which allows for significant improvements in stage IV and VI.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Boss Battles: I was  able  to improve boss battles in stage II, III, IV, IVb, VIb, IIb, IIIb, and Phalanx 2, by either hitting the boss in screen transition (flier 1 & 2), dealing more damage with either better manipulation (arma II) better attack placement (Ovnunu, hippogriff 2), stacking damage (flamelord), or using a more powerful Crest type (Arma 3, Phalanx 2)
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Movement optimizations: headbutting, clinging to walls, starting or stopping flying, shooting on the ground, and initiating a dash all cause firebrand to stop moving for 1 or more frames so I minimize the amount of times I do any of these outside of boss fights. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Emulation: BizHawk is Much more accurate (laggy) emulation than Snes 9x. I estimate that this would have been over a 6,000 frame improvement on the SNES 9x.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Between This and my initial submission, The majority of improvements come from Boss fights in stages III, IV, and the final Boss. As well  as minor movement optimizations in several stages. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"New tricks: There are several tricks that were not  discovered at the time ES produced his run, which will be  detailed below. 
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[h3 
	"Minor Glitches: 
	$LF
]h3
[ul 
	[li 
		"Holding L/R glitches the placement of Firebrands attack. Right Direction takes priority but the fireball comes out of the back of his head. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Boss Invincibility: Some bosses (hippogriff, flame lord..) Calculate damage, then check invincibility and restore the damage if the timer is running. Thus, they can be defeated 1 hit early by stacking damage. (Hand Talisman)
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Hitting Bosses Early: In some stages, When the screen transition to a boss fight completes, you have control of firebrand for 1 frame. This is used to hit some bosses early. There  are some fights where this is possible but the bosses are either invulnerable or off screen and others where this is not possible at all.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		""Mercury Cancel": Mercury and Sulfur are the two potions I buy on the return trip to stage II. Normally, when defeating a boss and collecting their  reward, you go through some text and are transported to the world map. Using the Mercury potion, I am able to collect the item and have a 2 frame window to execute the "Mercury Cancel", skipping any text and the world map transition via the effect of the potion: transporting firebrand backward one screen. This is used vs. Belth in stage IIb and vs. Crawler in stage V. The Sulfur  Potion does  not require any timing, it simply transports  me  to the world map, allowing me to avoid long and pointless hikes to the end  of stages Ib and IIb.

[ul 
	[li 
		"Zombie Dragon: The Dragon is set on a timer so I tried to narrate the fight as a sort of struggle for the recently wounded Firebrand. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Graveyard: Pretty straight forward. I have to waste a few frames to manipulate the boss. Grab Useless Paper #1 and head to mini-boss.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Hippogriff 1: Courtesy of ES. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Mountain area: Every time you start or stop flying your character is frozen for 1  frame. With this in mind, I try to minimize the amount of times I do either through-out the run. I get Urn #1 because I'll need it for the return trip for the life vessel in the next segment

	$LF
]h3
[ul 
	[li 
		"Town: pretty straight forward. Just cutting through to get to the next section.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"drowned abbey: Dash through, control lag from ghosts/mermen. I go for a swim to grab the hand talisman which allows you to shoot extra spells. I manipulated a health to get through the caverns faster. "statue bump" saves 40 frames and makes the dashing through this section slightly less awkward. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Cavern 1: Pretty straight forward. The fire monsters cause a lot of lag dead or alive. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Cavern 2: You can disable BG layer 2 to see in the dark. Making sure enemies I kill and statues I break don't drop items because that  causes extra lag.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Eye Ball Soup: This is the one fight that can still potentially (theoretically be improved). There is a frame rule involving how the mini-eyes are released. The game checks ever ~130 frames to see if all eye balls are  dead. If they can be manipulated to come out faster it may be possible to engage the big eye in 3 "pulse cycles" instead of 4. Unfortunately, I could not crack the code and decided to move forward like this. However, I am able to take  down The big eye himself in 6 hits vs. the currently published 7 so not all was lost.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[h3 
	"Stage III: 
	$LF
]h3
[ul 
	[li 
		"This is a route change from ES's run and is responsible for ~1,500 frames saved
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Forest: Laggy enemies abound, a few  movement optimizations here let me Grab Urn #2 and get out just a little faster.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"River: More Laggy enemies. The floating platforms dance back and forth out of range so I kill some time to allow the ones off screen to move into place.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Forest Fire: Flame Lord pops in to set the forest on fire. I get through while minimizing lag from giant fireballs and tentacle monsters. Pick up useless Relic #1. Then Die to flame lord to pick up a health vessel that was hidden under the forest fire - saving  a return  trip.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Flame Lord: I took a new tact to try and Kill Flame Lord Low to the ground, and with much success. This boss fight is an improvement over my originial submission due to better manipulation + stacking damage to kill sooner.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[h3 
	"Stage IV:
	$LF
]h3
[ul 
	[li 
		"Pillars and Snakes: Cut down a lot of  waiting  and unoptimized  movement by making  my own platforms. Pick up a Urn #3 and head onward.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Floating zombie knights: Increased horizontal movement is blessing and a curse. I try to minimize the number of times I start/stop flying and utilize increased movement speed by staying airborne.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Hippogriff 2: Initially, I used ES's hippo 2 fight because I was under the assumption ground gargoyle's air shots had  too small a hitbox to connect when hippo is max height. I was wrong and thus defeat this boss 2 hits faster than ES.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Jungle Tower: The platform allows me to make another huge improvement. Optimizing the tornado jumps is pretty awkward at first, because you have to wait for the tornado to become a platform and then land on them. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"outer wall: I have to drop to get useless relic  #2 and Tornado Jump to the top right to grab Useless Paper #2. This segment is a little more laggy and also vertical movement is altered in this room making falling speed lower and increasing my jump height significantly.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Jungle Tower 2: Platform maker again saves a lot of time  here. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Arma 2: Arma 2 has 32 HP. 24 damage is dealt in ground shots (2 damage) while the remaining 8 is dealt with air shots (1 damage). This fight can also theoretically be improved if Arma can be manipulated to stay on  the ground. For that reason, some hits are not timed perfectly with his vulnerability. Another Instance where I assumed the fight was optimized. Dashing into ground shot for the first hit allows me to defeat this boss 1 hit faster. I also feel this is one of the more entertaining fights and I had a lot of fun producing it.

		"Scula: Scula is a 2 piece boss. The roly poly part requires 2 hits from the Crest of Time while the main body requires 5. In ES run he kills the head first, which freezes the game till it dies.

	[li 
		"Under the sea 1: Use the standing  animation trick to dash and switch to tidal gargoyle before  I take  damage. Moving around in this section is awkward so I use the spikes/enemies to propel my character in the right direction. The latter half of this section and the next section were definitely the laggiest/most awkward section to TAS.
