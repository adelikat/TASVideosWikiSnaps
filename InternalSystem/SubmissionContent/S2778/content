	"So, like, we were all chatting in IRC, and Nach totally had this awesome idea, which saved like, 69 frames minus ten frames. So a guy walks into a bar, looking really moody and orders immediately a double-whiskey. Then he starts rambling on about how lousy a wife he's got, until the bartender finally says: "You know, I don't understand what you're complaining about.
