	]b
	$LF
	"This is by far the highlight of the run. By attacking for one frame and then doing a jump while holding up, you are able to do another jump in the air. This helps skip large chunks of the game, especially the air stages. This glitch also works with the grapple since its the only other weapon in the game that allows you to perform a double jump.

	$LF
	"Sometimes when you do a slide, your speed decreases slowly over time. By doing a lttle adjustments, I was able to get constant speed in a lot more places in the run. This can be seen in the first Earth Stage.

	"This was quite relaxing to do. At first it seemed like it would be a drag to do since this game is 30 FPS. But once I tried it out for a bit, It got suprisingly enjoyable. It was also nice to take a short break from making the new Sonic 2 run since there arent so many things I have to worry about.
