	". It was originally made for PC in 2006, with a demake for the NES releasing in 2022 along with his other horror games. You play as Candyman, who visits 5 locations and 5 bonus levels killing everyone in sight.

Then we stab him and turn around at the earliest frames possible. After killing every victim in a level (apart from Level 5: I'll get to that later), we have to collect a mirror. After we collect said mirror, we can enter a portal, thus ending the level.

Anyways, after that, we walk past all the urinals and sinks to find our 3rd victim, who we attack with a swarm of bees. After this, we go back past the sinks, collect the mirror and turn around again. Then we go to the very back of the restroom to a mysterious door. Here we find 2 more victims to stab. With a hint of RNG manipulation, we can stab these guys as fast as possible. Then we go back through the door and walk past the graffiti to find 2 more victims. After walking past the urinals one more time, we head into the portal, which is near the toilets.

After stabbing those 2 victims (and waiting for the 2nd victim's death animation to finish), we head left, where we find our 3rd victim, who somehow falls through a wall after being stabbed. After heading down, we find another victim, who's cheekily ordering Domino's on the phone. We abruptly end his order and then we head right. After chasing our next victim, he gets a pistol out and shoots. But since his aim is quite bluntly a load of crap, we can easily avoid the bullet and stab him. Then we head back past the lockers and up the corridor to the broken bit of wall from earlier. However, it turns out to be... A SECRET HIDING PLACE! Here we find one more victim. Strangely, this is the only room that looks 2D rather than 3D. After leaving the aforementioned hiding place, we find 3 more victims who have foolishly gone near it. With a bit more RNG manipulation, we stab this trio as fast as possible and then head back down through the corridor. After walking past the lockers yet again, we collect the mirror and turn around. On our way back, we find another victim who tries to run but isn't fast enough. Then we head back up the corridor, kill one last victim that's standing next to a locker, and enter the portal.

Here we find 2 more victims, one of them being one of the 2 victims who "escaped". We stab those guys and head down, where our 4th victim is lurking. We decapitate him and move on. On the next screen, we find 3 more victims, including the other "escapologist". After sprinkling a bit of magic RNG dust, we can stab them all without any major slowdowns. On the screen after that, there's another victim, who - after being stabbed - faceplants into a wall, guaranteeing him dead. After heading up through a corridor, we find 2 more victims to stab, which gives us a total of 10 victims for this level so far. Then we head back through the corridor and sneak through a crevice, where we find victim number 11. You should know the drill by now, we stab him and move on. A bit further in the crevice, we have to predict a painting which is a source of our power by stabbing victim number 12 before he steals it. Then we head back to the crevice's entrance, go up through the left most corridor, and enter the mouth of the Candyman statue. Here we find the final victim of the game, Candyman's ex-wife Helen. Then we chase Helen until we catch her before she catches Baby Anthony.
