	"This is my atempt at an improvement over Adebis old run of Lost Levels, it is 434 frames faster. I choose the +Super Mario World rom because the last author used it and it was a few frames faster in the intro. I found improvements in many levels but due to a frame rule not all of them where allowed to be kept in the end. Therefore I will only write about the levels where the improvements where kept at the end of the level. Worth to mention is that ending a level 1 timeunit sooner will not always gain you time (I think), and likewise ending it on the same timeunit might gain you time. Also sometimes (I think when you are close to a timeunit decrease) ending the level by jumping further up the flag can gain you time.

When going to the top level for the "bing you choose the right path sound" I jumped up at the first opportunity instead of the second. At the decending platforms I jumed onto it instead of over it, if crouching on the last possible frame the game acts as if you are in crouched position but it looks like you are standing up, this allows me to seemingly pass through the wall. Did a crouchjump at the last firepillar. (42 frames saved)
