]h2
[p 
	"In -50 before J.-C., Asterix and Obelix, famous Uderzo's and Goscinny's characters, missed their dog Dogmatix. They will search him in six worlds : Armorica, Lutecia(Paris), Massalia(Marseilles), Alexandria, Memphis and Roma. Each world has 3 levels, a boss, a tavern and a mini-game. To finish a world, you have to collect keys in levels and beat the boss of the world without dying. At the tavern, you can exchange for money to restore your life or buying a password. The mini-game is unlocked when you collect all letters of your name's character in levels of the world.
