	"Well I for one never though that Galaga could be a game people could speedrun, but apparently it is and is a very fun one at that. I loved TASing this game and learning what things can be achieved when you do frame perfect inputs. The current world record for this category is 1:06.310 by theruseman. The time I got in TAS was 43.75

	"In Galaga you have to shoot the enemies on the top of the screen. When they're all dead you move onto the next stage, and so on.... Every few levels there is a Challenge Stage that if done perfectly (killed all 40 of the enemies) it will give you a 10k point bonus.

	"Making the movie was really entertaining. It shows how much potential is still left in this game. Making the movie (in my opinion) was really fun and easy. Sure it took a while to program inputs, but I had a good time doing it. Everyone in the small community of runners is very happy with the result, so I think others would be satisfied with the result as well.
