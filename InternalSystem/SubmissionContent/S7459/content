	"I did Sparkman first because he gives you Spark Bullet, which you can charge and use to move faster, this save a ton of time on Chillman Stage and it's his weakness and you obtain the definitive speedrun warpon, Chill Slip, a very fast slide and gives you a moment of vulnerability and is very useful to pass through enemies and spikes. I didn't do Chillman first because Sparkman Stage is mostly an autoscroller and i will not save that much time with the fast slide compared to what i can save on Chillman Stage with the Spark Bullet. The rest of the order is by robots weakness.
