	"Long ago I had the idea of TASing ALttP as my first TAS. But after I looked at Flagitious’ run several times, I realized that it would be pretty much impossible for me to do it, because I had no experience and I would never be able to handle the manipulation and movement so I gave up the idea.

	"This is used a lot when going through narrow passages such as doorways and stairs that will take you between different ground levels, not floors. This won't work with all doorways and stairs however; some stairs make you go out of bounds and some doors are Link walking through automatically.
