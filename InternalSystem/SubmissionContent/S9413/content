	"Mother 3 is the final installment in the highly acclaimed and beloved Mother trilogy of RPGs, and is considered by many to be the best of the series. The game was released in April of 2006 for the Game Boy Advance, only in Japan. It delves into many social and political topics, unusual for a Nintendo series, and has attained a cult following ever since. The game has been fan-translated so that it can be enjoyed in English and is considered a masterclass in fan-translation. The music of the game is also highly acclaimed, with some believing it is the best soundtrack for the GBA, and one of the best video game soundtracks ever.

	"As this game was only ever officially released in Japan, only the Japanese version can be used to make a TAS that would be accepted. While the fan translation is very good, and considered to be a gold standard of fan translations, the original official version must be used. This also allows Japanese viewers to enjoy the TAS in their language. The Japanese version saves a significant amount of time over the fan translation due to faster text speed, potentially adding up to over 30 minutes total. Any item names, characters, and other such things will be referred to as they are in the fan translation.

	"The game begins with the warning screen us naming the main family, and you may be wondering why we are going crazy naming the characters. We do this since there’s a delay between naming the characters, so that the scene in the top left corner can play out. You can name the character while it plays out but it will eventually stop until you proceed. We can use this to our advantage to spend some extra time on the naming screens without losing any actual game time.

[h4 id=Movement 
	"Movement
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"This game has pretty simple movement mechanics. You have the ability to walk and run in 8 directions. You can run by holding B for a certain amount of frames (varies based on # of people in the party) and letting go. You may press B again or bump into collision to stop. Otherwise, walking occurs by holding the intended direction down on the D-pad until you let go. When you run however, you do not need to hold down the direction, you will continue to run until you stop or change direction. Additionally, moving in a zig-zag pattern is exactly the same speed as moving in a straight line, something we often make use of.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Encounters occur when enemies touch your hitbox, but when you’re in a party with other members, you run together in a line, and any enemy can hit any character and it will trigger a fight. You can get creative with movements in order to avoid unnecessary encounters, although some encounters are not possible to avoid. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"An interesting but unintended mechanic is the ability to hold L+R and U+D at the same time, which allows you to run in place and not move. This can be used to avoid encounters and is used a tiny bit in the latter half of the game. As pressing LR/UD is not possible on a real unmodified controller or console, this mechanic can only be used in tool-assisted movies.

[div class=p 
	"RNG Manipulation / Select Cancels
	$LF
	"Because of Mother 3’s usage of dynamic memory, RAM Watch can’t really be used to any benefit. Combat RNG isn’t determined by frames, but rather rolled when you select the enemy or action. You can select the target and then wait for however long and the RNG won’t change. We manipulate RNG in this game through repeated selection and cancellation of a certain action or enemy, which allows the RNG to change. This can be repeated until you get the desired RNG, a tactic we refer to as ‘select cancelling’.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Another aspect of combat RNG is that select cancels don’t change based on the character made to perform them. You can have one character do 14 select cancels, or make 2 characters do 7 each, or 4 players do 5, 3, 2, 4 for example, all leading to the same result.
	$LF

	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"Another thing to introduce is the rolling HP mechanic, returning from Earthbound/Mother 2. When you take damage, your health rolls down. The quirk of this is that if you take a lethal hit, you don’t actually die until your health rolls to 0, and if you can heal in time, you will survive. Another quirk is that if you win the battle before losing all damage inflicted, it won’t be dealt to you. The last quirk is that defending will slow the rolling, buying time at the cost of an action. This will come in handy at times in the TAS.

It is important that we get Flint’s offense powered up a bit first to deal the maximum damage possible per hit. Since Flint’s Power Smash misses fairly often in regular gameplay, it can be a gamble, but because we have RNG manipulation, it hits every single time. Luckily we get rid of the Reconstructed Caribou before being dealt any fatal damage, making this a pretty smooth fight.

[div class=p 
	"The first player turn uses the Drago-Fang making the Mecha-Drago vulnerable to standard attacks, as well as using some manipulation to force the Drago’s attack to miss. Luckily Alec can be somewhat helpful throughout this fight as well. He does deal a single point of damage every now and then which isn’t too helpful, but he primarily heals us. The next turn goes to powering up Flint’s offense so that his Power Smash will deal higher damage. Luckily Alec heals us throughout the ordeal. A normal hit was thrown in prior to the final Power Smash attack to manipulate the Mecha-Drago to do less damage so that we would have enough HP for the final blow. A normal hit is good here as the Mecha-Drago’s HP would be low enough for one final Power Smash attack, saving the time required to manipulate Power Smash to hit. You need 31HP to survive Mecha-Drago's final blow, and we have 33HP. With our RNG, the Power Smash could actually be manipulated with less select-cancels, but one of 226 damage was needed to deal the perfect amount of damage, ending the fight and concluding Chapter 1.

Duster actually starts off with a Smoke Bomb to lower Genetor’s accuracy, then follows with Tickle Stick to lower defense. Boney starts off with a Saltwater Gun to deal some extra damage, and is used for extra items/heals throughout the rest of the fight.

Honey Showers usually send a swarm of bees and do minor damage, but there is a 10% chance that a bear can spawn and deal 800 or so damage. This strategy is the reason we went to Saturn Valley first, as this is the only location in the game which sells Honey Showers. Using intense RNG manipulation, this is how bosses will be taken out very quickly using this strategy, saving tons of time. This is also why the Black Beanlings were skipped entirely, as the damage from a successful bear spawn isn’t impacted by the player’s stats at all. Due to the low overall hit rate, reserve Honey Showers were needed to be most efficient, as forcing 3 or 4 bear spawns in a single round of combat would be nearly impossible to do in a time-efficient manner, since it would be incredibly unlikely that the game’s RNG would favor multiple back-to-back <0.1% rounds in reasonable time. This is why many Honey Showers are used that only provide the damage from swarms of bees. Still, you can deal around 1600 damage PER TURN with 2 honey showers working, with the additional ~100 damage from extra swarms of bees. In only 2 turns, Fassad is toast.

	"Ezra speaking directly here, when looking back on the early game, primarily in Chapter 1, it is clear that some of the movement primarily in the realm of reducing movement in cutscenes could be optimized further. The optimizations would be small optimizations however, and they are optimized to the best I could do at the job with the skill and knowledge I had. As the game progressed, it was a learning experience and the movement in the late game is incredibly optimized in my opinion, and I think rather difficult to beat.

	"Around Chapter 2, we figured out that the L button and A button have the same function in the battle navigation menu. All battles are in 30fps, meaning that every other frame is a “lag frame” essentially. You cannot press A in between a lag frame, as that is interpreted as holding A for 2 frames in 30fps. What you can do is press A and L in between a lag frame, and that’s like pressing A twice, which would save a frame in 30fps anytime you do this. This was not realized in Chapter 1, and would save a few frames, but ultimately less than a second.

One mistake is that we picked up a Magic Tart in Chapter 4, but it never got used. This was intended for restoring PP for use with the Genetor, but ended up not being needed. Another mistake was going to the Pigmask to buy things in New Pork City in Chapter 8. If we had purchased the items prior to going underground and fighting Fassad, we could actually have taken a faster way to get there, coming from the left. After the fight, that area gets blocked off by some people, which lost a few seconds.

	"New strategies or improving on existing strategies is the most common way to improve a TAS, but that would be something for the future as we’d need to come up with ways to achieve that to do so. Better RNG is another way. The thing is that you will get a different result depending on the frame you enter the battle in, and pause cancels could be drastically different. Theoretically, if we came 1 frame later, we could have saved many pause cancels, or used way more to get the results we wanted. The only time where frame manipulation was used in fights was to run away from enemies that could not be dodged. There is a delicate balance when TASing RPG fights. You could theoretically manipulate 4 bears to spawn in Honey Showers per turn, getting roughly 3200 damage per turn, but the time it would take to manipulate that using pause cancels would be far from optimal in terms of real time. The approach we used is to just encounter an enemy on the fastest frame we can, and just roll with it. There is a balance between getting super-duper-duper ridiculous optimization and preserving your time and sanity. For approaching battles, we optimized strategies and turns, and planned them out ahead of time. We will leave the hyper-optimization stuff to the TASing bots.

This raises the stats and health of the enemies in the game, making them more difficult. This will change the approach to battle and could result in a pretty interesting TAS, which English speaking viewers could potentially enjoy more. Because this is not an official feature of the Japanese version, it cannot qualify for TASVideos, but one can be created despite that.

	"I have been aware of tool-assisted speedruns before I was even a teenager. I was in the community somewhat but I never made a TAS of my own, which is something I wanted to do. I wouldn’t call it a dream to get a published TAS, far from it, but I would consider it a great accomplishment to get a movie published to TASVideos. And now here it is, my first full-length TAS being submitted here to TASVideos. I started getting interested in Mother 3 around 2021, and began to attempt TASing the game. I came up with some incomplete WIPs that never got too far, not past Chapter 1. Eventually, on January 17th, 2023, I began the groundwork for a new TAS that will come to fruition. I did Chapter 1, and brought RadixSmash along for Chapter 2. I was already using the routes he had made, and in my hiatus before the new TAS began, the Honey Shower strategy was theorized. I would sometimes have large gaps in between TASing the game, sometimes for months, but I was determined to finish it.

	"A 5 hour TAS is no joke, that's a far longer movie than what most people on this site will ever do, and do that as my first TAS and get it done, I’m very proud of myself for accomplishing that. We had plans to eventually get it revealed on Really Really Long A Thon, a speedrunning marathon dedicated to long runs, and the main organizer loves the game and wanted to offer us a primetime slot on the stream. I was very excited to see that play out, but I was especially excited for the Honey Showers strategy. When Radix sent me movie files of the first Fassad fight, when I played back his work, I was absolutely floored. I knew this was gonna be good. Over Christmas and New Years, we got a lot of Chapter 7 done, and on March 9th, 2024, I placed the final inputs to complete the TAS.

	"Hey everyone, thanks for taking the time to read through this. This is the first TAS I’ve contributed to that’s been submitted to TASVideos, and the first full run I’ve contributed significantly to. I’ve made attempts in the past to create a full TAS of this game that never ended up being completed, but Ezra eventually brought me into this project in March of 2023. From there on, I TASed the majority of the combat throughout the rest of the game, starting with the Chapter 2 Clayman fight. The games’ route was mostly unchanged for chapters 1-3, though the Honey Shower strategy had been theorized prior to the start of the TAS. I eventually took the time to write out the full route for the later chapters, and with some double-checking, we continued with the TAS production.

Many thanks to Xel and ReallyReallyLongAThon for allowing us to showcase our TAS at the event, to the Mother 3 RTA community for their help in crafting this route/TAS, and to Ezra for bringing me into this project.

Any situations, where large cuts are made, escape me on techniques differences between the TAS and WR. Needless to say, ~50 minutes over human capabilities is an impressive feat...especially where lots of spots are slow moving. Congratulations...I do believe the "Mother" community is impressed and appreciates your efforts.
