		"I Wanna Flip The Sky
	]em
	" is a homebrew NES platformer game, along the lines of I Wanna Be The Guy and Battle Kid, developed by Tom Livak in August 2012 for the NEO Flash contest. There are 12 one-screen levels where players must avoid spikes, walk on conveyor belts, and walljump on specifically marked walls to make it to the exit door; players are given the ability to flip a number of times in each level.
