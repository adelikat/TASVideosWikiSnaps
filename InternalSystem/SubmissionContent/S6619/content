	"The fourth instalment of the Tomb Raider series, released in 1999. The story begins with Lara Croft's teenaged tomb-raiding origins, accompanied by her former mentor Werner Von Croy. They travel to a Khmer temple in Angkor Wat, Cambodia in the hope of finding the mystical "Iris". However, the trip is cut short by an accident where Lara is forced to abandon her companion in order to save her own life. Back in the year 1999 in Egypt, Lara Croft uncovers an ancient tomb where the fearsome Egyptian God Seth was once imprisoned. She unwittingly unleashes him and finds herself in a deadly race against time to restore the god to his resting place before an apocalypse befalls Earth. Unfortunately, Von Croy becomes Lara's new rival as he is possessed by Seth himself and he makes things considerably more difficult. Lara travels across Egypt to collect the pieces of Horus' armour in order to defeat Seth. They are found in Pharos, Temple of Isis, Temple of Poseidon and Cleopatra's Palaces. She combines them (with the Amulet of Horus) in the Temple of Horus to finally defeat her enemy. However before Horus can be summoned, Set arrives and destroys the armour, knocking the amulet into the water. Lara quickly recovers it and exits the Temple sealing the entrance shut with the amulet. She must leave it in place to keep Set imprisoned for eternity. As she reaches the exit of the temple, injured and exhausted, she is confronted by Von Croy. Fearful that he may still be possessed she is reluctant to hold onto his hands and so falls into the darkness beneath the collapsing temple.

However, it's better to sprint roll off ledges as Lara's speed carries on to the fall. with a sprint roll that's usually 98-100, which is better than sprinting off the ledge with 82 speed.

		$LF

		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Dive bug : If Lara performs a dive to a wall and hits the point where it meets the floor, Lara arrives at the floor without taking any damage. Even if the fall hight would have normally killed her.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" QWOP : The state that happens when the game thinks Lara is falling while she's still on the ground. What makes it useful is that it ends with a quicksand bug. can be done in multiple ways. The way that was used in this TAS is doing a specific jump at a stair.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Flare Cancel : When throwing a flare during a long fall, The "Throw Flare" animation overrides Lara's stumble animation when she arrives. allowing her to move as soon as she falls. very useful. Lara still takes damage/dies from the fall though.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Free flares: A glitch in the crouching system allows to get a flare in Lara's hand without actually removing any flares from the inventory. it even works if there are no flares in the inventory at all! Used in Cambodia and saves over 2 minutes.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Keyhole Glitch : an extremely useful glitch that allows Lara to place keys and puzzle items without having them in the inventory. Basically, the game has two responses when pressing action near keyholes. either "Yes" (when Lara has the item in her inventory) or "No" (when she doesn't)- Picking up flares is signaled "Yes" for the game. Now interrupting Lara's animation when she picks up flares when she's next to a keyhole transfers the "Yes" command from the flare to the keyhole, so Lara inserts the needed puzzle/key even without having it! extremely useful and used in a lot of levels.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Flare Jump : A glitch that happens when Lara jumps at the frame the flare pickup animation starts. Only possible if the "move to pickip" animation is interrupted. when it happens, the jump physics transfer to the flare pickup animation, Launching Lara up+forwards then she starts falling down, but while performing the flare pickup animation which ignores all collision and objects until the frame is finished. useful for skipping doors and triggers.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Extended Sprint : Not all the frames of Lara's sprint animation require the sprint button to be pressed to continue sprinting. in fact only a few frames require it to be pressed(only 1-2 frames with sprint button pressed between 7-8 frames of not needing the button pressed). extremely useful and used in almost all levels. unfortunately you can't turn without the sprint button pressed.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Binoculars camera bug : When Lara is embedded inside a wall, using the binoculars then letting them go results in the camera being thrown for about 20 squares (the levels are made of "rooms" which are made of squares, each square is 1024*1024. a perfect block is 1024*1024*1024). only useful with the trigger bug.

Basically, we embed into the wall using a flare, removing Lara from the active objects list. and having no other active entities (the flare in Lara's hand doesn't count) then using the binoculars to throw the camera to the trigger we're aiming for (most of the time the level end trigger), then the trigger bug takes care of the rest!

	": So another great Tomb Raider run from Troye. This one has some great highlights like being able to push multiple objects at once and being able to trigger level exits with binoculars. Even though the game can be a bit dark at times, it usually doesn't happen where there is stuff going on. I'm not sure whether or not a color correction encode would help here either. In any case I found the movie very entertaining.
