	": One of the central ideas of a TAS is that the run should look superhuman. I know this run is superhuman, because it's a huge improvement based on the last run, but still, it doesn't look it. This is not a popular game that people are demanding, nor does the game look to be particularly well made. Sure, RachelB, you did a great job with this drivel, but hardly anyone who sees this run on its own will really notice it. I don't think anyone is going to miss this run not being on the site. Sorry, but I'm rejecting this.
