	"A pool game played in completely frictionless setup is a very different game
	$LF
	"from a normal pool game.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"In a frictionless game, it is more than possible, that a careless shot makes
	$LF
	"the game completely unwinnable. Indeed, it is easy to demonstrate such a shot
	$LF
	"that will leave the game into an infinite loop, much resembling the effect
	$LF
	"that happens in the popular gadget, "Newton's cradle". In such a loop,
	$LF
	"there is no choice but to reset the console, terminating the game.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"From a computer player's viewpoint, this means that the searching space for
	$LF
	"valid moves is drastically smaller than it is for a regular game: most shots
	$LF
	"produce either an infinite loop, or they result in the eventual demise of the
	$LF
	"cue ball. Due to the law of conservation of energy, so called "preparation shots"
	$LF
	"simply cannot be done, either. This also means that unless you "suicide" once
	$LF
	"in a while (intentionally pocket the cue ball), you get a "PERFECT" message
	$LF
	"in all boards, and that the scores skyrocket. Also, the timeout for shots
	$LF
	"should be set considerably longer than in a default-friction game, because
	$LF
	"the balls can be gliding for a long time before they eventually find a pocket.

	"In Lunar Ball, each successful shot increases the "RATE" value of the player;
	$LF
	"each unsuccessful shot resets it.
	$LF
	"The higher the "RATE" value, the more points the player is awarded for the
	$LF
	"next successful shot. Points are awarded at a rate of 10 points per frame.
	$LF

[p 
	"The RATE value maxes at 99, at which point completing a single

	$LF
	"Tallying that amount takes more than half a minute.
	$LF
	"Because nobody wants to watch 15 minutes of score tallying, it is a good
	$LF
	"idea to reset the RATE value every once in a while.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"However, because this game mode is frictionless, the only possible
	$LF
	"method that a finite shot can be unsuccessful,

	$LF
