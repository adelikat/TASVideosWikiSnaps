	" (At least as best I could come up with ....I was unable to find a copy of the manual.  I was able to contact the game's designer via email to see if he was okay with this description and/or if he could give me the actual story.  He loved my version and couldn't really remember the original story anyway as it's been 30+ years.)

	"Choosing to defy the odds, you saunter into the main floor of the building to start your quest.  It is only then you realize that not only will you have to dodge spiders and snakes as you move from floor to floor, the building's security system (for some insane, ungodly reason) requires six signal pads to be triggered before the door will open for the elevator to the next floor.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"On top of all that, on each individual floor, the signal pads begin moving around once one of them has been triggered; making your task that much more difficult.  To add even more confusion; as each signal pad is triggered, a random effect will occur on that floor.  These random effects may impact you (the rat itself), the snakes/spiders, the walls of the level itself, or possibly even release a mechanical security guard hellbent on permanently interrupting your quest.

	"The RNG of this game is affected by both the rat's movement and its spitting.  Both enemy movement as well as signal pad movement are affected by RNG, thus it's possible there are better routing options than what I've accomplished via different RNG manipulation.  While there may be room for improvement in this area, changing RNG anywhere affects all subsequent aspects of the run requiring significant re-do of all parts of the run subsequent to that RNG change.

		"Level 2 - Hitting the "R" signal pad sends the rat back to the beginning of the level.  Due to the proximity of the just-spawned security guard enemy, this can appear to be a death; it is not.
		$LF

	[li 
		"Level 3 - Unless collected last, hitting the "R" signal pad resets the level to its initial state with no signal pads triggered.

		"Level 4 - 
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				"Hitting the "T" signal pad temporarily freezes the motion of the other pads.  This is collected first to simplify collection of the rest.

		"Level 7 - Hitting the "A" signal pad causes the rest to turn invisible.  Being a TAS, I was still able to track the pad locations using an lua script and thus complete the level.

		"Level 8 - Hitting the "A" signal pad causes the rat's controls to be reversed....this is not apparent to a viewer due to TAS precision controls.
