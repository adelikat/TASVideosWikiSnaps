	"The game is pretty easy to optimise. All we have to do is type words as fast as the ZX Spectrum allows us, with a hint of luck manipulation here and there, as well as a couple of tricks:
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The first trick is that when typing letters that are 5 letters or longer, we can shorten them to just 4 letters. For example, “Porridge” becomes “Porr”. The game only needs 4 letters to identify a word.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The second trick is that when typing a direction, we can put the initial of that direction. For example, “South” becomes “S”. The one exception to this is when Super Gran’s swimming in the lake. There we have to type the full words “Down” and “Up”.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Due to this game being a text adventure where you can type really quickly, we can complete our quest in only about 2 minutes of gameplay time. Input ends on frame 20533 when we press “e” after typing “DROP SCUL”.
