Players have to use the blocks provided to clear up all the blocks to clear a level. The highlight of the video is how to use the least time to dedonate all the blocks.

	": Hi, fcxiaopengyou.  Good work on completing this 100-level project!  In particular, the ones where multiple pieces had to be deployed on-screen especially stood out to me (e.g. 9, 60, 75, & 100) and differentiated from what might be seen in an RTA playthrough.  Seeing the various puzzle solutions play out was noteworthy, as well.  All in all, the tech quality demonstrated here certainly meets the standard for site publication.
