	"This game is very similar to Dora Super Spies, where you Play as Dora and travel to different locations to do stuff.  However I think this game runs on a different game engine as the camera moves much differently.  unlike Super Spies, Damage boosting isnt possible as you die in one hit.

	"Used to hit wood, bricks, and grab one star.  I get close to the wood or bricks because the animation is faster, then jump immediatly.  even though jumping over the bricks is slower if doing it up close, it's still faster to do it close.  some instances though I dont get close because I cant jump at those angles for whatever reason
