	"Recently, Alyosha made a GB core for BizHawk. I decided to test it out, and made this TAS while at it. I also managed to improve the platforming stages along with the boss fights due to finding out more about their mechanics. I chose story mode instead, since it shows more of the game. It turned out to be quite dialogue-heavy however, but it's still vaultable since this is a different game mode that also reaches the ending.

	"There is no way to change the default text speed. The most one can do is press and hold "A" to make it go slightly faster. For ease of syncing in case of some change, "A" was held only on the frames that mattered. In this case, the 16 bit address 0xD492 determines the speed. Holding "A" makes text go the fastest, and sets the value of 0xD492 to 0. Whether or not "A" is held the entire time or only for the minimum amount of time necessary does not matter time wise, and is done solely for making splicing easier.

The boss cannot be attacked when it is doing somersault, so it's short version is manipulated to occur each time instead. This means sometimes, an attack is delayed by a frame or so. This saves 40? frames or so each time. Using this knowledge, the first fight is 146 frames faster than the current TAS. The boss has 160 HP, so it takes 11 hits.

If you attack the boss in the air, he slowly falls down compared to when he lands without getting hit. He takes over 60 frames to summon falling barrels, and during this time, he's invincible. Delaying an attack and striking only when he's near the ground allows his summoning to occur earlier, thus saving 1 extra frame compared to hitting as soon as possible. In total, this happens 5 times.
