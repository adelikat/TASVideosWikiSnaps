	"This is my first submission ever. Just like 
	[em 
		"mklip2001
	]em
	", this game is also my childhood. So, I decided to make this TAS. I made this in much weeks and I know you've waited for an encode. But I'd submitted this earlier so somebody will encode this. Although this game is too 
	[tt 
		"laggy
	]tt
	" and very challenging. Challenging because there are many carrots to dodge so it can be prevented from playing a disgusting 
	[b 
		"bonus rounds
	]b
	". I played 
	[b 
		"bonus round
	]b
	" three times. However I didn't get some bonuses because it can waste time.

	"On June 2010, I did my first

		"WIP
	]a
	". However, it is only a Test WIP. Then, I made a next 
	[a class=extlink href=http://dehacked.2y.net/microstorage.php/info/1757012787/The%20Bugs%20Bunny%20Birthday%20Blowout%20World%203%20DONE.fm2 rel=nofollow 
		"WIP
	]a
	" that uses a Japan rom because of Japanese text. However, I gave up. And this year, I'd returned to redo this TAS by carrot prevention.

	$LF
]h3
[ul 
	[li 
		" 1-1 - Easiest level ever. If you asked me why I took damage on spikes so I can dodge a carrot. I found a new route which is more optimized than just climbing a ladder.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 1-2 - In second area, there are two routes. The top and the bottom. I didn't compare between these two but I believe the top route is better. If you asked me why did I jumped earlier from a moving clock enemy so I can dodge a carrot. from below.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 1-3 - I found a new shortcut in this level. This is my first shortcut.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 1-4 - No comment
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 2-1 - In Rabbit Season, I'd dodged at least one carrot and it didn't play a bonus round. Good thing I'd used an angle jump.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 2-2 - Once again, I didn't collect any carrots in this level.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 2-3 - Oh no! I'd totally got at least one carrot and played a bonus round. But check also the tornado flight. And in Rabbit Session, there are lots of block breaking just like in Level 3-4
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 2-4 - I'd saved at least one carrot in this level. Thanks for quicksand route. Oh no! I have only one heart left.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 3-1 - I didn't get a carrot even one but check out also Bugs walking above the defeated clock enemy.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 3-2 - I'd saved a few carrots in this level. Oh no! I have only one health left.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 3-3 - I can't catch the moving platform just like in my Japan WIP. Oh no again! I have only one health left.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 3-4 - Just like in level 2-3, there's also a block smashing. But unlike in level 2-3, there's a frog which i need to kill because I can't smash with a hammer when Bugs takes damage.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 4-1 - Another bonus round playing in this level. If you ask me why I've decided to go to a pipe (or what object do you think?) below is because you can't reach for a moving platform. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 4-2 - In first area, I've compered between taking damage and waiting to dodging the waterfall but I believe taking damage is faster than dodging. In 3rd area, I don't know which is the optimal input when you are riding in vertical moving platform.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 4-3 - Check out the clock enemy sliding after I've hit with a hammer. And in Rabbit Season, I can't reach the carrot from an area where I've started, so I've landed in Rabbit Season platform.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 4-4 - In reaching the vertical moving platform, I've decided to collect a carrot so I can save time.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 5-1 - Well, I have no comment in this level. But in Rabbit Season, I found a shortcut by jumping through the Rabbit Season platform.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 5-2 - There are two routes in this level, which is top and bottom. I didn't compare these two routes but I believe that the bottom route is very optimized.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 5-3 - Another bonus round playing in this level. As you see, I didn't caught a second vine. So I'd took damage in spikes. In second area, I'd decided to take in top route, because you can't dodge carrots from below.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 5-4 - In the start, I'd took to the top route because the bottom route is the dead end, so you don't know where you can take. And in boss battle, you need to kill the chick first before Foghorn Leghorn was killed. And so I can catch a big carrot early, I'd stayed in the top route.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 6-1 - This one is challenging. Those conveyor belts make me slow.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 6-2 - Well, I've wanted to smash with hammer to face spikes to the right, but I can't, because I took damage, though.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 6-3 - I tried to get a shortcut in a clock areas but the problem is some carrots. So I can't do a carrot shortcut though.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 6-4 - This is the final level. This level is very challenging, specially to the final boss.
