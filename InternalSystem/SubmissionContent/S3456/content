	"Hong Kong 97 (HK97 (香港97, Honkon97?)) is a game made in Japan in 1995 for the Super Famicom in disk drive and cartridge format by HappySoft Ltd., a homebrew game company. The game has gained a cult following in Japan and Taiwan for its notoriously poor quality — it has been ranked as a kuso-ge, literally means "shitty game", a game considered "so bad that it's good". It has since received a cult following online and given multiple parody treatments, particularly in Taiwan.

	"The game also achieved Number One "Wacky Japanese Game of All Time" in the XLEAGUE.TV video game TV show Wez and Larry's Top Tens.
