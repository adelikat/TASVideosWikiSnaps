	"This game needs some introduction to those who haven't played it: You play as the blue wizard "Shadax". Your goal is to rescue the princess from the evil wizard Morbius. You can walk up, down, left and right. You can also jump. You get killed if you touch an enemy or land on spikes.

If you press the B button when standing on a block, you will pick it up. When you press B again you will release it. This allows you to carry them with you and use them to reach places that aren't possible to reach if you don't do this.
