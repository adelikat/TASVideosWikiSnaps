	"Easy difficulty is used to be able to screen wrap, in hard mode walls which are needed for screen wrapping kill. Delayed starting the game by one frame to make the gun appear nearer to the player. Screen wrapping is achieved by pressing against a wall when moving between screens. I tested multiple routes to the boss and this one was obviously the fastest.

	"Second reminder that Easy difficulty is acceptable because it's the only way the screen wrapping glitch works. Walls kill you outright on Hard.
