	"The goal of this run is to play through all the stages without using Y. The Y button lets you run, roll and pick up barrels. There are however certain mechanics that will allow Diddy/Donkey to run without Y. Such as: Grabbing a rope and getting shot out of certain barrels. Sometimes it is faster to enter a bonus just to get the speed from being shot out of the barrel. I'm only allowed to run on the ground for a couple of frames, otherwise the effects run out, so jumping it is!
