	"The goal of this run is to play through all the stages without using Y. The Y button lets you run, roll and pick up barrels. There are however certain mechanics that will allow Diddy/Donkey to run without Y. Such as: Grabbing a rope and getting shot out of certain barrels. Sometimes it is faster to enter a bonus just to get the speed from being shot out of the barrel. I'm only allowed to run on the ground for a couple of frames, otherwise the effects run out, so jumping it is!

	"Corner boosts are applied quite a lot of in this category. You can get a boost by either walking/running down the slope or jumping at the corner. Walking/running down gives a bigger boost, though while running it usually doesn't work because the running effect will wear off, which is why jumping is more commonly used.

Normally ropes are grabbed automatically when you approach them, though some ropes can be avoided if you jump to get a corner boost, which puts Diddy in a "falling" state. It also means I can't use some corner boosts at times where I need to grab the rope to progress.

Rainbowsprinklez found that you could use a Superjump at the start of the level and fly over the entire stage. Thanks to the DK barrel being a floating barrel, Y is not needed to destroy it.
	$LF
	"To do a Superjump, one Kong first has to take damage and run into a wall that makes him jump straight up into the air, which is why I need to go right for a bit at the start. Get the Kong back, take damage, keep holding B and land on something you can bounce off of, in this case the Squawks barrel, getting him some time to shine as well. The longer you hold down B for, the higher you go and thus further.

	"It's always a terrible day when it's faster to break Donkey out from the DK barrel than to skip him. Mine carts have interesting speed mechanics. If you land back into it, the speed will usually reset to the same value. If the mine cart is moving quickly, you want to avoid landing back in it for as long as possible, which is why some enemies were killed in order to bounce further. When the cart is moving slowly, you want to jump back into it as many times as possible to increase the speed for a brief moment.
