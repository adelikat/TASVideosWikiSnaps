	"Perfection is a board game where you have to make all the pieces fit in a time limit. The pieces can be rotated with L and R. When you successfully place a piece, the cursor goes to the next available piece automatically, though that's not always optimal for traveling around the board so we occasionally grab pieces out of order that better help the flow.

	": This game changes orders on both panels depending on when you start, and routing can be quite challenging even though the game is short, because you want to minimize the travel distance for both panels, and the cursor can't wrap around. I tried one full attempt, and while I started the actual game 8 frames sooner, I finished 9 frames later. Accepting.
