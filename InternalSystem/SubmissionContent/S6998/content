	"Thunder Castle is a whimsical medieval fantasy game. You're the knight in shining armor on your quest for survival. Your journey takes you through the enchanted forest where three dragons wait with heated breath. Then, through a castle maze with six wicked wizards. Finally to a dark and dreary dungeon where the nine demons present your final challenge!

	"Disregarding content that doesn't naturally appear as you just play further, also doesn't feel like a helpful approach, because people may be interested in the challenges and aim for more completeness, and that's basically encouraged for enging-less games!

So all you're left with is staring at the level layout and listening to music. Well, and enemy screens before levels too. Since movement and action is only a minor part of this run, and even that it rather sparing, I'm accepting this run to Vault.
