	"Perhaps the biggest change to the game as a result of no dashing is we have to utilize a trick known as slope hopping.  When running up a slope, X will slow down even if you were to jump in that direction.  But if you were to run down a slope you would gain speed.  Whenever X jumps he will preserve whatever speed value was set on him previously, which even includes if he changes directions mid-air.

	"So when we go up slopes, we turn the other direction and jump so we can get the slope speed and it saves a bit of time overall that we would have lost from no dashing.
