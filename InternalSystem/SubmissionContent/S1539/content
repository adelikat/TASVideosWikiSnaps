		" Small metal ball - very maneuverable, but doesn't have the bounce and speed of the rubber ball.  It is small so it can fit in tight places.  It sinks in water as well.  Since it bounces worse than the rubber ball, it can be faster to use in places where bouncing is not preferable.

		" Crystal ball - delicate and breaks from almost anything.  It's only advantage is that it doubles the amount of points & lives you get when you pick up items with it.  That means you get 2x points from garibs and 2 lives from and extra life.  Points and extra lives are useless for this TAS.

	"Many factors make Glover an interesting game for a TAS.  It is a platformer (which are always popular) and a puzzle game (showing interesting ways to solve various situations).  Glover has many types of movements and 4 different types of balls, each with its own unique characteristics.  It also has a variety of power-ups (potions) with interesting attributes.  This means a lot of possibilities to consider when optimizing levels.

		" Cutscene skipping.  When you roll/smash a button, a cutscene is triggered.  If you pause the game and respawn from a checkpoint the frame you touch a button, the cut scene will be skipped but the button will be still activated.  This saves a good deal of time.

		" The "chicken" gltich.  One of the more bizarre glitches I've ever seen!  There is an egg throwing chicken in this game.  If timed properly you can get the chicken and glover stuck together by having the chicken jump at glover while he is holding the ball in a throwing motion.  Oddly this causes both to fly upwards into the air as long as they are stuck.  Glover can become unstuck by simply canceling his throwing motion.  This is used in 2-1 for a huge shortcut.

		" Dynamite boost.  There is a dynamite enemy that explodes when you get near him (much like the bomb-ombs in smb2u).  Normally this blows glover and the ball into pieces as one might expect.  But if timed right it will send glover and/or the ball flying through the air unharmed.  This is an extremely fast movement and also allows for shortcuts but is extremely hard to time so that you end up somewhere useful with both glover and the ball still intact.  I use this in World 5 for a nice shortcut.

	"Vidar (meepers) played a significant role in the making of this TAS by discovering shortcuts & glitches (like the chicken glitch).  Also some parts if this run were recorded by her (some of the world 1 & 3 boss fights); also the whack-o-mole game in 2-1.  Also meepers recommended the game to me and motivated me to work on it.  I also want to thanks kirbymuncher, maza, comicalflop, and AKA, for feedback on WIPs & general motivation.
