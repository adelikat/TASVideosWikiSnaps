	"Salamander (沙羅曼蛇 Saramanda?), retitled Life Force (ライフフォース Raifu Fōsu?) in North America and in the Japanese arcade re-release (see development), is a scrolling shooter arcade game by Konami. Released in 1986 as a spin-off to Gradius, Salamander introduced a simplified power-up system, two-player cooperative gameplay and both horizontally and vertically scrolling stages. Some of these later became the norm for future Gradius games.

	": Hello Bloodyspare, and welcome to TASVideos. Unfortunately, your movie is not up to the standards of our site. The playaround does not give the impression that it is tool-assisted at all, and the movie just lacks the technical requirements in order to be published on the site. Because of this, I'm rejecting this run.
