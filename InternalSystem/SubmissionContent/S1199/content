]p
[p 
	"The program used was 
	[tt 
		"monopolysolve2.cc
	]tt
	". Given a starting point for RndVal1 (9000 iterations from the beginning seed 3E2AD2) and using a search distance of 100000 (later shortened to 20000), the program takes a RndVal1 seed and tests, for all 256 possible RndVal2 values, whether it produces the eight rolls necessary to bankrupt the four CPUs. Each CPU must roll a double, followed by 2, 3, 4, or 6, with the restriction that only one CPU is permitted to roll 4 or 6. This relaxed condition relative to the last submissions is a result of an improved strategy, putting 12 houses on the orange properties in two turns without using the "back 3 space" card. The downside is the more restrictive card manipulation. Both hurry timing and relax timing can be tested.

Rolling the dice in hand (on my last move) is the fastest way to iterate RndVal1, but it also affects RndVal2, so I carefully set up RndVal2=1E (by entering and exiting the menu just before CPU rolls), then spend enough time to get RndVal1=9ACFC6. These values appear three frames after the movie ends, just before RAM(27) increments to 1.
