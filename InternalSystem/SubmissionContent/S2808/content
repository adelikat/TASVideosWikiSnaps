	"In 4-3, the screen scrolls only every other frame and isn't affected by when the level starts. Since I saved an even number of frames (4 frames) rather than an odd number (3 frames or 5 frames), I was able to hex 4-3 in my improved movie which was neat. Aside from 4-2 all the other levels were not changed. The score stayed the same too.

	": Okay, it's a bit silly that only one moment of the entire run was changed. But the last run for this game (in non hard mode) wasn't published in a while, so I don't think it'll disturb the audience if there's another publication, although minor. Accepting as a infinitesimal improvement to an existing run.
