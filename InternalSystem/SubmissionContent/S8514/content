	"- All attacks type of main character have power/speed/range aren't same, each type have each stats. Get knuckle will help gain power for punchs

	"- Enemies/Bosses can dodge, run away, even sometimes can't get hit from main characters

[h1 
	"- Most enemies movement have high speed if staying far from main character, they'll slow down speed if staying close enough

	"- Most next scenes activate rules are at least main character staying at mid screen or further to the right screen, no corpse on screen, main character isn't moving

	"- AI control: simple think it's let AI move to what location I want. It's depend what actions and positions of main character
	$LF
]h1
[h1 
	"- RNG control: simple think it's let AI get hit of main character. It's depend time make input
	$LF
]h1
[h1 
	"- Kill enemies without hit: just work at random. Sometimes, when I let AI move out of screen, they'll die. Easy see at Tank boss stage
	$LF
]h1
[h1 
	"- Make enemies disappear: truly to say, I don't understand how it work. Can see at frames 34440, have total 3 enemies, but result is only need attack one enemy. Maybe it's game bug
	$LF
]h1
[h1 
	"- Critical attacks: it'll help make more damage to target (x2 or more). It's depend RNG control. Easy see at final boss (RAM Watch for most bosses HP is Address 0790), jump attack without critical will have 8 damage
	$LF
]h1
[h1 
	"- Reduce auto scroll time: stand correct position will help reduce few frames while auto moving

	"- I'm not sure with my strategy using for AI control is best or not. This thing is hard to say. Maybe have some other ways I didn't think of it can do better
	$LF
]h1
[h1 
	"- The critical attacks I have found at time fighting to final boss, while I having too tired for find best strategy because he alway can't get hit. It's too late for edit, because I must remake all, same as start again from begin, and the imporant is need read RAM better. I'm lazy now
	$LF
]h1
[h1 
	"- Sometimes, if enemies can hit to main characters, it'll random can run away, reduce time for attack them. But because it's RNG and will make the run have ugly then I didn't try do it

[h1 
	"At the beginning, I thought this run will simple same as other action games, just need move and attacks but I was wrong. This game have AI is too good (because I didn't remember how it hard at before), not easy make hit enemies, even fire with gun
	$LF
]h1
[h1 
	"I was surprised with the sample speedrun. It have RNG manipulation too good, and the actions have perfect frames time. Easy see at stage 1. Try do it by your self then you'll understand

	": This is really good work. I compared your run against the WR, and I find it amazing how your techniques at manipulating the AI put you ahead so quickly. Needless to say, your execution was impressive. Not bad for more than a minute and a half over the RTA record.
