		[b 
			""Roll-zipping"
		]b
		".  This is the earliest known glitch, and predates all of the TAS attempts.  Basically, if Sonic is in ball form, usually from having ducked down or from hitting something while jumping (a regular jump doesn't count), and enters mid-air (usually from rolling off an edge or down a ramp), he accelerates constantly; this allows very high speeds to be obtained.  I'll refer to this as "roll-zipping" in the balance of the run comments.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 
		[b 
			"Speed trick
		]b
		".  Pointed out to me by SprintGod.  Sonic's velocity in this game is normally limited to 768 (0x300) units per frame while running on the ground, but this is only checked for the frame after Sonic exceeds this velocity.  This can be abused: from a stop, Sonic can run up to a velocity of 768 units.  One then taps down to rollfor one frame - deceleration while rolling is 4 units per frame per frame - to hit a velocity of 764 (0x2FC) units, taps back to stand back up (this has a side effect of braking Sonic by 48 (0x30) units per frame per frame, to hit a velocity of 716 (0x2CC) units per frame, then runs for four frames - accelerating at a speed of 16 (0x10) units per frame per frame to reach a one-frame velocity of 780 (0x30C) units per frame.  If the forward direction is pressed in the following frame, velocity will drop back to 768; instead we release the forward direction, causing Sonic to decelerate 16 (0x10) units per frame per frame for one frame to reach a velocity of 764 (0x2FC); alternating between forward and no direction key causes velocity to toggle between 780 and 764 for an effective speed of 772 units per frame.  By using the alternate acceleration/deceleration values of slopes, it's possible to achieve toggling between 766 (0x2FE) and 782 (0x30E) units per frame, for an average velocity of 774 units per frame, but this is rare in practice.  Performing the speed trick on the ground causes lag due to the rapid switching between animations; fortunately, given an appropriate starting velocity, it can be done just as well in the air where no such animation switching takes place, so you will see Sonic spending a lot of time in the air wherever the speed trick is in use.
		$LF

	[li 
		" 
		[b 
			"Acceleration trick
		]b
		". Also pointed out to me by SprintGod.  When braking from a roll in the manner described above, the one-frame deceleration is always applied towards the left, so if Sonic is moving towards the left he gains 48 (0x30) units of speed braking out of a roll.  By rapidly rolling and braking while moving to the left, Sonic accelerates at an average of 22 (0x16) units per frame up to the game's internal maximum limit for velocity.

[p 
	"This level is probably one of the highlights of the run - completed in the impossibly low time of 0:17!  The trick that allows this is abuse of the scales - it is quite possible to roll-zip from them by rolling just before the weight hits the other side - the massive air time resulting from this leads to truly absurd speeds.  Combined with bouncing off of monitors and enemies and a handful of additional roll-zips, this level passes by so quickly you can see how Sonic gets his reputation of being the fastest ever video game character.
	$LF

[p 
	"Although obtaining the shield and rolling over the bridge during this roll-zip cause lag, it's also critical not to do anything to lose speed during that segment to make the impossibly low time feasible.

[p 
	"This level has seen the most improvements over the course of working on this run.  In an earlier version of this run, the precise input sequence leading to the massive chain of roll-zips that make such short work of the level was discovered quite by accident - in one of the earliest WIPs I had achieved 0:21 from a less impressive set of roll-zips, then discovered that the input for Green Hill 3 up to the boss fight had somehow been erased in the interim.  I reran that segment and spliced the input past that point on, only to find the run would desync when hopping on to the scale; I attempted to tweak the input by hand and quite mistakenly ended up achieving a long sought-after 0:20 time.  Although that iteration looked slightly sloppy, I didn't want to touch it for fear of disturbing the roll-zip, but then mike89 pointed out what (correctly) looked to be a slight improvement to GH2; I went and inserted that into the run and sure enough it caused the roll-zip once more to desync, and in a very strange echoing of circumstances ended up improving the roll-zip into a very low and much better-looking 0:20.  Then SprintGod came along with his new (to me) set of glitches, and I restarted the run; with those glitches, his information about velocity RAM addresses, and the knowledge of how to work the scales from my WIPs, I was able to shave another impressive three seconds off of the level to what you see now.

	"The game's requisite auto-scrolling level, also making it the most boring level in the game, and made even worse coming hot off the heels of one of the fastest levels in the game.  My major priority here is lag reduction, considering how atrocious wwmarx's run of this level looks without it.  To that end, I take a hit from the first enemy in the level to lose the shield and kill most enemies the moment they appear on the screen.

[p 
	"During the long interregnum, I bounce around idly and collect most of the rings.  There are enough in the level that the special stage would normally be triggered at the level end (which happens with at least 50 rings), so I take a hit from the second-last enemy in the level to drop the rings (I didn't use the last enemy because it's placed in such a fashion that using it would cause two bridge tiles to drop instead of one).

In the middle of the level, a switch is hit which moves several doors around.  Notably, a door falls to block the spawn point for the level segment from the switch, and opens another door from the spawn point to the path to the exit - so dying after hitting the switch is faster than going through the intended route!
