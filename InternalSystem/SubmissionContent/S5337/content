	"I used a new trick "scroll glitch" which makes an item appear somewhere at the second level. To make it happen, you should put a bomb near (not in front of) a door and scroll the bomb out when it explodes. This trick looks very useful, but can be used in a limited situation, so I can only employ this in stage 1 to rescue 2 goonies.

	"The Ghost appears when the timer (0x011C) becomes 0. It starts from 255 and decreases when any mobs are not in the screen. Ideally, it should be 1 when I moved to the second room at stage 3 to be killed by the ghost immediately. However, when I tried many times, there were no good results, so I compromised and went there when it was 7 which meant a loss of 15 frames. For more info about manipulating the spawning mechanism of mobs, read Phil's submission.

	"Actually, it's extremely difficult to control a timing when the mouse appears. If the mouse appears later than you reach, you have to wait until it completely appears. If earlier, the mouse walks away. Besides, it sometimes doesn't appear at all. Luckily, the mouse appeared a bit earlier than the last publication.
