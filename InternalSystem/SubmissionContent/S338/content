	$LF
	"a boost, ex. that 
	[em 
		"iceboard
	]em
	", and 3 seconds later reswitch to the precedent item. Are you sure it is not better to just walk? You should
	$LF
	"test and compare because it takes ~1 second to switch items. I am
	$LF
	"waiting a 3rd version. Maybe seeing the 
	[a class=intlink href=/43M

	" movie can help you for better strategy on how defeating bosses.
