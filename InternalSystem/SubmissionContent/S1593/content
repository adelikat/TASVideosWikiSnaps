	"The goal of this run is to beat the entire game with only small Mario.  This can be defined as ‘minimalist,’ ‘low%,’ or ‘no items/power-ups/upgrades,’ but I would prefer to call it ‘small-only’ because that’s what it really is.  Only small Mario, the bare minimum, is allowed, with no power-ups to help along the way.  This minimalist goal creates an entirely new style of play from the existing caped run, and is like watching an entirely different TAS.  The main reason for this is because in Super Mario World, the cape power-up greatly changes the gameplay, as caped Mario can easily fly over any gap, enemy, or obstacle, and even spend entire levels flying above all the ‘action.’  Small Mario, however, is forced to confront every obstacle head-on.  He cannot kill enemies with a simple spin of the cape, cannot fly or float above obstacles, and cannot take any damage to save time.  This requires different strategies on almost every level, and makes the game as a whole significantly more challenging.  For clarification rules of the run are: nothing is allowed that would be considered a power-up or upgrade.  These upgrades are: Mushroom, Fire Flower, Cape Feather, and riding on Yoshi.  Switch Palaces, while not a traditional ‘power-up,’ do greatly aid Mario in some levels (and thus take away from their entertainment) so they are also disallowed.  As small Mario, the following levels are not possible to complete: Donut Ghost House b, Star World 1a, Star World 1b, Cheese Bridge Area b, and Valley of Bowser 4b.  Since Cheese Bridge Area b cannot be completed, Soda Lake cannot be accessed and thus cannot be completed.   If you add in the four Switch Palaces that are skipped, it brings the new exit total to 86.

Since Mario’s speed oscillates in two different ranges, 35-37 and 47-49, there are two times the hop glitch can be used.  See

		".  37 hop is only used if Mario doesn’t have enough running room to build his p-meter up to 112 and thus reach the 47-49 speed range (see p-meter/speed meter in Terms Defined section).  Hop glitch is used by simply releasing forward (or left) at the desired past of the oscillation, which will freeze Mario at that speed.  For this to work, forward (or left) can never be pressed again, as doing so will bring the oscillation down to a lower point and freeze it there.  To avoid pressing forward, Mario can never touch the ground for more than one frame, which is why it’s called the hop glitch.  The hop glitch can only be used if Mario can get through the rest of the level without having to press a direction or slow down.  This means there cannot be any turnaround, wall jumps, aerial shell jumps, etc in the remaining part of the level once 49 hop is started.  For those numerous places where some form or pressing a direction or slowing down is needed, you use…
		$LF
		[dt 
			"6/5
		]dt
		[dd 
			"The much more complicated and only slightly faster form of just running by pressing forward.  This 11 frame cycle requires pressing nothing for 6 frames to freeze the oscillation at 49 for these 6 frames.  Since doing this depletes the needed p-meter, however, there must be 5 frames of pressing forward to get the p-meter back up to its charged state.  During the 11 frame cycle, Mario can only touch the ground during the last 3 frames, since these are the only 3 frames when p-meter is charged.  This means all jumps must be timed out to be the perfect height so they hit during these 3 out of 11 frames.  6/5 is used in this run whenever we do a wall jump, aerial/vertical shell jump (they require changing the oscillating speeds), turnaround, grabbing a shell, or running on moving platforms.  
			$LF
			[dt 
				"Aerial shell jump
			]dt
			[dd 
				"This is the most frequently used type of shell jump.  It requires a large open space and lots of height to set up, but allows Mario to bounce off a shell he is holding in midair to clear large horizontal gaps.  This shell jump doesn’t do much in the way of height.  To use this shell jump, Mario must have a fully charged p-meter so he can abuse the 47-49 range oscillating speeds.  At the height of the jump, dropping (not throwing) the shell will make it travel close to Mario.  To allow Mario to actually catch up to it, however, the shell must be dropped at the slowest oscillation, 47.  You then press forward for a few frames and get Mario up to 49 speed and keep him there, allowing the 49 speed Mario to catch up to the 47 speed shell, even though shells are always dropped in front of Mario.  Once Mario catches up to the shell, he must hit it forward (if you press Y during contact he will just grab it).  Hitting this shell in midair is the same as throwing it and it can now be bounced off of, provided Mario can catch up to the now faster moving shell in midair (which he can at 49 speed).  Hitting the shell for the first time will show 200 points appearing and then bouncing off of it will show 400 points.  This same concept can also be used to jump off a p-switch in midair, except it need not be hit in midair because it can be bounced off of right away.
				$LF
				[dt 
					"Vertical shell jump
				]dt
				[dd 
					"This shell jump is used when a large vertical distance needs to be cleared and not much horizontal distance.  It also requires turnaround.  The way it works is the same as the aerial shell jump, but the set-up is different.  Instead of dropping the shell right in front of Mario, the shell is thrown straight up into the air.  This makes the shell move up very slowly, which is why Mario must turnaround to stay even with it.  Once the shell is on the way down, Mario jumps up and hits it in the air, starting the process as explained in the aerial shell jump.
					$LF
					[dt 
						"Block duplication
					]dt
					[dd 
						"All ‘usable’ blocks in Super Mario World can be duplicated (the ones that can’t be are blocks that have been used and are thus brown or just stone blocks of ground).  A block can be duplicated either above or to the left or right side of it (and possibly even below).  To duplicate a block, you must throw an item such as a shell key or p-switch straight up when it is right next to the block.  This will result in another usable block being created above the existing one.  To duplicate to the left or right (or top-left and top-right), the item must be thrown a few pixels further away from the block.  All coins blocks and power-up (Mushroom, Fire Flower, Cape Father) blocks yield the same item upon duplication, but sometimes the duplicated block may be an entirely different item, which differs with its horizontal position (blocks duplicated above are always the same as the original).  For example, duplicating a 1-up to the left produces a coin block and duplicating it to the right produces a vine block (expressed as Coin-1up-vine).  The most useful block duplication is the series shell-key-Yoshi wings-pballoon-shell, which means that duplicating a Yoshi wings block to the right can actually give Mario a p-balloon out of nowhere, as seen in Valley of Bowser 2.

It is possible to grab any two items at once because if they are perfectly aligned the game treats it as one item.  The gap is crossed with an aerial shell jump, but luckily the p-switch falls at a different speed from the shell so it can be re-grabbed without also grabbing the shell.  When grabbing the second shell for the end, long sweeping jumps with lots of turnaround are necessary for Mario to keep p-run.

Blocks can either be duplicated above or to the right or left and blocks that have been used up (are brown) cannot be duplicated.  In the part with the yellow rising ground, we were almost able to get a 1up by bouncing off the shells, only one hit away.  A Buzzy Beetle shell can be thrown into some walls and it will walk around inside the walls when it wakes up.  We were able to get over 18 mushrooms to come out of the mushroom blocks, but having more than 3 onscreen at a time causes lag. When the second set of coin blocks are duplicated, the blocks go right into the walls.  To enter the green pipe as fast as possible, the Buzzy Beetle has to wake up at just the right time, which means hitting him at the right time earlier in the level since they always rest for 300 frames.  The second shell is needed to get up to the key at the end without waiting for the vine.  When Mario comes up through the orange pipe, he does a tiny bit of turnaround to manipulate the Chargin Chuck into not kicking a football, which is impossible to get past without losing p-run.  You’ll notice that the Chuck is doing a kicking motion but nothing is there.  The color change at the end occurs because Mario beats the level without being onscreen.  Putting the key into the keyhole at different positions created 3 different possible colors.

It saves about 120 frames.  The p-switch is thrown through the stair using the same concept.  During the Boo fight, normally Mario needs a some ground to stand on because the animation of the level ending waits for Mario to land on a solid surface.  By catching the wall for a wall jump right as the level ends, however, the game thinks Mario is standing during that frame.

In the third room, hitting the yellow spinning block with the shell first is much faster than having Mario hit it, fall back down, and then jump up again.  49 hop cant be started until Mario is under the block of ground with the 2 red Spike Tops because a few frames of running on the ground are necessary to get under this block (Mario will hit the left side of it if he does 49 hop and jumps right away).

Falling down the passageway looks sloppy because Mario hits the wall, but it is optimized.  Shell jumping out of the water is faster than just ditching the shell and jumping off the ground to the right.  You can’t see it because the screen hasn’t scrolled up yet, but sliding on the slope is used to boost Mario’s speed from 37 to 44 before p-run and thus 49 speed can be gained.  Jumping off the p-switch is not possible because it always puts Mario in a bad position for making it past the gaps, so Mario simply falls off the p-switch and only loses p-run for a few frames because 6/5 allows it to quickly be regained.  Falling down the passage way requires 5 frames of turnaround, and 49 hop can be used once this is done.

Jumping off the p-switch always results in instant death by running into the Chargin Chuck no matter the setup, so Mario has to fall off the switch and go down to 48 speed.  Luckily, there is a nearby slope that we slide on to boost Mario back to 49 speed right away.  Since Mario lands on two Buzzy Beetles after sliding, he never touches the ground and is able to keep the weird butt-out sliding animation while in the air.  This also allows him to kill a beetle in the air by just running into him because the game still thinks he is sliding on a slope.

In the second lava pit, the shell is placed at the top of the slope so Mario can spin jump grab it without wasting any time (Mario must have the shell in front of him and spin jump into it to pick it up while spinning).  Neither a vertical nor aerial shell jump will get enough height to make it up to the bonus room, so the shell had to be backed off the wall, requiring 5 frames of turnaround.  Clearing the next pit was possible without the wall jump, but was slower because it required a lot more waiting on the raft to get the needed height.  The reason we stop and duck at the end is because we have to wait for the shell to come alive so Mario can bounce off it and make it over the slope.

The throw and re-grab process of keeping these blocks for moving upwards and ditching them when moving downwards is optimal.  At 270 on the in-game timer, there is supposed to be an Urchin just to the left of the existing one.  This Urchin blocks the passage and forces Mario to do turnaround to squeeze through, but for some reason when we got to this point the Urchin wasn’t there, allowing us to save about 10 frames.  Another improvement on this level was the boost off the Chargin Chuck at the very end, which briefly boosts Mario’s swimming speed up to 32.  A corner boost could not be used on the last indentation in the ceiling because going up there causes more fish to be on screen and causes more lag.  The missing Urchin, Chargin Chuck boost, and ability of small Mario to more quickly exit the pipe that begins the level all contribute to make this one of the few levels that is faster than the caped run.

	"Since we have to wait for the timer to get down to 249 when exiting the Koopa Room, there is plenty of time to mess around.  In the first room, the spring glitch is used to push Mario through the coin block.  In the Koopa Room, Mario is able to face backwards but still have the forward-facing animation because back is pressed for one frame, bringing Mario’s speed down to 44, which it stays at because of the hop glitch.  This is one of the only places in the run this trick can be used since it is slower than regular 49 speed hop glitch and speed doesn’t matter here.

	"Taking the upward blue pipe takes Mario to the pipe before the Fuzzies about 20 frames sooner, but since Mario loses speed this gain is compromised.  Landing on forward rotating platforms, even if for only a frame, can save time because Mario is teleported forward a pixel, but in this level all the platforms are rotating to the left, which means no time can be gained in this way.  Usually when grabbing a shell, it takes 7 frames of turnaround, but when the Koopa is on a block, only 1-3 frames of turnaround are needed depending on the placement of the Koopa because Mario can hit the Koopa and grab the shell at what would normally be below ground level.  Also, it is not important to grab the first available shell since we must continue to do 6/5 for the shell jump at the end.  Taking the vine at the end is 117 frames slower than doing the shell jump.  This type of vertical shell jump, which focuses on height over distance by throwing the shell above Mario, is only used 3 times in the run: DP1b, here, and CI3b.

	" gives a sense of just how big the gap is that needs to be cleared.  6/5 need not be used in the level because the shell setup at the end kills Mario’s speed anyways.  Since 49 hop is used, it is important for Mario to get the first shell so he can start hop glitch right away.  For the ending shell jump, throwing the first shell up behind the gate will cause it to disappear when Mario goes offscreen to take the vine, so the shell had to be placed on the rotating platform block.  Hitting the vine before throwing this shell would seem to be a priority, but is actually slower due to backtracking.  Mario cannot do fast climbing while holding an item, so this second shell had to be juggled when climbing the vine.  For some reason, if Mario is high enough over the gate, the game doesn’t count it as him having gotten to it.  When setting up the shells, the one to the right has to be a certain distance away from the ledge for the shell jumps to make it.  This shell is placed as far to the left as possible.  The reason this shell isn’t all the way to the right, which would make the shell jumps much easier, is because if there is too much distance between the two shells, the right one will disappear when Mario goes offscreen to get the one by the gate.  Placing the one by the gate as far to the right as possible would be the easy solution, but this procedure costs more time, so it is important to get the left shell as far to the left as possible, allowing more leeway for the one by the gate to be dropped sooner.  The reason getting the shell by the gate further right costs more time is because Mario needs more height to make this happen and must thus stay on the vine longer.  In the setup used, Mario could’ve jumped off the vine sooner and still made it onto the block, but then the shell by the gate wouldn’t be far enough right to maintain the required minimum distance between shells.  With the right setup, a vertical shell jump is combined with an aerial shell jump to clear the gap.

	"There are two places in this level that cannot be passed with 49 hop: the second tar pit and the area just before the first Mega Mole.  We could get to 49 earlier in the beginning much sooner by sliding, but that would mean 49 hop would have to be used for the rest of the level, which isn’t possible.  It was possible to pass these obstacles with some slowdown and then regain 49 speed by sliding, but this was slower than just doing 6/5 and a bit of turnaround past the obstacles.  The second tar pit required a frame of turnaround and the first Mega Mole required two frames, after which 49 hop was used.  Note that we needlessly spin jump through a slope and then back out.  We travel all the way up to the ? block, but can’t hit it because doing so makes Mario land in a tar pit.

In the second area, 37 hop is used until the longer block platforms because there isn’t enough running room on the pipes for Mario to start gaining p-meter.  We had full p-meter on the second platform, but jumping off here causes Mario to fall into a gap regardless of how long or short the jump is and doing turnaround to make the jump short enough to land on the shorter pipe wasn’t worth it, so we had to drop down onto the third platform before jumping.

After this spike rises, however, 6/5 must be used to keep p-meter charged during the short bit of turnaround needed to pass the spikes that rise and fall quickly.  In the second room, 6/5 is used for the beginning because 3 frames of turnaround are needed to not run into the high wall toward the end.  The boss fight again ends with Mario catching the wall.

In the section with the yellow blocks near the end, the Chargin Chuck’s jump would always block Mario’s path.  There was no way to get him to not jump, so we had to slow down a bit before being able to pass by him.  The blue blocks at the end always kill Mario’s speed, but doing 6/5 here was still beneficial because it allowed Mario to reach p-run much sooner on the stretch before the pipe.

	"The first two shells seen in the level cannot be grabbed without lots of slowdown, so the third shell must be grabbed.  The second room combines two newly discovered tricks to save almost 32 seconds (1,900 frames) from the traditional route of running through the maze (small Mario cannot push himself into walls in this level as seen in the caped run.)  The first trick is block duplication.  One feature of this glitch is that duplicating certain blocks to the right or left creates entirely new blocks with entirely new items.  The order of items produced is shell-key-Yoshi wings-pballoon-shell, meaning that when duplicating a Yoshi wings block such as the one in this level, you can produce a key from the left side and p-balloon from the right side.  When duplicating the Yoshi wings block, it may seem sloppy because Mario slows down a lot, but to make the duplication work it is necessary to come to almost a complete stop.  We get a p-balloon from the right to use the second trick, left+right in a cloud/p-balloon, in order to go through walls and boost Mario’s speed.  Once in the p-balloon, pressing left+right lets Mario’s speed oscillate from speed values of 52 down to 36 and back up to 52 again, which is much faster then just pressing right.  Left+right also allows Mario to go through walls.  Going through walls doesn’t affect Mario’s oscillating speed, but does actually slow him down a bit because Mario is not pushed through right away.  For this reason, it is important to avoid all of the brown chunks of ground, as a differentiation in ground type (yellow vs. brown) is treated as a wall.  This is done by pushing Mario into the very bottom part of the ground so he will not be constantly be slowed down by running into the numerous brown chunks of ground (Mario can move smoothly when in one medium of ground, it is when he goes between different ground types that slows him down).  Mario is pushed into the bottom part of the ground quickly because when he approaches a wall, it is resistant to let him enter, so if he is near the top or bottom of this wall it will quickly push him to this point.  This occurs in the rectangular chunk of brown ground at the beginning and when entering the brown ground, as Mario appears to warp downwards.  Luckily, Mario can enter the pipe in inflated form, so there is no waiting time needed for the p-balloon to wear off.  In the third room, 37 hop is used until Mario reaches a platform long enough for him to max out the p-meter and get up to 49 speed.

	"37 hop is used to jump over the first staircase because walking up a slope depletes p-meter and slows Mario down.  In the second room, the method of hitting the p-switch used is much faster than jumping up and hitting it while on the block.  Mario starts moving to the left as early as possible without getting too far away to hit the p-switch.  The traditional route here is to run to the 5th door on the right, which takes you to the leftmost part of the third room, where there is a p-switch. Hitting the ? block in the third room creates a chain of coins that can be controlled and hitting the p-switch then turns these coins into blocks, giving Mario a staircase to the key (

	").  Our route of taking the left door to directly under the key and spin jumping off the Boos is much faster because Mario doesn’t have to take the time to run to the faraway 5th door, get the p-switch, or make the staircase.  Taking the 2nd door on the right also takes Mario to directly under the key, but is still slower than going to the left.

We run on as many platforms as possible, but some of them have to be skipped.  In one instance near the end of the level, Mario falls off a platform instead of jumping off which briefly causes him to lose p-run, but this sacrifice was worth it since it allows running on a platform that would otherwise be missed.  49 hop is used after the last moving platform until the end.  99 gate points for the end!

Moving back and forth while falling down the narrow passageway does save a few frames because it gets Mario’s speed going instead of him just being still.  6/5 needs to be used until the end of the level because 3 frames of turnaround are needed to not fall in the lava at time 269 and the ending bounce off the rock requires some turnaround as well.  This bounce was faster than jumping on the spring on the spring block and grabbing the spring (which kills speed).  It is not possible to make the gap without either killing speed on the spring on using the rock to bounce off of.  The secret exit is not possible here, because the walls around the key always kill Mario if he tries to enter them using the spring glitch.

When Mario runs into the clown-copter, it pushes him out at 64 speed, so we can do the zipping along the ground trick (as seen in Chocolate Island 1) by pressing A and B alternately every frame to maintain this speed while zipping along the ground.  If we continue to hold forward when running into the clown-copter, Mario can pass through it and even fall through the otherwise deadly propeller because the game treats hitting it from above as hitting it from a safe direction.  Whenever Bowser throws Mechakoopas, they are hit and thrown at the earliest possible time.  Alexis Neuhaus, the author of a long since obsoleted SMW 11 run, also did the Bowser fight small so we can use his times to compare.  The first phase is done 49 frames faster, the second 51 frames faster, and the third 22 frames faster, for a total of 122 frames gained.  The AVI length is shortened by having Mario right under Princess Peach after the last hit on Bowser so he doesn’t have to spend time walking over to her.
