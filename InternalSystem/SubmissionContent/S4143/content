[p 
	"This game uses two RNGs. First RNG determines almost every luck-based event on this game. Its formula can be obtained from 
	[a class=extlink href=http://www.smogon.com/ingame/rng/pid_iv_creation#what_is_a_pid rel=nofollow 
		"smogon
	]a
	". However, this game additionally uses a second RNG that is used to determine wild encounters.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This second RNG (formula is: val <- val*0x41C64E6D + 0x3039 ) only advances if you step in grass, cave, water, etc. So this means that it’s not possible to avoid wild encounters during the whole run.
	$LF
]p
[h3 id=PokémonCenter’sextraRNGcycle 
	" Pokémon Center’s extra RNG cycle
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"At the start of the game, RNG goes forward at two per frame in battle, and one per frame outside a battle. This means it’s possible to switch the parity of the RNG by delaying one frame before starting a battle, but it’s not possible to control this parity later, meaning you would be forced to skip some RNG values that you may have want to use (a RNG that determines a critical hit earlier, for example).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"However, after entering on a Pokemon Center for the first time (I do on Cerulean City), it advances twice outside a battle and three per frame in battle except when changing the move selection of a Pokemon (the RNG advances twice in this case). This means you have a much better control of the RNG cycles, and you get a good luck manipulation quicker. Because of this, Route 3 was probably one of the hardest parts to luck manipulate. Also, because of how RNG cycles works, if waiting is needed for a certain event to happen, it is better to wait during a battle than outside.
	$LF

[h3 id=Battleluckmanipulation 
	" Battle luck manipulation
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"It is important to know how RNG determines critical hits, misses, side effects, etc.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Critical hits are determined just after the “X used Y!” message, and right after, damage percentage is determined (from 85% to 100%). There’s a chance of 1/16 to get a critical hit, 1/16 to get a max damage hit, and 1/256 to get a critical max damage hit, which is necessary sometimes on this run. (And obviously quite hard to luck manipulate).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Definitely, the hardest part was luck manipulating Metronome. There are 339 different moves that Metronome can execute. Since the only way to manipulate it is waiting for the right RNG value to appear, sometimes waiting a lot of time is needed.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The main problem of manipulating this is when more than one rare event needs to be manipulated together (for example, Metronome + Critical Hit would be a chance of 1/5424, so you may need to waste many frames for that to happen). When waiting a lot is needed, there is usually a solution that lets you manipulate the different events separately, which is opening the help menu screen.
	$LF

[p 
	"Of course, I learned how RNG determines all of these things, so I could optimize the battles the best I could.

[h3 id=Openinghelpmenuinabattle 
	" Opening help menu in a battle
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"When it is not possible to control the parity of the RNG (beginning of the run), or you need to hit a Critical Max Damage or manipulate a Metronome + Critical hit, and you do not want to wait for too long, it is also possible to open the help menu screen for luck manipulation. When the help menu screen is opened, RNG advances one per frame before getting to a Pokemon Center, and two per frame after entering, meaning it is another way to control RNG parity (even before entering on a Pokemon Center). Another use of this is that if help menu is opened between Critical hit determination and damage percentage determination, you can control those two events separately, making it easier to luck manipulate (this also works to any other event that normally would happen together but you need to control them separately to get a faster luck manipulation, such as Metronome and Critical Hit for example).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There are two inconveniences of this, obvious ones; it makes the battle look worse (I personally do not find very clean to see how help screen is opened on a battle), and it forces you to waste some frames. So this trick is used on this run when it is really necessary to use it. I tried to use it as few times as possible, but for example in the late part of the run, it is completely neccesary, or else the run would have been much slower.
	$LF
]p
[h3 id=Wildencountermanipulation 
	" Wild encounter manipulation
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Unlike previous generations and Ruby / Shapphire, wild encounters work differently, and they are determined with a new RNG. As explained before, this RNG only advances when doing a step over something that could generate a wild encounter, so it is not possible to avoid getting them. Well, there is only one possibility to avoid them, which is using Repels, so I need some of them during the run. However, it is still possible to luck manipulate to get the lowest possible number of wild encounters. Since I can buy Repels on Pewter City, I luck manipulated the number of wild encounters until that city.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Wild encounter manipulation was one of the hardest things I did on this TAS, and I run some simulator search programs to help me with this. First of all, the seed of this RNG is generated just after the Charizard screen clears in the intro. It is known which address generates the seed, but it is not known how it exactly generates it. So I used a brute-force search script in VBA to find the seed, which gave me the seed I wanted after waiting for only 8 frames. The help menu noise at the very beginning is intended and completely necessary to get the perfect seed as soon as possible.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There are 65536 possible seeds you can get, and only one of those would give me the perfect seed I was looking for, which means this is one of the rarest events in this TAS, since the chances of getting the perfect seed is 1/65536. Since Repels can be used after Pewter City, what I needed from the seed was as low encounters as possible until Pewter City. This seed gives me exactly 2 encounters until Pewter City (both encounters on Route 1), which is fine since I need to catch 2 HM slaves, and let's me save one Repel in the Mt.Moon. There was another seed that was taken into consideration, a seed that wouldn't give you any encounter until Pewter City, but it wouldn't work as good as the previous one since I would need to take extra steps in order to avoid encounters in Viridian Forest, and I would need to catch 2 HM slaves later anyway.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"So, the 2 seeds I talked about were the only 2 seeds that would let me go to Pewter City without extra encounters (encounters that I will just need to run away). The one I use is the best one because it lets me cut a bit more grass, saving some steps in my movement. Still, I needed to save a grass step on Viridian Forest so that I didn't get an extra encounter, and that was by letting the Bug Catcher watch me ("!" message) and not talking to him.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Another minor event that I had to manipulate was encountering Abra on the first grass step.

	" Manipulating IV’s (Squirtle and Clefairy)
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The main RNG seed is generated just after choosing a name for your character (“I” in my case). This seed would determine how good my Squirtle and my Clefairy could be. Again, there is 65536 possible seeds I could get, so I used another simulator search program that could help me with this work.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The first problem I had was the emulator itself. Lua script savestates are broken, so a brute force searching does not work perfectly, and I have to manually check if my brute force searching was right. The seed I ended up finding was D4D4, which is a very good seed for this run. Still, there are 2 seeds that would be better in theory, but according to my brute force searching (which I checked manually), it is not possible to get those 2 seeds fast enough to be worth getting them. However, there is a chance that my search (even if I checked it manually) was wrong because of the emulator limitations.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Another important thing is that, the seed is the thing that lets me get the IVs I want for both Squirtle and Clefairy. This means I can't just expect perfect IVs on both Pokémon. My simulate search program determined the best possible combination of IVs for both Pokémon (taking into account Clefable is more important than Squirtle since it's used longer in the run), without having to wait too much time to get those IVs (it's worse to get flawless IVs if you have to wait too much to get them).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"So, after getting this seed, the IV's I could get for Squirtle and Clefable were:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Squirtle IV's: HP: 8 Atk: 13 Def: 18 SpAtk: 31 SpDef: 26 Speed: 10 (+sp.atk/-sp.def)

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Squirtle's special attack IV is the highest possible. Attack IV doesn't need to be any higher (it wouldn't make any difference for this run). 31 IV speed would have worked better, but there is not seed that could give you a 31 IV speed Squirtle, and then a good Clefable (because of what I explained before), so it wasn't an option in the end. The 2 better seeds I was talking before would have given me slightly better IV's on speed, but this IV works fine anyway.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Clefable IV's are really good. Perfect attack and speed, and really high special attack IV (31 IV for special attack wouldn't make any difference).

	"FractalFusion really made a big part of the route planning. Actually, I followed most of his ideas: I get Mega Punch and Mega Kick for strong Pokemon, Water Pulse for rock / ghost Pokemon, Pound for weaker Pokemon, and in the end I get Metronome. I also teach Strength to Clefairy because it has the same base power than Mega Punch, it has a higher accuracy, and its name is shorter. Also, a Squirtle with high Attack is not needed anymore since Squirtle is only used until Mt.Moon. Because of that, it was better to get a Squirtle with high Special Attack, which ended up saving 16 seconds in the early part of the run compared to the previous publication.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Another important thing for the route was knowing which items I will need to use. I need enough items so I don't have to use any Pokemon Center (since they are slow), but I don't want any extra items (for example, using 5 Mega Punch Critical Hits is faster than using 5 Mega Kicks and then using a Repel).

In fact, the route I use for the Elite Four and the decisions I make basically depends completely on the RNG, so I wasn't unsure how the elite four would look. One of those decisions was not depositing all my Pokemon except Clefable before the Elite Four. It's actually 10 frames slower but luck manipulation resulted to be better.

If I didn't have metronome, Cloyster would die in 3 hits (its hability is Shell Armor, so I can't critical hit him), and it has a 100% chance of using Hail, which wastes a lot of time. Then the more moves I can use to 1 hit an enemy, the easier it is to manipulate it. I can use 3 different moves for Cloyster (Thunder, Thunderbolt or Zap Cannon), but Low Kick is the only move that works for Lapras, and therefore it was the hardest metronome to execute.

Then Dragonite only dies with an Ice type move (none of the Dragon type moves would be enough to kill). Blizzard can kill Dragonite without a critical hit, but I would have to wait too much frames to be worth it, so it was better to use Ice Beam on this case.
