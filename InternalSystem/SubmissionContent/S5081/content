	"We needed a fastest unwinnable stuck trapped situation where i can still move around but cannot progress in the game with my or anyone else's current knowledge of glitches though i have to admit i cannot specifically prove that this is an unwinnable situation which p TAS for AFD so here's one that traps Juste in an inescapable Clock Tower. DISCLAIMER: This is a Castlevania game and thus there's probably a way to unwinnable stuck trapped situation where i can still move around but cannot progress in the game with my or anyone else's current knowledge of glitches though i have to admit i cannot specifically prove that this is an unwinnable situation which p everything before the game starts, but what kind of loser puts effort into an AFD submission? *shuts down VirtualBox and Adobe Premiere, cries softly*
