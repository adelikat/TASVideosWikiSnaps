		"Bugs Bunny in Double Trouble
	]em
	" is a Looney Tunes-based video game published by Sega in 1996 for Genesis and Game Gear, developed by Probe Entertainment and Climax Studios.

[div class=p 
	"In the game's storyline, Bugs Bunny is having some wacky dream involving Yosemite Sam as a laboratory professor who tries to catch Bugs Bunny and take his brain. Bugs takes off, runs into a television-like machine, and finds that it transports him through various worlds (based on classic Looney Tunes episodes) where Bugs needs to go through various adventures.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The game looks quite interesting at a glance - Bugs can run pretty fast and the levels are pretty varied. Unfortunately, there are a lot of annoyances:
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		" It seems the music composer was short on time, because five out of seven worlds (and the credits, and the level select menu) use the same generic music theme. It gets old fast.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" The 
		[em 
			"first
		]em
		" world in the game is two stages of escort missions. Everyone loves those, right?
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Somehow, the UI graphics regularly clip and get hidden by the in-game level graphics.
		$LF

	[li 
		" Movement physics in general are a bit wonky.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" The sprint meter mechanic, which is terribly implemented. First of all, though it's a "meter", it is not visible in any way, and can only be measured through RAM watching. Basically, if you sprint for longer than 1.5 seconds, Bugs gets exhausted and needs to stop and rest for a few seconds (automatically triggered from a standing or walking state). A lot of tricks in the TAS involve ways to get around this, finding ways to cancel the rest animation or reducing sprint bar usage. And sometimes there just are situations with no good way to cancel the rest animation, so Bugs just has to stop and pant now and then.

		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Releasing the sprint button will make it start going down by 1 per frame, but only if you release on the ground. If you release in mid-air, the sprint meter just gets stuck in place. Sometimes it's best to walk for a bit and let the sprint meter decrease on its own, typically when there is no other way to cancel the rest animation.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" If the sprint meter goes above 89, if the player lands on the ground or is in a standing or walking state (or any other grounded state except sprinting itself), it will reset to 0, and the player will lose control of Bugs while he does a resting animation for a second.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" If the player is sprinting or jumping, the sprint meter can go up indefinitely until either state ends. This means that for long running sections, it can be better to make the sprint meter rise up far beyond the 89 mark, even if there is no good way to cancel the rest animation afterwards.

		" The only way to reset the sprint meter is to trigger the rest animation, or to go to a new area.. To prevent having to wait for this animation, there are ways to cancel it:
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" Trigger the rest animation and then slide off a platform. This is the most common way to cancel the rest animation, as platforms that can be slid off are common in most areas, although not everywhere. Often times, it is also useful to jump upon a platform, then reverse direction and slide off backwards, then drift back on the platform again. This is useful in platforming sections where just sliding off a platform is not useful.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				" Trigger the rest animation and then slide into a fire. This triggers a jumping motion. It does not work if Bugs is invincible (from taking damage or otherwise). Bugs must first trigger the animation and then get hit by the fire - just sprinting into the fire will trigger the animation after the jump instead.

[div class=p 
	"With the right speed and some pixel positioning, it's possible to clip pretty deep into the side of a ledge or platform (about Bugs' width) before collision actually realizes it should stop Bugs from going in there. These sorts of clips are used in various platforming segments, where they usually can save several frames.

Beyond doing that at the first possible opportunity, there isn't that much to do here - mainly just making sure to stay ahead enough of Daffy that he will follow Bugs, but not too far so he doesn't get lost. Then there's also accounting for some random frames that can be lost here and there by Daffy for reasons I'm not entirely sure of, as well as good old lag frames, which I made sure to minimize as much as possible.

[div class=p
