A decent amount of luck manipulation was needed to get the enemies to appear in good locations to quickly clear rooms. Also, damage was taken to quickly get through two rooms. The boss was also a lot more fun than the Ant Queen.

	"This stage also proved to be about a minute faster than Sand Castle. This bright and colorful stage is interesting. There are three rooms with these giant cookies with an X on them. In the second room, the cookie was slightly too far out, so I couldn’t just jump around it like I did in the third room. Also, in the two rooms where you had to ride on cookies to get across it, I found that if you jumped in the direction it was staking you, it would give you a little extra speed to fly forward with. Lastly the boss battle was quick. Took damage on purpose to show you can walk through the cake, which I found amusing.
