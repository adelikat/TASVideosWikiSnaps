The optmization comes in three ways: 1) of course, shooting the magic as early as possible to strike him back; 2) forcing him to energize the cloud that is farther to the right, to energize it faster and by consequence attacking him faster; 3) forcing him to energize the bottom 2 clouds at the same time (they get pretty close to each other), so you can strike the first one and right after his damage cooldown ends you can strike the second one. Also I noticed that sometimes his routine framecounter is set to 12 before attacking (fast) and sometimes 25 (slow), seems to be relate to Santa's y position relative to him, so I moved around in order to maximize the faster attacks.
