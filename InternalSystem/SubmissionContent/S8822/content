	"The flap trick is done by flapping, by tapping A, just as you start falling, as a rule of thumb, the frame to flap is two frames before the first frame you can start dive bombing. This trick saves about 2 frames per fall, where fall speed matters, and can be seen specially on room 1 of Stage 3, where this trick is used on each individual fall when breaking the blocks.

	": Well, this is a really nice improvement. Nice to see mechanics getting exploited even further. In regards to the loss of frames, over an RNG difference...these things happen. I can think of a two games I've TASed where improvement TASes were created and some spots just won't cooperate as before. Its unfortunate, but very understandable and quite fine in this case. Great work.
