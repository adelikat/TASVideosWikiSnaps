	"Last time I sacrified something entertaining for lag, but then I realized the things I thought were entertaining really were very skippable.  Thus, some of the improvement came from reducing lag.  There is a large amount of lag in this game because of the large number of objects in most of the levels.

The layout of the game takes full advantage of both the mechanics of Super Mario World and the additions of Super Demo World, and the levels can get extremely complicated.
