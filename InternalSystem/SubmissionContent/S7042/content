	"This unlicensed NES port of Earthworm Jim 2, known as the "Shin-Shin" version, was developed by the Ex-Sachen developer team, and was published by NT (also known as Ka-Sheng or Shin-Shin). Compared to the also unlicensed port by Super Game, this version feels more official, however this port's graphics seem to be confused about what perspective they're supposed to be.

	", which if applied over the entire run would save a significant amount of time. I'd recommend investigating the game a bit further and really squeezing everything out of it. Tricks like this that are both significant timesavers and easy to find shouldn't be left out. I guess the fourth try's gonna be the charm on this one, eh?
