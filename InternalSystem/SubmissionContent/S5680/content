	"Due to the nature of the game, the optimal stage order and the strategies were not obvious before gaining thorough game knowledge, resulting in very different approaches from every team, also due to the different tricks and glitches discovered by them. For this reason, making a new run from scratch was necessary.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"After the contest, a few teams pooled their knowledge and turns out there were a few things that no team did, but the collective knowledge and analysis revealed these tricks. The most notable is that by combining Miniboss Skip and Door Lock Break, it is possible to skip many boss re-fights as well. Another interesting exploit was the result of researching on Charge Swap and Shot Counter Glitch, which allowed us to "create our own weapons".
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The work was mostly looking for every team's best strategies and combining them. Author count is very high for this reason. Some of it was applying the new tricks, and a few bits are just straight optimization. Teams 4 & 3 were both very optimal, a single trick could have decided who won, and were well ahead of everyone else, so a lot of times we picked one of those two teams on a given segment. The resources of the other teams still had a bit of extra information to work with.

[p 
	"There are many parts, especially in the earlier stages, in which it was possible to make arbitrary choices that don't result in any time sacrificies. We exploited these possibilities in order to make this run more pleasant to watch.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"There are two kind of situations in which we improved entertainment: in the traveling throught the levels and in minibosses and bosses fights.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Every miniboss is placed around in the half of stages, and from the moment the fight starts, the relative miniboss theme music will persists until we reach the stage boss. Since the musics are the most appealing and original side of this game, for the first three stages we managed to avoid picking up item drops, in order to allow the watcher to enjoy them better.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"However, while every stage (except the Intro) has a an unique background music, the 9 minibosses do reuse the same 4 music themes, making them less interesting. For this reason, during the second half of the stages we do the exact opposite, by trying to pick as many item drops as possible, in order to show off extra luck manipulation and kill as many enemies as possible while still maintaining enough ammo for beating the boss as fast as possible.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"During the minibosses and bosses fights, we play around with Zook's movements and use as many different weapons as possible. For Whirlwind and Meteor Shower attacks, these are the only occasions in which they can be used without wasting any time, mostly due to heavy lag involving them.
	[br 
	]br

	"Beside play-around, there is another kind of inputs we left in the movie file that doesn't affect the speed. Actually, these input are not being read by the game at all: these function as a form of bookmarks that will serve as a TASing aid for future improvements.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Whenever we lose control of Zook, we press Start just before regaining control. This is a sync check, letting us immediately know if we wait too many frames. If a change in emulation happened, the pause screen will immediately let us know if the loading took fewer frames for some reason.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"We also use the Select button. It has no purpose in game. It is used to mark "important" frames. Around bosses, it denotes when we inserted intentional delay, the moment camera begins scrolling, lag that happens before boss dialog, the first character in the dialog that showed up (frame rule check), and when the boss particles have all finally vanished.

	"Zook  Man ZX4 is an action platformer bootleg by unlicensed developer Vast Fame from Taiwan, based loosely on Mega Man X series. Most graphics are taken from Mega Man X, X2, X3, and Mega Man & Bass, while some enemies come from previous Zook Hero titles by the same company. Most musics are remixes of songs found in Soul Falchion, although there are new original compositions made for the game.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Like for most Mega Man games, there are 8 main levels that can be accessed at chosen order, while there are as well an intro stage and a final stage that are accessed, respectively, firstly and lastly in the playthrough.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"The main difference is that there isn't a final stage with a final boss, but rather a group of 8 mini-levels, each with a boss re-fight. Also, bosses don't have weakness to any weapon.
	$LF
	"The playability is very low due to many developing overlooks, while at the same time making the TASing much complex and challenging. The hitboxes are huge, the levels are narrow, the weapons are weird, and of course there are many glitches.

	[a id=heading-7516

]h3
[p 
	"Ironically, even bootleg games themselves are subject to piracy. For this reason, many unlicensed game developers have implemented protections aganist ROM dumping. Zook Man ZX4 featured especially heavy protections, in both the hardware and software sides, that made it took many efforts to make it emulated. Also, the Chinese version cartridge is much more rare than the English one. For these reasons, the game was dumped and emulated only in June 26nd 2016, at least 10 years after the game was released.

[p 
	"These are the same from Mega Man X series: walk, jump, shoot, charge shot, walljump, and dash (instead of slide from regular Mega Man series). Note that the dash needs to be unlocked by getting the Leg Upgrade in Stage 7.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There are no subpixels in this game, and everything moves in whole pixels. There are three speeds at which Zook can move: 2 pixels for walking, 3 pixels for dash and Flame Dash, and -1 pixel when getting hurt.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Jumping and falling speed is not calculated with an acceleration, but just with a prewritten cycle that makes little sense: you rise faster when the jump is about to end (up 4/frame), rather than at the beginning (up 3/frame). Also, walljumping makes Zook rise much faster (up 6/frame) than regular jumps from floor.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Keeping B button for at least 60 frames charges for the next shot, which will be fired on button release. At first, only the Basic Buster can be charged, then after getting Arm Upgrade is possible to charge shots with all other weapons, and also double charge with Basic Buster. See other sections for more informations.

	"There are only two items that can be stored and consumed at will: Health Tanks and Ammo Tanks. The first completely restores the player's health points and the second completely replenishes the current weapon's ammo.

]h2
[p 
	"Every weapon, beside the Basic Buster, depletes one or more ammo when firing, and needs to be unlocked by defeating the relative boss in order to be used. Every weapon has a separate stock of 11 ammo maximum. These can be replenished by picking Ammo Drops, using Ammo Tanks, or by quitting the current stage. They won't get replenished between stages of the Boss Rush, differently from Health Points. Current weapon can be changed in Pause Menu, or by pressing L or R buttons.

[h3 
	" Basic Buster
	$LF
	[a id=heading-7519 
	]a
]h3
[p 
	"The only weapon with infinite ammo, deals 1 damage per hit. It's also the only weapon we can charge from the start of the game, which deals 2 damage. With the Arm Upgrade, it can charge twice for as much as 3 damage, that is the minimum damage dealt by other weapons. The basic shots are the only weapon projectile that can break blocks at range.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Differently from other weapons, you can change to other weapons while an uncharged shot is present, and this will mutate the shot in strange ways, giving it different hitboxes. This is used at times to hit enemies in difficult spots with the mutated hitboxes. Bullets will also get the ability to hit multiple enemies if we switch to laser, which can be useful sometimes. Lastly, there is a glitch with graphics allocation, and if we do these switches, it is possible to have a type of memory leak that may cause more lag. In extreme cases (we don't go this far), enemies and player bullets will start sharing the same graphics.

]h3
[p 
	"Deals 3 damage, with a main projectile and two smaller projectiles. Its charged shot does not fire a bullet, but rather sends Zook flying horizontaly at 3 pixels/frame for around 64 frames. The big reason to pick this thing up is for the flying 3 pixels/frame, which for some reason lets us do a mid-air jump after it finishes. No frame perfect trick here, just release the charge in mid-air, and after it's done, we can jump once any time. Critical for breaking the auto-scrollers of Stages 2 & 4.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"The fact the charged flame attack also deals 5 damage is convenient for destroying enemies on the way for items, as no regular enemy has more than 5 HP.

[p 
	"Deals 4 damage with a shot that falls to the ground, then creates a column of damage. Charged shot is two of these, that shortly move as well, on both sides. This weapon wasn't really helpful, and we only pick it up after getting all the good stuff. If anything, having it will cost us time in Stage 5, because it's an extra weapon we have to scroll past, so it has the dubious status of being a weapon with negative value. By the way, the ability to hit a boss 2 times with a single use is still welcome for the Boss Rush stages.

]h3
[p 
	"Deals 4 damage with a spike that runs along the ground, or completely stationary if shot in the air. Its charged shot drops 10-damage huge meteors that can easily create lag, and it is rare to find situations where it doesn't at all. We pick it up later in the run. Nothing against a 4-damage uncharged projectile that keeps lag low, but just having it gets in the way of weapon select in Stage 5, so it's value is negative.

	$LF
	[a id=heading-7523

[p 
	"Deals 3 damage with two really slow shots. The charged shot gives a 6 HP barrier that, so long as it is visible, prevents us from shooting, switching weapons, or pausing. This would be a crippling disadvantage, but Charge Swap trick lets us get rid of the sprite and keep the barrier, letting us fight back with impunity. That makes it a cool "weapon" we pick up right after getting all the cooler weapons.

	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Note that every missile shoot will generate a trail of smoke that won't disappear instantly after the missile hits something, and if you swap weapon these smoke sprites will turn into 0-damage bullets, which could make some problems.

	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Its charged shot deals 6 damage with a pair of pretty fast moving stars in some sideways 8 pattern. These stars can exist pretty far off-screen and is critical for the Boss Skip, but since there aren't any enemies we can use outside of the end stages, this weapon is left until after we pick up all the good stuff. Would be useful for two Miniboss Skips, but it's impossible to do Stage 6 before Stage 6, and Stage 1 has a rather vital weapon we need rather early.

	$LF
	[a id=heading-7526

]h3
[p 
	"Deals 4 damage, with an annoyingly long bounce around. As fun as it is to make it work, we can't do much other attacking while it's out, and we've got flame charges to do. Its charge shot fires a pair of 8-damage giant spikeballs that are excellent for taking down bosses, but this by itself isn't really a sufficiently good reason for going through Stage 7 as early as we did. The Leg Upgrade is primarily why we end up with this weapon early, but it also saves a small amount of time over just laser versus bosses.

	$LF
	[a id=heading-7527

]h3
[p 
	"Deals 4 damage and can hit multiple enemies, making it very useful. The charged shot is this mega laser that deals 10 damage and often hits minibosses twice. Lasts just slightly too short to double-hit bosses. The properties of the mega laser also frees our movement in cases where it really shouldn't be freed, which among other small time savers, also allows the Boss Skip to happen at all. It is also easy to trigger the Shot Counter Glitch with this weapon, by hitting an off-screen enemy with an uncharged shot.

	[br

	"If the intent is to deal damage, this thing gets in the way. However, it can break blocks, and if the intent was just to get an enemy into hit-stun, the muzzle flash works as well as any weapon.

Taking damage or using Flame Charge does not interrupt the dash, merely suspends it for the duration you lose control, and if you're over air after regaining control, you get one more frame of dash.

This would be fatal, as terrain is the big thing stopping you from falling to the center of the world, but there's two ways to escape without having to die: Land on an object platform, or use Flame Charge and jump out. As it happens, every place we Ghost Fall, we have such escapes.

We can't initiate a fall unless we can stop on an air tile, so solid tiles next to the ladder tiles means we still need to jump as normal if we need to fall.

It wasn't me who manipulated the spawn zones to prevent the upper enemy from ever existing.

	"This is the most interesting battle. Most of them are just "do enough overflow damage, then keep up with invincibility timer." For anyone who didn't route for Arm Upgrade first, it's "shoot boss 28 times with 60 frames charging against 96 frames invincibility," as trivial as it sounds. But with Arm Upgrade and only the basic buster, the stategy then becomes "use doppler effect and Charge Storage to optimize 140 frames charging against 96 frames invincibility."
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Bosses have 11 main HP and 5 sub-HP per main HP. In total, that means we need to blast away 55 HP. Since there's no chance at overflow damage with 3 damage maximum, it's just counting how many 3-damage shots it will take to remove 55 HP. The answer is 19, with 2 damage to spare. 140 frames of charging is a long time, longer than the 96 frames invincibility by a full 44 frames, plus one more frame because one of them B is released to shoot. 60 frames of charging (okay, 61 because B released to shoot) is well under, and since we have 2 damage to spare, we can replace two 3-damage shots with a pair of faster 2-damage ones, so we can shoot 17 full blasts and 2 decent blasts.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The movement necessary keeps us very busy, at least. Charge Storage requires we take damage, but enables us to shoot a 3-damage charge while keeping fully charged. This is done by releasing B in the moment you lose control, and pressing it the instant control is regained. We lose control thanks to dialog, so we get a free Charge Storage at the very start. Since we haven't been damaged yet, we walk forward to take a hit and repeat the glitch. After that, we generally walk back so we can fire our shot as early as possible, giving it some travel time before hitting the boss, and letting us charge our next shot sooner. The "doppler effect" I was talking about earlier.
	$LF

[p 
	"Although Charge Storage lets us keep the 140 frames charge while shooting such lovely 3-damage shots, it takes 96 frames for our own invincibility to wear off, on top of the 16 frames of ouch animation to wait out, for 112 frames between shots. Sure, this is faster than 140 frames, but the doppler effect makes up for enough of the 140 frames that it still saves time, and lets us take a hit for Charge Storage without the 112 frames wait. Besides, too much damage, and we'd need a Heart Tank, costing 5 frames and is so much less stylish.

Part of the laser's effects are to lock the player in place, and so does the capsule. Since these things don't really account for each other, once the laser object finishes, it unlocks us.

Still, the game keeps track of total damage dealt, and although the overflow damage can't actually remove more than one HP at a time, later hits will make use of the overflow damage and a weak attack or even the 0-damage Muzzle Flash will be able to remove one main HP on the next attack. Basically, the strategy boils down to doing enough damage up-front so that later attacks just need to make the hits rather than damage. You can't defeat bosses faster than 11 hits, no matter the damage.

	"Dashing requires a double tap to, well, dash. When we jump out of a dash, we are stopped for one frame. The double tap has a 20 frame timer between taps, so we can tap once, do a really fast jump, then finish with our second tap. For a tap to work, we have to release left or right for a frame, which also delays us. By making a tap on the frame we jump out of a dash, we overlap some of the zero speed frames, so that it wastes less time. Then we only need to release for one more frame when we land, as opposed to needing the two taps then. This is done for short ledges, but higher ledges are too high and our 20 frame timer expires before we land.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The higher ones aren't perfectly straight-forward either. Sure, we have to jump higher, and we have to make the double tap to dash when we land. However, the important pixel the game uses when landing depends on our facing, always toward the back foot. The process of facing left requires us to move one frame in that direction, so although we lose 2 pixels, we can dash 3 frames earlier, for a net gain of 1 pixel.

	"We trigger the Shot Counter glitch in this segment. The laser apparently is supposed to erase itself after destroying a few enemies, but seems to use the wrong code for that, and using it to rapidly destroy a respawning off-screen enemy glitches the shot counter. This lets us shoot mulitple projectiles of things we should only shoot one of at a time, and also switch while they're out. The disadvantage here is that while the counter is negative, we can't switch weapons, requiring us to shoot to bring it up to zero to allow the switch. It doesn't save time now, but it will later.

[p 
	"At the spot where we take damage from a fire, there's another fire we managed to get past. Initially, it is faster to just shoot that short platform and keep dashing, making only one jump, but we took the path we did because otherwise our invincibility runs out a few frames too early and we take damage at the second fire. In fact, the timing is so tight our invincibillity wears off and we're relying on the fact our hitbox is disabled when we're on the invisible frames of the invincibility blinks, for just those last few frames.

Yes, I do those jumps on some ledges in this game, in fact. The reason we don't here is because the dash speed makes up for it in fall time, and jumping does not carry dash speed through it. If we were going to a left-side ledge, then I would have jumped, as ending a dash checks the right-side pixel for whether we're over air to begin our fall.

After the bats, there is another enemy on the wall, and the only attack we've got that can hit it without slowing our 6 pixels/frame rise is the charged spikeball. We switch weapons and somehow glitch-erase a spikeball, probably has to do with animation timers, plus it keeps our shot counter at zero and ends the glitch.

Our second Ladder Dash is a lot more glorious than the first, as now you see us fly through the air. Even nicer, this Ladder Dash lets us jump out of it, so we effectively get a mid-air jump from it, and it's enough to make the shortcut to the platform. Yes, it is glorious.

Since we aren't, the standard routine of warping you to the start of the next segment is instead called, and these two segment blocks do not coincide.

We didn't do that this run, since it's only 2 pixels/frame, and Ghost Fall uses the falling speed of 4 pixels/frame with zero speed once every 9 frames.

The jump may seem rather short to the wall, but if we get the maximum height, the game gets extremely laggy because of those bombs. This may look horribly slow, making the wall jump that low, but it's still better than any alternatives we looked at.

The enemy in the way up there can be destroyed with a flame shot, and on we go. An interesting path, but due to camera issues and the fact Flame Charge does not end until its 64 frame timer says so, ultimately makes the route a slower one.

Since none of the remaining weapons are even worth the 2 frames, here I am, selecting Stage 5 after 4, and if those 2 frames get me a frame rule, it's more than any other route can give.

So we're on a different fall cycle when the camera begins moving down, and as a result, we manage to reach the next segment just before we hit the part of the fall cycle with zero speed.

The fall cycle is simply that the falling animation loops every 9 frames, and 8 of those is falling 4 pixels, with 1 having 0 speed. Falling past the ladder, between the moment we can move to the right, and the moment we would land on the floor, there's enough time for 3 or 4 of these zero speed frames. When we say we just barely fall past, that's with the 4 frames of zero speed, and 3 frames doesn't give us enough time to move far enough right. The only way to change whether we get 4 frames or 3 is to adjust the height we begin our fall, so that's why the 9 frames of climbing down. All this, just so we avoid landing on the floor, and between the rather slow climb and skipping the landing, it's all for just 2 frames.

[p 
	"We need another barrier up. Chewing through barrier HP like mad, this stage. Like our last one, we fire a shot to get our shot counter up, run out of previous barrier before the shot goes away, and put up another barrier. This time, we need to get rid of the barrier sprite on the flame weapon, and we can't wipe off the sticky barrier residue on an enemy, as there aren't any convenient ones near our route. There is an animation timer that lets the game know what sprite to use next, so we wait until it would select sprite zero for the next flame animation frame. This gets rid of the sprite, which is good as otherwise we take a lot of lag just having it.

[p 
	"There is another floor we land on. It's just plain too far to reach its end before we fall to it. No Ledge Clip trickery above it we can take to go further right, and the flat floor doesn't allow for Ledge Clip on it. That bubble barrier we set up? We used the Muzzle Flash from it to delay the missile enemy to save one barrier HP. Our short dash gives us an opportunity to tweak our X position for odd-even position and a better camera.

	"Not too many details to talk about. The ground dashes between Flame Charges are pretty flexible with our timing, though that doesn't really help us get ammo drops. One flame charge has us begin Dash Ready before we jumped, then Flame Charge, then we get the dash after landing. This only worked because the 20 frame Dash Ready timer is frozen during Flame Charge (or any sort of player control lock).

I know, that bullet nearby us looks rather far when our Flame Charge ends, but trust us, when our charge ends, our invincibility is gone but we keep the massive hitbox for another few frames (0-3, but not at right timing for zero frames).

It is possible to pick a route earlier that gets us to 80 directly, but unfortunately, that takes us one pixel closer to a wall enemy, exactly within range for it to shoot and cause terrible lag.

Pointing this out because this boss has an invincibility move that takes a while, and there's no sneaking in a shot earlier by delaying the dialog or pause trickery and changing our first attack relative to this invincibility move.

Then we jump onto the ladder, get ourselves to a pixel perfect hieght, and dash left before the Dash Ready expires. The pixel perfect height lets us go past the wall and later walljump up it on the wrong side. Finally, the walljumps allow us to rise through the ceiling in that awkward spot. All this so we can save having to climb a ladder only to fall back down.

The 2 HP is important in the next segment, as we'll be too busy with Flame Charge to have a chance to charge the barrier.

There are no enemies before you are stopped by a breakable block. With a normal barrier up, you can't shoot, swap weapons, or pause. The barrier will never go away on its own. Good luck finding a way out! (Hint: Find a spot for Ledge Clip to escape)

The fact is that the dialog printing is ruled by the global timer, as opposed to enemies, bullets, etc. So while the menu is open, the dialog printing will continue progressing, while the boss timer will get paused. Thanks to this, we're able to delay the boss moves enough to hit him another time just before he is about to do his ninja teleporting. With this trick, we save 85 frames.

The flying enemies we use for the skip pick a direction to go based on our position relative to where they spawn, so we just need to be far enough right on our ascent. With one flying to the right, it's simply a matter of using that wall above us to get enough height and timing our Flame Charge. It appears unlikely to be able to get a projectile out to hit the enemy with perfect timing as we Flame Charge, so the Flame Charge itself is used.

It's all address 15F0, alright. This was because this lets us use Charged Spikeball on the earliest frame possible instead of waiting until we had a chance to jump up.
	$LF

	"After that initial hit, standard procedure. Smack boss with enough overflow damage early, and lodge bullets in boss on frames that invincibility wears off. There is a moment the boss uses whirlwind attacks, and there's enough objects to lag us even if we stand still. If we take a hit, we skip the laggy damage detection code and can reduce lag. We use the barrier to hide the damage, of course.

[p 
	"As for finishing the boss, we jump up the wall a little ways and hit the boss with the spikeball. The hit itself is delayed a few frames, and this was to bring the boss further up. We're on the wall to get higher up so the boss does not warp to its next position when it is hit. When the boss dies, it stays up there to explode. Far enough that the explosion particles instantly unload. As a result, we beam out earlier.

Overall, doing this gets us back only 4 ammo, but since it costs us zero frames, and it's not easy manipulating back laser ammo, we'll take that 4 ammo happily.

Only in the end stages are there spawns in the segment as we scroll. Although it automatically scrolls the camera to the right, moving left will still trigger spawns. In order to move left, we have to use the charged laser to break ourselves out of the door lock. So laser at door, move left when it would spawn something close enough, shoot at it before the boss speaks. Charged Star weapon is basically the only weapon that will reach far enough off-screen.

	"This wasn't a simple boss to skip, as it was the last one we figured out a skip for. There is an enemy on the ground before the door, who bounces back and forth between the walls rather quick. It will continue to exist if it stays on the right wall, even as the boss loads, but keeping it there is difficult, as most projectiles won't even exist out there. The strategy here was simply to move back left after triggering the door, and use basic shots and Muzzle Flash to delay the enemy. When the boss segment loads, a chunk of the wall goes away, and the enemy can approach further. While it still won't let the enemy come all the way into the room, it is now close enough for our basic shots to continue the job. Careful timing consideration was needed, particularly around the ouch timer and door's animation frame rule, but at least we didn't need anything fancy like using Spikeball rebound sprites to leave behind 0-damage "land mines."

It is used to reduce the intense lag around here. It has a few problems, though. It reduces the shot counter by 1 for every enemy it erases, quickly glitching it to negatives, and requiring a charged laser to clear it back to zero. The hitbox of this glitchy laser is very awkward, and some enemies are just too short to hit with it. Yes, when I say it erases anything, that includes the weakpoint of minibosses, and the bosses themselves. Unfortunately, it also erases the trigger that lets us actually advance the game, so it's no good against minibosses or bosses.

	"This stage is theoretically perfect, but then the theoretically perfect is proven to be beaten a few times. We met the dialog frame rule perfectly, so if there are more frames to save, we need another 8 to get any benefit. We have one frame delay at a ladder after the miniboss, due to some animation frame rule, but other than that, finding the other 7 frames should be difficult.

	"Another early stage with some crazy optimizations. With Arm Upgrade, Leg Upgrade (early from this stage), and the laser, there's a lot more possibilities. There may be better navigation between the capsule and miniboss, nothing else really comes to mind. Note that improvements here could have us start the next stage in 4 frame increments, due to the boss invincibility attack being right at that point where it could delay us.

	"Another stage tightly optimized. However, we have a pile of frames lost at the 8-frame dialog rule. Enough so that the path taken to speed up our climb after the miniboss is actually slower than an older route. Well, we save 4 *normal* frames at cost to 2 *lag* frames, and we lose all 4 *normal* frames to the frame rule, at -2 net. The laser used to glitch the shot count is laggy, so perhaps find a different enemy? Oh, and if we do find another 4 *normal* frames, even another 4 from out of Stage 7, then the laggy path will win out.

	"Oh, geez. I don't like thinking about the long "auto-scroller but not really" parts. Flame Charge is used generously, partly due to the fact there aren't a lot of flat ground to cover, and somehow we got the right item drops to avoid a pause screen. Note that improving earlier stages means we lose sync with the 32 frame cycle, and I'm not sure it is possible to maintain the time we have without the timing of the frame cycle we're on now. The route is extremely sensitive to ammo drops, and a good number of them can't even adjust their kill timings.

	"Most of the stage is pretty straight-forward. Well, except for the right-going segment just before the miniboss. And the left-going segment on the fall after. Before I go on to a huge list of things we missed that makes the stage very much not straight-forward, also note that ammo drops are important as well, which is one major problem these segments have to deal with. The boss has an invincibility attack, but the dialog frame rule is in full force here, as the boss attacks based on when it is cleared, not when the boss appears on the screen.

	"FatRatKnight was losing motivation around this point, and the horizontal segments are particularly unclear about the routing. Miniboss Skip was investigated here, but if there's some possibility we missed (don't say star weapon before Stage 6; this implies Stage 6 before Stage 6), the skip would save some time. There are 4 frames after this stage, lost at stage select because we wanted the remainder of the run to sync (32-frame item drop cycle).

	"Like with Stage 4, there are rather long horizontal segments that are supposed to be auto-scrollers, but aren't thanks to flaming trickery. Once again, it's difficult to find convenient measurement points in short increments that can readily declare one route or another as best. At least the lack of ground may reduce the possibile useful routes, but there's still some possibilities we probably missed. FatRatKnight was also getting tired out, too.

When I was starting to fade off from this project, he picked up the pieces I left and gave it more effort, and I moved from leading it to supporting it then.
