	"Each round requires 80% area cleared. Another way is to shoot the boss with special item. Mostly the fastest route is to manipulate RNG and get good item from the red block. Sometimes there is no red block, so you need to get lesser item from a grey block.

	"The best item is the weapon that can kill the boss with three hits. The weapon fires three shots at once, but it spreads wide so you need to be close to the boss. If there is no weapon available, then it is good to get the speed item or timestop from grey block. Some level has no items, so it is very difficult. One frame or one pixel can kill you.
