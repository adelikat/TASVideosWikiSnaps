	"The manipulation in this game works kind of like the A2600 version in the fact that you can throw drinks at nothing at the end of each round to somewhat manipulate the customers. The customers that stay and drink cannot be manipulated, which believe me I tried. But, the amount of customers that come in can be manipulated, and that's what I did in this movie. The manipulation saves quite a few frames over not manipulating and going-with-the-flow.
