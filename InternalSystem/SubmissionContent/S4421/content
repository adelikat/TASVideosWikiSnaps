[p 
	"This category isn't vaultable, so if the reception was good, it could be mooned, and then, after the "retreat glitch" version is done ultimately, it might have been obsoleted by it, if content is mostly similar (that can happen for different branches). Or they could both remain published, if different enough.

[p 
	"But right now, people don't have what to compare this run too, and also aren't sure they like this version. It very well can happen so that after the "retreat glitch" run is done (which doesn't need to be well received to be accepted, and which all hope to see) this branch is redone on a more professional level (if possible), and they finally like it!
