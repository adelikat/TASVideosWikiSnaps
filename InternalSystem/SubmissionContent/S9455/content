For reference, Jhynjhiruu went down to hit a hidden block and reveal a 1UP Mushroom, removing the flag from the pole; this is because the flag sprite occupies a secret sixth sprite slot, and only one sprite can occupy that slot. So if a power-up is revealed after first revealing the flag sprite, the flag will disappear; this also applies to vice versa and between two power-ups (since only one power-up can appear on the screen at a time).
