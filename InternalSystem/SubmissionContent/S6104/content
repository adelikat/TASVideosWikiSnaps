	"TowerFall Ascension is a multiplayer arena game first released on the Ouya by the name TowerFall in 2013, then later ported to other consoles and PC. The Dark World expansion pack was released two years later. While focusing on multiplayer, this game features a Trials mode where a single player must shoot targets. The present TAS completes all 48 trials of the game, including ones from Dark World expansion.

[p 
	"(Most of the tricks described here are taken from http://towerfall.wikidot.com/how-to-play )
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Dodge-slide
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"A standard ability, but very important for the following tricks. Pressing the Dodge button while ducking executes a Dodge-slide, which is an horizontal Dodge with a higher velocity than a normal Dodge.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Dodge Canceling
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The base of most tricks of the game is the ability to cancel a Dodge at any point by pressing the same or another Dodge button (Hyper Dash), or by jumping if the player is on the ground (jump-cancel). When Dodging, the player starts at a high initial speed, then it decreases rapidly. When a Dodge is canceled by another Dodge, the player keeps the Dodge speed, allowing him to move faster than running speed. A Dodge can be canceled on the first frame after the Dodge for the highest speed. A cancelled dodge also enters the cooldown period earlier, allowing the player to execute another Dodge earlier.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Super Jump
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"A Super Jump combines a dodge-slide with a jump-cancel. The player must perform a dodge-slide immediately followed by a jump-cancel. The added momentum from the dodge-slide will propel the player forward into the air a great distance.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Hyper Jump
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"A Hyper Jump is a Super Jump combined with a Hyper Dash. It's executed by performing a dodge-slide, followed immediately by a Dodge cancel, and then a jump. This method gives the highest momentum boost to the player allowing for jumps of huge distances. This is the best way to gain massive speed and launch yourself across the map, since slides are faster than dodges and air friction is lower than ground friction.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Hyper Wing
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"If a player possesses wings they can perform a technique that sees them fly rapidly upwards into the air. It is performed by jumping with wings when airborne followed immediately by an upwards Hyper Dash.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Air Aiming
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"During a Hyper Jump, holding the arrow button slightly decreases the air friction, but we loose the player control when aiming in the air.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Framerate choice
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Because of the Dodge cancel mechanics, the sooner you cancel the Dodge, the higher speed you gain. As a consequence, a higher framerate gives access to higher speed. The game does not lock the framerate, it depends either on your monitor refresh rate when vsync is on, or your computer processing power when vsync is off. The game engine supports high framerates without any problem. As an example, at a very high framerate (1000 fps), a Hyper Jump gives a velocity 15% higher than at 60 fps. So I decided to record this TAS at a framerate of 1000 fps. This value was chosen for multiple reasons. First, the increased velocity is negligible after around 300 fps. Also, the in-game timer is precise to the millisecond, and behaves correctly regarding frame advancing (advancing one frame always increases the timer by exactly one millisecond). This allows us to complete stages at the best precision displayed by the game.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Edit: I conducted more research on the framerate dependent speed. I took Twilight Spire II stage because you can do an hyper jump across the whole screen. For each framerate value, I performed an hyper jump to the right, using the following inputs: 
	[tt 
		"down+right+dash1, right+dash2, right+jump
	]tt
	", then I hold these last inputs until getting to the right wall. Before touching the right wall, I released and pressed jump again to buffer a wall jump. Then, I write down the in-game time of first frame of the wall jump animation. The obtained values are:
