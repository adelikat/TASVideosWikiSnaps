	"This is a run using Mega Man on Normal Difficulty. It utilizes a gecko code created by Delroth and Darkeye which allows quick weapon switching similar to Mega Man 10. For the purposes of this run, the code is ONLY used to provide a smoother viewing experience. An in-game time run without using the code would use the exact same strategies, but every weapon change would include a ~70 frame pause. After obtaining concrete shot, this would become incredibly jarring and unpleasant to watch.

[p 
	"The code isn't perfect, and there are some frames where it doesn't work or I need to change weapons faster than the code allows. For this, I still use the menu as normal.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Again, the code DOES NOT provide any gameplay advantages over a regular run. It's ONLY purpose is to enhance the entertainment. Whether this code bars it from acceptance is to be seen. I merely created this run because I said I would 4 years ago (http://tasvideos.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=7067&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=240) and I'm not one to be called a liar. :)

	"I will add that there is an improvement to be had if someone were to create a New Game+ of this run with maximum screws and buy an M-Tank before every stage.
	$LF
	"This would allow an extra full bar of concrete shot zips would could save up to a second on each stage. I chose not to do this and only visited the shot once before the Wily stages.
