	"Iji is an action-packed strategic platform shooter with a detailed story, large levels with multiple paths, powerful bosses and lots of secrets. There are alternate gameplay events, dialogues and scenes depending on what you do, a wealth of extras and bonus features, and seven stats to upgrade through a leveling system. Iji herself has superhuman strength and abilities, and can crack Nanotechnology, use her enemies' most devastating weapons against them, and be a pacifist or a killer - the story adapts to how you play.

	"Perhaps All Items is not the greatest name for this category, but 100% isn't accurate either, though it's about the closest thing to it you can do. The rule is that you need to collect all Ribbons, Posters and Supercharges. These are all optional, Ribbons and Posters don't give you any benifits but Supercharges give you 1 Skill point. I use Normal difficulty because on the game's hardest difficulty (Ultimortal), an All Items run is impossible because you cannot get most posters/supercharges since they require nanoweapons which you cannot get. On the Hard and Extreme difficulties, an All Items run would be far more time-consuming, due to required Nano farming and other factors, without a significant gain in difficulty under TAS conditions. This would result in a far less entertaining movie in comparison to one on Normal difficulty.
