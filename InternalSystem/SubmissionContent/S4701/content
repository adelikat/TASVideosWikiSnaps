	"This game is very difficult. The NPCs aren't just hard; they're on frictionless skateboards with a constant supply of steroids. Their speed regardless of their character choice tends to be a lot faster than if you were to choose the same character. The handicap that applies at the end is also ludicrous; Their score will get boosted up to

	"Given that this is a TAS, I sought to correct this, and end up with 13,378 points (and 15 more due to rank bonus) at the end. The HUD only displays up to 999, and the end maxes at 4,000, but it appears it still keeps track of it even above the "limit":

	"I'm rank 1 despite initially being 2nd place due to having over three times the score of the first NPC. I didn't chose Tony Hawk because despite him having the same speed, his acceleration made it a frame slower despite costing an extra frame to select Bucky. Your speed seems to be slower than the NPC's for some odd reason. Also any values above ~155 appears to be around the same speed.

	"Doing tricks constantly lag the game a bit, and that messes with the initial goal. So I had to delay my movements a bit every now and then to eliminate lag during the race. It resulted in rather....odd movements, so I to add some NPC assault without losing time.
