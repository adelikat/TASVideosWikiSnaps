The Clokkle (Elf) should only be equipped when upgraded from fusion elf to satellite elf because when using fusion elf a long time animation would be shown, and would deduct points. Upgrading it to satellite elf cost 200EC, so a lot of luck manipulation were required in the former 3 stages to get enough EC. With Clokkle (Elf) Zero could beat mid-boss in 3 turns of combo. The third combo in mid-boss fight Zero didn't get hit as what I do in last boss fight, so that there would be enough HP for the boss fight. In this stage and later 4 stages, Zero cannot kill lots of enemy due to lack of Buster Shot, so the scores for killing enemy were all 0/15 points.

The flame was also equipped at the same time for the next stage. The boss fight of this stage was complicated because Copy-X would go backward when got hit. So I manipulated to make the boss move close to the wall. The HP regeneration ability may be used when Copy-X's HP is lower than 50%, but it was conditional and the way to beat him in this run won't let him regenerate HP. The best situation was that Zero and Copy-X were at a specified position in the end, but the combos used in boss fight required the boss to stay close to the wall, thus the best situation cannot be reached.

In this stage Zero got a disk containing Quick Charge (Head). In boss fight I manipulated the boss to move forward. During the second turn of combos I opened the menu and equipped Buster Shot, and the combination of Normal (Head) + Light (Body) + Quick (Foot), which was used in the next stage.

The steels at the end of mid-stage also changed because of going through former part faster (the position of the steels is only determined by how much time passed after the stage started), and this saved more time.

The Gigantic Elevator part of this stage contained a lot of enemies with a shield, which should only be killed by charged Recoil Rod, thus this combination saved much time. The mid-boss is really special: he had very high HP and when he got hit and tilted back, the damage he took will be doubled.

The hitbox of the former 2 forms of the final boss was in the mid-air, thus even the boss was not weak to ice, adding BlizzrdArrow into the combo still saved much time. In the second form Biraid (Elf) worked: Zero could use SmashSlash in the combos and wouldn't fall down into the pit, thus the number of turns of combos was decreased from 6 to 4.
