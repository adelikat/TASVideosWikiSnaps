	"The extremely long autoscroller at the end was originally played through normally and only sped to the end when it was a straight path. This was good and all but it could have been walked through from the very beginning. I worked out a way in the end that I probably overcomplicated but it worked so I'm satisfied and I wasn't able to improve it so that's even better. There is a moment about halfway through where the wolf stops for a frame and then continues walking. This is because it ended up stuck in a pit being tormented by a flame enemy if it just kept walking right the entire time. I'm unsure why this is but just letting go of R for one frame seemed to fix it.
