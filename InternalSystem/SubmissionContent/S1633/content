	"The main improvement is a better strategy, where more lines are completed at once. Initially, I was about 10 seconds faster, but then I noticed the number of blocks the level started with was an odd number, so it wasn't possible to clear all lines. This was very frustrating. It did mean that the actual number of blocks that you start out with was also manipulatable, which could be used in my advantage too. This is why in this movie, the tetris at the end actually clears four lines. Due to this, my second attempt was faster than my first, ending up with a 11.68 second improvement.
