	$LF
	"Being even crueler than its SNES predecessor and with the difficulty locked to maximum, Arthur once again sets out to get princess Prin Prin back in record time.

	"This is a TAS of the game's Arrange Mode. Between each stage, we get to choose between three stages: A normal stage from the base game, a new stage based on other Ghouls games or a more difficult version of the base game stages. The arrange stages are the shortest path through the game conveniently enough for your viewing pleasure.
	$LF
	"Also... the developers decided to lock the difficulty to professional in this mode, as if the stages weren't evil enough already!

	"Some basics:
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" Arrange mode is a one loop playthrough, unlike the base game which is of course a two loop game.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Which stages we can select on the map screen depends on armor status. Green armor is enough to go the middle route (arrange stages) and gold armor is needed for the top route (hard variation stages). Anything less and we're forced going the bottom route (normal stages).
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Jumping is faster than walking, so we'll be doing that as much as possible. Arthur's double jump has the same speed as walking, however.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Jumping from a crouching position carries some properties from the crouch into the jump. For example, shots come out lower and Arthur's hitbox is smaller for sprite collision purposes (but not for collision with terrain).
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Chest contents depend on Arthur's current armor (or lack thereof).
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" The Goddess' bracelet, which is necessary to finish the game, is obtainable from the start in this mode.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Bracelet damage tapers off over time. Better armor makes it faster, essentially letting you pack a punch even at longer ranges.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Although the ported stages tend to lag less than the SNES game, some of the arrange stages have incredibly laggy sections.

	"The bracelet takes time to spawn and there's a spot in stage 1 where I have to wait anyway.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"The dagger has been indirectly nerfed in Arrange Mode. The new bosses have a few i-frames on hit, which really hurts the "2 damage / frame" magic cast.

	"The bracelet is also just really strong and decimates the new bosses before they can take many actions.
