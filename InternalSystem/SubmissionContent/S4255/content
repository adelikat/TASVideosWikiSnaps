	"It's Kangaroo, again. A lot faster, too. Super quickly after the first publication, too. I love you guys. 2290 frames faster than the published TAS.

	"Kangaroo takes some Kangaroids and demolishes the game. This TAS is much quicker than the previous. This is because a new bug is abused. Pressing down+left+right causes the kangaroo to fall through the ground. He eventually wraps around to the top of the screen. This allows us to skip pretty much each level. Now the game is completed super quickly. To all the people who liked the previous submission because the game was from their childhood, uh... sorry.

	"In this level, you die if you're in midair, which is why we have to land on that one platform. Also, moving left at the start is to avoid being killed by an apple on the top floor when we do the warp.
