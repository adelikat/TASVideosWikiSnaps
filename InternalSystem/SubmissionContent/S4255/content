	"Kangaroo takes some Kangaroids and demolishes the game. This TAS is much quicker than the previous. This is because a new bug is abused. Pressing down+left+right causes the kangaroo to fall through the ground. He eventually wraps around to the top of the screen. This allows us to skip pretty much each level. Now the game is completed super quickly. To all the people who liked the previous submission because the game was from their childhood, uh... sorry.
