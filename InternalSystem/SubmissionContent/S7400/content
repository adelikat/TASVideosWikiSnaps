	"Ford Simulator III is a vehicle simulation game from 1992 that was published by Ford Motor Company and developed by The SoftAd Group. This software lets you browse Ford's catalog and order a new car built to your specifications. Of greater interest nowadays is the Driving Simulator portion of the software, in which you pick a vehicle and drive to your family vacation in Lake Wakatonka. In order to do so, you must drive like a complete psychopath, endangering yourself and everybody on the road - but make sure you slow down when cops are around!

	"You have a broad choice of cars, ranging from daily drivers like a Lincoln Town Car all the way up to the Ford Mustang. I choose the Ford Taurus SHO because it has slightly better speed than the Mercury Capri XR2. This one has a manual transmission, so I must change gears myself with the spacebar.

	"Speeding up optimally is a matter of changing gears at the right time, which isn't too difficult to do. For some reason, the 3rd gear gives you really great acceleration, so once you top out at 105 MPH you should switch to 5th gear.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The steering system is not very precise - there are only a small number of steering wheel angles available. Steering straight or one slot to the left or right will result in normal acceleration, but any sharper angles will result in a slight slowdown. Sometimes this is necessary for sharp curves, since going offroad will result in a much more significant speed loss.

You can tell they're coming up behind you if you hear sirens, or you can see their cruisers in the oncoming lane. Thankfully, they can be easily manipulated away with a little movement variation - or, alternately, they just don't bother pulling you over. Maybe they know they can't catch up? I don't know.
