	"Mortal Kombat is a game that needs no introduction. This is the game that made parents worry about the media, and probably caused all that video games make people violent stuff. I chose to run the Genesis version because it's the one I played a lot when I was younger. I was initially going to play as Rayden, but I chose Johnny Cage instead.

	"When I was playing MK1 Genesis again, I noticed that Rayden could just keep ramming himself into the enemy with his torpedo attack for an easy win with almost no punishments. I initially wanted to record a TAS of said torpedo ramming, but then I thought, "No one actually wants to watch Rayden slamming into his opponent for 20 minutes."

	"Let me give a sort of basic rundown of what's happening. Basically, I'm trying to manipulate what the opponent will do (I know, shocker) for my benefit. This can be achieved by throwing fireballs randomly, or walking away from the opponent, for example. What I'm trying to manipulate is the opponent throwing a projectile at me. Every character has a projectile move in this game, and by getting them to throw it, they leave themselves vulnerable for, say, an aerial kick. That's usually what I try to do, but sometimes I do other things for entertainment purposes.

	"I encourage more people to try TASing MK1, as I found this very fun to make. Maybe make a JC TAS with the Crotch Punch, or without the Blood Code. Also, improvements could be made by not bothering with Test Your Might (something I completely forgot about), starting matches on the first frame possible, and better manipulation.
