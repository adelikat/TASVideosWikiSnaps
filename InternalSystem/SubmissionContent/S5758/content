	"a Nintendo Licensed game that wasnt made by Nintendo.  During a time when other companies were able to make Mario games, most of these games were educational. howver this game has more of a platforming element to it, making this more of a game than an educational game.

	": After many discussions surrounding educational games in general and a few other recent submissions in particular, we now have a more clear concept of what should be expected of a game with educational components. At a first glance, this game looks pretty fine, with gameplay consisting of some platforming action with a Mario Bros.-style minigame to collect items, a time machine to go to different eras, and brief platforming levels to bring the items to. However, once you really start playing the game, you find out that this gameplay is really a side component to the educational time travel goals. The player cannot take damage or die whatsoever, eliminating all challenge to the Mario Bros. segments or platforming segments. The Mario Bros. segments are simplistic and repetitive in themselves, and the platforming stages are very short and uneventful. Even the final Bowser fight literally cannot be lost at all. All the challenge is put upon bringing the objects to their correct times, helped by making use of the educational clues. Considering this general makeup of the game, I consider the educational history lessons to be the primary game aspect of this game, with the platforming only taking on a secondary role in the player's quest.
