	"The first of the three Donkey Kong Land games for the Game Boy. While DKL2 and DKL3 are both similar to their SNES versions, DKL has practically nothing in common with DKC. And in this game you can just as well use Donkey Kong, as both monkeys are equally fast. There is an enemy boost (Krushapult) you can do with Diddy Kong. But because of the time it takes to switch characters, it didn't end up being useful.

	"The first roll you make in a stage is a slow one, unless you start the roll when landing from a jump, falling out from a bonus does not work. After that first roll, all of the following rolls will have the same speed as running. However, the first and last frame of the roll, your speed is 0. Rolling is therefor avoided quite frequently

	"Jumping/falling is slow compared to running. Though if you jump on an enemy, your speed will be the same as running. Bouncing on enemies is often used to avoid jumping up cliffs normally or having to roll down a cliff, to avoid the two frames with speed 0.

	"When you are on an animal, your speed stays the same whenever you are running or jumping. Using them is almost always faster because of that. Sadly they aren't kept after going through a bonus stage.

	$LF
	"You never have to finish the bonus stage. It's usually faster to just commit suicide and get back as fast as possible. Though because of the death animation, when you don't jump down into a hole, quite often it's faster to run to the exit instead.
