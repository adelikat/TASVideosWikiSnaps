	"He must use these bombs and other things located on each island to help him clear the bombs so he can proceed to the next island.
	$LF
	"An island has a single red detonator bomb, which must be grouped alongside other bombs in the level by pushing the bombs (excluding ones planted in the ground) before lighting the detonator bomb, which allows for all the bombs to explode and destroy the island.

	"As the player advances, additional hazards are added to make the game more challenging, such as moving platforms, spikes coming through the ground, and slippery surfaces that prevent him from pushing bombs across. After each island is cleared the player has given a password which consists of five playing cards.

	"I looked up Rayquaza911's Speedrun of the game on Youtube and analyzed it thoroughly. Already at the 3rd stage i managed to find a better way to execute the stage, i believe i managed to save around 5+ steps. When tasing the stages i would always look at his run to see how he would execute the stage, and look for potential flaws.

	"Kid Klown Bot can be accessed through the Menu and by selecting "Help". The game will present you with an example on how to clear the stage. Kid Klown Bot is perfect, he will always go for the least amount of steps necessary to clear the stage and the less steps you need to clear the stage = the faster it is.
	$LF
	"At some point i was doubting Kid Klown Bot and did some testing with my own routes, he really is perfect down to the last frame. The game gets really hard to optimize in the last stages because of the hundreds of steps required to clear the stage, mistakes can quickly add up.

[div class=p 
	"Kid Klown Bot is not 100% perfect however in a speedrun sense, sometimes he will take damage, use slippery tiles and more which is most of the time slower than moving from tile to tile. So for levels that have a lot of damageboosts and slippery movement i had to come up with new routes and movement to save more time over Kid Klown Bot.

	"Getting run over by a bomb also takes ~3s. Taking damage from spikes is a few frames slower than walking from tile to tile, so this run takes as less damage as possible.
