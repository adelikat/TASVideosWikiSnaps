	"This is my very first TAS, and it's pretty to the point on what goes on. One thing you will need to know is what a buttslap is. This is an extra ollie (or ollies) that happen when you ride off a ledge, do a grab trick or a flip trick, and mash ollie. Triple buttslaps are the average most that people can do, although very, very few can do a quad every now and then. It is a very hard trick at first, but it's basically nothing once you get it down.

	"Similar to Warehouse from THPS1 in the design of the right side, this is the FASTEST level in this TAS. Credit to Unpro for telling me to jump off the high rail and do the Benihana then. I didn't think it would work at first with how everything was placed, though after going through with it I found it to be faster than what I previously did before. 13 seconds faster, to be exact.

	"Glad to see more THPS speedrunners getting into TASing. I've enjoyed the THPS runs that have come in, this being no exception. However, there are some glaring issues I've noticed while judging the run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"First off, there are a couple instances where there are no menu actions being done for several seconds. These are obvious optimization issues which aren't being done for RNG manipulation and generally take away from the run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Secondly, it seems like there is some questionable movement and route decisions which makes the run feel sloppy and not optimal.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Finally, this run can be easily improved upon. To prove this, with about an hour of work, I was able to improve the very first level 
	[a class=extlink href=https://youtu.be/hpfD0svnUTU rel=nofollow 
		"by two seconds
	]a
	". This doesn't bode well for the other levels. If I can find improvements in such a short time, it should be possible for you to do so as well.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There are some nice technical tricks during the run, but overall, the lack of optimization has proven to be its downfall. The beauty of TASes is in how it makes the humanly impossible look easy. It also allows for creativity in routing and movement which would otherwise be missing in normal runs. Become willing to try new ideas out and break from the normal bounds of speed running.

[p 
	"Don't be discouraged by my comments above, I hope to see more runs from you in the future. I'm definitely willing to assist you with your potential next submission. With everything said, I'll be rejecting this run for the reasons stated above.
