	"-Jaws is the easiest and one of the shortest games on the planet. When you're not dropping cannonballs on dancing jellyfish you're shooting harpoons at a 30' shark who lives in an ocean about the size of the castle at the bottom of my goldfish tank. With lame animation, no story, and three (three!!!) enemies, it makes me wonder why I wasted my time, but it's about as exciting as watching the movie series, if you've never seen the movies and someone lies to you.

	"-The hardest part about Jaws is keeping yourself from seeing the repeating Final Fantasy-ish "You've Hit Something!" when wandering around the map screen, hence the slight delays after the bonus stage. 100% kills are necessary for a fast time because, for example, if a sting-ray shoots past the diver and goes off-screen, he'll emerge a few inches higher going the opposite direction, and the session lasts as long as the enemies are alive. Therefore, the fastest dispatch of all enemies provides the least amount of time underwater. Two sessions and the bonus stage are required to collect enough shells to acquire the receiver and power up two levels. It is impossible to beat Jaws in one underwater session with a power level less than three, and if you don't take him out in one session, he revives four life bars. I tried the game with a power level of two and it took four sessions to take out Jaws - much faster to just get that power-up. Furthermore, I collected the mini-sub which boosted the final time by more than 30 seconds over just using the diver and harpoons.
