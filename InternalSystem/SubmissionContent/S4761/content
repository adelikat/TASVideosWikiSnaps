	"Well this run came a long way very rapidly, being now over 1:30 faster then the published run. After Arc mentioned several new potential clips, I started from scratch and after staring at the map for a while discovered a new key first route that saves additional time as well. Brute forcing wall clips made them much faster, and as well as allowed for getting the key falling straight through the floor.

	"Big thanks to Arc for really putting a lot of thought into routing and different clip potential that I initially wrote off as being too slow, which in turn forced me to learn to automate rerecords for the first time. I think this run contains around 500000 rerecords now.
