	"Well this run came a long way very rapidly, being now over 1:30 faster then the published run. After Arc mentioned several new potential clips, I started from scratch and after staring at the map for a while discovered a new key first route that saves additional time as well. Brute forcing wall clips made them much faster, and as well as allowed for getting the key falling straight through the floor.

	"Big thanks to Arc for really putting a lot of thought into routing and different clip potential that I initially wrote off as being too slow, which in turn forced me to learn to automate rerecords for the first time. I think this run contains around 500000 rerecords now.

	"It was quite fun to make this run and make new discoveries. Most of my runs up to now were just applying known improvements or very linear games, it was nice to take a really fresh look at a game.

	"I don't think there is a faster route, but possibly with more cpu time slightly faster clips can be found, but not by much.

	"I had also found a time saving trick in the first waterfall that could be used to improve a real time run, but it didn't make it into the final run.
