	"The above video contains commentaries as subtitles. Also, you may notice that the time in the video differs from the submitted time. This TAS was done on an older version of libTAS. Resyncing to the current one resulted in loosing 29 frames. I was lazy to redo a full encode.

	$LF
	"As a consequence, slashes and relics are usually done in the air, and are canceled with Shovel Knight lands by jumping again. It also allows to chain slashes by canceling a slash after it hits by a jump and starting another slash instantly.

	"Ubuntu 18.04 is stable, so we're fine, but I found out there's no easy way to even run libTAS on stable Debian (Stretch), because it depends on packages only available for Buster+. But Ubuntu happens to use packages from Debian Sid, which are considered unstable for Debian, though apparently stable for Ubuntu. Installing packages from Sid to Stretch also works, but it requires some surgery, and I wouldn't want to accept a movie if it only ran with unstable dependencies. Anyway, since coincidentally unstable Debian packages are stable for Ubuntu, we're fine.
