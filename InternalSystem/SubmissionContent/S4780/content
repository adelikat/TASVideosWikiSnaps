It's one of the first two-players games I've ever actually played with a second player, it's one of the first games I've ever actually beaten, and it's definitely the first game I've played that was named after a form of movement and a bladed weapon. It was developed by Horisoft, which sounds less like a company and more like a Las Vegas brothel, and it was published by a company that would go on to become one of my favorite game companies ever: Atlus. Horisoft would later go on to make classics, such as:

	"The currently published run of Sprint Scimitar was my first honest TAS effort, which is why it's really not a very good run. This improvement has, technically, been in the works since shortly after that first run was published. I've got copies of my old improvement run dating back to late 2011. So if you count really long hiatuses and generally not caring too much, this is a run almost 4 years in the making. Directly comparing frame counts of the two runs, this run is 1915 frames faster than the published run, and 289 frames faster than the old improvement run (up to where it ends at least). Every stage is improved over the published run by at least 3 seconds.

The camera is on a fixed track, and won't move in a certain direction unless it hits certain points first. When you move, the camera moves with you. When you run, it moves faster. By wiggling back and forth while running, I can trick the camera into moving at running speed while staying still. This helps the camera catch up to me at points where I'm near the edge of the screen. This also works with vertical camera movement by wiggling back and forth on slopes!

Jumping a frame earlier may change a boss's pattern, while moving farther away or behind the boss may influence them to use a better attack or to move into a more favorable position. Bosses are usually invulnerable for 50 frames after every attack, but certain attacks may mess with their hitbox in a way that leaves them invulnerable a few frames longer, so it's important to manipulate these bosses into not using those certain attacks.

Hard has less item drops and the enemies move a little bit faster, and that's pretty much it. It's barely noticeable. I've always been under the impression that the hardest difficulty is only preferred if it significantly changes the way the run is presented: For example, enemies doing more damage might mean less damage boosts, or more careful health management/luck manipulation. Enemies having more health might leads to longer, more satisfying boss fights. One hit kills means more excitement by dancing around each and every killing blow.

	"The Abomination fight (second to last boss) was heavily improved thanks to Omnigamer's LUA script letting me know precisely how the boss worked: The bottom head of the boss is only vulnerable once the top two heads are destroyed, so I prioritize killing the top head ASAP, as it has more health. The bottom head doesn't actually start taking damage until a number of frames after the top head is killed, so I make sure to leave the bottom head vulnerable and hit it on the first frame it's able to take damage. Alongside that, the actual final boss was significantly improved as well thanks to me actually caring about it. The RTA strategy for Hard difficulty is used here for convenience, as it allows me to hit the core every 50 frames with a little bit of leeway. I don't need to hit the head as often as I do, but I like to think of it as revenge for how badly this fight went in the published run. That's right. I am the final boss.
