	"Completely different level when compared to the original game. A framerule could only be saved if 10 more frames were saved somewhere. There (sadly) happens to be no way to face left when exiting the "pipe" and therefore there is no way to accelerate faster. There may be some way of saving 1 frame when accelerating in the underground room and possibly 1 frame could be saved from a slightly faster flagpole glitch, but it would change nothing since the framerule barrier is much further away than 2 frames.

The framerule for 1-2 is far enough away that you can change your strategies or lower your speed for a few frames to add entertainment. You will notice I opt to go for the slower pipe clip method. This is for one reason, which will be explained in the 4-2 comments.

I will be doing some testing in the next few days to see if it is possible to bypass the lift by using the roof. So far, there is no other way to progress through the level. Since there is no floor, I cannot perform a flagpole glitch. I slow down before hitting the flagpole to enable the timer to count below 276 (which gives 6 fireworks and loses a LOT of time)

	"The hack of this game has one flaw when performing glitches. The subpixel values are slightly different which means performing glitches is increasingly difficult if not impossible. Since the 4-2 wallclip is so early on in the level, I had not enough time to alter my subpixels to match the values needed to perform the trick properly and so you see a 1-framerule slower method being performed, which ultimately looks more entertaining, since you pass from a floor to the one above. This subpixel flaw is also a problem in 1-2, where I opt to take the slower pipe clip. Since the pipe is far enough at the end of the level, there 
	[em 
		"probably
	]em
	" is a way to perform the trick, but since it loses no time and (in my personal opinion) it looks cleaner, I didn't spend extra time attempting the advanced method.

	"It would be nice to see a way to complete 4-1 without needing to use the lift to progress through the level, but I will be testing this and it will be confirmed within the next few days whether it is possible to avoid the lift or not. It would also be great if you can perform bullet bill glitch in 8-2 without Mario falling out of the stage, but I don't think that'll ever happen. If someone found a way to perform the wallclip in 4-2 properly, then a framerule (0.35s) would be saved. Other than that, I really enjoyed making this TAS and I am extremely satisfied with this movie, and hope to start working on the warpless category very soon after testing the 4-1 theory.
