	"Well, I managed to get a good RTA time in normal speedruning which is 7:00.22 as of 28th Nov 2016, but after watching the TAS by AnS and trying to inspiring some good strats from it, I found that it also needs some other improvements, and the first one which is really obvious is in Walrus, as it is possible to beat it only like 5 cycles unlike in the current run that took a full 6 cycles which saves like around 3 seconds, and that gave me the idea to do a tool-assisted for this game. Not only that major time saved noted above was found but also there are some minor optimizations here and there in the run like grabing the shell to kill fishes without shooting bubbles on them which saves more frames, and good every boss fight. Overall, this run succeded on improving the current run by 426 frames or 7.09 sec
