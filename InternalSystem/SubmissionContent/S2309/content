	"When you see this movie, I think you will share my view that the theme of this game clearly is about chocolate, cake, pencil, A B C letters and stuff like that :) I think the creators of this game really wanted to make this a "joyful" and pleasant game for young children.
	$LF
	"I decided to TAS this game as its one of my childhood gaming memories and I think it makes a decent effort for submission. It was fairly easy to TAS this game. Mickey's somewhat slow starting momentum was sometimes slightly annoying. As far as I am concerned, there arent many tricks involved in this game other than the ladder trick and 1-frame zipping. The ladder trick involves having a ladder up at the screen and where you can jump high and grab the ladder's highest point. Once the screen has stopped scrolling upwards, you can stand on a ladder and jump on it and reach the nearest platform instead of climbing. Some parts may seem slow but I tested many different approaches without succeeding. Someetimes I was annoyingly 1 or 2 pixel away from reaching certain platforms earlier.

	"All in all, it was a pleasant experience for me.

	": I am taking the liberty of 1) putting in version in the ROM name, because this movie only syncs on V1.1, and 2) cancelling this movie, since Angerfist has said he will redo it and possible improvements were posted in the submission thread.
