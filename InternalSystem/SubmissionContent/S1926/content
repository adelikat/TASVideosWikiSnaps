	"It is 5929 frames (98.8 seconds) faster.

[p 
	"This comes from better optimization, and new tricks, but also from the use of Fang instead of Browny.  I also change to the J version of the rom (just like the "bad ending" movie) which accounts for some of frame savings.

[p 
	"This is a 1 player movie.  The reason I did not use 2 player is because it would (unfortunately) be slower.  The reason is that with 2 players on the screen, each one's weapons does less damage.  The weapon most affected by this is Fang's D weapon which, unfortunately, is the most powerful weapon in the game (and the one used almost exclusively).

	"Fang is the undisputed TAS champion of Hard Corps.  The reason is due to a D weapon glitch.  
	$LF

[p 
	"His D weapon does 30 dmg per frame, but normally takes 90 frames to charge.  Normally this balances it out some and makes it not the best weapon choice in terms of dmg/frame.  But, if you select the B weapon, shoot, then select the D weapon, it will deliver a fully charged shot!  This negates the 90 frame charge completely.  This results in turning bosses into mince meat :)

[p 
	"This one might be controversial but I chose the J ROM because the characters have HP.  This allows me to take damage to save time in a few spots.  It also means many of the cutscenes are shorter due to the use of Japanese characters (though several are longer).  I didn't test exactly, but I would estimate that the text differences add up to about 10-15 seconds.

[p 
	"1) Sliding off ledges to save time.  Sliding off a ledge cancels out the slide recovery which saves a good bit of time.  By holding no direction keys while sliding off a ledge it keeps your sliding speed.  By holding left just before sliding off you can land back on for 1 frame and slide again, this allows you to slide off with full momentum!  All of this makes sliding profitable whenever it can be done.

[p 
	"2) Luck manipulation.  The poles in level 1 and the dinosaur's shots in level 4 are random.  I manipulated both to give me the best possible scenario (that I could find).
