		" Main objective here is to show an alternate way to complete all levels in the unlicensed version of Felix the Cat, especially in levels 1 and 7 where you normally have to beat the boss in order to finish them. This method implies exploiting a glitch where if the player is close to go off-screen to the right, it'll autofinish the level.

	"How the 'glitch' method was used in the movie: basically the player requires timed jumps while moving forward, plus using the attack button while jumping in most cases. As long as it is done properly (by avoiding walls where possible), it'll place the player at a farther distance than the normal centered position, slowly reaching the right border of the screen. In the case of levels 2, 3 and 6, it also requires jumping over the horizontal-moving log until most of the front sprites are very close to the border.

	": While this is an improvement over your first submission, it is not quite up to the optimization standards that we are looking for. Your TAS contains slowdowns that could have easily been avoided to save time. For that reason, this TAS must be rejected. Better luck in the future.
