Ordinarily, the game will push you off the block afterwards and you'll begin falling. However, if you alternate left and down inputs, Dana won't register as falling, even though the Y-position slowly increases. Importantly, you can also still jump from this state. Here, I use the glitch to get the key and jump back up afterwards. Also gets the warp feather to skip ahead to room 29.
