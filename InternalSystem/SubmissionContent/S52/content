	"This time I made Power Blade. Arc had it on his idea-list and also it´s a kinda care free action game. Due to a cool glitch on some bosses I saved a lots of time.

	"This game was alot harder and longer then I expected it to be. I also played on expert mode cus it should be cooler. Im not really sure what the difference between normal and expert is but I assume it´s  more enemies on expert. The enemies also caused me some problems. I don´t know why but I had a hard time to choose wether I should avoid them or take some damage. I think I did the best of every situation and this is the result. Also, like in many other games I have to jump in most situations  because else the character stops. In some cases it was better to stop for 0.4 seconds or whatever for various reasons, enemy positions etc.

	"Also I avoided hamburgers for 2 reasons, I shouldn´t need energy (and I don´t) and they take some time to pick up. This resulted in a little delay in stage 6. If you got any suggestion im thankful but I think this is the fastest possible way to complete it.
