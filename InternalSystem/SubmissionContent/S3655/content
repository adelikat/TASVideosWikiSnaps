	"This is the third version of my Metroid Fusion 100% TAS. My testing was much more rigorous and I looked for creative solutions. The in-game completion time is 55 minutes and 28 seconds. This beats the previous version's in-game time by 3030 frames or 47 seconds (an in-game second is 64 frames). Because I aimed for in-game time, I opted to pause the game in order to manipulate luck, as the in-game timer does not run on the pause screen. I placed most of the pauses right before door transitions, so as not to detract from the flow of the run. One thing I've learned: shinesparks are slow. This run features several less shinesparks than the previous. The reason for this is that shinesparks have a delay both while Samus is "charging" it and once she has hit something.
