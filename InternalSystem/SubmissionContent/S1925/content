	"Run Saber is a pretty blatant rip-off of Strider, by Horisoft. It's still a lot of fun for that. Basic plot is that aliens have taken over the Earth, and the Run Sabers, two genetically enhanced soldiers, are the planet's only hope. This TAS, using Alow (the male Run Saber) clears the game in 14min 54.50sec, with input ending at frame 53670 and the final hit connecting 3 frames after.
