	"Jungle Hunt is a home console port of the classic Taito arcade game. Released in 1983 for the Atari 2600, it was a rather faithful port of the original arcade game, with almost all of the elements carying over to the system. With the games simplicity came much difficulty, jumping from rope to rope, killing alligators (looks a lot more like punching), avoiding boulders, and jumping over cannibals isn't easy. Jungle Hunt was generally well-received and is arguably one of the best games on the Atari 2600.

	"Jungle Hunt was rather simple in terms of completion. The patterns are pretty much exactly the same during each scene, so there isn't much luck manipulation that goes into this run. I also haven't really found any glitches in this game so far. But I believe this marks a beginning point in Jungle Hunt TASing on this platform.

	"The boulders were a bit more of a challenge, but the RNG was forgiving and didn't give me very many large boulders. When the large boulders did come, they were a little tricky to jump over. I had to get the explorer's X coordinates just right in order to get over the boulders. This was also one of the few points where I could entertain the viewer, mainly moving left and right in random sequence. I didn't think about ducking much, though.
