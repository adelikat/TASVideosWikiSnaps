	"Samlaptop PM'd me some time ago to tell me about the death delay trick. At that time I was inclined to only run SNES games, but since I was having some trouble with one of my SNES runs I decided to take a break and include the new trick on Oddworld. And as always, I hope you enjoy.

Combining it with the above trick and Abe will jump/fall backwards. While jumping he will pass through any wall in the game, also, Abe can survive any size drop because the game just thinks he's doing a simple jump up & down.
