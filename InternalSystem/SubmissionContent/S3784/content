	"This is an improvement of 3326 frames over my published run; http://tasvideos.org/3268S.html . The improvement comes from a new glitch, the death delay trick, and some small optimizations.

	"Samlaptop PM'd me some time ago to tell me about the death delay trick. At that time I was inclined to only run SNES games, but since I was having some trouble with one of my SNES runs I decided to take a break and include the new trick on Oddworld. And as always, I hope you enjoy.

	"Normally when you're rolling along, if you release the directional pad for one frame and hold it again Abe unroll out into a walk, but if you press to turn the other way just when Abe wants to unroll he'll suddenly stop & turn. Combining it with the above trick and Abe will jump/fall backwards. While jumping he will pass through any wall in the game, also, Abe can survive any size drop because the game just thinks he's doing a simple jump up & down.
