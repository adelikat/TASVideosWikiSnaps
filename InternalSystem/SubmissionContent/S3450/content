	"When I saw XTREMAL93's attempt on the submission feed I noticed quite a few moments where it looked that the run could be improved. When others commented on the low re-record count and noted the same flaws I did I decided to make a test run to prove it to myself. Upon my first attempt I managed to save 36 frames within the first 36 seconds and recognized that there was going to be much time to save in the run.

	"In the end, I managed so save at least two frames on each "scene" (from fade to black to the next fade to black) and in many cases saved many seconds in each segment.

[p 
	"In most levels the time was saved from better timing of jumps so that momentum was not lost and limit the number of full stops that were necessary to avoid enemies. Another major time saver was far improved boss fights through both new schemes to get hits in quicker and more frequently and simply optimizing existing strategies.

	"Attempts were made at trying to improve the down time during the run where not action was taken but in many cases the entertaining aspects I tried to implement added to lag during cutscenes so they were removed. In a few other scenes, like in the elevator and after the bosses, it appears that my character remains stationary by choice but in fact control of the character is removed during those scenes.

	"I was not sure on the protocol for improving on movies that were still in the submission queue. It appeared that others agreed that the other movie was not up to TASVideos standards. I tried to encourage canceling the submission and having XTREMAL93 improving and resubmitting. It did not seem that there was going to be a response to this request so I just did the run myself and here are the results.

	"Finally thanks to XTREMAL93 for your first run which helped greatly with the route planning for this run.
