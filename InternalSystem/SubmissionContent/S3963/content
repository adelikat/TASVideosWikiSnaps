	"In my honest opinion, this is one of the worst fighting games ever made, if not the worst. Everything about the game is a travesty. From the unresponsive controls to the horrendous presentation to the piss-poor enemy A.I. to the slowdown to the random freezes, the game manages to suck in practically every aspect imaginable. It's even worse than Mortal Kombat Advance, and that's saying a lot.

	"I'm having strong doubts if you could ever make a good, entertaining playaround for this game - starting from the fact that it's torture to experience any part of it with any of your senses - but at least a speed-TAS of it is mercifully short. A large part of the run's brevity comes from a glitch in Scorpion's teleport punch, doing multiple times the damage it should if you're close enough to your opponent. A fight can at best end in only three hits. However...

	"A fast fight also needs something more. For one, the teleport punch damage varies due to the bizarre hit detection this game has. I couldn't always help it. Also, you need to take some damage per round to prevent the "Flawless Victory"-message from showing up, which wastes over 2 seconds each time. So, enemies had to be manipulated to quickly hit you at some point during the barrages of teleport punch.

	"As for manipulation techniques, I mostly used blocking and d-pad presses after a teleport punch. Another way to manipulate things is to wait frames in the Kombat Kode-screen before a fight starts. I found I had the most difficulties in manipulation in the first two fights.

	"This run is admittedly not perfect, but I think it is good enough for a first-edition TAS. It's a great improvement in strategies and precision over my test TAS, at least.

	": This is such an awful game people especially enjoyed the shortness of its run. Wow. The submission met 66% of Yes votes unexpectedly. However, this is not enough of a gap to get to Moons (people are uncertain if this content is
