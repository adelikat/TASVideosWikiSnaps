Apparently the story varies slightly on the different releases.

	"After submitting my first run, I was pointed to a youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Itq_MVTCXuk of the Japanese version (Kyorochan Land).  That video used some slightly different routes than my original.  This submission uses some routing from this run, so credit to that runner for finding faster routes.  There are differences between the Japanese and US versions that affect comparison though.

This results in a longer wait,ultimately longer video, and probably some minor RNG changes as well.

	": While this movie appears slower than a Japanese run, the difference appears to be almost entirely due to lag differences, and one version-exclusive trick early in the run. Comparing in-game time, while this run loses one in-game second in the first stage (due to aforementioned trick), in all other stages it matches or beats the Japanese run in in-game time. Therefore, I judge this run as technically superior. Accepting for the Vault.
