[div class=p 
	"The rotation of the ship is a mixture of RNG and a global timer, influenced by movement and actions in the opening section of the game (prior to the cutscene where the ship begins to sink). I'd initially thought this was checking the door, but further testing revealed that movement can also affect it. This rotation is forced in order to proceed, so it needs to be minimized in order to save time. Once your character wakes up after that cutscene, the game will write a number to $34E (2 byte). This appears to be a 15 second range of values from ~45 seconds to ~60 seconds... Actually about a second and a half under in both cases: The range I found was 2617 - 3510 frames. Once the global timer ($344, 2 byte) reaches the value in $34E, the screen will begin to shake as long as you're in a rotate-able room, and the ship will rotate a set number of frames later. The direction of rotation is influenced by your movement shortly before the rotation begins. Outside of this, movement between waking up and the ship rotating does not need to be optimized for speed apart from getting in position to meet the rotation, but I do so anyway since there isn't too much wiggle room anyway.

CasualPokePlayer mentioned that he was unable to get my run to sync, though (EDIT: this turned out to be user error and not an issue with the core), so I decided it was probably better to just cancel and remake on standard BSNES. I figured I could start with the v115 input and resync where necessary, but it turned out to be a nearly instant process, and by sheer luck it managed to match the 2617 frame wait I had gotten in the original improvement file without any changes to the base input, only some frame removals/additions for resyncing. The only other changes are very small changes to movement prior to the rotation. No time was saved or lost with them.
