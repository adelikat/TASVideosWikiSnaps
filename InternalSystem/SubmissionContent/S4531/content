	"In this TAS I perform several glitches such as...  the orb, the dragon coin skip, 6/5, 1/1, powerup increment, etc.  I will go to Yoshi's Island 2 first in order to get big mario so I can next go to Yoshi's Island 1 to obtain the orb.  Then I proceed with yoshi to the switch palace.  Then I will go through the normal Any% route but keep going and get to special world and play 2 levels of that and finally beat bowser.

	"The powerup increment glitch lets me add to mario's "powerup" status.  If you add over what mario can normally get you will get some crazy effects such as when I turn red in Yoshi's Island 3.

	"The orb is a glitch which is a form of the item swap glitch which gives you the orb from the Sunken Ghost Ship level.  It will skip any level when touched.  (It skips the level you are currently in.)  I use this item in Iggy's Castle to skip the cutscene after you kill Iggy.

	": The goals in this TAS are a bit random. The play is also sloppy. Please consider discussing your new TAS ideas on the forum, and seeing how well they go over, and allow the community to fine tune them. Rejecting.
