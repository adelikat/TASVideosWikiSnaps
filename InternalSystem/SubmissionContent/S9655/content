		"The goal of this category to have a "pure" way of beating this game (Glasses skip doesn't interfere much), which includes doing a no wrong warp route in order to show how this game is beaten with normal mechanics, unlike the 
		(__wikiLink|displaytext=current published run|href=/3334M)

		"If you watch the current published run, you will find that it makes Mickey jumps at very high speeds from moving platforms, so I called those super jumps in reference to OoT Extended Super Slide, as mostly they are also executed by throwing a bomb and jumping off of it xD. Now, I thought that it would be a cool idea to drop those in another run, however, 3 scenarios popped to my head:
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				"1) Dropping all glitches. This includes Glasses skip, but that will create a very slow backtrack to get Glasses, as we will go back to the Ice Cave anyway later on. Felt slow and redundant
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				"2) Keeping both Glasses skip and super jumps, but only those that do not create ladders in unintended places. Though, time save is not that significant and it didn't feel right to use them in some places, but not in others.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				"3) Dropping just super jumps. This one felt more appropriate as a different kind. Super jumps are what enables wrong warps and destroyed graphics, thus dropping them will have significant impact on how you would approach the game, and Glasses skip is still there, so we can go to Hyper Shoes quickly enough. Moreover, this is how RTA runners approach the game themselves, so it would be great to see how far we can get in a TAS with same strategies.

		"What is great about this run is that it revives the old strats from 
		(__wikiLink|displaytext=2005|href=/411M)
		" and 
		(__wikiLink|displaytext=2012|href=/2093M)
		", except with Glasses skip lol. Also, I used US text this time around just for variety, and it was found that ladder usage is 10 frames faster on the US version, while time lost from text is only 10.9 seconds, so might as well try it here :)

Apparently, that trick must be too hard to consistently perform in speed-runs...setting this kind of category as a good comparison against speed-runs.
