	"Super Monkey Ball Jr. is part of the Super Monkey Ball series (most certainly not the best), in which a monkey inside a bubble spins around a course, aiming to either collect the bananas or get the fastest time. In the GBA port, you have far less control of your monkey ball, and you have 2 different modes: the main game and mini-games. The Mini-games are: Monkey Duel, Monkey Fight, Monkey Bowling, and Monkey Golf. The Main game has 3 different difficulties, each with a different number of courses: Beginner (10), Advanced (20), and Expert (30.) There is also a Master difficulty (5), normally only attainable once you beat Expert without any continues, which this TAS completes. A password (Down, Down, Up, Up, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A) is used in order to unlock this difficulty from a power on.

[p 
	"The reason why I chose Master over Expert is that Expert has 30 courses, and they might get tedious after watching a while, and I wasn't sure of audience feedback yet. Master difficulty has only 5 courses, which are even more difficult, so I felt that this mode should be used. (The music is also different and the stages are fiery. Hyah!!!!)

	"The game is notoriously difficult to play in real time, because of the lack analog controls, the course tilting, the slipperiness, and the very thin platforms. To quote a gameFAQs review:

	"If this game is received well, the Expert difficulty can be run as well (a different category, or obsoleting since it's the hardest difficulty without a password and may be liked for the presence of 25 more stages), and also a 100% run that does all courses (and maybe all mini-games) and gets a perfect bonus on each one, which is attained by collecting all of the bananas, which really changes the way the game is played.
