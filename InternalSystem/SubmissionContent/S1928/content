	"F-Zero for SNES was published with only one track done. It was one of the first games for the SNES. Now here’s a game that doubles F-Zero’s tracks with the first game released for the GBA. F-Zero: Maximum Velocity is a typical racing game with a very fast-paced twist.

	"This is the only thing I have been planning and working on since my joining in January 2008. The process of the fastest racing line took a month and a half, then the production took about another month and a half. I chose this game because I was looking for games that may be good to run, and seeing as there is already an SNES F-Zero concept by Saturn, I thought that the GBA version would work out too.

	"Make sure that Allow Left+Right is on. There IS a faster time than this, but that is using a vehicle that you can only get by defeating all cups, which would be a run on it’s own, for someone with enough time. This is merely a concept demo of the first stage, kind of like what Saturn did with the normal F-Zero run.

	"girfanatic501: I never knew that there was a password for MV (thanks to Comicalflop/caitsith2), so I have no choice but to cancel this submission  and work on a new one working through all the cups. Like AKA said, what's the point of one track anymore?
