	"It uses different death and health management to save time. For example, one death is avoided in the beginning of world 1-3.

	"Also, in the final shop, the weapon is downgraded to get money for another extra life, allowing one more death in the final level. This was one of the "major" improvements, saving 28 frames, if I remember correctly.

	"There is also a 2 frames faster movie, which reduces lag by disabling hint messages, but it is less entertaining: http://dehacked.2y.net/microstorage.php/info/1257299063/gods-no-hints.gmv
