	"This is a 2522 frames (42,03s) improvement over the current Tiny Toon Adventures movie. It is also 1402 frames (23,37s) faster than Exim's left+right run of this game.

		"About the left+right glitch:
	]b
	" If you press left+right in this game, you will turn left and start running to the right at top speed. If you're standing still, you will reach top speed instantly, without having to accellerate up to top speed. If you're running left and suddenly press left+right, you will slow down really fast, stop, then go right at high speed.

	"The left+right glitch also works underwater, which you will see in the water level of this run. It also works in mid-air. However, you can't dash while running with left+right, if you press down when running with left+right, you will surprisingly enough dash left (at normal dash-speed)!

		"Climbing walls:
	]b
	" In this game, the cat can climb walls, similiar to the Mega Man X games. The best way to climb walls is to jump on the wall every 31 frames.

		"Number of carrots:
	]b
	" If your number of carrots is divisible by 11 when you have completed a world, you'll get to a bonuslevel. This is why I avoid getting 99 carrots.

		"Conclusion:
	]b
	" Overall, I personally think that the left+right glitch makes a run of this game more interesting and fun to watch. It is my opinion that this should either obsolete the current movie, or get published individually. If only referred to, it would also be necessary (or at least preffered)to refer to these comments, as well as the discussion of this submission, as well as and .avi-torrent. This seems to be a bit much for just reference, at least that's what I think. But as I said, it's also fine by me if this submission obsoletes the current submission.
