Unlike the other spidey 2 TASes, this one is done in the JIT engine because Dolphin devs are legends - they fixed the one bug with savestates (intentionally or not) that resulted in random savestate corruptions when making states for this game specifically in the JIT engine. It's now able to be TASed at any speed you want; none of that 4fps stuff we used to be stuck with.
