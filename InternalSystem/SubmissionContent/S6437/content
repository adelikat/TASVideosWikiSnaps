	(__wikiLink|displaytext=6415|href=/6415S)
	", 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=6416|href=/6416S)
	", 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=6417|href=/6417S)
	"). Submitting the same movies again won't give a chance to have a different judgment. Submitting should be done for movies that have a chance to be accepted, otherwise it's just spam that can only bother our community members, as all new submissions are announced in real-time in our IRC channel, Discord server, and RSS feed.

	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Judge Guidelines|href=/JudgeGuidelines)
	". Then, and only if the Judge will consider your arguments reasonable, the submission will be judged again, in view of your arguments. If that isn't enough, you can also contact the Senior Judge (
