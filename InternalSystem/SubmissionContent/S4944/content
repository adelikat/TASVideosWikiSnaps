	"The third of four.  Thankfully the PSX version of Warcraft II also includes the expansion "Beyond the Dark Portal"; so now I offer you the continuation of the orc story.  There's no longer any easy tutorial levels to sit through, and with the addition of our powerful new Hero units, expect nothing but hardcore battles and the total annihilation of all those who stand in our way.

Suiciding basically everybody grants just enough wiggle room to get to the end to rescue those dragons.  Fear not brave orcs, for your lives have been given a greater purpose.  May Ner'Zhul guide your worthless spirits into the ever after.

The Green base who cower behind thick layers of rock will send in regular attacks from their non stop gryphon production, while blue send in more traditional footmen patrols.  But no feeble alliance can possibly match the cunning or might of The Horde.  Both are dealt with in a swift and timely manner.

Not a task for the faint hearted, considering they already have upgraded units, guaranteeing a loss in any 1v1 match.  Well, that is without the aid of super micromanagement anyway.  Oh, and just in case you forgot: "You're the captain".

	"Kill the daemon at the end, using any rescued packs to help you.  This renders all other enemy packs effectively optional, ideally resulting in skipping them.  However, there is not enough room to sneak around them, nor can we use suicidal ogres to distract them because they're more interested in our DK anyway.  This means the first few packs need to be killed properly, until the DK (once research finished) can clear some guard towers.  Once that's done, it then becomes a mad rush to the end to kill a single daemon.

Red can then be slowly destroyed, while the rest of the army takes care of White.  However, low remaining health means that not all guard towers can be done with our initial army, and so we need to return later with the additional help of the rescued units.

	"Nozdormu's power over time wanes while we approach the city of Dalaran, slowing down our mighty warriors to only half their regular speed.  In order to overcome these dark magiks, we need to allow ample time before beginning our assault.  (IE the frame rate is bad here if we don't let this level load properly, hence a delayed skip to get past the tactics screen).  With no time to build a base, this means no extra catapults, no Bloodlust from ogres, and no Death & Decay for our DKs.  These form the usual core behind any offensive attack on Cross Island, and so more cunning techniques have to be devised.

	"Medivh's work will not go unfinished.  With the jeweled scepter of Sargaras in our command, and the dragon aspect Neltharion to cause destruction of cataclysmic proportions, the return to our home land Draenor can begin.  Unfortunately, the alliance have bolstered their hold over the portal, with five of their toughest heroes standing watch over the shores.  However, they are not immortal, as the simplest of auras can melt the flesh from their bones, securing another victory for The Horde.  Other nuisances include enemy peasants who enjoy repairing, or just simply rebuilding entire structures.  This means certain buildings are tactically not fully destroyed until we can work our way further in, to make sure potential replacements will not be built.   Ten minutes are all that are required to lay waste to all.

Fine execution of brilliant strategies, micromanagement, sacrifices, and everything else that makes these runs joyous to watch. Looking forward to seeing the Dark Saga concluded with the fourth and final campaign in the future. Accepting to Moons as a new branch.
