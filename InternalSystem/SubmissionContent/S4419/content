	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"Another World, also known as Out of This World and Outer World, is a 1991 cinematic platformer action-adventure game designed by Ã‰ric Chahi for Delphine Software. This game is story of young scientist Lester Knight Chaykin, who in result of an failed experiment with particle accelerator was teleportation in a dangerous alien world where he is forced to fight for his survival.

[p 
	"If you think that you already know story about how he will survive, you are wrong. Happy viewing to everyone!

	" Emulators speed difference
	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"Comparison in frames with previous movie is not fully correct. Old movie was done on Snes9x 1.43 which is no longer accepted. For unknown reasons, game speed on newer 1.51 version approximately ~1.02 times slower than was in 1.43. Probably it is one of reasons why it is forbidden nowadays. Newer emulator is big disadvantage, about ~15 seconds was wasted just because more accurate emulation was used, fortunately numerous improvements are more than enough to compensate these 15 seconds emulator-based difference. So in reality improvement is more significant than these "1585 frames".

	" Shooting at sitting position is faster than at standing
	$LF

[p 
	"Yep it is.
	$LF

[h3 
	" Shield-forward trick & Running with White Flash trick
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Pistol mechanics include a little-known trick - after short period of accumulation of energy-ball Lester can start run forward with keeping this energy-ball.  If ball have enough energy for shield, shield will be created ahead of Lester. If ball have enough energy for White Flash, White Flash will be done. Notable moment that even if to go to the next screen energy-ball will be still with Lester.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Impuls-jumping 
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Doing a tiny step(s) before every jump is faster than simple continuously jumping. NHG who discovered it explanation it like this and i agree with this explanation (quote): "I think the real reason is that he is in the middle of a running animation but the game has to restart the position of his legs to do the jump animation properly, and to do that he kind of teleports him just a little further."

[h3 
	" Bombs glitch
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"In palace, guard who drop bombs at cellar. At bottom of stairway in very epicenter of explosions there is a safety point. The lower part of the Lester's body located in offscreen and explosions can't damage him.

	" Underwater
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"When press "UP" and "A" buttons Lester swim up faster than with only "up" button. It is not improvement, just fun fact if someone not knew about it.

	" Prison
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"First guard was killed by falling cage slightly faster, he not even shoot up, in old run he died after shooting.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Another improvement, when "our friend" finished opening door, go to back previous screen and come back to elevator screen simultaneously with him. In result "our friend" will teleported ahead of Lester and run instead of lazy walking.
	$LF

[h4 
	" New sequence break
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Normally walkthrough assumes to deactivate energy system on the lowest floor and lock the door with guard, however with very thin timing is possible to pass this guard and survive even without locking doors!

	" Broken bridge section
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Very short section before caverns, but have many tiny time-saving tricks. At first small glitch after recharging pistol Lester shoot thru closed door. And then used running forward with White Flash trick three times in row. In previous TAS all three White Flashes was done staying on the same place. Not forget that shooting at sitting position is faster than at standing.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"At the end of section, while making pass into the rock, turning around allowed Lester to jump into hole faster.
	$LF

[h3 
	" Caverns
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Some movements optimization + using Rrunning with White Flash trick three times. When awaken pterodactyl shoot while sit down as always.

[h4 
	" Death abuse
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"After inundation, death abuse was used to reach water pool screen without getting pistol back, after resurrection at DDRX checkpoint Lester got new pistol.

	"New faster pacifistic tactic, shield-forward trick was used to pass this screen with one stop instead of two.

	" Laser deadly pit
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Long time ago, in childhood, in times without internet and other tutorials, another world was my first ever video game, i was stuck in may places, particularly in caverns i not knew what to do underwater and i just fall in this pit with deadly lasers again and again.. and again and after long sufferings i finally get success. Only later i understood that it was wrong solution. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Better luck manipulation inside pit, 0 squatting instead of 2.  In 2011 i was not able to make own TAS and i am grateful to NitroGenesis that he demonstrated this underwater part skip for everyone even with these 2 sloppy squatting movements.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Also jumping-run at opening doors are slowdown Lester speed, here is faster to normal running before doors will be open.
	$LF

[h3 
	" Terrace/Palace
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"After throwing Lester to the other side, execute simple normal jump to left, instead of running to right before jump (I dunno why Nitro did this strange mistake). Running with White Flash trick was used to destroy wall at guard with bombs earlier. Also bomb glitch was used to survive in epicenter of explosions. Besides it better luck manipulation - in old movie guard did 1 laser shot during bombing. In new movie one 0 shots.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" New sequence break
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Discovered by NHG. Normally before jumping into pit to the basement Lester must to deactivate security system or diagonal laser's shot must kill him, however he can survive!

[h3 
	" Tank
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Extremely short section, but very small improvement was done even here - at left panel-block with 4-buttons block, just before last white button, right bottom button is not necessary to be pressed.

	"Most of tricks we designed together with him in 2011, it were months of research, many times we thought that all that can be found in this game we already found, but this game full of surprises and many times suddenly he or i found some yet new improvements, it were very fun times. I recommend to watch his awesome Single Segment run for PC version of game on SDA.
