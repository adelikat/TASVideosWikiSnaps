	"Comparison in frames with previous movie is not fully correct. Old movie was done on Snes9x 1.43 which is no longer accepted. For unknown reasons, game speed on newer 1.51 version approximately ~1.02 times slower than was in 1.43. Probably it is one of reasons why it is forbidden nowadays. Newer emulator is big disadvantage, about ~15 seconds was wasted just because more accurate emulation was used, fortunately numerous improvements are more than enough to compensate these 15 seconds emulator-based difference. So in reality improvement is more significant than these "1585 frames".
