[p 
	"The character's stats aren't random, but determined only by the name. Using "!" gave me the best overall stats (mostly higher strength and agility), saving a few turns in some fights ... having a short name to scroll through only took away a small fraction of that saved time.

	"Using Hurt against the Dragonlord only has a 1/16 chance to work, 1/8 chance to do max damage (12), and all monsters have a 1/3 chance to wake up (which must be avoided). That made the odds quite low and resulted in some 3 second waits and non constant damage (10-12), but that was the best I could get. I actually went as far as figuring out the game's randomization and how it determined things so that I could make a program that simulates it and shows the results for each frame, allowing me to plan the whole fight in advance and saving a lot of re-records and trouble.
