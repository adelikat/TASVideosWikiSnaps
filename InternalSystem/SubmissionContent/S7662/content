THPS3 features eight levels, five of which contain goals and the other three are competitions.

	"It's difficult to compare this run to the previous TAS done by emu, mainly due to his choice to score in one heat and grab the stat points in the other heat. Due to the stats in competitions not completing any goal and the extra score padding out the length of the run, I've chosen to skip those and create a run more like what the real time speedrunning community would do. All in all, 19 seconds of in game time were saved in goal levels, 228 seconds of in game time were saved in competitions, and upwards of 30-40+ seconds were saved by skipping out on adjusting stats/tricks between level menus. These time saves will be elaborated on further in the submission.

	$LF
	"I turned Autokick off for two main reasons. First and foremost, you move a little bit faster overall (though you lose around 8 frames at the start of level waiting to get up to speed). It's fast enough that you catch up to and surpass Autokick on within the first 5 seconds or so of a level. The second reason is that having Autokick off be on C-Left means that I can choose to do a one frame ollie with A, whereas with Autokick On I would do a big jump every time I release A. It allows for much more precise and controlled movement overall at the sacrifice of a few seconds of menus.

If your Switch stat is below maximum, your stats are decreased when you're in Switch stance, and if it was left at 6 we'd be moving like a snail comparatively. One stat is taken from Speed and added to Switch, maxing our Switch and leaving us with 11 Speed. The 11 speed may only save a few frames but the 1 extra Switch is invaluable.

Ideally you want to land perfect as much as you can to speed up your overall movement (though situations do arise where landing perfect ruins a strategy). One last note on perfect landings: if you 180 into a grind and then land (be it from the rail ending or ollieing without turning), you will almost always get a perfect landing.

Otherwise, the route is the same up through the third valve. I skip bonking the wall before the control booth gap. The control booth goal wants you to do grind the whole booth, but if you just barely jump over the trigger the gap will just count anyway. You also can't land a perfect landing from that control booth jump, which is why I jump again to get a perfect and build more speed.

If you do pretty much anything inside the elevator (be it manualing, jumping, anything that isn't just moving forward and turning) you will fall through the elevator or clip out of the side of it. I choose to do a leap of faith onto the elevator rail to make up for the wait.

Once I reach the final valve, I do an insanely high wallride into wallie to reach to ledge with the deck on it. I think it's frame perfect to make it up there without falling and super precise.

Normally, you'd think to just wallride the nice, beautiful, flat back of the ice cream truck, but due to where I landed that wasn't feasible.
