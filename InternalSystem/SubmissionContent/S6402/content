	"Iji is an action-packed strategic platform shooter with a detailed story, large levels with multiple paths, powerful bosses and lots of secrets. There are alternate gameplay events, dialogues and scenes depending on what you do, a wealth of extras and bonus features, and seven stats to upgrade through a leveling system. Iji herself has superhuman strength and abilities, and can crack Nanotechnology, use her enemies' most devastating weapons against them, and be a pacifist or a killer - the story adapts to how you play.

It is also possible to move for one frames worth of pixels if you hold left of right when you press C (the default crack key).  When jumping you move at the same speed as walking but you lose 1 frame when you land (you always lose a frame when you land).

It is slower than walking to damage boost by hitting yourself with the Rocket launcher or Splintershock because the getting up animation is really long. Getting hit by enemy rockets or splintershocks is faster if the ceiling is tall enough (you get massively slowed down if you hit it). It is also better to be in the air when getting hit because you travel at a high speed for longer, assuming that the ceiling is high enough. Getting punched by the Tasen Commander or hit by Komato Berserker’s resonance detonator is also faster than walking. Note that holding the arrow key in the direction you are flying makes you go faster if you aren’t at max speed (not holding any key or holding the key in the direction you are going is identical) and holding the arrow key opposite the flying direction will slow you down (you can speed back up by holding the opposite direction key).

Accepting the truce adds 10 minutes onto the ingame timer but that is not a good option for timing (it always rounds down to the nearest second after each sector). Skipping the boss saves around 12 seconds (you would want to get the Buster gun and enough ammo to fight the boss and this would take extra time on top of the 9 second boss fight). Accepting the truce also save 17 seconds in sector 9 because the doors to the room before Iosa are open.

Since you have a high strength level you can use the Resonance detonator to kill the green Tasen Scouts. This can be done at the start, after falling down the long drop and in the restricted storage room and near the end of the sector to get some extra Nano for no extra time. In the restricted storage room I manipulate enemies to get damage boosted. Right before the end I use a Nanofield reboot to get 5 Crack and 2 HP, which will be used in the next sector.

You need to crack Spread rockets (combination of the shotgun and Rocket launcher) in order to blast away the cracked floor. After this you need to switch to the MPFB as soon as you get it and blast yourself over the wall. This skips over half of sector 5. You need to be level 18 to get the Nuke to instakill Asha. This can be done by firing the nuke on the first frame of the fight. It is best to also hold left so that you get knocked back to the right towards the Supercharge which gives you 1 skill point.

I Make sure to only use rockets to do this as I need MPFB ammo later on. After knocking myself over the gap with the Nuke it is time to fight Proxima. For whatever reason if you nuke Proxima when it is in the correct position you can knock it downwards instead of upwards. After being struck by both lightnings it is possible to knock Proxima far enough back, causing it to skip attacks (normally it chases you after being hit by the ightning) I manipulate Proxima so that it is close to the electricity after I activate the second terminal.

Later I MPFB boost myself not only because it is faster but also because I need to take damage for the death warp at the end of the Shredder part. After boosting myself and falling down I get 10 Crack, Tasen and Komato. Since I manipulated enemies to drop Nano I do not need to reboot my nanofield.

	"Iosa part 1 is beaten by shooting her with Rockets and Splintershocks throughout the fight because they don’t waste any time and also MPFB where it doesn’t waste time. Mid fight I use Retribution – you need all 8 basic weapons, at least 1 ammo for each, and 5 or less HP currently left. Just after being knocked to the ground, rise while holding the Use key. If performed while Iji is still flashing from taking the damage that knocked her down, the skill will activate. This deals massive damage if you are on top of her. Iosa part 2 is just RNG. You need her to do the attack where you duck to dodge it and then kick her or hit her with the Resonance detonator.

This skips more than half of sector X and is the reason why you need 10 crack, Tasen and Komato. After dropping down and destroying the turret with the Resonance detonator, I crack the door which saves 20 seconds over going around it. For the next part it is best to select the Splinterhock as it breaks the glass, saving a frame. In the final room before Tor I reboot my Nanofield for the last time, getting 10 Tasen and Attack, 3 assimilate and some HP. The HP level needed is at least 3 as you need to shoot MPFBs constantly and that knocks you on the ground, making you take damage.

	"And finally Tor. You need 26 MPFB ammo and 5 rockets. I shoot 5 MPFB shots per round (6 in one of the rounds), reflect the Chargeball, and fire a rocket before he flies away. I make sure to shoot the first shot before Tor lands otherwise I might not be able to get 5 shots off. The missile attack delays Tor’s next attack by about 20 frames and I manipulate him to do it twice (when I want to get the 6th MPFB shot and the final round, makes it so that you can shoot the rocket before reflecting the Chargeball, saves about 1.5 seconds). Also from all of the “transition attacks” (Mega missile (shoots balls), Death hail (shoots something from above) and Eruption (fast red wave), Eruption is the fastest so you can save a few seconds over the course of the fight if you get good RNG. This is the only transition attack he uses in this TAS (except for the very first one, which is always a weaker Death hail).
