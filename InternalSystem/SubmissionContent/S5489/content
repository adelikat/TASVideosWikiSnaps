	"Resident Evil 2 story takes place two months after the events of the first game, Resident Evil. It is set in Raccoon City, an American community whose residents have been transformed into zombies by the T-virus, a biological weapon developed by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella. In their escape from the city, the two protagonists, Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield, encounter other survivors, and are confronted by William Birkin, the mutated creator of the even more powerful G-virus.

	"This mysterious man will follow you around the R.P.D. Building in the second scenario. At first his intentions are unclear, but later we found out what he is after. I can't explain very well how i've managed to dodge him but its very simple, basically you have to make he thinks you're going by one side but you are actually going to the other side. At his second appeareance, you can dodge Mr. X when he bust out of the wall, just run on the wall that he just destroyed, and you can slip past him easy, can be done also in 2F hallway where you dodge by his left side and go straight to the door.

	"As already mentioned in my previous submission, you don't really have to use cord in order to get an optimal Scenario B run, using it in Scenario A leaves the windows blocked in Scenario B but it has no strategic value whatsoever. If you're playing right, you should never have to return to the zombie infested hallways. The break-in during scene B happens "earlier" if and only if you enter the library at anytime during that scenario. You dont have to enter the library at any time until you are ready to get the last two puzzle pieces you need to exit the station. That means if you are in the 2F lounge on the west side of the building and you need to get to the interrogation room on the east side, you shouldnt take the Library as a "shortcut"... you have to back track the way you came, but this is just a route example.

[p 
	"I did not detailed all the technical aspect of this movie such as how many frames ive saved in my attempts, i think the range for further optimization depends on the amount of route change involved and in my opinion, there is no major improvement that could be done here and i dont expect more than 1-3 seconds to be saved, unless i've made some mistakes that i am not aware of.
