	"Wordle is a web-based word game created and developed by Welsh software engineer Josh Wardle, and owned and published by The New York Times Company since 2022. Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word, with feedback given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position. The mechanics are nearly identical to the 1955 pen-and-paper game Jotto and the television game show franchise Lingo. Wordle has a single daily solution, with all players attempting to guess the same word.

Tens of thousands if you remove the BIOS splash! I've ended up coming to a bit of a rough conclusion on this one, and it's all about game choice. I will say in advance that

	"Anyway, site stuff aside, where I think this game falls short is mainly in notability. Yes, Wordle itself is extremely popular and notable, but this is just a homebrew GB version of it. Similarly to last year's barrage of
