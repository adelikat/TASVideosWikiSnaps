In the thps2 engine, you don't really need to hold ollie much at all to keep max speed, but in 6th gen games you need to hold it a good bit more. This means that I can't get a million one frame ollies like 5th gen thps3, but I will move faster overall and we make up for the extra ollie button holding with stat changes.

A retry or two will still come out a decent bit faster than having to do an extra jump and trick in each heat to make up for having unfavorable rng.

The reason it’s so valuable on PC is because the game takes almost no time to load, while on Gamecube a retry loses over half a second on its own.

Instead what you can do is Boneless in the few frames of movement after you end run and instantly get your score. This allows for some incredibly early end of runs that can end up potentially saving in game time.

This is normally pretty easy in real time because runners frequently use max ollie, but because I have it set to 7 I have to be a bit more creative with how we grab it. The main problem is that the letters bob up and down and we absolutely need a low part of the cycle to even have a chance to grab it. You may be able to gather exactly what went wrong here, an optimal start simply can't reach it. The way I slow down here is by clipping the wall slightly to delay just enough to meet the cycle..

	"The next bit is pretty simple to get the E then wallride up to the top area, and now we've reached the main route difference between this and Fogs TAS. A few years ago it was found that you can fall onto the A after grabbing the tape, and this opened a pretty big reroute in rta. Runners nowadays will normally turn around at the fourth valve, grind back towards the way they came, then follow the path to hit the foreman grind with speed and go to the fifth valve from there. However, it was found that you can go from the A to the foreman with a well placed boneless, which eliminated the need for some backtracking.
	$LF
	"	
	$LF
	"The TAS optimization of the segment comes from the fact that IL runners go towards the end of the scaffolding with the tape and use that for a consistent setup for the strategy, and I found that you can do it by just dropping off right when you get the tape and don't need to bonk the wall. This allows me to get 1 igt better than the ILs (using the IL timing method).
	$LF
	"	
	$LF
	"The route after the foreman is pretty basic and standard. A 50-50, a Boneless up to the bucket, a few side hops, then grinds with some Ollies/bonelesses to avoid slopes or get slope boosts. After the last valve I delay ending the run (and also choose end run over retry) to skip a cutscene.

The reason for that is that it loses no time to hit 30k (the only difference is spinning 180 degrees at the start vs 360 degrees) and makes the comp 100% free.
