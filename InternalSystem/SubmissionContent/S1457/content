	"Pokemon Sapphire is a pokemon game from the third generation, along with Ruby and Emerald.  The reason I chose Sapphire is that Ruby has a Groudon instead of a Kyogre, which isn't quite as useful, and Emerald is slightly longer.  Mudkip is picked as the starter because it learns a lot of HMs and is good against many of the gyms.  Although Blaziken is very useful for battling the Elite Four, I have Kyogre by then and have completely abandoned my starter.  Of course, almost every hit in this movie is a critical hit, as they do about twice as much damage.
