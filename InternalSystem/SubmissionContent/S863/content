	"Rolo to the Rescue is a cute game about an elephant who tries to save her furry friends from an evil circus master. In this any% movie however, Rolo runs home as fast as possible using her friends only for selfish purposes. So, Rolo aims for fastest time and even forces her poor friends to absorb damage for her.

	"General pattern for completing levels: 1) get the key 2) release all animals to get the next map piece 3) exit

	"Tricks: downward hill speed boost & underground running (latter is for entertainment)

	"Rolo's speed decreases in the air, so even if it looks bad it's played very well. To improve: mainly, end some more levels with start button instead of running to the exit. Good luck to anyone trying to get this under 9 minutes!

	"I'm not sure whether a 100% run would be interesting, but I can help if someone wants to try.
