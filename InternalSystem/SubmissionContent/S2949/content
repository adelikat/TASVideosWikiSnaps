	"When Randil submitted his 
	[a class=intlink href=/1669M 
		"Tom and Jerry run
	]a
	" a while back I was reminded of this little gem, and as such things go I decided to TAS it. I like this game in that it is quite different from the traditional platformer. It breaks down like this: at the end of each level is a boss; to trigger the boss you must find Jerry's furry friend in the level; to find Jerry's friend you may need a special item; to get this special item you may need another special item (etc. all found within the level); to get the special item you must win a mini game; to unlock the mini game you must collect a minimum amount of a certain item within the level. This made the game quite complicated to TAS; finding the optimal route to collect the initial items was challenging and I found many tricks and glitches that allowed me to skip certain special items and parts of the level. Oh...and, on top of that, this game lags like a bitch, probably because the graphics are actually pretty decent.

		" Movement
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" Jerry moves fastest while jumping for as long as he can. This entails holding down the A button for 9 frames, all depressions less than that result in lower jumps. However, due to the huge amount of lag in this game it can often be faster to deliberately use a frame slower jump to avoid lag.

		" Left/Right
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" This game does not like left/right. I use this for entertainment purposes during downtime, especially while using special items. For example, doing it while using the rocket triggers Jerry's 'pushing' animation, using it with the bubblegum triggers the 'entering a door' animation.

		" Left/Right Climbing Abuse
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" One useful aspect is that when you hit LR before grabbing onto a climbable object (broomhandle, plant etc) Jerry momentarily gets stuck in the object which allows you a window of opportunity to jump upwards which is not normally possible.

		" Rocket Glitch

		[ul 
			[li 
				" Once your Rocket runs out you have a single frame on which to press B to quickly get another Rocket. This allows you to access three times as much height as normal and can be used for some major skips.

		" Superjacent Platform Abuse
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" When jumping up to a platform above, you can go through the platform as much as you want until Jerry's feet register on the top surface, however objects below the platform treat the bottom of the platform as real. The best application of this is in the last level where I use it to pass between the platform and the barricade to skip most of the level.

This skips two minigames and a huge amount of collecting. Job done!
