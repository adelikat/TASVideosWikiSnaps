Commit suicide! Don't laughing please, it's not a joke, arrrg, it's not possible to talk with you! More seriously, at some moments the fastest solution to save time is to commit suicide. Don't do it at home, this is very stupid and dangerous for your life... Do it outdoor! f*****g stupid joke.

During some boss fighting, if the number of enemies is greater than the number of enemies displaying at screen, then you are obliged to kill for decreases this number and obtain a number equal to this number of display, else you are obliged to continue the fighting after killing boss.

		"-Lesson ten: kill RNG! RNG of this game is very interesting, I created a big list of patterns used by enemies and create some tools to assist me at some specific moments. Enemies have a trigger linked at five counters to take decision, when the counter reach the trigger it can test x and y player's position, if it have a parents more close of the player, x and y weapon's position, player's button pressed... It possible to manipulate all comportements, with a lot of patience.
