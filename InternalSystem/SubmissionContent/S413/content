	"Tecmo Super Bowl.. a very popular game in America. I like some parts of the previous video, but not the work as a whole. It needed to be more entertaining as a game of football. In v1 I manipulated luck solely for my own advantage. In this version, I also manipulate luck in order to help the other team out, which can be a bit difficult (e.g. the long interception return.) I tested and confirmed my hypothesis that whenever the ballcarrier for either team is not entrapped, it is possible to avoid being tackled, even if everyone on the other team is chasing the slowest guy on the field.

	"To summarize, I have tried to play a zany and entertaining game instead of an undramatic blowout. It is over 4 minutes shorter than the first one.
