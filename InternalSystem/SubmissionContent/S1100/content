	"I actually had a lot of fun making this movie when I wasn't fighting with the bad hit detection and seemingly random damage dealt by my double jumping.  Many times in order to avoid taking damage or slowing down too much I would double jump into an enemy.  Unfortunately that requires getting really close to the enemies as well as trying to deal with them in the event they don't die.  There are also a few places that have a low enough ceiling that the game won't even let you jump.  A few of the levels really irked me though.  2 and 15 specifically.  2 because it's part above water and part below.  The transition is what really slows things down so I try to say either above or below water as much as I can.  15 was really annoying because of those light carriers.  You can't fall through them so going down (required at times) is very slow.  I think people will like it for the acrobatics and some of the fancy shooting.
