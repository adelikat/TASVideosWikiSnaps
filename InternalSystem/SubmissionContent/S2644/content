	"Rocket: Robot on Wheels is, like many other N64 games such as Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong, centered on collecting all of the items in each world. The game takes place in a theme park on the eve of opening day, when the antagonist Jojo sneaks in and reprograms the park, leaving Rocket (the player character) to fix the mess before opening day. This is accomplished by completing six worlds with the help of vehicles and special abilities, and finally facing Jojo and foiling his plans once and for all...
