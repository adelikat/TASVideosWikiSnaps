If this is done when jumped into a whirlpool, the speed of your "boost cancel" and the speed of your vehicle spinning around when crossing a whirlpool will be put together. When this happens, your boat will face only one direction and cannot be controlled, so i made sure to have a good angle before i made use of this trick. Furthermore, when entering a portal with this kind of speed, transformation will be executed much faster. This saves around 1s every lap.
