It has always been a mystery on how you would optimize a game like this...but the range of input can be played with to take advantage of completing each room quickly; however, holding an input seems to work...so I guess a human could match this??? Doesn't seem so though. Human runs that I have watched still make mistakes and slightly falls behind in a slow manner. Speaking of...my comparison with other's plaything this, I saw different routes...which confused me (apparently an RNG factor). Well, I don't see any issues with the way these rooms progressed. The optimization is very tight, compared to humans and satisfies my review.
