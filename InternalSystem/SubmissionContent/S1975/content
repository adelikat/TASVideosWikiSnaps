	"So, this is the first (real) submission of this game. This run does not use the pipe glitch which the red team used in the TAS competition a while back (causing VBA v20 to be created). I'm surprised no one has attempted it before, actually. As you'll probably notice when watching, the game lags A LOT. Not to the extent of e.g. Kirby's Dream Land, but you get the picture. There are some places where lag was unavoidable, such as in the last level of the water stage, when I take the flower.

	"The reason why I picked the (J) ROM is simple. When a boss dies, it flies up, and then down, quite slowly. In the (J) ROM, if the boss is sent outside the screen on its way up, the battle will end there, saving ~2 seconds each fight it's applicable (Moon boss and the three pigs). There is close to no text in this game anyway, so no entertainment value is cut off.

	"One possible improvement would be in the castle, when going up to the first floor. The jumps here are badly timed as I discovered later. However when I optimized that part, the next room was out of rythm. You see, Mario moves at 1 pixel, 2 pixels, 1 pixel, 2 pixels. This rythm wasn't the same after I corrected the earlier room, and so the next one was messed up too. 15 frames could potentially be saved if this was somehow done better.
