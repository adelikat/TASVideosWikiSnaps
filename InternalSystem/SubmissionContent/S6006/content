	"This run is done on the USA version of Top Gear 2 and uses English Text.  The goal of this run is to get to the credits as quickly as possible (USA%) using the fastest known methods currently possible.  This TAS was started in April of 2018.  Many improvements came and went.  The previous TAS that was created which had a final (RTA) time of 9:10.210.  The original TAS that I made was decent but had many flaws in a nearly perfect run.  All of the inputs you see here, where recorded by me.  However, as time went on I did have a little bit of help from the Top Gear community about theorizing the perfect run.

	"USA% is the shortest category for Top Gear 2.  Here an in-game password is used to skip directly to the final country with a fully stocked vehicle substantially faster than the competition it faces - conditions in which any human player would find it possible to win, yet obstacles, cars, and frame perfect skips allows for perfect reflexes and a great deal of luck.  Back in 2013, this category was recognized as Any%.  RallyFTW and I changed the name, the reason the name was changed is that Any% wouldn't make sense since, Any% is what this category is, but is renamed to USA% because I am only playing the last country in the game, which is the United States, hence the name USA% was created.  I started this category back in 2013 and have used the same upgrades since then, with some minor upgrade changes here and there.

I originally got my inspiration from that video to start running this category.  My TAS in today's standards is a lot different, in fact, almost has no correlation to the original TAS by Dooty.  In my TAS I use the best upgrades to finish the races quicker and frame perfect skips to make the run a little more entertaining to some extent.

[div class=p 
	"All of the Top Gear games besides Top Gear 2 uses IGT.  The reason this run uses RTA timing is that the IGT is very inaccurate, sometimes at the start of races you will lose between 1 and 20 milliseconds each time before you are able to start driving.  I'm not really sure why the game does this, but my general idea, would be loading in the level, however, for now, we still don't know the reason.  Another funny factor about the IGT in Top Gear 2 that I don't use in this run, is being able to shave off 1 millisecond for every race you go through.  If your car manages to get behind another car after crossing the finish line, the game will get confused and make the IGT count backward and make you save more time then the initial processing time calculated.

		"United States: Las Vegas: Las Vegas is interesting because it's one of the only tracks in the game that will allow the player to hold A and Left on the controller to get a starting boost from a nitro.  The only other track in the game at the moment that has a same starting boost is San Francisco.  I framed advanced the nitro boost's here to get the best possible time, without losing speed.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" United States: Los Angeles: This track is also really interesting.  Starting off, you can boost past the 2 sets of cars in front of you (which is frame perfect), and it saves roughly 1 1/2 seconds over normal play.  Los Angeles is one of the tracks I also spent the most time on and checked each frame to see when the appropriate time to boost was.  There is a small hill that leads into a tunnel, you are able to use all of your nitro's on each lap when the MPH hits 228, doing this is also frame perfect and closest it's come RTA would be 226 MPH.

		" United States: New York: New York is the last snow stage in the game, and features a new technique called "turn throttling".  Turn throttling was discovered by RallyFTW and is used in RTA runs today.  Before this discovery we were sliding every which way possible, however, the way this works is quite unique.  If you are going around a corner (which depends on the sharpness of the turn), you can tap the direction your car will go, and it will cancel out the sliding animation.  I used earlier nitro's here on 2nd lap near the end because I wanted to go fast because waiting loses time overall.

[ul 
	[li 
		" United States: San Francisco: San Francisco is the final track in the game. Unfortunately, you won't be seeing San Francisco all that much, since the entire stage is fog based. Just like Las Vegas, you are able to hold an A press and a Left press on the controller and steer off the track to get in front of the cars ahead. This little time saving was found by another runner "RallyFTW".  Later on in the track, you will notice I held off from gearing up, unlike the previous 3 tracks.  The reason this is, is because I wanted a lot of speed and maintaining that speed is very important, because you are then able to keep your speed down a hill which increases your speed to 234, then 228 after the uphill than to 230, before leveling back off below 230 then a nitro is used a little later to maintain the kept speed from earlier.  This track also features a half a nitro pick up or known as "Speed Up".  Right before my nitro runs out, I pick this up to maintain speed for a little longer than intended.
