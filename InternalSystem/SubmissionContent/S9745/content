	"For some inconceivable reason, everything in this game after clicking on the first level runs about twice as slow as it would on Flash Player, which makes this movie way slower than it should be. I did a few attempt runs, and I completed one in 8 minutes, which is 16 seconds faster than the TAS, despite having many deaths. The run time if the game ran accordingly would be around 4 minutes and 32 seconds. Also, in the Big Dino screen, you have to keep clicking the game window (outside of recording, like literally click on the Ruffle tab) in order for the game to progress.
