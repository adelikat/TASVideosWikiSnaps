	": Hello Marcio, and welcome to TASVideos. The goal for movie publications on this site is to provide footage of perfect play-through, achieved through tools such as frame advance and rerecording. Your movie does not use rerecords to fix mistakes - not just mistakes in being suboptimal in your action, but actually just mistakes in the minigames themselves. Mistakes like this are not acceptable for a movie submission for this site; as such, I will be cancelling your movie.
