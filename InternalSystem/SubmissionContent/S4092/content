	"Hi, here is our TAS of Super Mario Advance 4 E-Levels which took about 3month to finish
	$LF
	"This is a TAS of the e-reader levels of Super Mario Advance 4. To watch the movie you will need the .sav file of the e-reader levels (see link below). This TAS plays through all 32 e-reader levels. There are 5 other levels on the file, they are SMB3 remakes of the SMB1 levels 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, and 2-2. There is a 32 level limit to the number of files that can be on the game save, so these levels were not included.

	"Who and why choose this game?
	$LF
	"I (Got4n) chose this game because I was looking for mario games and then saw this game then searched on TASVideos if there was a tas of this game and saw an e-reader Submission. It was very interesting!
	$LF
	"Also because L+R does epic things
	$LF
	"Did a test run, then showed it to TehSeven, which was interested, then I gave to him my values then he did a lua script. He did many levels then I did the rest!
	$LF
	"(He did the autoscrollers except the bowser board ones)

	"The e-Reader is an add-on device for the Game Boy Advance released in 2002 that can read dot codes on special cards and interpret them into data. Depending on the card, the data may contain either information or some type of Minigame. Several complete Nintendo Entertainment System games were also made available on special packs of cards. It took a total of nine or ten dot codes (two per card) to store the data of an NES game.

	"What is missing and why those and not these?
	$LF
	"The listing of levels is endless, but the e-reader can only save 32 levels
	$LF
	"These are the "common" one

	"Order: 
	$LF
	"Skip 2 (level 30 and 27) (I think) levels because they are faster with flower, and mostly because level 30 does not end because you can kill bowser with fire only. Else, all levels are done in order

	": This movie needs a bit of work before it can become acceptable. There's a general lack of feeling in the viewers of this run that the player is exhibiting mastery over the game. There needs to be some noticeable pattern to items collected, and not look like things are just missed, or done haphazardly. Auto-scroll levels need to be more entertaining, and show off. Throughout the run, there are noticeable suboptimal playing. More precision needs to be given to jumping, falling, turning around. Seeing Mario crash into walls, at high velocity and turning around slowly looks really bad. Holding down B for the entire run is not advised. I also think you can benefit greatly from looking beyond the obvious solutions in various levels.
