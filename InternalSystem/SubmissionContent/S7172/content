	"Something something win a tournament and you get credits. There isn't really too much to comment on, other than the maps are randomly generated when you start the tournament, and that is manipulated for favorable movement. Also, fishing is randomish, although the fastest fish I get happens to be a winning fish, so not too much manipulation there.

	": So this one was a bit tricky to research, considering the entire game is in Japanese as well as any information about the game online. From what I can figure, the optimization is good. The routing is pretty straightforward; you only need one good fish to win the game and the tournament length is set to the minimum. The RNG for the map and the fishing minigame look good as well. It also beats the only record I could find. Accepting.
