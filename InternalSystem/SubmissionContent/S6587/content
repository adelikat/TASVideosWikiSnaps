	"In a trade, a player will set up the trade that they want and click "Yes".  At that point the other player has a chance to say "Yes", "No" or set up a different deal.  If they say "Yes", the trade is done and final.  If the CPU is the first to say yes, you have the option of menuing out of the trade and doing things such as mortgaging properties.  However, there is a glitch/oversight that if you mortgage a property and return to the trade, the CPU will still be set to yes! (This also works against human players, if you want to be savage. And not have friends).  Monopoly speedrun strats then involve offering a trade to a CPU that's a bit too high for them, causing them to counter by adding a new property from your list or more money then saying yes.  This is generally a bad deal for you, but if you can mortgage all the properties, you end up with the advantage.

	"The innovation that is the basis for this movie is rather simple.  Set up a trade that the CPU would agree to, then simply click "No" instead of "Yes"!  The CPU will immediately then say Yes to the deal.  At this point, you can do the mortgage glitch.  In normal play, this is completely breaking as you can set up an even trade of many properties of the same color (The cpu will always agree since they see this as even), then mortgage all your properties.
