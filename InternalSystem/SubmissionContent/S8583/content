You often ask yourself how long a defenseless baby bluebird can hope to survive when a host of voracious predators are looking for a meal. If only you could leave this place to find a new home. But alas--you're too young to fly. The best you can manage is a flapping long jump. But you'd better be careful not to jump too far: You could fall a long way down.
