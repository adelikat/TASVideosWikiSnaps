	"When the character is jumping on the very edge of the platform he looks like he jumped on it but then he falls through, unless you make him jump while he's in that landing animation. In the level after the first two minibosses I was able to skip an entire section of that level by jumping on the far left platform (it's as close of a jump as you can make).

	"During the driving stages I luck manipulated the Terminator's vehicle (represented in blue) to move farther by firing at him but making my shot miss. If the shot actually does hit the Terminator he slows down. I also got a faster starting boost by ramming my vehicle into the Terminator's to get a greater velocity.

[div class=p 
	"Another thing about this game is that lag plays a factor in whether or not the game will accept input in half the time than normal. That's why in the second driving stage I try to keep the Terminator off the screen when I'm making those sharp turns for optimized speed.

	"This run was pretty easy to TAS. I enjoyed TASing this game and I like trying new games that haven't been TASed yet. I think this will be a great addition to the NES games list because of how much work has been put into this such as finding new shortcuts in this game and faster ways to physically progress through levels.
