	"Thought it might be interesting to TAS one of those point&click escape games, since they're so fast. I feel like this turned out kind of funny, although it does have some animations it is fairly short. I couldn't figure out how to get save states to work until I finished the project (the -g gl command seems to do it), so I had to do some planning (which didn't always work because the animations' scroll speed is inconsistent, requiring me to wait for the whole 200-frame intro to play out over and over). But that's at least exciting for any of my future projects, whatever those might be.
