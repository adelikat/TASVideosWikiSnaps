	"Quartet was a 1986 arcade game where Sega saw the success of Gauntlet and thought to turn that into a sci-fi side scrolling platformer instead. Normally allowing up to 4 players at a time, they can cooperate to complete the 32 stages before the game loops. This TAS uses a later revision, Quartet 2, for reasons that will be explained later.

	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/feos

	". This old version was on an older version of MAME that didn't have the copy protection working for some Sega System 16 games, Quartet included. It also had stability issues, causing crashes and sound issues in TAStudio back in the time. Despite all those technical issues I persevered and completed what seems to be the first recorded MAMEHawk TAS in history.

	" looked at the MAMEHawk development and helped to make a waterboxed core. This new MAMEHawk core is so much more stable and also more up to date. All you future MAMEHawk TASers are much luckier than me. Anyways, I converted my inputs between the old and new cores with a single modification of adding a boot frame at the start to sync. This is great as it definitely means Sega System 16 games run excellently in BizHawk.

	"This uses "quartet2a" which is known in MAME as "Quartet 2 (unprotected)". The reason was that the old MAMEHawk core was started with a version that didn't fix the copy protection on Sega System 16 games. That protection affects the moving platforms in stages. Without that protection, taking a hit is mandatory to get past one of the stages due to those platforms not working. I used an unprotected version of Quartet to get around that, even though it did cost a few frames to select a character.

There are 32 stages in a loop of this game and this TAS completes 1 loop as the game continues endlessly. Bosses speed up the more damaged they are so sometimes a boss kill is delayed to have them move in a more favorable position to pick up the key.

More importantly this pushes the player further ahead in the screen as normally the screen scroll matches the player's walk speed. This can be used to get past some enemy spawns that otherwise have to be dealt with. The short hops also allows for making some gaps without bonking on the ceiling.

This is the big potential improvement but enemy spawns could render that benefit moot.
