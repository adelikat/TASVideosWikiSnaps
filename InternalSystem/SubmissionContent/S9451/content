If Mario clips into a block while jumping, what may happen is that Mario will warp to the top of that block (the block can't be more than 4 blocks high from where Mario jumped, if it is, it won't work). The interesting thing is the that if there are multiple blocks stacked on top of each other, Mario will clip and end up on the top one. Even though this saves time in the run, it doesn't really allow anything crazy to happen. One thing I must say is that this glitch is also present in the first game, but I believe it wouldn't have saved any time, mostly because that game's level design is more horizontal than this one's.

There are a lot of sections that are just barely impossible to cross without stopping for a frame or two, Mario hesitates a lot more in this movie compared to the first game. Anyway, collecting the first shine sprite (I'm numbering them based on collection order) is faster to do from the right side of the block while coming from the left. Upwarping saves a little bit of time when collecting the third shine.
