	"Robocop fell out of his bed. The Terminators. The fight with ED-209. The flying head. Had it all just been a terrible dream? Soaking wet from sweat, Robocop went to the fridge to get some cool oil, only to find out that he was all out of it. Robocop sighed. It was time for the weekly trip to the auto mechanics. Dirty work, but it had to be done. He still had vague memories of his dream in the back of his head. All the blood and gunfights. Robocop shook his head. It was just a dream.

In some strange way, I gained 3 frames in this level, possibly because having the Rocket Launcher when grabbing the last ladder before the rail. As usual, the Grenade Launcher is found behind a window and nukes the first fat man.

Man, did I just construct that sentence? I sure did! The game is stupid, but it's not hamster stupid**! Random frame whoring gained 12 frames, and the boss shows his best side as always. The dead side. 82 ahead.
