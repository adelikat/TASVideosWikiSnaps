	"I used an editor to give max stats to one batter and one pitcher.
	$LF
	"The only drawback to the editor is you can only select the ones digit, the thousandths digit in the batting average, and the hundredths digit in the earned run average. This was not the problem in the NES original, but was addressed in later sequels.
	$LF
	"The improvements to the editor include changing the color of the team's uniforms, editing the team name starting with the first letter, and earned run averages don't need to be distributed completely.
