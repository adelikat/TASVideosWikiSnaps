	"Normy's Beach Babe-o-Rama is a pretty simple platformer despite its goofy name and visuals. The character moves generally very slowly, but there's a dash, so not all is lost. The collision physics are notably glitchy at times, leading to a few interesting skips in some levels. The most annoying thing in this game is how your health does not replenish automatically between levels, so planning damage is a bigger hassle than it needs to be. I was mostly inspired to run this game because the current run is 5 yrs old and the sound was pretty awful at times courtesy of Gens, and ended up saving way more time than I expected to.

	"Most of the time saved here comes from the jumping on the pigs being vastly improved. If you let go of B when you're in the air, you fall down a bit quicker, so there's much less airtime while bouncing on them. There's an interesting moment near the end of the level where I bounce off three pigs in succession to skip a moment where, in the last run, two pigs had to be climbed up to get to the boss. The boss is defeated quicker with a mixture of dash attacks+rocks.

	"Around the start of the second screen, I stop and wait for a bit while on a moving platform. This is so I can land on the pig high enough to bounce up to the second with just one jump. The boss is defeated much, much faster, turns out she isn't invincible at all to dash attacks.

	"Although not especially significant, there's a new skip at the start of this level. By taking damage from a monkey throwing bananas while dashing at the same time, we fall through the stairs. The miniboss (and lengthy elephant ride) is skipped too by using hidden platforms and then dash-jumping to climb over the barrier. The boss is a pain to deal with because of how unpredictable and barely manipulatable he is, but he does go down quicker.

	"Hey, it's the level that had awful sound in the previous movie :) There are several pigs in this level that can be used to bypass those long, long elevator sequences, and we use two here (one near the start & one in the spaceship). nitrogenesis took a detour in the previous run to get a weapon that fires three shots instead of one, which isn't really necessary since the regular weapon you get does the same amount of damage.

	"I enter this level with much more health than the previous run does, which leads to more opportunities to damage boost. For example, less time is spent having to kill off the gym teachers, since we can just take damage and bypass them. (Also, by bouncing off of a pig, we can skip a section.) I also damage boost past a rope climb section where there's fire on the ground but only where taking damage wouldn't cause Normy to grab the rope anyway.
