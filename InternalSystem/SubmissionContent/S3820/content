	"This is New Super Mario Bros wii warped submission! NSMBwii is SMB game on wii. It's similiar as Super Mario Bros 3. But more interesting. New enemies, new items and Mario's new skills. There are a lot of stages in this game. And some secret stages. Sometimes these secret stages can be faster than normal stages. Such as 8-7. Also, the game is a little hard. And much harder than NSMB2 on 3ds. Stages are not short, too.

	"5-3: I didn't choose 5-2. Because 5-3 is faster. I wait for a moment at first. In order to tread first enemy succesfully. If I fly to go across it, time will be slower.

	"While this was a good first run, I think a first TAS of this should be significantly better. Soig, I've seen a bunch of your other TASs, and I know you're capable of a much better job. I hope to see you submit a better run. Till then, rejecting.
