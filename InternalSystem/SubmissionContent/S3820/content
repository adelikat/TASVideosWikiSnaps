	"This is New Super Mario Bros wii warped submission! NSMBwii is SMB game on wii. It's similiar as Super Mario Bros 3. But more interesting. New enemies, new items and Mario's new skills. There are a lot of stages in this game. And some secret stages. Sometimes these secret stages can be faster than normal stages. Such as 8-7. Also, the game is a little hard. And much harder than NSMB2 on 3ds. Stages are not short, too.
