For some reason, aliens always have an incredible variety of weapons at their disposal: death rays, regenerating tails that detach to soar like rockets toward their enemies; or perhaps toxic, sulfuric breath. It's a wonder the humans ever win. But this time, we have your, the official Spy Defender, to help humankind.

During the creation of this bridge, it is helpful to force the "Black" satellite to spawn on a side that helps to collect it quickly. That way, you can continue to drop more pieces...without delay. If you own a number of pieces that can complete the bridge, you must race to the bottom so that you can get the "Spy" to start walking across quickly. While getting this refill of pieces, you must continue shooting enemies so that the "Black" satellite will spawn faster. Because you have to wait for it, you can remain up higher to battle the enemies until the last few pieces can be filled in.
