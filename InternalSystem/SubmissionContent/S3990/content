	"You rush to the first possible place where you can abuse a game breaking glitch which triggers the ending credits (or various scene related subroutines) by using the Stone ability in water. While Stone Kirby will turn back into Kirby upon touching the surface of the water, entering a pool of water from below or from the side causes the game to crash. However, on the last frame before the game crashes, you can press Start and a few other buttons to manipulate the game to jump to the credits instead.

[p 
	"Other than that, there were various little tricks thrown in by the 6 TASers like subpixel positioning, removing enemies at lowest cost to save lag frames, dashing at cliffs, bunnyhopping to maintain movement speed, optimizing jumping lengths and inhaling, comparing different routes (sometimes you need to be slower to be faster) and rolling suitable RNGs.

After a moment of decision, I spent the rest of my afternoon and night creating the 39.07 run, submitting it before I went to bed. This was definitely a challenge for me, as I had no experience with a game like this and didn't know how to optimize it quite as well as, say, MESHUGGAH did. I did the best I could though, and submitted it thinking it wasn't very improvable.
