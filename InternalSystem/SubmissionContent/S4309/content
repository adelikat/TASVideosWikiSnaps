[ul

		" It is quite suboptimal, and can be improved a lot. This is demonstrated by some members in the submission thread. With some testing of my own, I concluded that on the first "Test your skill" stage, it is possible without much effort to get the timer to stop at 7.2s, whereas your run gets a time of 5.8s - a loss of 1.4 seconds on a minigame that lasts less than 15 seconds. This is way too much to be acceptable on the site.

	]li
	[li 
		" The goal choice seems quite arbitrary, as there are more phases after the 20th. Reportedly, the game ends in a loop at phase 99, so a run eligible for the Vault should make it up to and complete that round.

	]li
	[li 
		" The run uses the Mario Bros. Classic rerelease from Europe, which seems to have no merits over the traditional version aside from some extra screens showing off the enemies. It is generally preferred to use a NTSC (USA/Japan) release if available. See:
