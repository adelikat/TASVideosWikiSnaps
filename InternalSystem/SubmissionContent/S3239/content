	"Tool-assisted speedrun of Normy's Beach Babe-o-Rama, extremely fast-paced platformer developed by EA for the Sega Genesis, based on a comic strip titled "Making It." This game is very obscure but makes for an awesome TAS mostly because Normy can move very fast.

	"This game is weird. The levels are strange, the enemies are bizzare, the weapons are abnormal, and the main character is unusual. But he has a dash! It's used nearly everywhere, and it makes him move like a bat out of hell. You also become virtually invincible, as any enemy you hit while dashing only makes Normy bump back a little - it doesn't do damage or anything, and if you hit "A" the first frame Normy collides with the enemy, the bump will be ignored and Normy will continue to dash forward, which costs no time.
	$LF

[p 
	"It all seems rather puissant, no? The game designers must have realized this, so they added a "dash meter" (probably isn't the official name but who cares, that's what I'm going to refer it by) which can be seen in the bottom left corner, resembling a speedometer. Whenever Normy uses his dash, the meter will start fill up with red for every few frames Normy is on the ground dashing. I was able to watch the RAM value for the dash meter 
	[tt 
		"00FFB0A9
	]tt
	" so I could make sure that it didn't increase when I didn't want it to. The maximum it goes to is 8, at which Normy will be unable to dash until the meter decreases. But however, I found a way to avoid this. By jumping, Normy's speed will be kept, and the meter won't increase! This is the reason for all the constant jumping in this TAS.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"It's important to plan health and when Normy takes damage. Like I said above, when dashing, Normy will only be bumped back a bit by minor enemies. But however, natural traps, like the lava in stage 1, will damage Normy no matter what, and since health never refills unless Normy dies (never happens). So it was very important to plan when it would be faster to take damage.
