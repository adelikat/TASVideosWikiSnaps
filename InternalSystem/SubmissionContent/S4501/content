	": Putting aside the fact that Navi mode (and the alternate soundtrack it provides) wasn't picked (which is primarily cosmetics anyway), this run actually makes a pretty good show of what Mega Man 2 would be like without the zipping breaking the game (at least, horizontal zipping). It also gives some of the unused weapons, such as the Crash Bomb and Atomic Fire, a lot more love, which is quite nice. Accepting for Moons.
