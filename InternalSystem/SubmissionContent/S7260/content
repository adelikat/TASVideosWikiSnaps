	"This movie improves Chatterbox's TAS by 2 frames (Making The Time 4:54.70) by having a faster 2nd room (Walljump room) and 4th room (Water room) of 8-4. I will explain how we improved it in a bit, but for now let's discuss the movie level by level.

	"As you see in the warpzone we did 2 different clips I did a "blazit clip" which you charge into the wall and clip in with 1 or more jumps, as suppose to Mario did a top clip which you get near to the edge of the pipe to press left and clip in (Take Note That You Need To Be In Walking Speed Because The Pipe Is Low). I did a seperate cip for Luigi because ofcourse, entertainment and to slow him down because again we need Luigi and Mario to be at sync to go down the pipe.

	"4-2
	$LF
	"This level is very interesting, Normally we do 2 bumps, blazit clip, mana clip etc. but we cant do that here because the faster scrolling of the screen makes that impossible to go fast enough. So we opted to go for the vine warp as other TAS'sers used. We do the vine warp by letting the screen scroll up until to the point if that we touched the vine it will warp/teleport us to the far right and give us enough Xpos (X Position) for the wrong warp to work.

	"I really took my time to make this level to make it look entertaining as possible. First of we kill enemies to manipulate the bullet bill launcher to shoot a bullet bill fast enough to save the TAS 8-2 framerule.
	$LF
	"After we got a shot, enjoy to see a million wall jumps made by Mario and Luigi while not falling to the pit. After that Mario needs to hit the block to do the bullet bill glitch as well as Luigi doing the flagpole glitch at the same time. If Mario hits the block first and the 2nd frame luigi touches the block (doing flagpole glitch) the game will just softlock and will not be able to continue any gameplay, waiting for the timer to run down is not an option since the timer freezes.

	"8-3
	$LF
	"Very normal completion of 8-3 except we do a slowdown at the end doing a walljump to do a flagpole glitch because if we don't do the slowdown and just straight up do the flagpole glitch we would lose time because it will give us 3 fireworks at the result of the timer ending at a 243 and thus losing time. Although Using L+R TAS Acceleration we can just be fast enough to get a 244 and not get fireworks but would still get the slowdown with fpg framerule by grabbing the flag at the top. But doing a flagpole glitch without slowdown and also using the mentioned L+R Acceleration will give you 3 fire works because you waste time clipping into the block
