	"Throughout the entire run, the slot-machine is manipulated to produce positive results. The result of a spin is determined by the moment it starts spinning and the current value in a (Pseudo) Random Number Generator (PRNG). Thus by stopping the current spin early, one can manipulate the next spin (since it will be started earlier). By examining the game code (thanks Nitrodon) it was possible to construct a LUA script to predict the outcome of the PRNG and hence the frame to stop the current spin in order to get the desired result. Consequently, the maximum number of continues is achieved and invincibility is available whenever nessecary.

[p 
	"The Warners walk in predefined lanes. While airborn, the warners can only change one lane. When changing from a lane while standing on ground to a lane that has no ground (or a lower), one can continue 'walking on air' until the new lane is reached. By jumping at that exact frame, one can start a jump that counts as if it was started in the new lane, hence a second lane-change can be done.
