	"Super Smash Bros. Brawl is a fighting game released for the Nintendo Wii in 2008. While its core mechanics are the same as its predecessors (Where the genre’s traditional health bar is replaced with a percent counter, with the goal of knocking opponents off the stage instead of reducing their HP to zero), Brawl changed many aspects of the game from Super Smash Bros. Melee, and is considered the “slowest” game in the series as a result of some of them. Brawl is also the first game in the series to have a dedicated story mode, called “The Subspace Emissary”, and is the main focus of this TAS.

Pressing the A button in combination with the control stick allows characters to attack with a variety of moves (Including Jabs, Tilt attacks, and Smash attacks on the ground, and aerial attacks in the air), and pressing the B button in the same manner allows unique Special attacks to be used. The Z button is used to grab opponents, and the L/R buttons are used to shield against or dodge enemy attacks. The C-Stick allows Smash Attacks to be used on the ground, and aerial attacks in the air.

Enough about the RNG was known for me to make an RNG brute-forcing Lua Script - many of the spectacles in this TAS would have been considered impossible without it.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The RNG’s RAM address is 0x805A1E8C, with values taking the form of a 4-Byte Hexadecimal. New RNG values are almost always generated by taking the preexisting value, multiplying it by 0x41C64E6D, adding 0x3039, and using the last eight digits (The lone exception is during room transitions, where the last value generated has its last two digits floored to zero, making the RNG “jump” from one sequence to another). The RNG value changes many times in a single frame, with the exact amount depending on the amount of things calling it (Many enemies on the screen at once bring the call-per-frame number to over 40, for example). Numerous player actions also change the RNG (Generating dust from running, jumping, attacking, pausing and unpausing, etc.), which makes manipulating it a relatively quick process.
	$LF

	$LF
]h3
[div class=p 
	"On the frame an enemy is defeated, they drop a random item the character can use. The general item probabilities are dependant on the enemy itself (With specific enemies having their own individual item pools), the stage or room one is in (With some specific items not showing up at all, like Super Mushrooms in most of The Battlefield Fortress), and the game’s difficulty (With higher difficulties increasing the chances of Trophy Stands and Stickers dropping, for example). As RNG is called numerous times per frame, and that every value corresponds to its own item, many items are initially “trapped” in-between frames, requiring RNG manipulation to make them appear on a whole frame. Notably, pausing and unpausing the game up to three frames before an enemy dies prevents the RNG from moving up to six values (Two values per pause frame) in comparison to normal; this means a given frame of enemy death has four different item outcomes - one regular outcome, and three pause outcomes. Exclusive to fight areas, running advances the RNG once for every frame the run is active, making it even easier to manipulate.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The item that an enemy drops is determined by converting the RNG value into an integer, generally with bounds between 0 and 1000. The value is then compared against the item pool’s corresponding list, where each item has a specific value; the first item with a value smaller than the RNG’s value is what spawns.
	$LF

This leads to an intended mechanic where attempting to damage boost all over the place is met with being KO’d from the camera’s frozen blastzones. However, the developers missed some important details that allowed me to do exactly what they wanted to prevent.

	"At first, it was believed that only electric attacks were capable of unintended behavior: If one gets hit by an electric attack and SDIs into a wall or ceiling before hitstun ends, the camera doesn’t freeze, and the player flies through the level. I found out later that it works with all attack types, but that non-electric attacks have much tighter timing (Getting a wall or ceiling bounce on the first frame of hitstun, instead of any frame of hitstun like electric attacks). They also have the added requirement of the player needing to move directly into a wall or ceiling the instant the attack hits; the trick doesn’t work if the character is frozen in hitlag or not moving in general, unless the wall or ceiling itself is moving.

	"This occurs because the game only explicitly freezes the camera if the character is in the neutral “taking damage” animation; immediately entering a wall or ceiling bounce (Or in the event of hitting a Jyk, air-dodging on the frame of impact) skips this animation, and doesn’t freeze the camera. Because this technique always (Except the rare Jyk scenario I mentioned) requires you to be in the wall or ceiling bounce animation, I’ve decided to name it “Bounce Boosting”, for a shorthand of “Wall-Bounce Damage Boost” or “Ceiling-Bounce Damage Boost”.

The camera’s own blastzones also still exist, which means moving far away enough from an enemy causes it to despawn. This is used in many areas to completely skip past a fight.

The camera tries to remain centered on any notable objects of interest, which include the player, enemies, specific items like Blast Boxes and Super Mushrooms, trophy characters in the Subspace 1 and Subspace 2 levels, and some 100% collectibles. Otherwise, the camera disregards everything else, including previously set scrolling limits from areas in the room and autoscrollers.

While there are some rooms where Peach’s slow falling speed and relatively low running speed make her slower than other characters like Captain Falcon, these instances are incredibly minor in comparison to how outrageously fast she is everywhere else.

	]li
]ul
[ul

	"The last thing to mention about the Maze is that the 
	[b 
		"route
	]b
	" is now different to what it was before, in utter defiance of the status quo. The shadow character fights are, generally, unidirectional - you can only fight them by entering a single possible door, and when you complete the fight, you’re either spawned back in the same location you entered with the fight door gone, or spawned in a new location with a bidirectional door passage now unlocked. Every character fight follows this trend.

	"Thanks to the setting of the lower left quadrant’s hub area, where there’s repeated instances of backtracking to the same area and going to different doors, I needed to test every possible combination of “hub-room movements”, with the Pokemon Trainer’s bidirectional doors in mind too, to see if the (then) current route was the fastest, or if something else was faster.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"It was ultimately found that going to Wario’s door first, going to Zelda through the middle door of The Ruins room, backtracking through its entire section to fight the Pokemon Trainer “in reverse”, and then Bounce Boosting to Lucas’ door is about 50 frames faster than going to the Pokemon Trainer first, then Zelda, then Wario, then Lucas - all other rooms considered equal.

	"Eventually, I reach Tabuu. And promptly pluck a frame perfect Stitch Face without any intentional RNG manipulation - the correct RNG seed occurred from Peach doing absolutely nothing at the end of Ganondorf’s fight. With this slight head start and pulling out literally every single trick in the book I have at my disposal, I’m able to do the previously unthinkable and quick-kill Tabuu just a couple of frames before his first attack actually activates - the final boss on the hardest difficulty is destroyed in a little over four seconds. The game is now completed, and I can finally walk away from any% for a while.

The time for a particular room always starts on the first non-black or non-loading frame, and ends on the first frame of the door opening/fade to black/hoop bubble disappearing/enemy death/boss’ health reaching zero (Depending on the room). The time for an entire level starts at the finished “Stage Clear!” screen of the preceding level, and ends at the level’s own finished “Stage Clear!” screen. Timing for the two sticker applications starts on the first frame the sticker menu appears, and ends on the frame the map menu is seen again.

But unfortunately, I still came across a small number of potential improvements; Specific things include a Smash Attack Boost at Sea of Clouds Room 1 (Which is a 70 frame timesave, RNG permitting), getting a better Smash Attack Boost at Forest Room 1 (So I can just Ground Pound to the end instead of needing to Egg Throw and fall normally), and other miscellaneous improvements just like the last time. I’m probably going to end up doing this again at some point, but at least this time I can knowingly stop for a long while. The question of “Can this sub-56” is also still very much up in the air, unless another major skip happens. Hey, it happened after the last time, so I won’t be surprised at all if it happens after this one too.
