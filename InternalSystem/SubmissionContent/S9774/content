	""There are three viruses of different colors—blue, yellow and red—each standing beside a vial containing fluid of the same color. Dr. Mario has to defeat the viruses by draining their vials completely using capsules. To toss a pill somewhere, the player has to initiate a sliding cursor on a "Toss Meter" and, as it moves back and forth, stop it on a certain area on that meter. If the cursor lines up with a colored spot on the meter, Dr. Mario lands a pill in the vial with fluid of that color. In order to decrease the fluid in a vial, the pill has to match its color; if the player lands the wrong color, the fluid inside the vial increases instead, reviving the corresponding virus if it is already dead, or stays unaffected if the vial is full. A minimum of four pills are needed to fully drain a vial. To win, all three viruses have to be dead simultaneously. The end screen shows the time it took the player to beat the game and offers them to replay it or visit the "Dr. Mario / Puzzle League" website."

	"I swear next time I'll TAS a bigger game. I was actually working on a Super Brawl 2 TAS but then a tiny power outage that lasted like 3 seconds happened and I lost all my progress... that sucked. Eventually I'll finish it and submit it (not to mention other Flash games later). Stay tuned!
