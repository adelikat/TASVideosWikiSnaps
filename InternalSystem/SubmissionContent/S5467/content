	"In Bubble-oh-seven's third game, our villain Dr.Maybe has amassed a rat army to pillage the treasure of the moon.  Or more specifically, the stiltonium found inside of the moon's cheese.  To destroy his operations, we need to clear out all his mines, as well as blowing up all his stiltonium machines.  Trying to defeat the final boss without these will simply result in him bragging that his mines are still up, and the game not actually completing.

	[b 
		"Hitbox Rotation
	]b
	" :  While jumping around certain corners, you may notice Pond maintains his rotational movement, which really messes up his hitbox.  It results in him being able to pass through thin walls, but only during the limited time frame that it takes for him to do one complete revolution.  Obviously in order for this to be useful, we need a potential wall to use as a shortcut, a nearby corner to trigger the glitch, as well as enough speed to transfer through it in sufficient time.  As such, only ~2 levels can benefit from this.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Ceiling Clips
	]b
	":  Dropping an object beneath you while at the height of your jump will cause Pond to stand on it, which can be used for an additional jump point. Trying to do this while against a ceiling will wedge Pond inside, while still allowing some basic movement.  We can accelerate both left and right, and in this glitched state can even pass through certain walls.

[p 
	[b 
		" TNT Preservation
	]b
	":  In many spots, you will see TNT packs used to destroy the environment to create entrance ways, yet it turns out that the TNT explosion itself is not responsible.  The ground has its own separate hitbox, which extends above that of the TNT pack.  This means careful timing with dynamite can open up the pathways without the corresponding explosion.  This saves both time, and health.

	"This is an improvement of 17072 frames (4m:44s) over the previous submission.  Improvements are from better speed preservation, proper acceleration to the ground during jumps, proper fuse timing, level resets, and a nice overworld reroute.  Each level can only finish periodically every 4 frames, and thus that is the smallest improvement which can be shown for each level.  Collecting the blue minimap token will provide extra routes to hidden levels, needed for proper overworld routing and to actually access the ones with the necessary stiltonium machines.  Most levels get completed simply by reaching the exit, but certain ones require you to find the 4 teacups before it becomes active.  Naturally this is only done when necessary.  Both the minimap, and teacups will remain collected if you choose to reset the level, which helps in a few places.
