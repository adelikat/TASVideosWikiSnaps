	(__wikiLink|displaytext=in this post|href=/Forum/Posts/509637)
	", this game is not trivial to TAS optimally, so it doesn't make sense to reject it because it formally matches a description of a banned genre. As well as the whole clause about visual novels and "Choose your own adventure" games. So we removed that clause from Standard rules. Triviality is enough to resolve those.

	" I explained why this ending is acceptable. You can't avoid it even if you try to fully complete all stories, so it can't be considered improper. It's similar to what Ghosts'n'Goblins does: you beat the game once, it tells you to play further, then you get the final ending after beating it twice. In this movie's ending, the host tells you that there's more to accomplish, but he says about "tonight's entertainment" and "your enjoyment" in past tense. He doesn't say "no no, this is all fake, you failed". So this goal is valid for this game.
