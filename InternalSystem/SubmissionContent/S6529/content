	"The previous submission was done using BizHawk 1.11.4 which utilized a different input format for Coleco games than BizHawk 2.3.2.  Due to this, inputs from that submission had to be manually converted to the new format to even be read properly and copied into modern BizHawk.  When appropriate, these converted inputs were used for some stages of this submission.

I have included BrunoVisnadi in authorship credits as his stage inputs served as the basis for the remaining 5 stages.  Some of these have minor (less than 5) variations in routing/frame count.  If he'd prefer not to be included in authorship, he can remove himself.

	$LF
	"1) Delayed movement - Either delaying frames when beating the previous level, or delaying steps pre-suicide to alter a fall pattern.  
	$LF
	"2) Pause/Resume - Pausing and resuming the game alters RNG (likely in a similar way to delaying movement, just using a different mechanism).  This method allows for manipulation of fall patterns mid fall instead of just manipulating when the fall begins.

[div class=p 
	"As a few of the levels have significant RNG dependent variables (i.e. bomb placement in 'Blackout'), it's possible that beating prior levels earlier or even later could yield better RNG patterns than I was able to manipulate.  This could result in a net faster run even if earlier stages themselves would be slower.  Testing this theory would be rather tedious in my opinion.
