	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"I've wanted to do a Shining Force run for 3 years now. You can look at the history of the TAS board and at shiningforcecentral.com to see my post from many years ago, asking about this run. It wasn't a possibility until Upthorn created the movie/frame advance/decompiler version of Gens, allowing me to disassemble every aspect of the game. Using my history with MATLAB, I created many different programs to simulate the results of every random possibility. Then, the next step was the long, interesting task of TASing an epic strategy game. I spent countless hours figuring out the best possible approach to every battle. Each battle attempt takes around 5 hours, and it often took 2 to 4 attempts to get a battle correct. 
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Shining Force
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Shining Force is a turn-based strategy RPG. Every round of battle, the Player and CPU take interleaved turns, determined by the 
	[b 
		"Battle Order
	]b
	", to try and destroy the opponent. Your team can be comprised of 12 of the 30 possible warriors found through out the game. The game usually takes 8-10 hours to play all the way through. Large amounts of time is wasted when playing the game normally, because every attack animation on either side takes at least 7 seconds to perform. Therefore, minimizing the number of attacks is essential to maximize the speed of the run   
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Luck manipulation and MATLAB
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"All luck manipulation can be performed with the controller. There is a 16 byte value (0-65535) at FF0EC2 which can be incremented from 1 to 255 by different button combinations. Thus, there are 65536 different possible random outcomes at any given time. MATLAB was used to simulate every one of these outcomes. Additionally, MATLAB was programmed to tell me the exact button presses to achieve the "random" outcome I desired. Surprisingly, I was able to minimize the number of times that I have to wait for the counter to get to the random outcome I wanted. The only time it is noticeable is in Battle 20, Bleu waits about 1/5th of second to correctly manipulate battle order.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Battle Order
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Manipulating the Battle Order was the key to obtaining the ridiculous speed of this run, and lack of enemy attacks. Like noted before, the Battle Order determines the order in which the CPU/player take turns, based on the characters agilities. Thus, the most important part of the run was selecting the best Battle Order out of the 65536 possible. Now, it would have been ridiculous to try and look through all of those. So, I created a program to help me "shop" for the best battle order. I set it up to allow me to look for groupings of characters, look for one character to perform before another, or to look for the earliest character movement. This usually allowed me to narrow down the choices to 2-10 different options. B
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The choosing of each Battle Order was no small task. The priorities in which Battle Order was chosen was:
	$LF
]p
[ol 
	[li 
		" Avoid enemy attacks
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Group close characters together
		$LF

]ol
[p 
	"Thus, when priority 1 takes precedent, the cursor will be forced to bounce around the screen often. This is extremely noticeable in the Colossus battle, which I will discuss later. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Additionally, the question is often raised, "Why not kill more enemies to reduce cursor movement and enemy turns?" The major reason being that each enemy turn takes approximately 1 second, plus the cursor movement. Killing an enemy takes 7 seconds of battle animation, plus the time to move a character to the enemy. Since battles rarely go beyond 3-4 rounds, the only enemies that are killed are those which would otherwise attack me, wasting the 7 seconds anway, or are necessary to end the battle.   
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Enemy AI
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The AI in this game is based completely on locational threshold crossings. Thus, to manipulate the AI to be stupid, you have to know where these thresholds are. Battle 3 is a great example of this. Max stops right before the threshold for the 5 knights to move, and then takes two consecutive turns (achieved by being at the end of a round, and beginning of the next) to pass the knights with them never moving. In the following battle explinations, this will be used often. 
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Programming Glitches
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Two glitches were abused in this game. First, the BOOST spell (provided by the power ring) ends after 3-4 turns. However, as long as the character is not attacked or does not gain a level, the BOOST spell lasts indefinitely. Thus, a character can kill up to 3 enemies post-BOOST with the elevated attack. This is abused considerably through the entire run. Additionally, the mobility ring can be unequipped at the end of a turn, without losing the ground gained by it previously being equipped. The start of the movie also has Max leaving town without obtaining the first 5 members of the force. Whether or not this was intentionally available is debatable. 
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Promotion
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Only 4 characters are promoted in this run. Promotion is the double-edged sword of the game. First, the actual time it takes to promote a character is extremely long, since the game has to play music to promote. Second, characters are absolutely DECIMATED post promotion. Additionally, the first 3 level gains of any promoted character are extremely poor. The only reason characters are promoted in this run at all is to be able to equip the higher level weapons. The actual statistics of the characters don't greatly benefit from promotion given the low post-promotion levels achieved (aside for one: Max's Agility). Therefore, characters other than Max are only promoted when a new super-powerful weapon is available. For Gort, it is the Heat Axe, for Pelle, the Halberd, and Balbaroy, the Broad Sword. Earnest goes unpromoted, since his only purpose post Chapter 6 is to kill one High Priest, and stop the Armed Skeleton in Dark Dragon battle from regenerating. Musashi can not be promoted (thankfully). All other characters are eliminated before they would ever need a promotion. It may be arguable that buying a steel sword and promoting Amon would make battle 20 faster. However, the Power ring takes 8 seconds to use. It takes well over 30 seconds to promote a character, and that doesn't include the time to buy and equip a new weapon. Additionally, the hit to her agility would have killed her ability to attack Mages before they attack her.

Luckily, her death distracts one of the bats, minimizing the number of useless attacks. An interesting note. At the end of round 2, Gort crosses the bridge. This is a threshold which causes the Mage and archers to start moving down. Once they start, they don't stop their planned movement. However, if Max or Mae were to cross the second bridge/threshold, they would never move. They are moved downwards for the convience of Max and Mae.

If someone does not enter the top-lower (below the stairs) part of the ship before the conch's turn, they will move. If anyone moves past the 2 anchor lines, they will move. Hence, the 4 force members that kill them need to take double turns, to get there and kill them to end the battle. If the spot where they stand is open at the end of the round, the shellfish will appear, unless the end of the round ends the battle. The Shellfish never appear :) There is some standing around in round 2 to wait until everyone can make the move downwards.

The mobility ring glitch and the BOOST glitch are used extensively. On balbaroy's 2nd to last turn, he equips the mobility ring, moves to his new spot, equips the power ring, and the BOOST spell ends. If he tried to equip the power ring on the next turn, the BOOST spell glitch would end. The cursor bounces around for the 4th and 5th battle round, quite a bit. This is because the earliest Balbaroy can move/attack is 11th! Only one order exists which he is 11th, which is used for both the 4th and 5th round. This avoids the 2 jets below him from getting into range to attack him, much less even moving! Unfortunately, he could not go before the one Jet hence why it follows him.
