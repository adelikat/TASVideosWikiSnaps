	"From the manual: "Joe must find his way through the 16 rooms to get out of this nightmare. He will come across the floating eyeballs, Frankie the mutant Frankensteiner student ghost, Dracula, blood and fire dripping from paintings, ghouls and goblins , and even the dreaded Brainiac, a mysteriously deceased lunatic brain surgeon, who was whispered to have performed surgery on himself after his license was taken away. To get out off each room, Joe has to find the clue to the hidden passageways and secret staircases. To help you overcome these, please bear the following in mind:

If they appear, your heartbeat fastens until a coronary follows. Escaping from their scary spell is the only remedy!
