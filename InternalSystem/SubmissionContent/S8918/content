	"In this game, you usually jump using the jump button (in this case it's A and C), but there are many situations where pressing the A button doesn't trigger a jump (Swimming, escaping wind/ice, etc...). There are only two situation that aren't explicitly jumps, yet I still count them as jumps. Those situations are: Whenever you jump out of a body of water, and whenever you jump out of monkey bars (by pressing the jump button). The former one is required to beat the game, while the latter would just make it faster

This is still my favorite stage in the challenge though.
