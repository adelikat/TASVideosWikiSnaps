	"Well, I promised that I would TAS a G3 MlP game, so here it is! This is what you guys meant, right? Btw, you can't skip any of the minigames, unlike the first game for the GBA.

	"4 Ponies, Toola-Roola, Rainbow Dash, Sweetie Belle, and Starsong starts a fetch quest that when talked to, makes a present pop out of a house as shown on the minimap. During these epic quests, you CANNOT start any minigames at all; This is the reason why I had to backtrack to Toola-Roola, Rainbow Dash, and Starsong so I can complete their respective minigames.

	"The final minigame I manipulate the butterflies to be close together so I can draw triangles to catch them all. Then I made a poorly done drawing of G3 Pinkie.

	": Even with the introduction of the vault, there are still some standards. Gameplay must stand out from non-assisted play, and it must be a "serious game". This TAS does not meet these requirements in a satisfying way. Rejecting.
