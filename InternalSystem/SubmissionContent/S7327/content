	"Hi there! I noticed that my last submission (which was a TAS of Contra) got rejected. I realized that this is because there are SO MANY SUBMISSIONS OF CONTRA! So, I decided to take a different approach, and TAS a game that nobody's done one of before. I hope you enjoy this bite sized TAS!

	"While I am not 100% sure on how efficient the route taken through this layout is, I do believe it could be improved. The author seems to seek out some matches that are closer to each other, at least early on. This results in multiple frame movements reaching the first of each pair. Optimally, one would always only move one tile after each match. It feels almost like they went for easier matches initially but since the layout is static once the game begins, it is trivial to know the locations of all tiles (I took a screenshot after finishing it personally) and there is no real need for this.

	"Finally, the layout itself can be different depending on RNG. So far I found that waiting on the title screen can change the RNG value. There is a very low probability that the layout in this TAS is remotely optimal considering this.
