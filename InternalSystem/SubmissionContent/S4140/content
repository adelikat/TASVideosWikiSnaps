	"After I saw Wersterlobe’s AGDQ 2013 Pokemon Gold run, I became very interested in the bad clone and map distortion route. I played around with it and did a few real time runs, but that was it. Lately I’ve taken greater interest and wanted to try making a well optimized run of the current real time route. I started a run in Bizhawk, but stuff went wrong so I restarted on Lsnes which worked much better for this game.

For the most part luck can be manipulated by delaying input for a few frames at very specific times. Wild encounters can sometimes be manipulated based on your movement patterns.

With this glitched Pokémon in your party it is possible to move a 7 th Pokémon from a box into your party. Afterwards, you can withdraw a large number of Pokémon (this has a total of 27 Pokémon at once). Upon withdrawing your 30th Pokémon, the game will crash and distort the colors. After reloading your file you have a bunch of random pokemon in your party (not seen in this TAS, but if you scroll through then it’s quite a list), the amount of Pokemon you’ve caught/seen changes, and your team is poisoned with pokerus. There are likely some other affects I’m blanking on right now.

From a little trial and error I did, the names of your Pokémon and the amount of Pokémon you have influences what random tiles you get. For this run having 27 Pokémon, most of which are Abras named “GEODUDE” causes distortion patterns that are very favorable and allow one to get places they normally shouldn’t.

This allows me to skip using the Pokémon center since Pokémon like zubat can be manipulated into using status moves like supersonic and such. This is seen in the youngster fight.

This fight was tricky; I needed to get a crit that hit 13, a normal attack that hit 9 (which is rare) and an attack to hit 8. Since I had a maxed out speed DV I was able to tie goldeen’s speed a save some time. I’m not sure what the minimum DV you would need to tie goldeen.

It is possible to leave metapod with 1-2 hp allowing him to add to rage, but I could never get a rage to 1 hit Scyther so just koing it was the way to go. I found that while fighting scythe it was just barely possible to hit 25 damage with my current rate (half of its total hp) meaning I could let its second fury cutter miss. Was a pain trying to manipulate 25 damage.

Zubat was a pain. With either a critical water gun or a critical scratch I was never able to 1 hit zubat (I tried for a long time, it might be possible with a maxed special DV, but that’s only 2 values higher and might not have changed anything). 2 scratches proved to be fastest.

If it was moved to the party by using the “withdraw” option, it would become a level 1 abra which we don’t want. Giving the level 0 abra to the day care lady levels it up and changes it into a glitched Pokémon. This allows us to withdraw more than 6 Pokémon (in this case a party of 27 is used), the game crashes after withdrawing 30.

Likewise, distorting near the blocked off Diglett’s cave allows you to get behind Snorlax. And again, distorting next to the person blocking off Victory Road allows you past him. The game is saved and soft reset because after distorting the entry way to victory road gets blocked by garbage.

There is always a chance I missed a combination that would have had the desired affect with fewer frames. Additionally time might be savable with better map distortion patterns, but that would take a LOT of trial and error. I am also certain that having a much higher defense DV would save some time early on (less damage during the first gym), but might loose time while koing the team. Either way, I was not able to manipulate a good defense DV and great other DVs.
