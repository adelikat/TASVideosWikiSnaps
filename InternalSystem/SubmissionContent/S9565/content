	" playing BadApple, but BizHawk only allows one input per frame, so there were major issues with resolution and frame rate. Also, at this input speed, the data sent in real-time cannot be output directly to the screen in time, so the video is created by saving the data once in SRAM and rewriting the image based on it. Therefore, the capacity of the moving image depended on the storage capacity of the SRAM, and there was no choice but to create a moving image with an extremely low frame rate and resolution. Furthermore, it was extremely difficult to store even audio with such data capacity, so implementation was not possible.

	"The two runs referred to show that being able to input buttons in subframe units is a prerequisite. In this run, I reviewed the emulator and decided to use lsnes, which allows subframe-by-subframe input (I should have used this in the previous run, but I didn't know how to handle it due to my lack of knowledge). This freed me from the once-per-frame input limit and allowed me to send about 260 bytes of data per frame. The significant increase in the amount of data that could be sent solved the problems of low frame rate and resolution, and also enabled the successful output of sound.

In addition to freezing, the time required for scrolling varies because the length of the name changes depending on the method of emulation of the 0x00 toy when moving the toy column, and this causes a large difference in movement. In the early version (r0), this is not a problem because the name of the 0x00 instrument is fixed, but only in the later version is it possible to input every frame to 0xFFF5, so there is no choice but to execute it in the later version

	"To summarise pretty well what we are doing, it is a simple story of rewriting the waveform memory at the right time. How MrWint timed the rewrites is a mystery, but I was able to get the timing right. I adjust the timer interrupt to write to the 16-byte waveform memory at once, just after all 32 samples in the waveform memory have been read. The frequency of ch3 is adjusted at 
	[code 
		"65536 / x
	]code
	"Hz for all 32 samples. In this case 
	[code 
		"x = 216
	]code
	", so the audio output will be at 
	[code 
		"32 * 65536 / 216 = 9709
	]code
	"Hz. The timer interrupt on the other hand is adjusted at 
	[code 
		"262144 / y
	]code
	"Hz, this time with 
	[code 
		"y = 54
	]code
	", so the interrupt is triggered at 
	[code 
		"262144 / 54 = 4854
	]code
	"Hz. If the timing of the 16 interrupts is the same as the frequency of ch3, the audio output can be adjusted successfully. The audio output can be synchronised with the interrupts by applying the equation 
	[code 
		"x = 4y
	]code
	". The advantage of using timer interrupts is that they can be implemented separately from the screen output; MrWint 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=article|href=/5384S)
	" wrote that the rewriting of the waveform memory is synchronised to the V-Blank, but by using timer interrupts, there is no need to synchronise the image by itself and the timing can be automatically timed. This makes it possible to measure the timing automatically. This allows the sampling rate of the audio to be adjusted flexibly (although this is only a creative device and does not affect the quality of the video at all...).

Although we still have some work to do, we are happy with the improved resolution and frame rate, and the audio output. My regrets are that the video did not compress well and the audio quality is quite low. I tried my best to work on both, but with my knowledge and skills, the current quality was the limit. I am a little disappointed that I was able to surpass my previous goal, but not quite up to the quality of MrWint's and OnehundredthCoin's videos.

However this tas had a lot of effort put in evidenced by the extensive submission notes and impressive video.  The submission was enjoyed by the majority of viewers as well.  The goal is quite clear with the intent to playback Bad Apple, then immediately completes the game.

	"If Bad Apple is accepted here would we then see a glut of video playback ACE tases?  The clear answer to that is a resounding no.  The technical ceiling just for completing a game using ACE among tasers is very high.  That ceiling gets raised even further if we are talking about converting video into a form that can be played back in a tas.  There are currently only a handful of tases on the site that have video playback during ACE.  However in the future if there starts to be a massive influx of ACE video playbacks we could revisit how they are treated.  Possible solutions if that happens is to curate them more strictly.

	"There is also an argument for ACE Bad Apple not being artistically unique enough to really deserve its own branch since it has been done before.  However the counterargument to that is that ACE tases are unique in their own way due to various technical differences of the system and how the ACE is actually performed within the specific game.

This plays Bad Apple which is obviously takes more time.  This tas does not violate any of the movie rules for Alternative.  It has a clear concise non-arbitrary goal, and finishes the game after the video playback according to the rules.  So it goes to Alternative.
