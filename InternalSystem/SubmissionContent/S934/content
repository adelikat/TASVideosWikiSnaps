	"After going back and forth between a few different games, I decided to make a Megaman X3 TAS. Unlike 
	[a class=intlink href=/824S 
		"X2
	]a
	", the weapons don't make X go any faster or slower, so it's actually easier to optimize. Making a good TAS is never easy, though, as I throw in luck manipulation and weapon combinations to improve just about every boss battle in the game. Boss battles are extremely important to optimize. One less hit means one second saved.

[p 
	"To get the Beam Saber, X must first defeat Vile in his own stage (only activated when you beat 2-7 Maverick bosses) and the last hit must be either Spinning Blade or (in this case) Ray Splasher. Then in Doppler 2, Zero must defeat the bug miniboss. Although a couple minutes are lost doing this, the time is made up by the speed at which the sword kills all the remaining bosses. I am not sure whether a no-items run is faster or not.

[p 
	"Anyway, my run is faster than 
	[a class=intlink href=/653S 
		"nitsuja's run

	" by 5776 frames (1:36 faster). Saved about 10 seconds or more on each of three of the bosses, and had significant gains from other bosses. Bosses weren't the only place where I saved time; I also found various tricks in levels which saved a fair amount of time. I also cut out revisiting a level; that alone saved about 15 seconds.

Sandwiching the 10 Frost Shield shots with uncharged X-Buster shots seems faster than ending with a charged X-Buster shot, although it's not clear. I take a hit here to make sure Bit is on the ground when I deliver the final hit, so he doesn't waste time falling to the ground.

The third hit I took was to get Rhino to flash charge into the closest wall; the flash charge is unavoidable and so was taking damage.

]p
[p 
	"- How this glitch works in the Neon Tiger battle: If he is on the ground and performs his next action, he resets invincibility, regardless of how soon you hit him before. So double-shooting the X-Buster can do 2 damage. I use this to deliver 5 damage every 3 seconds.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- A glitch I stumbled across was to defeat Vile's ride armor while it was punching. Since the arm is technically a projectile, X falls onto the arm and takes damage, allowing control when Vile charges up. Not only does this allow me to hit Vile on the earliest possible frame, but it allows me to make delayed hits with the Ray Splasher so I don't have to get so close.

I used charged/uncharged X-Buster, but I had to get hit 5 times, bringing my health down to 2 (no hits to give). The worst Catfish attack was his Triad Thunder, but it was necessary to keep him from not only flopping around, but delaying him just enough to bring him down to 2 health before he supercharges. And when he supercharges, it resets invincibility to Tornado Fang (if you were wondering how I took off the last 4 bars so fast).

	"- If Crawfish is hit with the Triad Thunder, after 60 frames, he loses invincibility and for over a second has absolutely no recovery. I use this time to shoot him down with X-Buster autofire. I take damage because I don't want to get hit by his shooting claw and I jump because I don't want him to charge (he would grab and stun X even when X is invincible).

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- I use Ray Splasher/X-Buster combo on Gravity Beetle. There is an invincibility glitch such that if Beetle is using a flash charge, a Ray Splasher hit immediately stops the Beetle flashing 
	[b 
		"and
	]b
	" resets invincibility, and a second hit does damage. Normally, he jumps too low to pull off an X-Buster/Ray Splasher quick double hit, but when he makes a huge Gravity Well, his jumps take longer and I can make the quick double hit for 5 damage.

The C4 Wheel miniboss is the reason why I started with Buffalo and Seahorse.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- Instead of using the useless (in a speedrun) Gravity Well on Hornet, how about Spinning Blade? I saved about 15 seconds on this battle alone, more than on any other level. I tried to get Hornet as low as possible for the final hit.

For some reason, the Bug's movements are totally erratic when trying to crash on Zero, and sometimes the Bug hovers on Zero's sprite for what seems like eternity until it crashes. It is best to minimize the Bug's horizontal distance it must travel to crash on Zero. Defeating the Bug at a position one or two pixels off can mean losing 40 frames.

[p 
	"- Generally, there are a couple timesavers I use here. First, the fastest way to get rid of a charged shot is to shoot it into an invincible boss. How do you make the boss invincible? Pre-hit it with a weapon like Ray Splasher or Parasitic Bomb (this only works for the first charged shot). Second, taking damage just after hitting with the slash allows faster charge-up, although I am limited by the health bar.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- Blast Hornet went fine; I found a way to take 3 damage instead of 8. No pre-hit here; it's just too awkward.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- I didn't want to take 5 damage against Blizzard Buffalo, but there was no other choice because I can't dump the second charged shot anywhere good (without taking damage). I also can't pre-hit Buffalo because he is immune to Ray Splasher, and Parasitic Bomb obviously doesn't work.

[p 
	"- Volt Catfish and Gravity Beetle go quick; I use pre-hits here.
	$LF

[p

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- Ironically, the glitch that defeated Neon Tiger faster in the first battle was the one that threw my entire plan out the window. I had planned to pre-hit Neon Tiger, take damage on his Ray Splasher, and slash him before he put up his block. As it turned out, the glitch renders the pre-hit useless, and I couldn't recover enough time to hit him fast enough. I settled with making him fly up to the wall, and I couldn't take damage.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- Against Doppler, I dump a charged shot to make him put up the green shield, then strike with the point of the Beam Saber when he takes it down. This is faster than starting the slash the moment he won't put up his shield. I also dumped the second charged shot into Doppler since he has a 90-frame invincibility, but I had to turn him around to avoid getting hit by the energy ball he fires.
