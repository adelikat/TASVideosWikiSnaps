	"The men's game has the ball actually move faster but we choose the women's game because though the ball moves slower, there are more/faster Ace opportunities per serve, but which Ace is the fastest changes per point.

	"To score a point in volleyball you must be holding serve. A point ends when the ball hits the ground (which can be in or out) or the net. If a ball goes out of play, whichever team last touched it loses the point. There are some serves where we basically just blast it off an opposing player and it lands out, giving us the point. We also occasionally get faster points with a shorter serve where the ball hits the ground but we can't do this on every point.

	"There are many serve combinations between initial throw height (low to high) impact height (high to low) and they can be modified with the D-pad to influence direction.

	"We do have to break their serve in the start of match 2 to gain control and start scoring points. We setup a spike and go back to farming Aces, finishing in about 6 minutes.
