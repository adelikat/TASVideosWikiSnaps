	"My first TAS run that i decided to make a 16 star run. It sucks a whole lot compared to others, and at most points dont seem like TAS, but oh well... I get 8 stars from the first floor, and 8 stars on the bottem. Places i could improve, are the swimming in DDD. All of the bowser stages. I probably could have gotten the BLJ's better and quicker. And a few other places i probably forgot. It tooke me about 6 hours to make this. Not that long. And maybe about 1500 rerecords. I still have a few things to learn, such as backward longjumping on the first bowser stage, jumping up through the poll on BitFS, and doing the dive thing into the slanted wall. The next thing i'm going to do, is just play around with TAS, and try to get better. Wish me luck.

	":  Fails to beat the last 16 star run by a long shot.  And of course the 16star run is long obsolete.  I am rejecting this submission.
