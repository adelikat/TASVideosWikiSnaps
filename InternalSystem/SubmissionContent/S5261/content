Unfortunately, even though it's possible to hit both on the same frame by doing this, the glitch simply does not work on the SNES version.

		" For whatever reason, it's impossible to dodge the low turtle that gets dodged after you call Zero in the PSX version. Luckily, a reverse wall jump makes the strat still faster than falling on the platform to the left and jumping across after. It's possible to jump to the right wall underwater as Zero earlier if you kill both turtles, which is what the PSX version does, but this causes too much lag to save time on SNES.

		" It was possible to saber jump up to the second snail on the left wall of the spike wall climb without a second missile damage boost, but this forces you to wall jump off the side of the snail instead of platform jump off the top of it, ending your next set of iframes too soon to make it to the next missile damage boost(the saber jump mechanics are all explained in detail in the PSX "all stages" submission text).

		" Spamming jumps after starting a saber slash can delay the saber's manifestation while still incrementing your charge timer. The charge for your second charged shot will still finish at the same time regardless, but the delay on the first hit allows you to shoot the 2nd charge shot into the boss while it is still under the effect of iframes instead of having to shoot it offscreen(which would keep the charged shot in active memory longer, delaying your ability to slash).
