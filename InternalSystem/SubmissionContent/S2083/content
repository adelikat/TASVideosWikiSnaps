	" Jabo's 1.6 was used to record the run. No current graphics plugin emulates Mischief Makers with 100% accuracy; Jabo's gives me the advantage in world 4 by not darkening the screen at all, making it easier for me to see. So far, Rice 6.1.1 Beta 10 (and Rice 6.1.4) seem to emulate it the closest, removing the yellow/blue/green outlines in backgrounds and giving the correct darkness effect in world 4; however the ground in world 2 is not right (ground/platform/background textures do not repeat correctly.) Nitsuja's modified plugin emulates world 2 perfectly (and makes the boulder in 4-01 visible), but seems to throw world 4 out of whack (unless something's wrong with my settings; the circle in the middle should be a ray of light, not a ray of dark.) If world 4 can be made to work with

[p 
	"One more part about Mischief Makers emulation is that 2-03, 2-08, and some of the events in 3-10 (100m dash, 200m dash, 400m dash, and hurdle) run at 30 FPS instead of 60 FPS because of too many sprites onscreen. This is unpreventable, and an unfortunate reduction of entertainment. You can fast forward through these, since mupen's inferior fast forwarding capabilities will make it run at a little more than 60 FPS and seem more fluent. An AVI will not fix this problem.

	"Mischief Makers is a side-scrolling 2D platform/puzzle N64 Treasure game made in 1997. Starring Ultra-Intergalactic-Cybot G Marina Liteyears, the robotic maid of the absent-minded Professor Theo. Marina is easily bamboozled from preventing Prof.'s capture, who is taken by mysterious creatures named Clancers, and it's up to Marina to save him from the evil Empire.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Marina travels on 5 different parts of the Clancer world: a grassy/desert area (world 1), a volcano (world 2), a snowy mountain (world 3), an underground cave (world 4), and aboard a battleship (world 5). Each of the worlds are split into 10 or so (depending on the world) individual stages. In each stage, you must complete objectives to grab the blue exit star and proceed to the next stage. Your time is kept track of, and a rank is given to you based on your time.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Marina can slide, jump, dash, boost, grab, throw, shake, roll, hover, and much more. Her wide array of moves and abilities, as well as her quick speed/acceleration and speed preserving capabilities, make her a very fast paced character.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The game is very fun, colorful, amusing, and a great game to speedrun due to its time-attack nature. Achieving all S ranks in the game, and also all gold gems is a very great feat of skill.

		"Nitsuja's WIP
	]a
	" was left incomplete after beating Cerberus Alpha, and no one would take it up. Well, Deign tried, and I tried with him as well. Deign found a trick, I found more tricks, and then I took over the project entirely and proceeded to spend an entire year making this movie.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I restarted this run from scratch 9 times. Every time I found new tricks that needed to be inserted into most of the stages. Each time I improved the precision, and in the final version I was satisfied. I tried to be as entertaining as possible, and also make it as optimal as I could. My goal was to create something that myself and others would have an immensely hard time obsoleting. I also tried to show off glitches when it wouldn't waste time.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When making this run, I used the TAS Input plugin, and a USB analog controller. true story, the number of buttons that I needed to hold down/press at a whim's notice was so great that, at times I needed one more digit to hold down buttons; I devised a clever solution to this problem.

His run was good, and I highly recommend everyone watch it before watching this run; the improvements will be very visible, yet his run is entertaining despite no memory watching. It really laid the foundation for how good a Mischief Makers TAS would be. I also advise watching all of the speedruns of the game (check

[h3 
	"Goals
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"In-game time is the goal of the run, rather than fastest real time. Fastest time means managing lag; the game is unfairly laggy in a few stages (aka the 30 FPS stages), avoiding lag means on some stages Boost Grabbing above the stage and flying over the entire level is fastest(which is boring), and real time also requires standing still during "lag potential areas" of the game. I felt that working hard to maximize real time frames, in a game where in-game time is more important, where the real time frame counter of mupen isn't accurate, and where I have many laggy sections that I can't prevent, would be a waste. In-game time makes more sense since each stage is given a rank based on how low the in-game time is. Also, I could spend more time showing off during waiting periods, and I also could include the time-stopping trick which improves the variety of the movie. Lastly, when making comparisons between Nitsuja's run and my own, the input frame counter was the most reliable, as was the memory address which displayed the current stage's in-game time.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"As a rule, I ignore lag; in very rare cases will I consciously try to avoid it (most notably was in 5-03 where I found a pattern of movements that prevented a heavily laggy area during the spinning spikeball section.) Sometimes I lag the game up a little bit while showing off, but I felt that showing off with a tiny bit of lag was better than just standing still.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The game gives you a rank based on what time you get. The ranks  are D, C, B, A, and S. S ranks are the best score you can get, and this run gets all S ranks.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Gold gems were avoided as much as possible. The reason for this is that at bosses, getting a gold gem after the fight increases your time because the scene where you collect the gem still has the clock running; taking damage at those bosses was done to prevent getting the gold gem. The other reason they were avoided is that there is a cutscene before the final credits, and the more gold gems you have, the longer the cutscene will be. I only got 1 gold gem (in the 100m dash event) which is gotten from getting under 11 seconds on that course. I felt it was a fine sacrifice; it would increase the in-game time of the 3-10 stage itself by slowing down. Besides, 5-09 story line isn't that much longer by the lone 1 gold gem collected, so you can still get to the credits kinda fast!
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The final in-game time on the game file for all of the stages combined is 27 minutes, 45.52 seconds.

]p
[h4 
	" Memory Addresses
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Zdude and I found many addresses for this game in MHS that really help in optimizing stuff, like HPs for every single boss, x/y speed, x/y pixel and subpixel positions, Teran's Speed, the speed when on the tricycle, Game File Timer, current in-game time (MASSIVELY helpful address to have) mathfun digit answers, and more. PM me if you want the list.
	$LF

[h3 
	"New tricks that will make you pee!
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"A year gives lots of time for trick/glitch finding. Here's what I found:
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Clancer Boost
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"If you do an extended slide jump as you hit something, your speed increases really slightly, but enough so that if you boost grab your way through a level, it saves some frames. It's more beneficial to do this trick over a long distance. Deign found this one, because he was the first to find the speed address for Marina using MHS.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Go through floors
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"If you are on a thin floor, if you either:
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"-press A, then vC, wait 3 frames, then press B
	[br 
	]br

	"or
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"-Do a slide jump (vA, 1 frame, vA), vC, wait 2 frames, then press B.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There are limitations. It can only be done on thin floors (aka the blocks that are 1x2), some levels have a layout where it is not beneficial to go through floors, and I can't seem to go through thin vertical walls, like those in 2-08 and 5-05.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Corner Clip
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"If you try to do the go through floor trick at a corner of thick blocks, you will go inside the corner and get pushed out 20 pixels. Marina moves at 5 pixels per frame when at max slide jump speed. When you do a corner clip, your speed slows down, so it's more useful to do it so you touch the ground sooner, and at max it saves 2 frames per use.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Boost Grab anywhere!
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"When boost grabbing, you can press B in any direction. This doesn't save time speed wise, but sometimes you can do it to get in an extra Boost Grab without grabbing onto something. It also increases the entertainment.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Boost Grabbing
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Oh yeah, to those who don't know, if you press any of the C buttons then B, your speed is preserved. You can gain height (with ^C and ^B) and skip portions of the game by going over obstacles. This technique is used a lot not only to skip portions of the game, but it is also faster on a sub pixel level than Slide Jumping.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Text trick
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"If you activate a text during the game, like talking to clancers or grabbing the pink hint balls, the in-game time of the current stage is paused.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Throw off Springball
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"If you grab-throw off a springball when you get on it, you'll launch yourself off slightly sooner and gain 1 frame. Also, for most distances it is better to not spring the coil at max speed, since it takes 3 frames longer to launch yourself off it.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Clanball boost throw
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"If you press ^C then throw off when throwing off a clanball to go vertical, you  gain some height.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Cancel hit animations
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"In some cases, pressing B at the right frame can cancel damage animations (this seems to work only with spikeballs; more testing needed). You can also rapidly press A to recover from a hit animation when you're in the air; this is used in the Final Fight.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Go through ceiling
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"In 4-01 Rolling rock, on one of the slopes you can simply jump up and through one of the ceilings, thus saving a warp star transition. (Veysey found this one.)
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Abuse moving objects
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Many objects that you cling to can move or swivel, such as ropes of clancers, clanball pinwheels, etc. When you grab one of these and press C and >D every other frame, you can achieve movements faster than normal slide jumping (5 pixels per frame.) In some cases, like the clancer ropes, you can save massive amounts of time and launch yourself off at wayyyyy higher than normal speeds; in some other cases, like the pinwheels, it saves only a few frames.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There's various other time saving tricks here and there, some major, some minor. Much of the improvements simply came from using better precision. If I think of other significant ones, I'll add them here.

One of the things he was testing was clipping past corners, where if you boost grab through a 1x2 block just before the first warp star, you'll get pushed ahead. Nitsuja had this featured in his WIP, and I worked constantly to figure out why Marina can get clipped like that, where it can be done, etc. Of course, the text trick eventually obsoleted the use of the clip in this stage, but my analyzing of that trick in this stage is what got me started on the project.

	"This stage was the first one where I was struggling to save time versus Nitsuja. By using his strategy, I wasn't saving more than a few frames. However, the first improvement came when I boosted into the corner to grab the exit star sooner. This application would eventually become the corner clip trick. It actually took me a long time to test and see if the trick would actually save time anywhere else. The other improvement came in cancelling the hit animation, so that I could slide jump up rather than damage boost my way up. Again, if only there was a grabbable object next to the star, I would save time.

The zipping thing is a weird side effect of getting stuck in a floor holding an object; I couldn't use it to save time in any stage though. How far deep you are in the floor, and the object you're holding determines what happens. With the bomb, you can move at 30 pixels per frame, so it would be a major time saver, but sadly I could not replicate it anywhere at all.
