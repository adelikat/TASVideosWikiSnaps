	"Sludge Vohaul is an ugly, evil genius and original brain behind the Star Generator of Space Quest Chapter 1.  He's got a bit of a grudge against the people of Xenon for re-purposing the Star Generator into a mechanism to sustain life instead of being used as the weapon Vohaul originally designed it to be. Vohaul is also slightly peeved toward Golden Mop recipient, Roger Wilco (aka TAS), for foiling his plan of having the Sariens steal the Star Generator back for him.  Mr. Sludge devises a new plan to infest Xenon with an army of robot Insurance Salesmen, which he somehow believes will sap the desire of life out of the people of Xenon.  Vohaul also kidnaps Roger to prevent him from again foiling the plan.

Through very brief and careful game-speed manipulation it's possible to both open and enter the escape pod without leaving the screen.  Game-speed is again manipulated just before the escape pod jettison cut scene.  This is necessary to slow the in-game countdown of the salesman launch; otherwise they will launch before the escape pod jettisons (resulting in a game loss).  The escape pod countdown cut scene is unfortunately slowed as well adding quite a few frames.  This results in only about a 6 second savings over the previous run.  I could not modify the speed mid cut-scene.
