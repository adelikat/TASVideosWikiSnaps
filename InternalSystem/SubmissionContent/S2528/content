Thereafter, Zero had such an exaggerated sense of power that he proceeded to beat the stuffing out of everything he came across. Even enemies which resisted the SDC fell in more artful ways. Poor Storm Owl, who was playing with a warp charm, fell to the GOD HAND. Web Spider, who was playing with a similar charm, was slashed into oblivion. Don't try looking for him.
