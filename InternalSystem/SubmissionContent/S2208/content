	"This is my very first TAS I have ever created, which I admit isn't even close to being a good choice.  The reason I picked this game is because no one has attempted to TAS it before, so I decided to go for something new.  Whether this run is published or rejected, I do not care, I just want to here your comments on what you thought about my movie.

	"There is no need to explain any of the stages, all of them are pretty repetitive and linear.  As for bosses, there may be some certain points on when and where you have to hit the bosses.  That goes for all of them too.

	": Rejecting for several reason: 1)It breaks the 
	[a class=intlink href=/Rules#UseTheCorrectVersion 
		"Rules
	]a
	", as it uses the PAL version when an NTSC version is readily available; 2) It is a very simple and repetitive game, which has very little action; and 3) Despite this, there are some parts that look to be somewhat sloppy, with large losses in speed (the first two sections of stage 2, for example). Good luck with your next attempt, and please read the rules prior to starting.
