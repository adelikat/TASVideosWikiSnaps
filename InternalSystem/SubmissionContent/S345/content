	"Here we go ;) After lots of hard work Im finally finished 
	$LF
	"with my full run of Rygar. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"First of all, im not that happy to "steal" other peoples 
	$LF
	"work. But Warp can defend his run with the fact that he didn
	$LF
	"´t used any glitches. With that said, here´s my full run ;
	$LF

	"Hmm where to start.. This game is truely one of the most 
	$LF
	"awesome games I've ever played. I loved it as a kid and now 
	$LF
	"when I have learned about the game even more I still love 
	$LF
	"it ;) 
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"It contains so many great glitches. I think I used all of 
	$LF
	"the useful ones in this run. Unfortunately I didn´t find 
	$LF
	"any new ones for this run. Air walk is used where I could 
	$LF
	"save time from it and so on..
	$LF

[p 
	"One big part of this game is the tone points you gain from 
	$LF
	"killing monsters. This is like experience but it makes you 
	$LF
	"stronger. So I have to kill loads of monsters along my way 
	$LF
	"for the bosses. I think I did this pretty good without 
	$LF
	"backtracking too much. Almost every enemy I kill is tried 
	$LF
	"out several times so I could kill it faster.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Hmm. Something that might look weird is that I don´t jump 
	$LF
	"over some holes which I jumped over in my warping run. This 
	$LF
	"is because there are .. uhm.. trees there where I can use 
	$LF
	"the rope. Those sticks/logs/trees/whatever doesn´t allow me 
	$LF
	"to pass when I have that... thing from the first boss.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Also I thought about the route. Basically with all those 
	$LF
	"cool glitches you can take on any boss from the start. But 
	$LF
	"this would take an awful lot of time since Rygar is pretty 
	$LF
	"weak from the start. So without wasting time obviously 
	$LF
	"collecting tone points this is the fastest (and also the 
	$LF
	"correct) route.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"As fast as possible

	"Takes damage to save time

	$LF
	"ABUSES programming errors in the game
