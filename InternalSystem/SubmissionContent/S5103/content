	"Vice: Project Doom is multi-faceted game with platforming, top down driving, and side scrolling shoot-em-up stages. The curent run is about a 5.5 second improvement over the published run due mainly to lag reduction.

	"This game was suggested to me a few months ago as having possibly a lot of room for optimization as you can save about 1 second just in optimized menuing on the title screen. However, after that it quickly became a struggle to save frames as Sonikkustar had done quite a good job optimizing routing and lag reduction. Originally I wasn't going to bother continuing the run but since I needed a break from Battletoads and lost all my files I decided to give it a try. Ultimately I saved about 5 more seconds over the course of the game, mostly in lag reduction from slight strategy changes, but also a little in gameplay improvement as well.

	"The mechanics of this game are quite strange. Sometimes you can jump higher while pressing select, sometimes your inputs get eaten, and sometimes you can get different results by doing seemingly inconsequential things. Overall though it seems like it would be a fun and challenging game to play real time, it's pretty unique.
