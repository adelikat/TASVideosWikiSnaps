[div class=p 
	"Gravity pulls your character down 144 subpx/fr/fr normally, and 48 subpx/fr/fr when holding the jump button. Your terminal velocity is 8 px/fr. Note, however, that this velocity is never actually achieved, and that the game immediately sets your velocity to 7px/fr (+0 subpx/fr) if this velocity is attained. As a result of this, your vertical speed normally oscillates between (7px+0subpx)/fr and (7px+144subpx)/fr. However, if you hold hold jump for 2 (or 3) frames and release jump for 2 (or 1) frames, you can have the subpixel portion of your speed go from 0 to 144 to 192 to 240 to 0 and so on. For long falls, this trick saves just a tad more than 1 frame per screen.

There are platforms that can zip you up, right, and left at exhilarating speeds (while you are doing absolutely nothing). There are segments where you just run with no obstacles. There's quite a bit bit of falling (which thankfully can be sped up). The ultimate example of this do-nothing-itis, however, is the elevators. They will

Instead, I timed my last punch and last bit of running so that the fade-out would happen as soon as possible (so I could get the best in-game time possible).
