	"This TAS was initially make for the 
	[a class=intlink href=/Forum/T/11953 
		"Consolation Team Contest
	]a
	", however I continue it after the contest was close as a personal project.TASing this game is like TASing Arkanoid : there is an incredibly high amount of options in each levels.

	"First, each time a ball hit the paddle, you can shoot it with 10 different angles. This is neither low or high enough, since it makes you obviously unable to test all possibilities, and it means if you want your ball to get an accurate angle, you must choose between these 10 angles.
	$LF
	"Basically, here is how to obtain them :
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" 4 angles by hitting the motionless paddle
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 2 angles by hitting the normal/high speed paddle
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 4 angles by hitting the low speed paddle
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"And of course you can hit the ball with the side of the paddle, to get the same angle but a little difference with the ball position 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Second, the power-ups. There are more than 10 power-ups in this game, and they can be purchase at the beginning of the stage (except some of them like the giant ball) with MP or obtain by breaking specifics jewels.
	$LF
	"When you break two or more jewels without hitting a ball, you gain the same amount of MP. This means you must avoid to break only one jewel in a row, unless you have a good reason for this.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Here is a quick list of the power-ups that give a fast way to complete a level, with their price when you can purchase them, from the fastest way to the slowest :
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" Laser (280 MP) : instant win
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Giant bomb (N/A) : all balls become giant, and they destroy any jewel in one hit
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 100-balls (240) : 100 balls on the stage, but the game start to lag with more than 20 balls
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Multi-ball (150) : each ball that hit the paddle split into two balls
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Stars (N/A) : stars fall and destroy any jewels in their ways (you can luck manipulate where they fall)
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Fire-ball (110) : the balls cross and destroy jewels without bounce on them
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Ball-control (70) : each ball that hit the paddle follow it until it bounces on something
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"Note that Fire-ball and Ball-control together give a powerful combo.

[p 
	"There are 90 levels and 11 boss in this game, which is a lot, so the MP management was a main issue in this TAS, and also the reason why I started with worlds 2 and 4.
	$LF

[p 
	"The ball initial (and minimal) speed is 200 (maximal speed is 1600), and there are only three ways to increase it :

[ul 
	[li 
		" It increases by 31 regularly after some times

	]li
	[li 
		" It increases by 65 with a Speed-up power-up
