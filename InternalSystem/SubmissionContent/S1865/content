	"My route for the final level abuses two new tricks:
	$LF

[ol 
	[li 
		" The bike can be used to gain enough speed so that you get stuck in a wall. Then you can ascend by jumping inside the wall. This trick is used four times for shortcuts.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" If you get damaged when you are using the bike or the helicopter, you sometimes get warped upwards the height of approxximately 7 blocks. This trick is used once by equipping the helicopter, touching an enemy and warping to the screen that is located above.

	"I'm sure that some sub-pixel optimization is possible in the final level (and maybe in level 9), but I'm not used to it, so I can't understand how to do it perfectly. So go ahead and improve the movie further, if you can handle the sub-pixel world. I would enjoy seeing any improvements to this. :)
