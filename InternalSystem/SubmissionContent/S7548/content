	"What is interesting about it though is that it is a 2 player coop game. Aside from the other 2 double dragon games, there aren't many other examples of this, so it's a bit of a novelty. So I played through the game with 2 players.

	"Enemies, including bosses, are almost always locked on to only one player, so the other player can freely hit them. You can punch and kick enemies, but these are useless compared to the jump kick, so this move is used throughout the run. The only element of complexity is enemy spawns, so you have to plan ahead a bit to kick enemies in the direction you want to end up going.

	"Enemies also have a cool down time in between hits, so you can't hit them right away after they get up from a jump kick. This makes a 1 player game quite challenging, but isn't a problem for 2 players.

	": It looks like it's not all that efficient to hit enemies out of the visible area and wait for them to go back every time, but if you're closer to them they simply counter-attack right away when they get up. So standing farther away from them with the player they are targeting is probably the best way to make them calmly eat all the hits, because you can't damage them while they're counter-attacking. Accepting.
