	", in which 3 frames come from faster gameplay and 30 frames come from the dialogue manipulation described in the submission text. But after it was resynced on the updated PSX core, gameplay was improved even further (10 frames now), while the non-gameplay parts became longer, negating the dialogue manipulation improvements. Gameplay itself now starts 121 frames later, and the intermission screens last longer.
