	"Oracle of Seasons - a game where you change the seasons to get into 8 dungeons so you can get the essences of nature lying behind the evil bosses. You need those essences to destroy a barrier, after that they are useless. The reason for this journey is to save Din, the oracle of seasons, who was kidnapped by Onox. The seasons are in total chaos (yet they are always the same when you enter some place).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The aim is to defeat the game as fast as possible. The game is kinda linear so I can't really choose the order the required things are done. Only the 4 jewels and the 4 golden beasts are things I can choose when to get/defeat.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Pegasus seeds are the most important things to look for. They make you walk a lot faster and jump further. They just run out quickly and you can only have 20 of them. That is why I use gale seeds to get those.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In the beginning I need to talk with everyone to get Din kidnapped. It would be better if Link just slept there so that the cutscene would never be activated.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The Hero's cave is stupid. You need to walk in the middle of an army of weak monsters with no items. And the wooden sword really is a sign of courage. Diagonal movement doesn't slow you down, so I use it a lot.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Alright, Link proved his courage. Then he needed to go into a dungeon with even worse enemies, armed with a wooden sword. How does it kill those skeletons anyway?
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The first miniboss is really easy. Well, it should be, it's the first one after all. The bomb may or may not kill them faster (it does hurt them), but it doesn't waste time.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The warp thing is strange, usually it takes you into the beginning of the level. I kill those 2 pink blobs because they are in the way and I'd need to kill them anyway. The hands are stupid, I had to kill a lot of them so they wouldn't grap me.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The first boss looks ugly with all those missing slashes. I'd redo it if it didn't mean redoing the whole game.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I ignore Maple for obvious reasons. Now Link had to go into Subrosia. No way to speed up the hiding game so I tried to dance. Finally I got the rod of seasons to change the current season. Sadly I have to get the powers of the season spirits first...
	$LF

[p 
	"Nothing special in the 2nd dungeon. The boss is annoying as it has long periods of invunerability. Lots of stupid bats are killed in the game for being in my way.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Digging for money really looks bad. You can't manipulate what comes when you dig, so... it took 3 digs to get something. I'd redo this if possible...
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Yay, pegasus seeds. In OoA you can get them after the 4th dungeon...
	$LF
	"Getting the jewel from the cave is required, so I do it while I'm in the area.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Nothing special about the third dungeon. Roc's feather just is my favorite item after the sword and the roc's cape. And I should've jumped over the trampoline...
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"First golden beast defeated. Only 3 left for the Red Ring (2x sword damage). The path to the 4th dungeon is really really long. Moosh and the subrosian thieves are annoying.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Still nothing special to say about the dungeon. The path to the next is short, thank god.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I use the restart sequence in 5th level to reset the placement of the carts. The bosses are annoying. Magnetic balls are stupid, they don't move like they should when you're using pegasus seeds.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Yay, got the nobel sword! Defeated the second golden beast! The strange circle-movement in the 6th levels miniboss is 'cause it appeared where you weren't. The boss is extremely annoying when playing normally, but I could tell its movements with save states. Thank god.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Defeated the last 2 golden beasts, got the red ring, entered 7th dungeon. I do some nice jumps here, don't imitate them without save states. The bosses are weaklings.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The strange stupid mistake-looking thing in the ruins of the Temple of Seasons is because I needed to manipulate a spider to not appear at the end of the giant row of pits, so that I could just jump over it.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The 8th dungeon has the crappiest weapon imo (hyper slingshot? Yeah right...) and the crappiest boss. At least the miniboss couldn't be hurt with the sword. I should've gotten some bombs here.
	$LF

[p 
	"Onox is a weakling. The Dark Dragon is weaker. Losers.
