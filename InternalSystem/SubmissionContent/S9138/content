	"Atop the Witch's Tower is a 2017 ZZT game developed by John Thyer that was inspired by Anna Anthropy's book about ZZT. The game is about Mary the witch, getting ready for a sacrifice. I highly recommend playing through the game for yourself since it's both a short game and it's a narrative driven ZZT best experienced at a normal pace. Watching this TAS is not an optimal way to experience the game.

	"In 2023 asie, who has also worked on Zeta (a modern emulator made to run ZZT and Super ZZT on modern computers) and The Reconstruction of ZZT (a reverse engineered recreation of ZZT's source code) made a WonderSwan Color port of the ZZT engine. Atop the Witch's Tower was chosen for the first WonderSwan Color ported ZZT world.

	"There's a bit of backstory on why I did this. First I watched streamer authorblues play through a bunch of ZZT worlds on his stream a few years ago, which planted an initial interest of ZZT on to me. Fast forward to this year when after clearing up my backlog of physical books 
	[del 
		"mostly about video games
	]del
	" so I bought and read through Anna Anthropy's book about ZZT for myself as well. The book was a good and informative read of ZZT's history up until the writing of the book and lots of information on why the game was so compelling for others to both play and create ZZT worlds. After reading the book, I started playing some ZZT worlds on my own in earnest. I can say that I've enjoyed my experiences with ZZT worlds, and that's kind of partially why this submission exists in the first place.
