	"Back to the Future is a vertical sidescroller where you have to go from start to finish before the timer runs out while trying to avoid things like giant bees, bullies, hula-hoop girls, and guys holding glass windows. After four of these walking stages are over, there is a bonus game. In my run I abused the up+down+left+right combinations to make it so that the character is going all over the screen. I make him jump in the air so that he doesn't get killed when he moves all around the screen. If he lands or is walking on anything other than the road or sidewalk, he gets killed. Doing the control combinations (U+D/L+R) actually gives the impression that he is time travelling at the speed of light, which is awesome. It is a really easy game to TAS, so this run took me three days to complete.
