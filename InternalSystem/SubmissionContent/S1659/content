	"This movie is 39 seconds faster than the currently published Adventures of Lolo 2 run by Randil and me. In this new version, 22 out of the 51 levels have been made faster through new strategies and glitch abuse. For the remaining levels, various stylistic elements have been added without sacrificing time.

			"Rear half-heart shield
		]b
		": Anyone who has beaten a Lolo game on the NES console has probably done this at some point. When standing on the right half of a heart, Lolo is protected from attacks by Medusa or Don Medusa from the right. When standing on the bottom half a heart, he is protected from such attacks coming from below. With its asymmetric direction requirements, this rule was  most likely originally a programming error but seems to have been intentionally retained in the later games including Lolo 2. Just like in the previous movie, this allows shortcuts in levels 2-5 and 9-2.

			"Stand on water
		]b
		": While riding an egg, if you try to push another egg against a body of water, Lolo will stay in place as the first egg floats away. Just like in the previous movie, this trick is demonstrated in level 7-5 where it can be done without sacrificing time.

			"Dodge Don Medusa
		]b
		": If Don Medusa moves left and right, Lolo can walk through his horizontal line of vision for a brief moment provided that this space is immediately to the right of a heart of boulder. If Don Medusa moves up and down, with proper timing Lolo can pass immediately below a heart or boulder. This glitch is used as a shortcut in levels 7-1 and Castle-3.

			"Get chased past Medusa
		]b
		": Alma or a moving Skull can overlap several pixels with Lolo before being lethal. If Lolo is running horizontally with a tailing enemy, he can avoid fire from Medusa or Don Medusa from below. If Lolo is being chased vertically by a tailing enemy, he can avoid fire from Medusa on the right. Note the similarity of directional requirements between this and two other glitches above. This is used in level 9-4.

			"Walk through Rocky
		]b
		": Technically, it is Rocky who runs through Lolo. Push an emerald block (or egg) leftward or rightward against a wall while Rocky is running towards Lolo. Rocky will then swing up and down through Lolo. This glitch is used in levels 5-4 and Castle-1.

I could have manipulated this scenario by exiting the previous level 2 frames later. The total movie length would have been the same regardless, so I chose to retain the unmanipulated boss fight which is more interesting with Lolo parrying a fireball.
