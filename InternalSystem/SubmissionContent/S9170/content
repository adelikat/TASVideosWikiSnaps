	"They've finally broken through. In "Final Defense", the hundreds of enemy ships are approaching by sea, and an equal number of tanks are convergin on you by land. You're the last defender, and before they take you, you must wipe out as many of them as possible. If only you could hold on long enough for reinforcements to arrive.

	"There are 10 levels of difficulty. "0" is the easiest, as there are no enemies to shoot against. Starting with Level 1, you start to see enemies. This TAS is played on Level 9, where almost all ships shoot back, as opposed to a few in the easier levels. As for the ending, it is clear...fly the mission, shoot as many ships and tanks as possible, and then land.

	"This game had a few details to figure out. For one, its an auto-scroller, so i was forced to create a maximum-score run. So this posed a problem of manipulating RNG to force all the ships and tanks to be within reach of me shooting them.

	"As for the landing, there was a bit of "Balancing" speed and landing to stop the aircraft as soon as possible. Before landing, there was so much speed you could reduce by. So you would basically have to slow down at a certain point so that the landing strip came up the quickest. Afterwards, you had touch down quickly and then manual decelerate.

	" and the response, this run works as any %/baseline. The ability to control speed in the takeoff and landing sections makes this not completely an autoscroller even if the fighting sections are.  In my opinion a maximum score goal is still an option, which should either max out or roll over the score counter somehow.
