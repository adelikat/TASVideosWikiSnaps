	""That's my home, Metro City.  Quiet place.  Good city.
	$LF
	"Good people.  Good future.  But as time passed, bad seeds
	$LF
	"started to grow, and Vortex, Metro City's protector, was
	$LF
	"outnumbered.  Even with the help of the local police,
	$LF
	"Vortex was no match for the growth of corruption.

[div class=p 
	"With Vortex gone, the criminals moved in like a cancer,
	$LF
	"eating through the city's heart.  Day by day, Metro City
	$LF
	"was getting worse.  Without Vortex to combat crime, things
	$LF
	"started to get out of hand.  Crime feeds upon itself like
	$LF
	"rats fighting over cheese.  Pretty soon the crime bosses
	$LF
	"began to fight over control of Metro City.

	"There's someone new in town.  Someone organizing all the

[div class=p 
	"Looks like fourth time is really the charm. More than a minute was shaved from the last release, and I'm pretty confident in saying that it's unlikely this time can be improved by as drastic a margin as the last 3 versions kept setting (13:07 to 11:25 to 10:16 to current).

	"The ninja fights have all been DRASTICALLY improved. Props to Nitsuja for bearing with me while I kept refining this.

	"The new path on the opening level saves about 600 frames overall. Getting the gas mask as opposed to taking the damage in the sewers actually also saves about 5-7 seconds overall since you avoid 4 message prompts as a result.

[div class=p 
	"The final battle is also greatly improved; Sutekh only teleports once :)

	"For this movie to be any faster (by a noticible margin), there would have to be a way to do more damage to Goliath in both battles.
