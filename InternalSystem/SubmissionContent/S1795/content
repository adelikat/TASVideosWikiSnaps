	"My

	" was more an experiment to see how quickly the game could be completed.  This one is about 3 minutes slower but adds a lot more bizarre plays and programming errors.  In addition, I show an entertaining game of football with a rather surprising ending :)

	"While entertainment is hard to judge, nevertheless I think I managed to improve on Arc's 
	(__wikiLink|250M|published movie)
	".  It shows a more interesting game overall, skips a rather boring coin toss, and it over two minutes shorter.  More importantly, it shows more bizzare plays and programming errors in the game.  Nearly every play has something unexpected.
