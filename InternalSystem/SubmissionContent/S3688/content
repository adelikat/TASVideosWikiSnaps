	": Hello got4n, and welcome to TASVideos. Unfortunately, I will have to reject this movie. The play quality is not up to par for this site; I see many times where you wait for a few seconds without moving for no discernible reason, and the playing in general looks like it could be significantly improved. It looks like with more time investment (5 to 6 hours is definitely not enough for most TASes, much less one that's over 40 minutes long), and more careful play (1832 rerecords also definitely aren't enough for a run of this caliber), the movie could be improvable by several minutes. Because of that, I'm rejecting this run.
