	"In Crash Bandicoot XS (Huge Adventure for American) Uka Uka has been upset with Doctor Neo Cortex failure once again but Cortex promices to change that so he srinks the world with his "Planetary Minimizer". Aku Aku informs Crash and Coco on what has happened and tells them to find in veries places in the world the 20 crystals (in other crash series it's 25 crystals). Once done this reverses the effects of this ray.

	"Used aku damage abuse in this tas to do this you must have aku to be with you at much needed times a example was when im near nitro i run through them with aku not belly flopping (even though that occurs once in this run). small luck was used with the tnt as it exploades crash's hit ditection with particle field is a bit random. Good luck trying to tell on what can be fixed in this run.

	"As you can see low rerecords was used in this run I have done a speedrun without tassing this game and it was quite hard but while tassing I found verious and new techniques to use (There is a glitch that I stumbled on so I tryed and used it to my advantage but all it lead me to was a dead end). A nice trick to use is ice-slide-jump physics this will launch Crash faster.

	"Some improvements I will mention towards everyone I didn't use alot of damage abuse as I kept losing aku at wrong spots but even with that writen it would be tough to try and use more damage abuse than what I did. Another improvement that can be fixed is Ngin boss fight I was slow due to speed (Note to self: Use frame advance).
