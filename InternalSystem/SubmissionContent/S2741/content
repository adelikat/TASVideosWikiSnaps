	"I don't know if it's just me, but to get the replay often desyncs on start-up, usually around when I'm editing the dipswitches. Restarting the emulator and rerunning the replay file fixes it. If anyone knows any workarounds for that, please let me know.

	"This run relies on very strict 1-frame combos, character-specific combos, using special moves unsafely and heavy stun combos. It pretty much contains everything you wouldn't see experience players using so recklessly. I admit it starts out slow, but I promise it gets better as it progresses.

	"Necro is considered an average to below-average character in the competitive world. He doesn't have the quickness and utility necessary to punish most quick moving fighters but, if captured in a good loop with Necro, he can output good damage along with a heavy stun. Anyone familiar with the Street Fighter series understands he's a bit of a hybrid, mixed with old characters Dhalsim and Blanka, in regards to his moveset.

	"This was my second tool-assisted playthrough on this game. This is a game I've been playing for years, know a lot of frame-specific and situational combos, and many glitches. Though I'm not all that great yet at setting up such glitchy or situational combos because they require certain conditions and some require eating damage on your end which I did not want because I wanted a no-death playthrough.

	"Whenever I TAS it though, I develop sort of a block when I get into a situation where I can do so many things but can only make one decision. Some I'm happy with, others I'm not but I thought I'd share with you something I've been doing for a while now. I'm actually looking to branch from fighting game playthroughs (which is what I mostly do right now) into other genres.

	"I've also been lurking this site for about 3-4 years now. Finally decided to register to submit this today, regardless of how well received it may or may not be and gave tool-assisted playthroughs a shot some months ago. I'm turning this into an introduction rather than a submission, but I'll cut the "tl;dr" stuff for another time.

	"So. I hope you all can get some sort of entertainment from this run. Hopefully I can produce better stuff in the future.
