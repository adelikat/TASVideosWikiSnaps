	"Shantae is a rather obscure GBC game that was released almost a year after the GBA. It is notable for its high quality and general booty shakiness.

	"In rare situations where Shantae needs to let go of B on the ground, jumping and using an attack prevents the attack from delaying Shantae's acceleration.

	"Additionally, using an attack while in the air out of a run will not slow Shantae down at all. Only if she touches the ground without holding B again will her speed be reset.

If down is released without pressing any other buttons, she will do her transition animation between crouching and standing. If you then press A during this, she will jump in mid air.
