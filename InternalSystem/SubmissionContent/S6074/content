	"Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee is a 2D flip scrolling platform game released in 1997 for the PS1 and PC. In 2014, a TAS was made by Samtastic and Dooty which introduced a new skip in the Monsaic Lines which allows us to skip Paramonia and Scrabania. 4 years later, a new speedrunner came along from Spain and improved the bee DDG in the Monsaic Lines.  Thanks to LegnaX, we now know a way on setting up the DDG on the bottom instead of the top. The movie beats the current published movie by 2 seconds using the special value of 8213C that shows the time without loads. It is also 70 frames faster comparing to the PCSX run meaning that if this input was done on PCSX this would give me a 12:04 input time converting it to 60FPS. There were other small movement improvements done in almost every chapter. See stage by stage comments for more info.

	" Death Delay Glitch
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Often abbreviated as DDG it makes Abe invisible and can corrupt his sprite and eventually become invisible at some point allowing him to get past things that would kill him. Abe will die if he falls of a ledge or gets zapped. A video made by Sligfantry can show you how this glitch works:

[h4 
	" Auto Turn Delay Glitch
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This glitch works by standing on the edge of the ledge and pressing the down button quickly and run towards a spot where you would like to hoist down. You will need to press either 'left/down' or 'right/down' depending on which direction Abe was facing.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Stop Turn and Backwards Jump
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"By timing this glitch perfectly you can make Abe stop and turn. To set it up, Abe needs to be standing near a ledge (pressing up whilst tunring arround) you will be able to make Abe do a backwards jump. Notice that when you press the opposite direction to where Abe is standing at the incorrect frame, Abe will just jump up and stand. But if you time it perfectly, Abe will jump backwards and possibly jump to another screen. This will allow you to jump backwards to areas and skip Zulags. In a 100% run it will allow you to get to secret areas quicker and it skips a section of StockYards Escape after finishing the secret area. Sligfantry's video can show you how this glitch works: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIo1TJUBGlo
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Multiple Backwards Jump
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Whilst performing a backwards jump, simply press up/jump and Abe will do a multiple backwards jump and in this run Abe will use it to skip Zulag 3 to get to Zulag 4. 
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Diagonal fall
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This is done by combining the stop turn and the auto turn glitch. It is used as a time saver in Monsaic Lines and to save a frame in RuptureFarms.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Bird Portal Closure Glitch
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This run contains a glitch which saves a few frames. You can free the Mudokon a few frames earlier than a normal rescue. Here is the before and after video on how it looks when using the glitch.

[h4 
	" RuptureFarms
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"There are a few new movement improvements in this chapter. One of the most notable one is in the Griding Area where Abe walks an extra step to the right before he does a run and jump. 
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Monsaic Lines
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This section is faster than the PCSX run as Abe sets up the DDG faster than the original method. Also, a strat found by LegnaX entering the bird portal before the bee DDG was added. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Have a look here at LegnaX's DDG setup comparison video for time checks. This was done on PC.

	" Stockayrds Return
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"LegnaX showed me a new way on entering bird portals which is faster and consistent. 
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Zulag 4
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"In Zulag 4, on the third screen, Abe rolls before sliding into the door. LegnaX found out this was faster than just running and sliding into it. 
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Thanks
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"I need to thank LegnaX here for finding all these improvements. Although we speedrun this game on the PC version, all these new tricks work on the PS1 version just as good. Thanks again LegnaX! I also need to thank ViGadeomes for improving the menu section at the start. Thanks again ViGadeomes!
