	"The Lion King (Genesis) in 11:23.280 by Akiteru and EZGames69. This movie contains strategies discovered since the last publication, as well as brand new tech. I don't have a breakdown of frames saved per stage as the Genplus-gx core in BizHawk 2.10 has longer load times and different lag frames than 2.3.1. The gameplay time save is slightly more than the real-time difference suggests, but probably not more than 30 frames.

	"When an ostrich sections begin, a counter is initialized at 0xCD06, and from there is incremented by the same amount as the camera every frame. The sequences end when the counter reaches 0x1000 for the first one, and 0x1A00 for the second one. By turning to the left after rolling off the first giraffe's head, the camera pans to the left while Simba is falling, resulting in more being added to the counter as Simba is aligned to the left of the screen. This barely allows the sequence to end early enough that I land on the giraffe's head instead of missing it, allowing me to launch off of it. This saves the time spent from Simba splatting when hitting the ground, as well as time spent climbing onto the hippo.

Maybe there is some way of doing it with a different log height, but you don't have access to much else in a TAS setting. I saved 3 frames on hits during the boss fight.

	"EZGames69 brought it to my attention that it is actually possible to skip the 3rd ledge in the stage, something I had thought to be impossible in the Genesis version. This ledge skip involves getting a running start to build up speed, using the L+R bug for maintaining speed while stopped in mid air, and two frame-perfect swipes to avoid both touching the wall and losing your speed, or just not making it at all.

	"At the second leopard spawner, if you try to roar at the leopard, the stun doesn't appear to work because it stuns the leopard on the platform below instead. In the SNES TAS and real-time runs, runners usually kill the leopard using a glitched kill to allow the roar to target the leopard from the spawner. In this movie, I smack the leopard to the right and then bait it to jump at me, so by the time I reach the leopard spawner, the bottom leopard is so far to the right that it despawns. This allows me to correct the roar with next to no time loss.

	"Same skip, same pattern. The RNG resets to a fixed value at the start of each stage in Genesis, so luckily no manipulation required for the geysers unlike the SNES TAS. As far as I can tell, it's still not possible to get a double cycle skip in Genesis because it's impossible to enter the arena enough to start the eruptions with only one geyser loaded.

	"A lot of time save here from more efficient strategies, especially in rooms 4 and 7. There is a way of killing the hyenas known as a "remote kill" that is used heavily in the SNES TAS. This glitch does exist in Genesis, but only works under very specific conditions, and is not really feasible for heavy use in Genesis. One notable strategy I made use of twice is to start a maul on a hyena, and then cancel it by taking damage. As long as I keep swiping after regaining control, the kill still happens while I'm also able to do damage to the hyena I was damaged by.
