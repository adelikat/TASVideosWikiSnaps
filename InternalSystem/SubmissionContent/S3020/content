	"In Japan, this game is regarded as the first one of the “Seiken Densetsu” series, which is internationally known as the “Mana” series. The hero is a slave of the Empire Glaive. One of his fellows tells him the world is in danger. Thus the hero decides to escape and seek Excalibur to defeat Dark Lord. And to save the world, he has got to protect the Mana family…

	"No need to purchase Axe. Kill some enemies as fast as possible. When level 1, beat only Myconids. Killing one Death Flower (who has 3 EXP) needs two swings of sword if the hero’s level is fewer than 3. So before entering swamps, the hero should be level 3.

			"- This Warp requires an NPC player. At the map in Undersea Volcano, where there are three doors and the stairs, save & load game to summon enemies. Then use Blizzard to make a snowman and convey it onto the stairs. Walk toward the snowman. An NPC player sometimes comes between the hero and the snowman. At that time, the hero slightly enters the snowman. When he enters it over 8 pixels, break the snowman and walk downwards. Then the map will scroll and you can reach the top of the Tower of Gemma.
