Some stages are also poorly designed, being impossible to pass with the wrong armor or character, or structure randomization. The difficulty of the game is

This game also introduced a new hazzard enviroment system, wich means that a stage will have some enviroment variations depending on the stages that you went previously, some of these being incredibly annoying and some not being much of a problem. A Stage will only have 1 hazzard at a time, meaning that if you went to 2 stages that would cause hazzard in a stage, only the later one will take place.

[p 
	[b 
		"Saber Walljumping Trick:
	]b
	" Allows X to cancel backward movement after doing a walljump by using the saber, saving some frames occasionally. Not always usefull though, since it forces said walljump to be as high as possible, sometimes not being the optimal solution.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Ice Floor Trick:
	]b
	" When landing on a slippery terrain, and you stop moving forward (or backwards even) the frame before landing, you get to slide and when you dash the vertical speed gets added getting incredible fast movement, most likely leaving the camera behind.

[p 
	[b 
		"Part Slot Glitch:
	]b
	" Allows you to equip as many parts as you can into a single slot by pressing both X and Triangle at the same time, the part WILL be equipped but the slot will visually be available. This does NOT works with Limited Parts and Parts exclusive to the other character.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Scaravich Invencibility Glitch:
	]b
	" Triggered when you hit Scaravich with any attack that will cause invulnerability frames when he is not moving, after moving he will be vulnerable while he has invulnerability frames, so you can do a lot of damage in a few frames.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Ice Block Glitch:
	]b
	" By shooting a non-charged Ice Burst as X and managing to get inside it before touching the ground, X can get hit by it (but not causing any damage) causing invulnerability frames and sometimes being quicker then getting hit by enemies. But most important, while having invulnerability frames you can pass through some objects, like Nightmare Irons, Nightmare Cubes and even the Nightmare Press extensions.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Ride Armor Glitch:
	]b
	" In the 2nd part of Metal Shark Player stage, when you jump with the Ride Armor on a destroyable grey cubes (didn't tried on Nightmare Cubes) and just before the press is about to hit it, hopping off it and the Ride Armor glitches into the cube, X must be next or in the Ride Armor once it hits the ground, otherwise the press won't glitch. If done correctly, the press will go higher that what it usually does, allowing this part to safe from being crushed. Does not save any frames, but is neat nonetheless.

[p 
	[b 
		"Ultimate Buster:
	]b
	" Makes X fire charged shots of any weapon instantly without needing to charge beforehand, allowing X to fire charged shots faster than usually possible. The disadvantage of using it is that you can't use uncharged shots of any weapon (unless you are using Unarmed X), sometimes creating unconfortable situations since there is a delay you have to wait after shooting a charged shot and can only be one charged shot of a weapon onscreen at a time.

The boss can only get 1 damage from anything and Air Dash is the best way to deal damage, sometimes you can use the Z-Saber while on the ground since Air Slash causes lag.

So the 2 shortest stage are first. This stage is just dashing down while avoiding obstacles and defeating Ilumina (the giant robot at the back) by destroying its 2 cores. The Z-Saber is the fastest way to achieve that at this moment. After, comes the boss, he has an interesting mechanic, when being hit by the Z-Saber, a projectile reflected by Mirror Shield (his weakness) or each time a 4th of his health has been depleted, he gets send to the wall causing a lot of invulnerability frames. I used the Z-Saber since being on this invulnerability period, X can charge his X-Buster. After defeating him, X gets 200 Nightmare Souls.

Also note that here you can see our first Nightmare Hazzard, Nightmare Dark, it just black out most of the screen in certain sections of the stage, not a problem for the TASer, but the viewer is affected by it.

Eventually you will get to a teleporter wich sends us to the next area. Believe it or not, but the next area is another press and when you advance you will get to... another press, this time the midboss wich is weak to Charged Shield Mirror, useful only when timed correctly though, after you get to the boss.

The last section is pretty annoying for X since he has no flexibility in vertical movement but using Magma Blade and Falcon Armor's Air Dash, you can stop X's in the air, a lot of luck manipulation have been done to optimize this.

Picked up the second part for the Shadow Armor. This boss is unique, he has 2 cores that you need to destroy to be able to damage him you can also damage him by hitting from his other side. I used Charged Metal Anchor initially since it deals ton of damage quite fast, I believe it is because you are damaging him and his cores and by hitting his cores, it resets invencibility frames, after both cores are destroyed, the boss takes damage normally so I cancel Metal Anchor by pausing and switching weapons and continue using Charged Laser Array.

	"Equipped every part needed so I won't have to come back to this menu for the rest of the game, equipped Weapon+, Quick Charge, Buster+, Energy Saver, D-Barrier, D-Converter and Power Drive. Blade Armor makes this stage more enjoyable to TAS with it's Mach Dash. Used the Ice Block Glitch to pass through the magma to save some good amount of time, next is an auto scroller and Nightmare Mother. Basically 2 Eye Devils that can only be damaged when they get out of their bodies. Charged Metal Anchor does quite a lot of damage as you can see.

	"This is 2 stages in one. First part is some vertical section that Blade Armor get advantage of, afterwards you can make a totem skip sticking in the ground before getting to that section (not talking about holograms but actual totems and they take quite some time to destroy and have to wait for explosions). After used the Ice Block Glitch to pass through the pillars, it is faster than waiting to be crushed. Now we get to High Max to get our revenge, used Charged Saber to trigger vulnerability and used Mach Dash with Mirror Shield to cause a lot of damage very quickly, also used the wall to use another air dash quickly.

	"The second part is a rain section with some complex platforming, Mach Dash is used whenever it is faster. After that we finally get to Gate, he is inmune to everything you can throw at him, except his orbs wich on being destroyed releases some small orbs wich damages him. When he throws the orb, they go towards you, so I put X where they spawn to minimize the orbs movement since they can't be destroyed during this movement and using Charged Laser Ray to take advantage of its invencibility to destroy the orbs ASAP.

	"So it appears Sigma is behind everything <sarcasm>No one thought about this.</sarcasm> So Falcon Armor is used for this since it's X-Buster can do +1 damage to bosses compared to Blade Armor Buster. So the reason I equipped Energy Saver and D-Converter is to maximize the use of Charged Laser Ray since you already know, it is the best way to beat most bosses. The first part saves energy (ammo) and the second converts damage to energy, so I get hit on purpouse. I could unequip D-Barrie (long invencibility periods) but would loose frames.

[p 
	"The second part is a somewhat simple stage with nothing interesting to talk about, until you get to Sigma. The first fight is pretty simple, in the other hand the second fight I used Magma Blade to do Saber Damage to him (the fire does not any damage at all) and activated Power Drive to do +1 damage for each hit, what makes Magma Blade different is that it stops X vertical movement, reducing the delay between slashes to almost 0. After this, the game is beaten and you see Zero in a cutscene. At the end, X Rank is GA and Zero Ranks is D.

	" that helped me a lot in the process of making this TAS. It shows you the values of the common adresses you would be using on RAM Watch, these includes: Player's HP and Inv values, Souls collected by X and Zero, the X and Y Speeds and Positions with SubPixel of the player, the dash meter and a charge meter that only shows when the charge of any of the 2 weapons is greater than 0, that prevents it for showing when using Zero. It also shows the Boss HP and Inv if there is one.
