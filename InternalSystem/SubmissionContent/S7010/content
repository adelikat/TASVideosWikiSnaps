	"The game has 4 difficulty levels - Easy, Normal, Hero, and Super Hero. By completing the game on Hero or higher, the player unlocks the ability to play as Harry Osborn in the Green Goblin suit, complete with the glider and bombs. It takes place after the main Spider-Man story, with new dialogue, cutscenes, and an alternative voice for the opposing Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe, but pitched down and pretending to be an unknown man who was hired by Norman Osborn to kill Spider-Man). Harry is voiced by Josh Keaton, who was originally intended to be the voice for Spider-Man AND voices Spider-Man in the spectacular TV show, until Tobey stepped up. Instead of the devs getting James Franco (Harry Osborn in the movie) to voice playable Green Goblin, they put all of Keaton's lines into Green Goblin instead (most lines that Spider-Man and playable Green Goblin say are identical for this reason).

You will have to line them up accordingly (it's not as much of a problem as goblin since all story-based pre-rendered cutscenes are removed, but you'll have to sync the SFX pretty much level-by-level as Spider-Man).

Then just line up that second clip of audio with the gameplay, and you should be good to go export without making any other audio splices. The dtkdump (music) does not need to be spliced in any way and will remain synced with the game.

Now that 6 enemies are defeated, the final group and informant spawn.

This skips a cutscene where a thug with a necessary item runs into a locked back room with a long process to get him out - instead, he's now standing still and vulnerable. I sprint-jump over the truck ahead and fly up into the vent. I drop down and disable the electricity in the vent to proceed, then head back up and defeat the thug with the necessary item. The game will only let you use the desk switch after a certain amount of time has passed, so I goof around for a moment. I then use the switch, which shows a cutscene of the "closed" door being opened (remember how I skipped a cutscene earlier? In that cutscene, the door closes). I go into the opened room and spam explosions, defeating everyone to open the exit door (the enemies necessary to defeat the level won't spawn if you don't hit the desk switch from earlier).

I drop glider bombs on them before flying into the corner - normally a cutscene would play, but it's skipped when playing as goblin, so it just spawns me in the spot I would be after the cutscene, complete with all my momentum.

The glider is ALSO fast enough to damage shocker with a glider bomb before his cutscene starts (there's actually a way to clip into this room through the larger door to skip the cutscene and have Shocker's AI not activate, but I couldn't do it even after trying for hours). Can you guess how I defeat him? Let me give you a hint: it involves a lot of bombs. I also use a new trick that involves sprinting repeatedly to deal very high damage to Shocker.
