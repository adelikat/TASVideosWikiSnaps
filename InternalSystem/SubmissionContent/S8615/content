Similarly to TiTOL2, speedrun convention has it timed based off IGT, with rampant pause abuse for time shaving; unlike TiTOL2, this game's pause abuse doesn't even hypothetically offer any RTA timesave, so it's been totally set aside for this recording. And because of this, I think this might be my first movie that is 100% truly, down to the individual frame, unimprovable, which is pretty sweet. And of course the rerecord count is only

In fact, SRC runners can abuse this to effectively "frame advance" in stages too. The SRC times by IGT, rather than RTA, so this ultimately "saves" time in their regard.

	"However, for TASVideos, we judge based on the "gameplay" time. Pausing here could likely be used in order to shave off IGT time (for the stage transitions), although it would ultimately be doing so while having the same RTA time. In this case, it doesn't save any actual gameplay time, as it's just stopping IGT during periods of no player activity. Although whether to pause or not could be argued to be a stylistic choice, so movies abusing pausing and ones not pausing could likely obsolete each other in this regard.

The SRC record abuses a fullscreen window in order to move the mouse outside of the typical range a native resolution sized window could. This allows for a faster Stage 28, ultimately pulling ahead of this submission. This can similarly be done in Ruffle by just abusing out of bounds mouse movement in libTAS. Given this, it should be expected that a submission should abuse out of bounds mouse movement to match the SRC record's timesave.
