	"Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee is a 2D side scrolling platform game released in 1997 for the PS1 and PC. In 2014, a TAS was made by Samtastic and Dooty which introduced a new skip in the Monsaic Lines which allows us to skip Paramonia and Scrabania. 3 years later, a new speedrunner came along from Spain and imrpoved the way the DDG is set up. Thanks to LegnaX, we now know a way on setting up the DDG on the bottom instead of the top. Then all of a sudden, a faster way to do the new DDG set up was found. This movie is 30 frames faster than the previous movie thanks to a new way to set up the DDG in the Monsaic Lines.

	"Often abbreviated as DDG it makes Abe invisible and can corrupt his sprite and eventually become invisible at some point allowing him to get past things that would kill him. Abe will die if he falls of a ledge or gets zapped. A video made by Sligfantry can show you how this glitch works:

[div class=p 
	"This glitch works by standing on the edge of the ledge and pressing the down button quickly and run towards a spot where you would like to hoist down. You will need to press either 'left/down' or 'right/down' depending on which direction Abe was facing.

[div class=p 
	"By timing this glitch perfectly you can make Abe stop and turn. To set it up, Abe needs to be standing near a ledge (pressing up whilst tunring arround) you will be able to make Abe do a backwards jump. Notice that when you press the opposite direction to where Abe is standing at the incorrect frame, Abe will just jump up and stand. But if you time it perfectly, Abe will jump backwards and possibly jump to another screen. This will allow you to jump backwards to areas and skip Zulags. In a 100% run it will allow you to get to secret areas quicker and it skips a section of StockYards Escape after finishing the secret area. Sligfantry's video can show you how this glitch works: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIo1TJUBGlo
