	": The vast majority of this game is an autoscrolling environment that cannot be sped up or slowed down at all, except by getting hit and dying. As such, that makes this game almost trivial to speedrun. The only instances where timing matters in the slightest are the bossfights and subsequent stage transitions; and those end up being suboptimal, as I managed to improve the first boss fight and enter the next level 128 frames faster, as shown
