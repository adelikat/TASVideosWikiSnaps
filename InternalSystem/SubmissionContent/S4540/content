	"Boomerang Kid is a short platform game released as part of the Quattro Adventure game cart released by Camerica. Like other games on the cart, Boomerang Kid is filled with warps which allow the player rapid progression, but they are well hidden. The game has a visually clean style and decent music, but is more well known for its awkward mechanics. This run uses warps and careful routing to beat the game as quickly as possible.

	"I was inspired to do this run after seeing rchokler's WIP as I working through Super Robin Hood. The WIP had already worked out warp locations which made the game very fast while still showing off a lot of platforming action. So, not wanting to let good work go to waste, I took up the WIP and polished it up for this submission. My contributions were re-routing a couple of level choices to faster ones as well as optimizing most of the levels.

	"You won't get to see it, but after most stages you get a choice to go either left or right and choose the next stage. Of course stages with warps are preferred. If no warp is available both possible paths have to be routed, as it's not always obvious which level is faster.

	"The other important concept here is falling and jumping. You can only fall a certain distance before dying. When you walk off a ledge, you begin falling instantly. When you jump off a ledge, you will descend below your starting height before you start 'falling.' So counter-intuitively, you can reach lower platforms by jumping up first. You can tell when 'falling' starts when Boomerang Kid is falling straight down.

	"The final important mechanic here, which is not at all obvious, is that holding select decreases your remaining time. This is used to bring the timer to zero at the end of each level. Otherwise it will count down before the next level starts (adding points.)
