Yosemite Sam, Daffy Duck, Taz, Marvin the Martian, and Elmer Fudd have stolen all of Bugs and Lola's carrots and hid them in the nearby studio. Bugs and Lola must head through five different studio sets in order to get them all back!

Additionally, the character transition forces you to come to a complete stop; so if we transition at a place where we have to turn around anyway, the time we would've spent decelerating is now cancelled. If this isn't an option, we select a place where we simply come to a complete stop instead.

This is only optimal in places where we must descend and progress in the opposite direction (as all of our X speed is lost when doing so) and when Lola won't have to use her umbrella anymore (as that momentarily slows X and Y speed).

	"However, carrots aren't only collected for points. If you jump, and continue holding jump, Bugs/Lola will do a sort of shimmy that'll give their jump a bit of extra height/distance. The amount of extra height/distance is determined by how many carrots you've collected. Many levels can't even be completed if you're below a certain number of carrots. Turns out a whole bunch of skips can only be done with certain carrot counts as well, which will be referenced in the level descriptions below.

	"Pushing boxes, the hippos in Taz's Zoo, and the lifts in Space Station all move so slowly that a little bit of time is saved doing a midair shimmy farther out from where a standard jump would normally clear the gap. However, less than 8 frames is saved per carrot for each, so it isn't optimal to collect as many carrots as possible for these situations. Instead, if we must have a certain carrot count for a jump later on, we aim to satisfy this count as early as we can to save time for the aforementioned situations.

	" to Silencement, who I didn't even know made a WIP of this game until after I'd completely finished. From his movie I discovered I could remove 3 lag frames from "The Steamroller" and collect 13 instead of 15 carrots on "The Flying Scooter" for a total 19 frames improvement.
