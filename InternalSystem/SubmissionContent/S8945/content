	"The previous TAS showed off a basically ideal run of the any% route used at that time. Almost immediately after that TAS was published, klaxon set the RTA WR with a significant route change. By opting to blast open corp doors with frag grenades, we eliminate the need to enter the Matrix just to do CPU crash. Based on my knowledge of how the RNG works, I offered up a real-time viable RNG manip that could force an encounter with a frag grenade dealer before leaving Redmond. It was at that point I started to theorize how some of our more obscure knowledge of the game could be used to save time.

While we could retain his medkits, we'll take the cash early and try to replace them with random drops. For a bit of extra cash, you can pick up a randomly dropped fetish (15% chance, only drops in Council Island) that sells for 257Y. Then, by taking up a courier job along on route, we're able to earn 185Y and a karma point. The remaining 18Y can be covered by a single random drop (20Y in Downtown, 10% chance).

	"As may be expected for an RPG, combat demands a lot of dice rolls. In battles with 6 characters, this can get pretty chaotic. It hardly seems necessary to understand the mechanics in detail. For example, a single untargeted shotgun blast fired outside of combat may demand over a dozen rolls over the course of a couple frames. Within combat, a targeted shot would demand defensive rolls as well, which could double that number. Also, character attack rates could reach up to once per second. So, the approach to combat in the TAS is better left to trial, but there are other factors that may be used to steer the outcome.
