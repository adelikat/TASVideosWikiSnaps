	"Warp used almost immediately. The air claw slashing cuts Wolverine's health down just enough so that the countdown doesn't waste any time.

	" Trial by Air

]h4
[p 
	"Unlike the warp movie I save a few frames by taking out some enemies with the claw trick and saving damage for later.

	" Trial by Traps
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Pretty much the same as the warpless run, with a few adjustments for luck that saved a handful of frames near the end of the level.
	$LF

[h4 
	" Trial by Water
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Some minor time savings here that I missed in the warpless movie (mostly jumping off ledges). Warp near the end that skips all of the next level.

[h4 
	" Trial by Fire
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"I take a different route near the end of the level. It saves a whole 1 frame over the route in the warpless movie. Hey, everything counts.

[h4 
	" Into the Fortress
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"At the end of the level I save a few frames with a better timed jump which allows me to run past the final enemy before it even fires its weapon.

	" Defeat Magneto

	"I control the berzerk mode a little better than in the warpless movie.

	"As you can see there's roughly ~1 second of gameplay improvement over the warpless movie in this run. If I'm ever motivated enough, I may revisit that branch. But for now I think it's just important this game has both these runs finished. Thanks once again to goofydylan8 for his initial run of the game.
