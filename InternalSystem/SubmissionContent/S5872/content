	": There has been some arguing in the thread about the difficulty choice for this run. It seems like the hardest difficulty mode is preferred over the easiest for this game, as this current movie on easiest mode plows its way through the enemies with a bit too much ease and with relatively little strategy involved. As such, rejecting for using the easiest difficulty when per the 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=guidelines|href=/Guidelines)
	" and public opinion the hardest difficulty is preferable.

[div class=p 
	"That aside, I'm also not getting the impression that this movie is sufficiently optimal. Besides the lack of knowledge on randomness and luck manipulation so far, I'm also not seeing much of a consistent battle strategy, or the run does not appear to finish off enemies as fast as possible, which makes the run look suboptimal. For instance, in the Moose fight, Moose is defeated by knocking him down, grabbing him, and jump-throwing him into the ally so he bounces into the pit - but it looks like it would work just as well to grab him and just throw him down directly, which would save a few seconds. I can't tell if there is any reason for doing this, but I'm not convinced that there are no better ways of going throughout the run either. In general, for a future run of this game, I'd like to see some more insight on exactly what the strategy is behind the move choices that the player character makes.
