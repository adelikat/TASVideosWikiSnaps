	"If you've plaed Air Hockey, you already know how to play "Face-Off'. Based on the ice hockey, Air Hockey pits two players against each other, each trying to shoot a puck into his opponent's goal while defending their own goal. A center line splits, the playfield. Neither player is allowed to cross this line. The object of the game is simple: The first player to score five goals wins.

	"The magazine makes some comments that are not quite accurate. It is misleading when the article states that scoring 5 pucks wins the game. In reality, yes...but you still have to play the game until all 9 pucks have been sunk. For me, the code should have been adjusted to end the game. Another thing that I find funny is that it makes the claim of being near impossible to win on the fastest and hardest skill level. Oh well! TASing, once again, has totally destroyed a game!

The version you are seeing is my 3rd time all the way through. The last time through, I cut 71 frames over my 2nd effort. While my second attempt cut 324 frames over my first attempt, totaling 395 frames cut from re-working the entire game.

	": Pretty easy judgement on this one.  I agree with the choice of Maximum Score as a branch.  Even with having to (at least) initiate the final 4 rounds, it would likely be faster to finish this game by allowing the CPU to score on 4 of the rounds, which would still qualify for any % as the player would still win 5-4.  One curiosity would be determining which of the rounds would be fastest to lose.
