	"Time for Circle again! This is different from my other movie as I abuse a real neat glitch. This glitch warps me straight to Dracula using summons! Basicially, all I needed to do was to go to the shaft and go grab the first two cards so I can use the DSS glitch to use summons. I skip the dash boots as they're more out of the way and there isn't much moving. I just slide the rest of the time.
