	"El Viento is a platform game by Wolfteam... a programming team that operated under Telnet, the Japanese company responsible for 90% of the games in the 16-bit era that had extended anime cutscenes and/or cute babe heroines.  It stars Annette, a gal who wields a boomarang and magic powers, and is traveling to world to stop evil or something.  It has some straaange level design and a depressing ending.  It's a spinoff of Wolfteam's "Earnest Evans" and it had a (terrible) sequel on the Sega CD called "Annette Again".

	"If you haven't ever played this game (not many people did), I recommend it.  It's pretty fun, and had nice-looking graphics for the Genesis at the time.

	"Like Megaman 3+, this game has a dash move that's meant to be used sparingly, but in this case, the dash is quite a bit faster and continuous.  This makes for an interesting time attack, so I went for it.

	"7531 re-records is pretty hardcore for me, though it's not absolutely perfect; with a missed shot here and a split-second late jump there... But the result is still something no human could possibly do, and I think it's pretty entertaining.  I'd say it's about 95% perfect at the moment.

	"Someday I will have another go at this.  But not anytime soon, I'm afraid.  Gens desynched a LOT when I made this run; it doesn't seem to like this game.  Thus, making the video was a bit of an exercise in persistance.

	"A lot of hits are taken in the run, but hits rarely slow you down in the game, and it's actually just one of those games where... you get hit a lot.  You'll see that most of the hits take very little damage off the life bar, yet if you play the game normally, it can still prove quite difficult in places.

	"The game has five spells which you just pick up on the way.  Needless to say, using them efficiently was a big challenge in this time attack.

	"It desynchs shortly into the second level.  Not going to go into the specifics here, but I'll just say I won't be finishing the second version of this run until a more stable Genesis recording emulator is released.  Still, I'm pretty prousd of what I did with the first level.  I thnk it's pretty much perfect now.
