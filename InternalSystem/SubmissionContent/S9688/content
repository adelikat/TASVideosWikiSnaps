	"Sonic Rush was released in 2005 for the Nintendo DS by Sonic Team and Dimps, roughly following the level structure of the Genesis games while also introducing the tension gauge, which would go on to be the boost mechanic seen in later entries. The game’s emphasis on speed and trick combos shaped it into one of the series’ fastest-paced installments for its time.

	[li 
		" Backwards jump boosting (← + B + Y) achieves the same goal but instead by taking advantage of downward slopes by boosting into them while reversed, like in Leaf Storm 1 at 0:13. Sonic must be a decent amount below the speed cap to do a backward jump boost, usually requiring slowing down a bit.

		" Intentionally taking damage helps Sonic save time on forced parachute sections once on each Altitude Limit act. While doing the one in Altitude Limit 2, a glitch can also be done involving spindashing and boosting at the sametime to preserve a spindash in midair, then letting go to get extra distance and reach across the gap.

		" The zip on Dead Line 2 at 1:09 has a unique additional glitch that moves Sonic into the background layer where he has no collision with anything except springs and certain walls. This is the only spot in the game where dying saves time, since Sonic can skip a spring antigravity section and hit a checkpoint but is blocked from the next section by an invisible wall while unable to stay on the ground beneath him.

Note that speedrun.com's leaderboard have some different timings and are using a completed game file which means the conversations and unlocking sections for each new area are not included like they are here.  This tas is from a new game so it shows all of those.  While they is possibly a faster way to get speed since there is a old tas test video that shows the first level completed a little faster, the actual method to achieve that speed to do this is unclear.  However if someone finds out a way to possibly do that it could lead to some time reductions for stages.
