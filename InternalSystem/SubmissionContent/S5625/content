	"Super Smash Bros. is a fighting game released in 1999 for the Nintendo 64, selling 5.5 million units worldwide. It still has a large and passionate player-base almost 20 years later, with hundreds of competitors gathering for frequent tournaments around the world.

[p 
	"Even though the game focuses heavily on multiplayer, there is still single player content including timed obstacle courses called “Break the Targets” and “Board the Platforms”. In this run, we complete all 24 of these courses in the shortest possible time.
	$LF

[p 
	"The run starts from existing SRAM and a verification movie is provided. The verification movie unlocks all characters, then clears the bonus scores so that the timed portion is entirely focused on the bonus stages, making the run much faster paced and more entertaining.

	"Due to version differences the fastest version of the game for any given stage varies unpredictably. We ended up TASing all 24 stages on both the US and Japanese versions of the game to make sure we tested everything thoroughly. For submission, we chose the Japanese version which has the faster total game time by 2”16 when taking all 24 stages into account. We have made the slower but still very entertaining US run available on Mittenz' YouTube channel for your enjoyment. The video for the US run can be found

[p 
	"Even though we spent some time optimizing this run for real time, we would prefer the time listed on the published material to be the total game time for all 24 stages: 6'00"20 as this is much more meaningful to the Smash community than the real time length of this run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"A game time of 0”00 is possible for all 24 stages if a pause glitch is used, however this completely kills the entertainment value of the run and greatly increases the length of the run in real time. Pausing and unpausing as fast as possible is very distracting, and takes much longer to complete the stages in real time. For these reasons we have chosen not to use this glitch and would advise that any future improvements to this run follow this precedent.
	$LF

[p 
	"There is a long history of TASes for these stages over the past decade, before we started this project the total time for all Break the Targets stages (Japanese and US best times combined) was 2'07"56, after our improvements the combined best times now sit at 2'06"72. The total time for all Board the Platforms stages (Japanese and US best times combined) was 3'57"15 before we started this project, after our improvements the combined best times now sit at 3'51"31. Throughout this project we have saved a total of 6”67 when combining the best known times of the US and Japanese versions. We finished with a total of 204,122 rerecords for all 24 stages on the Japanese version over roughly 8 months.

[p 
	"The competitive nature of the Smash 64 community had spilled over into the TAS scene for this game, it was extremely rare to see inputs posted publicly for these stages when a new record was set. The only resources we had to compare against while working on this run were YouTube videos of the records, often at 30FPS. As far as we are aware, this is the first time that optimal inputs have been publicly available for all 24 stages on both versions. We are excited to see more TASers attempt to improve these stages now that all of the resources are publicly available, and we hope that the resources remain open as improvements are made.

However, in the Japanese version it is not necessary to tech or edge cancel damage boost off of Link’s bombs due to them having less knockback. The best known time on the US version is currently 17”70. The European version beats them both with the best known time currently at 16”55 due to increased horizontal aerial velocity.

	"Smash DI is used to ensure the correct angle from the bumper damage boosts. Originally we thought that the end of the stage was cycle based, we’d start the initial dash from very far right on the falling platform and wait for the platform to land so that the running animation wasn’t interrupted by running off of the edge of the platform. Thankfully we improved the start and mid sections to the point that it actually worked out faster to fall off of the falling platform before starting the final initial dash from the ground instead of the platform. Teleports are very useful in this stage, they can be done by switching running direction for a frame, and 3 frames later performing an action such as jumping. This causes a massive horizontal boost for a few frames. The best known time for this stage on the US version of the game is currently 20”39 due to the Smash DI advantage.

This is one of the more simple stages on paper (lots of running in straight lines) but we ended up spending over 14k rerecords on this stage. The up-special that enables this route to work appears to be impossible on the US version due to differences in the jump physics, giving a massive advantage to the Japanese version for this stage.

	"This is another stage that was thought to be capped by a cycle at 8”75, however with careful optimization of the start and a small reroute for the ending we were barely able to make an earlier cycle and save 0”35. Because of an extra freeze frame on the US version every time direct contact with a target is made, the fast cycle is narrowly out of reach on the US version. Interestingly if an aerial laser was a single frame faster a time of 8”3x could be achieved with a slightly different route.

	"This stage is capped by a cycling platform in the center of the stage, we land on the platform sooner than previous runs, and use this time to charge a shot slightly. We were hoping that the added size of the charged shot would allow us to shoot to the left from lower and thus land at the bottom sooner but sadly this didn’t end up saving any time. The best known time for this stage on the US version is currently 8”90 due to extra freeze frames after the platform cycle.

	"This was the first stage that Isotarge TASed back in December of 2016 after competing with The8bitbeast in real time attempts. Not much to say about it other than it was a fairly easy introduction to this game, several important mechanics were learned without the stage being prohibitively difficult to optimize. The previous best known time for this stage was 8”51 which was improved by a frame thanks to very careful optimization of the start. The input for the down-special occurs 46 frames before the stage is completed, which means it was 1 frame away from being an option for the last stage completed in this run.

	"We improved on the previous best known time of 15”01 by attacking the second target with an up-air instead of PK Thunder, and using the extra height from this jump to reduce the time needed for the PK Thunder to connect with the third target. Double jump cancels are important for this stage and save significant time when running along the ground. The best known time for this stage on the US version is currently 15”55 due to some significant version differences.

	"The most difficult part of this stage is hitting the up-airs without wasting time with extra height or distance before landing. The wall by the final target is not solid from the left and this allows Falcon to land back on the stage after hitting that target using an up-special, sometimes zipping horizontally by up to 800 units. We tried an alternate route which completes the stage backwards using this trick, unfortunately our test run was almost a second slower than the standard route.

	"This stage was quite difficult to optimize, we were consistently 2 frames behind the reference video for the previous best known time of 13”40 at the start and couldn’t figure out why. Eventually we figured out that a double jump is required to land sooner on the edge and managed to save the remaining frames needed to tie 13”40. The stage was then further improved by a somewhat counter-intuitive technique: Not holding left/right on the joystick after jumping in the air. Attacking while jumping in the air has horizontal velocity of 27.5 and this velocity is preserved through jumps even if the next jump doesn’t attack. When the next jump doesn’t attack, the velocity counts down in increments of 0.5 from 27.5, however holding a direction during this countdown instantly snaps it to the velocity cap of an aerial jump without an attack, 21.9, which lowers the horizontal distance covered by the jump quite significantly. So it’s fastest to let go of the control stick completely until the velocity counts down from 27.5 to 22 before holding the needed direction to cap it at 21.9. The reason we complete this stage last is that the final input (up-special) occurs 47 frames before the stage is completed, which allows the input file to end early, saving some time when using TASvideos standard timing (power on to last input).

The movie is well optimized and the authors clearly have done extensive research (including fully TASing both regions just to be sure which one is faster) and put a lot of work into it.
