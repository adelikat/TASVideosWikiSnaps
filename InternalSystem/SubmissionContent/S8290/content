	"Sooooo...in the old run, I didn't have a power-up. NONE. So it takes you a little bit of time to go down a warp-pipe. Using the Fire Flower power-up CAN save you a lot of time and with that equipped, I can go down a warp-pipe as fast as possible. I also heard that if you defeat Bowser with fireballs six times you'll be able to grab the flag in no time as normally, when you don't defeat Bowser with fireballs, it'll waste more time, so there, I defeat him with fireballs six times in some castle levels and touch the axe (without Bowser falling down!) so more time will be saved. I saved some time on 2-4 AND some of the castle levels, so that's pretty much it. :P
