	"In Silent Scope, you're a sniper trying to take out a band of terrorists who have kidnapped the President and apparently also his entire family. In this version, however, the sniper has apparently drank 15 cups of coffee, and may possibly have ADD.

	"I used VisualboyAdvance 1.7.2, re-recording version 19.3 (ie the newest one found on this site), and the only settings I switched from default throughout the game were the use of autohold and autofire (at times).

	"I didn't use warps or passwords, and the only programming errors I abused was slightly sketchy hit box detection. I took no damage, aimed for fastest time (both in game and frame total), while getting the highest score possible through consecutive headshots.

	"This is my second run of this game (the first I submitted), and I think it's a much more entertaining movie than I first produced, not to mention faster. The game is completed with an in-game time of exactly 2'15", and has a movie time of 5'30" (19757 frames, around 6000 frames of this is for the credits, just to get to the initials entry page). If the movie is stopped after the last shot is taken, the movie has a time of 3'48" (13708 frames). All in all I think it is pretty well optimized, but I'm sure a few frames can be squeezed out here and there.

	"This game was a pretty simple to make, since each shot has a specific amount of frames in between when you can fire again (if you fire too soon you get someone yelling "calm down" at you). It was difficult to make this movie super entertaining, but I managed to mix in a different and fast amount of movement, got some headshots without zooming in (thanks xoinx for reminding me of this), and tried to keep the viewer surprised as to what I'm going to do next.

	"Some tidbits for each level:
	$LF
	"1-1 Frantic movement, not much else
	$LF
	"1-3 The first shot was taken right after the screen became any sort of viewable, and you'll see the first no look headshot here
	$LF
	"1-4 The first and fourth shot are no look, however the 4th doesn't look like it since the game automatically shifts to zoomed in
	$LF
	"1-Boss Hmmm a rocket launcher vs. perfect reflexes. Guess who wins
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"2-1 My movement looks a little slower here for some reason.
	$LF
	"2-3 It almost looks like I only cap one baddie here, but the perfect setup from the previous level allows a no look header at the very start.
	$LF
	"2-Boss Walked right into my shot...
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"3-1 A good balance of no looks and zoom in shots
	$LF
	"3-3 The damn flares in this and the next couple levels create a very noticeable amount of lag, which I think is unavoidable. Enjoy the entertainment halfway through.
	$LF
	"3-4 One of the longest enemy respawn times in the game is in this level.
	$LF
	"3-Boss Here is one of the most noticeable hitbox abuses in the game. Slow down the second boss when he's killed, and you'll notice he somehow dies from me firing pretty far behind him.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"4-2 Some of the biggest improvements from my previous run came from taking out the snipers quickly. I had to sacrifice about 10 frames for the first one, but if I hadn't, I wouldn't have been able to get the second sniper in the same pass.
	$LF
	"4-3 I like the look of this level a lot, since there's a good mix of no looks thrown in.
	$LF
	"4-4, 4-5 These levels were a pain, because the enemies tend to fire and hit you if you don't take them out in the proper order.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"4-Boss She takes a direct headshot and only loses 3 of her 10 HP. Can't let her get away with that...
	$LF
	"4-Boss part 2 I wait a long time here to finish her off. This is intentional, because if you take her out before she says "Come and get me", she'll die but the game won't continue on to the next level. Interesting and pretty annoying glitch. Oh, and I believe I got her at exactly the earliest frame, because any before that the shot will either not register, or will connect but hit the President in the process. Since this made me lose half a health bar, I chose to wait an extra few frames.
	$LF

[p 
	"5-1 Shoot the glass? How dull. However the game automatically reloaded me so that I'd have exactly one bullet left for the final boss, which was nice.
	$LF
	"5-Boss- One shot to the noggin and he goes down. Hope you enjoyed the run!
