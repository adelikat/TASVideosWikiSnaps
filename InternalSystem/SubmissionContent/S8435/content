Biscotte is hiding on top of a tree where we also find an icon to clear the mist at the forest entrance and also find Albert. Beyond the entrance, Charlotte is hiding under the patch of grass on the left, and Arzane is hiding under another patch of grass on the right after we go up the stairs. I also throw some birds into each other on my way to Biscotte to finally fill up my Trance meter again. Two Quest Points, and now that our Hunter Rank is at Level 8, that's the last time we'll need to do numerous side quests.

		" Lemures is very similar to Lares structure and enemy-wise. Pretty much the only thing exclusive to Lemures is some rooms where acid is constantly rising and receding. We just speed on through these rooms, even if the acid hurts us a bit. If anything, the knockback from the acid usually helps. In the case of an encounter where the risen acid prevents me from grabbing a jellyfish, I just go into Trance and one-shot it with a Spark Javelin, then the cutscene for when the door opens automatically takes me out of Trance so that I don't waste that's left of it.

In order of attack, the security system will fire purple energy balls which go straight for Red (blue lights), dark shade bolts which zig zag around before trying to hit Red (grey lights), and then a laser beam (yellow lights). All but the last one can be caught and thrown back at the lights. After all five lights are gone, the second phase begins.

		" This phase is also the only fight where you get to see most of the boss's attacks because I'm saving my Trance for the final boss. The core starts by creating a Shade which tries to crush Red, but can be thrown at the core twice if successfully dodged. After that, it spawns a second Shade which flies around and fires energy balls which are repeatedly caught and thrown at the core. Black whirlpools are also created which suck you towards them and slow you down if you walk on them. When the core's health gets really low, it creates a giant whirlpool where the centre explodes after a few seconds. The only answer for that is to dash away to avoid the blast. The fight is won by throwing two crushing Shades twice, and ten energy balls from the flying Shades.
