	"In this final installment of the famous Phantasy Star series, the protagonist, while out on a routine assignment, uncovers evidence pointing to a sinister threat to the entire solar system. One thing leads to another and he and the rest of his party eventually find themselves fighting the root of all evil. Such a quest would normally take at least ten hours, but with copious amounts of luck manipulation, it can be reduced to just under an hour and a half.

	"Yes, yet another improvement. It had been a while since some people had found new ways to improve the game, namely escaping Igglanova and skipping the spaceship "docking" sequences. I finally decided to get back to it after the menu glitch run. After careful planning, here are the major changes

But it was better than the next best thing, fighting sand newts on my way to Tonoe (over 2k frames loss). Sleeping in Kadary with the previous run would have been even longer (at least 600 frames).
