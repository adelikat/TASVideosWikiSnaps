	" When I save Maria and Annet, you notice I jump to get closer to them. Those cutscenes are scripted, so no time is lost (if you look closely, you'll see that when I save Annet, the screen fades out before Richter leaves the room, proving my point).

		"Note3:
	]b
	" This game doesn't have the II and III upgrades. Instead, it uses a rather weird system: if your hearts amount starts with 2(20-29), you can have 2 sub-weapons on screen at the same time. If it's 3 or greater(30+), you can have 3. To kill Dracula that fast I need exactly those 35 hearts I get in that room right before the fight.
