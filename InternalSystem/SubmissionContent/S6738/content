	"Un-canceling with intent to qualify for Playground.  As noted in discussion the strategy is not optimized for time. I sacrificed much time building an overpowered team.  The level ups, character control, cursor movement, and menu navigation were highly optimized, and hopefully some will see value in it.

	"The biggest variation of my run is that I utilize Edward instead of some stronger characters (Sothe, Tauroneo, Black Knight).  The reason is that his Wrath skill combined with TAS makes him powerful due to high critical hit rate, yet high avoid to survive.  Both these are enhanced after I give him Tauroneo's Resolve scroll, which gives 50% speed and skill boost when health drops below 50% (Below 30% needed for Wrath).

	"RNG Manipulation:  RNG was manipulated to get good stat increases at level up, and for other gameplay purposes such as surviving a turn, or finishing a battle in one round where a critical hit or special skill attack are necessary.
	$LF
	"Up until Chapter 1-5, RNG was manipulated by changing the order of battles, where a certain combination will give better results than others.
	$LF
	"During Chapter 1-5 it was discovered that selecting an enemy for attack that is on a diagonal with a 2 range weapon will cycle the RNG.

	"Difficulty came in that RNG Cycling and cursor movement were not consistent.  On some levels dead frames would show up where input was not recognized, making these trial and error processes.   When RNG cycling and movement was ideal, the TAS process was much less time consuming.
