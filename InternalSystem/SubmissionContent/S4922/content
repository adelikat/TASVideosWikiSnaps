	"After TASing Dragster for a while but getting nowhere, I looked over the Atari section again to see if there was anything there that didn't already have a TAS to it and interested me, this TAS is the result of that.

	"Jumping is fastest form of movement in this game, where I don't jump, it's either due to being hit by the enemy, or if I jump, I'll fall and die.
	$LF
	"When Batman does a spinning Jump, his movement is locked so the direction cannot be changed unless he has touched something walkable.
	$LF
	"When you throw a Batarang while in midair, Batman position is locked, you can get out of it by jumping and pressing a direction.

	"Pretty simple, jump, I avoid the Bikers because if Batman gets hit by them he comes to a complete stop.
	$LF
	"Boss: As you can only hit his head and he likes to keep his head up most of the time, you have to time when you are going to hit him.

[p 
	"I don't jump in the way of Shotgun bullets as these stop Batman, they are also the reason why I stop at some ledges as if I get hit by one while jumping over the ledge/gap, Batman will fall to his death.
	$LF
	"Boss: If you get and stay too close, Cat Woman will kick batman, so I keep my distance using batarangs.

	"Penguin's Rockets and Mini-rockets will stop Batman, so it's best to avoid them whenever possible.
	$LF
	"To progress, I have to defeat all penguins that appear at the end, how you defeat them determine when they spawn, this is why I choose to go to the far right first.

[p 
	"At the end of the Level, getting hit by Rockets is unavoidable, so I time my jumps to change when they start shooting, this allows me to reach the Final Boss sooner:
	$LF
	"Boss: This boss has 3 cycles, I used the Acid sparingly throughout the TAS so I would have enough for the first 2 cycles, I manipulate him at the end to make him move closer to his machine, this allows me to face the right direction when delivering the final blow.
	$LF
	"It is not possible to kill him on an earlier cycle.
