	"The Questionable Level Design Contest is a Super Mario World hacking contest hosted by AmperSam where entrants make a short, one level hack with the theme of simply being "questionable". It's a neat hack jam where folks make lots of interesting interpretations of the idea of "questionable" with incredibly silly and strange ideas that probably wouldn't fit in a full, conventional SMW hack.

	"QLDC #2 is where this particular SMW level hack comes in. Specifically, it's #18 in the Anonymized Entries patch collection. The main idea of this hack was the idea of making the map the actual meat of the level. The "actual" level at the end is intentionally terrible as the main punchline. I found this level really fun and interesting to play. As a goof I also decided to TAS the level as well since it is April Fools Day and all that.

In this particular one, due to going too fast the music for later sections simply do not start which sadly breaks some of the musical goofs in the hack. I can confirm they do work normally when I did a casual playthrough on the same core and emulator version.

	"Regarding the ending, I have to note that the only way to "beat" this game is by dying. Getting hit or falling doesn't make you lose lives, except in the last level. However, committing suicide in that last level is really trivial, so it makes sense to allow the author to perform there whatever playaround they wish, and still consider the movie goal as fastest-completion, as the rest of the game was cleared as fast as possible. In the practice, we will consider this as a stylistic choice, for which the publication page will have the "Contains speed/entertainment tradeoffs" tag.
