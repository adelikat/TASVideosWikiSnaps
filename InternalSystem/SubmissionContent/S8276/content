If you just wanted to complete the secret levels, you could start at level 10 or level 30 with a hotkey, but it made the most sense to start at level 1 and show off as much of the game as possible.

There will likely be more Club Penguin minigames submitted in the future, so it might make more sense to have them all under Club Penguin.

[div class=p 
	"Your position between levels isn't reset, so finishing a level on one side of the screen may be slightly slower, but make the next level much faster due to the better starting position. There is also a fake "next level loading" screen that can be skipped with Enter. Sometimes it's better to leave this up for a few frames to be in a better position for the next level. Later in the game, turrets are introduced, which shoot at the same time as the player. These shots can carry over to the next level ("transition shots") which adds lots of possibilities.

	"There is a bug where you can press Enter after shooting the secret ship, and for example go Tutorial screen -> Level 11 -> Secret Level 2, which would be faster. I didn't consider this beating all the secret levels for the purpose of the branch though. If the goal was purely "secret ending", it should count, although it would be faster to skip the first set of secret levels entirely.
