]h2
[h3 
	"Stage 1
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Get 1 power star to fight with the boss and enemies.Sliding is faster than walking.

[p 
	"Manipulate boss's route
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Stage 3
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"There may take a desync at the blue T-shirt enemy.He has two ways to move by randomness.So the "Hadouken" cannot hit him sometime.
	$LF
	"I tried many times to avoid the desync here.But it is always possible to show 2 different situations.
	$LF
	"I ignore a star because one is enough.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Stage 4
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Get 2 stars,hit the boss only in one wave of attack.
	$LF
	"Dropping from some wall is faster than jumping.
	$LF
	"Sometime jumping is faster.So there are many comparation in this stage,and I take the best one.

[h3 
	"Final Mission
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Take damage to save time.If two players crash the iron soldiers together,only one of them take damage.
	$LF
	"It can't jump out before the wall rolls up.
	$LF
	"Find a best way to fight with the last boss.

[p 
	"I signed my name at last because the score need not cost long time.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Somewhere I cost some frames to avoid desync,just like the sliding on the chain in Stage 3.
