	"Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is a 1999 remake of the classic NES title, released for the Game Boy Color. This movie aims to complete the game as fast as possible, using warps to skip sections of the game. This movie is a 17 frame improvement over my previous publication; I saved 15 frames in 1-2, 1 frame in 4-1, and 1 frame in 4-2.

	"My mushroom grab was slightly unoptimized, so I fixed that here. I discovered that a crouch jump to avoid the third koopa is slightly faster than breaking the block and jumping, because Mario's head stays inside the block longer, so he gets pushed farther. I also figured out that by jumping to the fire flower block a few frames later, you can jump sooner when you land, ultimately saving a little time.
