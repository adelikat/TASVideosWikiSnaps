	"Game/run description: There are cleverly disguised Mega Man clones, there are blatant Mega Man clones, and then there's "Widget".  Based on a bad 1970's TV show, everyone's favourite purple shape-shifting hero goes on a mission to rid the Earth of Ratchet's evil world-taking-over plans.  The author uses wall zips and other interesting tricks to save time and have Widget go into place he shouldn't be going and manages to keep the audience amused, despite the hero character moving really, really slowly.

[div class=p 
	"Alternating between left/right and right on consecutive frames will cause Widget to zip forward (this does not work with left/right and left).  On one-screenful rooms, this works as an extra warp to zip through the level.  However, this does not work all the time, because the game is subject to crash if you start zipping from certain points in the room.  You can also use zipping to take damage early and bypass a backwards boost, and can also be used to bypass ground and wall checks and go right through walls
