	"1. The original Ultimate Doom v1.9. Use the following command line: "doom.exe -playdemo e2dq-302.lmp"

	$LF
	"2. Prboom 2.2.3 (or later version). You just need the original doom.wad file, which contains the level data etc. Drag and drop the LMP file to the prboom.exe and the run should begin.

	" Aqfaq's comment about Strafe50
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Strafe50 is always on. This means the player can turn while strafe running at max speed, which is supposedly impossible. It makes nearly no difference in the run (maybe a few frames), but makes recording the game A LOT easier (hours of work). Any sane person who makes Doom TASes should use it. IMO, this is technically less drastic than pressing left+right simultaneously, which has always been allowed. So, I think using strafe50 while turning is totally okay.

	"So, this run. It has had good viewer feedback, and is eligible for Moons category. It is also faster than any existing regular speedrun or TAS. The intermission screens are not skipped as quickly as possible, but that should easily be covered by the fact that it is timed in-game, and does this as a speed/entertainment trade-off. (I have added this tag above.)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The second question is about the difficulty level. Technically, Nightmare (NM) is the highest, and this is done on Ultra-Violence (UV). UV can be considered the highest "regular" difficulty, since NM was added at a later time (supposedly as a impossible joke difficulty), and plays very differently from what everyone is used to. In addition to the monsters respawning on NM, they also shoot faster projectiles, attack more often, and move faster. I think TASvideos has room for both. It should also be mentioned that due to the respawning, any 100% runs (which includes killing all enemies) should be done on UV.

	"About episodes in Doom 1 - all episodes are separate, and starting a new episode resets all your weapons and stats. Submitting them separately is OK. We will not accept single-level runs, though. For Doom 2, there are no episodes, and only whole game completions are considered for acceptance.

	$LF

[p 
	"ADDENDUM: I was asked to comment on Strafe50 while turning. Aqfaq's reasoning is sound, it can be compared to left+right. It is not possible to press normally, but it can be accomplished with a modified controller in both cases. The game accepts Strafe50 and turning as valid input when it receives it. This is not true for all input which can be sent, for example sending quicker running input than normally possible makes Doom go "Indigo: is turbo!" to warn viewers/other players that the player Indigo is cheating.
