	"In the previous movie, at frame 3798: sacrifice the next frame and then hold up+down = 2 frames saved, yay. Actually, not very impressive finding. Also at the end of this level (50 M) it is not necessary to climb all the way up as fast as possible to save those 2 frames because when the top of the level is reached, the game moves Donkey Kong to specific position first and after that the heart appears.

	"And finally we have... a shortcut. At level 75 M, surprisingly standing on the edge of the moving platform doesn't kill Jumpman when the ceiling is reached and... you know the rest. 130 frames saved.
