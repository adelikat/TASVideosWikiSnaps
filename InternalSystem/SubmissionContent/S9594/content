	"In fact, in all previous TAS runs, the third stage's route wasn't optimized for maximum speed in order to preserve the S Weapon. This time, we aimed to demonstrate the fastest possible third stage route, which means we could only use the starting weapon against the third stage boss. Consequently, we decided to create a TAS that completely avoids collecting any power-up items.
