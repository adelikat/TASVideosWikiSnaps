	"I began this run in late July of 2005.  Nine months of my life have been devoted to the making of this game.  WOW! I feel like I've been on a journey of my own.  In the process of making this run I have through much frustration as well as excitement.  I've watch 2 dragon warrior 1, and a dragon warrior 2 run completed. I've gone through many personal life events.  And in the end, I learned far more about this game and TASing than I ever thought I would.

	"Character selection was difficult for chp5 5.  I went almost entirely with a Hero, Ragnar, Alena, and Taloon party.  This gave me the advantage of having pure attackers, reducing the need to manipulate the AI.  Taloon was invaluable for his "sweeping legs" and "awful puns" in order to incapacitate enemies.  I kill off uncessary characters to prevent them from leveling up.  This saved me several minutes.

	"In this game the odds of a critical hit is 1/64 (unlike the mere 1/32 in DW1&2 :P).  The only exception is Alena who has a lv/256 chance. (notice that this mean the 2 critical hits I get early in chapter 2 are each a 1/256!)  With a systematic use of button presses & waiting I manage to reduce the delay when trying to get critical hits to and average of 10 frames (with a 20max).  This results in near-flawless looking fight sequences.

	"It is always faster for a enemy to miss rather than to cause damage (even when my characters have plenty of HP).  So you will see that an enemy never causes damage to my characters unless I am purposefully killing them off.  Also I manipulate them well in order to get a missed attack after only a short delay.

	$LF
	"it is highly unlikely that taloon will do any one particular action, nevertheless I manage to get the optimal action.  Note that Taloon's "army of merchants" is used rarely.  This is because it is rather slow and it is much less manipulatable for critical hits (button presses don't affect critical hits in this case which could lead to long delays).  In one case I used the "tripping" in order to get a critical hit.  This is usually slower due to the added text.  But you can manipulate the amount of damage the critical hit does (which was needed to get a few more hp of damage against the final boss).  The last hit of the game came from Taloon.  I thought it was only fitting that the brave hero trip and accidentally kill the ruler of all evil :)

	"Like with any RPG there is always the possibility of improvement.  As far as route, character selection, I believe this to be as fast as possible.  Further improvements would be mainly be from better luck manipulation to reduce wait times between actions. (I believe this to be unlikely without the aid of a "bot")
	$LF
	"I did sacrifice some time due to inability to luck manipulate: in chp 5, on my way to Keelon, I get stiletto earrings form a random treasure drop.  It is slower to have Taloon in the party, but I needed him to steal the treasure chest.  The odds of getting the regular treasure drop are 1/4096!  I hope people can understand me compromising with THOSE odds :)
