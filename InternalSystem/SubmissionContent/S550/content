	"Back to the Future is a game known for being ridiculously tough, so I figured I'd give it the time attack treatment.  A good portion of it is spent in the fairly simple street levels, with the occasional tough mini-game thrown in where you have to hit a ridiculous number of objects to move on (and get sent back to the previous stage if you fail).

	"The video runs from start to finish, aiming for as fast a time as possible and showing off a bit to make the stages more interesting I take only one hit in the final stage, because as far as I can tell there's no way to avoid slowing down at that point; you either hit the side of the road and get dragged to a stop, or drive over the lightning marks and take a hit to your speed.

	"The toughest part of this video was making it interesting to watch.  It's not a game known for its thrilling moments.  But I did my best with that.
