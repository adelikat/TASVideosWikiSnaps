	"There are four guessing minigames, each of which is a dinky little challenge that unveils a pre-drawn picture one square at a time as you score points. If you think you know it, you can press start to end the game early; as such, these games are 
	[b

	" does. As such, I've added a 
	[b 
		"full clear
	]b
	" restriction: I must score 40 points in each game and fully clear the picture. In my old submission, I made the questionable decision to just ban the start button and end each minigame dead or alive, usually dead... which isn't all that different from just skipping the minigames. I initially made that decision because I was a purist about saving 
	[em 
		"all
	]em
	" of the citizens in the fireman game, so I gave up and saved 
	[em

	"The drawing mode gives one player a prompt (everyone else must close their eyes!) and has either all players or just their teammate(s) guess it. The controls are inspired by the Logo turtle: you can use left and right to rotate the cursor, A to draw a line, and B to move without drawing. You can also make 1x1 or 2x2 circles with down and up, respectively. Unlike the Logo turtle, the Pictionary turtle is stuck to an 8x8 pixel grid and can only move at 0x1, 1x1, and 2x1 slopes (i.e. 0, +/-1, +/-1/2, +/-2, 1/0. Or... All vectors (x, y) such that x, y âˆˆ {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}). These limitations make it difficult to convey just about anything.

	"Now, drawing minigames are only available for two or more teams of two or more players (you need a teammate to guess your drawings). Otherwise, they're replaced with a random roll of the four guessing minigames.

That doesn't sit right with me either, so this time, I told the game I am four people so I could show you two drawings. The Potato Brains are just a vessel; these drawings are for YOU to guess!
