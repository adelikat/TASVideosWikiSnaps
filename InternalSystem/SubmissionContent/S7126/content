To get the same trajectory. There's no other way. I've tried to change the boss's fighting strategy, and I can't get frames

	(__wikiLink|displaytext=previous submission|href=/5158S)
	", I talked about how Ghosts 'n Goblins was the perfect example of one of my favorite parts of the TAS scene. To explain it further: This game has a long and storied history on the site. The first published Ghosts and Goblins run was quite literally 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=the first user submission TASvideos ever received|href=/SiteHistory)
	". That was over 17 years ago, and today, in the year of our lord Two Thousand And Twenty Part Two: Unmasked (known overseas as Two Thousand And Sixteen Part Six: We Really Fricked It), we received another fantastic run of it. New optimizations, new tricks, even a new TASer after Arc's absolute dominance over Ghosts w/ Goblins from the very start. It's a great thing to witness, it proves the longevity of the community and the hobby, as well as the evolution of the tools and techniques over a near two-decade period. Perhaps there could be another Ghosts ft. Goblins run in the near future, or perhaps it could be in the far future, but it seems perfectly clear to me that we will have another Ghosts alongside Goblins run just in general, and perhaps more Ghosts as well as Goblins runs after that, and frankly I am here for more Ghosts in addition to Goblins.
