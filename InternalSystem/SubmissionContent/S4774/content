	"In this movie i choose to pick up Kazuki in Rasetsu mode. In this mode, his moveset contain a frame perfect finisher (2 frames to be exact)and a mashing buttons follow-up wich are very TAS friendly(his no contest move is also very fast).

	": Hello, mamuuuut.  This playaround really had some nice choreographed sequences, and contained a fair amount of variety throughout the various stages.  From the combo-heavy emphasis on Jubei, to the deliberate beatdown on Charlotte, to the fatality-like finishing sequences on the final bosses, it was evident that much thought was placed into putting this one together.  Nice work, all around!
