[div class=p 
	"Unlike my 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext="all coins" submission|href=/9600S)
	", this run aims for fastest completion. When a coin is collected, it's tallied on the score screen after completing the level, losing time. I avoid picking up coins as much as possible. The last coin in "Bloodbath" and the last coin in "AfterCataBath" are impossible to miss however, and they are the only coins that are collected in the run. Outside of that, this run is virtually identical to the other submission. The only other noteworthy changes are the fact that I save 1 frame in "PG Clubstep" and 6 frames in "Cataclysm" due to me not having to go for the coins (this is because going for these coins causes lag).
