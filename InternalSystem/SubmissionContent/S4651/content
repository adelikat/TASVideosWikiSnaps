Using this information, he was able to find out how many dust sprites were needed to manipulation each starting position/web pattern based on where the TAS started the fight in the RNG sequence. He also discovered that breaking an ice sled advances the RNG sequence by 12 values, which made getting one of these 0 crossover patterns possible when there wasn't enough time to create 12 extra dust sprites.
