	"My Hero for the Sega Master System is a port of an arcade game of the same name from 1986. It's a fairly basic side-scrolling beat-em-up with only three different stages. There is a one-on-one fight at the end of each level with the guy that stole your girlfriend, which can be easily won by spamming high kicks. Frogs cane be jumped through, as they lose their hitbox mid-jump. The bombs and spiky balls all usually require a lot of waiting, but if you are strategic enough you can get past without much issue. The only places I slow down are to wait for bombs to explode so I can get past, and by turning around for a frame to kick the enemy grunts.
