[div class=p 
	"Again, the acceleration is different based on how many pizza boxes we're holding. We start each level at full acceleration, but if we hit a wall (which this TAS doesn't) the speed value on the X axis is automatically set to 0, and after that our speed slowly increases on a decreasing logarithm until the maximum speed based on how many boxes we're holding is reached.

[div class=p 
	"By jumping and picking up a box at the same time, it's possible to jump from the box's height while still picking up said box. This can be used to make things much easier than intended.

	" TAS Strategy
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"The strategy here is to keep placing and picking up boxes without letting go of R/L (depending on what direction we're heading). This way, we can produce tiny waves of speed to travel slightly faster than intended on average. With this trick, I managed to save 46 frames in the first level over my 1st attempt, where I just held the boxes all the way.
