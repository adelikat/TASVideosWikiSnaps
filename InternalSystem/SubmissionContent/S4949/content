		" In previous run, I had to wait entire trying talking animation before karaoke. This animation is required to sing songs correctly for some reason. I found I could cut most of waiting frames when I activate karaoke machine first then trying talking. Also, 2 ladies more approached more closer than before run because I changed Takeshi's sitting position. Thanks to that, I cut 2 punches to kill them.
