	"So this entire idea to TAS the game (from my own perspective) came when I was working on the Battle Factory TAS. A thought had crossed my mind about how a TAS of the main game would be like. Because of my curiosity, I went ahead and started to try it out. It was during this that I had learned odd behaviors between Frontier and normal battles. I proceeded to take on the game as close to a "secret" project until completion before unveiling it publicly to see what the responses would be like, which led to the test run's birth. A bit later into it, the Pomeg Berry glitch (this by itself was known for a long time) had an expansion into it where it became possible to clear the game far sooner with use of corrupted moves. Once that had surfaced, the number of possibilities increased and soon the glitched run became more sought after. Since I was working on the final version anyway, I decided to take it on. After the previous TAS, I felt that there was more to be done so I went to work on the improvement. This submission is the result of said improvement.

	$LF
	"Here's a part to develop a bit the corruption pattern, and the possible changes.
	$LF
	"Since the Pokemon selection pointer is programmed to check 2 values, we can consider that there are 2 different corruptions.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The first one is linked to the reading of HP / unknown value.
	$LF
	"In Party Pokemon data, this value is always at the same place, thus, this corruption is completely periodical, happening every 100 byte at the same adress everytime.
	$LF
	"The pointer reads data with double-words, so RAM data needs to be seen in 32-bit mode (double-words mode).
	$LF
	"If a double-word is corrupted, the console will try to set Bits 0 and 2 of the leftmost byte to 1.
	$LF
	"ex : 0x0024 5678 -> 0x0524 5678, 0x0400 0000 -> 0x0500 0000
	$LF
	"Thus, you have 4 different value changes : 
	$LF
	"Bit 0 and 2 effectively set to 1 (+0x0500 0000), only Bit 0 (+0x0400 0000) or only Bit 2 (+0x0100 0000) set to 1, or no Bit set to 1 (no change).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The second one is linked to the reading of Pokemon species.
	$LF
	"And this value isn't at a fix position, due to an anti-cheating build that organizes most of the Pokemon data into 4 substructures, and orders these substructures depending on the PID (congruence of PID modulo 24).
	$LF
	"Thus, the pointer will read the PID value to determine where the Species value is, and read it after that.
	$LF
	"Since there are 4 different positions for substructures, there are 4 different positions for species data into Party Pokemon's data.
	$LF
	"Thus, the corruption happens every 100 byte, but in 1 of 4 different places, so the corruption itself can't be seen as periodical.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The PID reading doesn't bring any value corruption (strangely).
	$LF
	"A corrupted double word has Bit 6 of its leftmost byte set to 1 or set to 0.
	$LF
	"ex : 0x0200 0000 -> 0x4200 0000
	$LF
	"This corruption isn't a real toggle (if Bit is 1, it becomes 0, and vice-versa). The Bit is set to 1 or 0 depending on the value of PID and TID (stored in a double word next to PID).
	$LF
	"If Bit 6 of the leftmost bytes of PID and TID have the same value, the Bit will be set to 1. Else it'll be set to 0.
	$LF
	"ex : PID = 0x4000 0000, TID = 0x0000 0001 -> Bit set to 0.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This second corruption is more interesting than the first one since you can always change the value of a double-word, if you can manipulate the value read as PID to control the corruption the pointer will make.
	$LF
	"With complete control of PID value (modulo 24), you can also manipulate the position of the second corruption.

[p 
	"The addresses where RAM corruption by pointer will happen are fix.
	$LF
	"But hopefully, another anti-cheating script saves the corruption.

Damage variation works as such: The fourth digit of the RNG value functions as a damage scaler. If it is 0, damage is applied at full 100%; if 1, 99%; if 2, 98%, and so on (if F, 85%). 0 is the only digit that gives the max damage; all others reduce it by at least 1.

	"At the very beginning of movement, you can hear a "bump" sound when I'm inside the truck. You can hear the same thing when I stop talking to the rival's mother later. It is faster to do this rather than turning as fast as possible without bumping (A comparison vid can be found

	"Once I get the Mudkip, I proceed through the tutorial battle against the Wild Zigzagoon (Poochyena in R/S). Just like in R/S and the first turn of FR/LG, you cannot get any critical hits in tutorial battles. Once over, I proceed to Route 103 to face Brendan. This battle goes by quickly so moving on back to Littleroot Town because Brendan told us so. Got the Pokédex from Birch, the 5 Poké Balls from Brendan, and the Running Shoes from Mom before finally leaving again. Everything else was pretty much straightforward.

	"First thing done was entering and leaving the Pokemon Center to set a Teleport point for later on before entering the gym. Spoke to Dad (Norman), the gym leader and our conversation gets interrupted by that blasted Wally. He wants a Pokemon but doesn't know how... So I am sent to go help him catch a Pokemon. Took this time to manipulate the borrowed Zigzagoon's IVs and nature for helping us out.

	"Back at Route 102, we walk into the grass and we proceeded to manipulate the IVs and Nature of the wild Ralts to have low HP & Defense IVs with a -Def nature. Two max damage Tackles were enough to 2HKO the tutorial Ralts, but the game treats it as a capture anyway. Returning to the gym, Wally returns the borrowed Zigzagoon before leaving and I followed afterwards as Dad will only battle after I get 4 badges. So after listening to this stalker, I head towards Petalburg Woods where I encounter a guy looking for a Shroomish, only to be ambushed by a Team Aqua Grunt. Being a good person, I defeated the Aqua Grunt with 2 critical Tackles and 1 normal Tackle. After saving the Devon employee, I receive a Great Ball and the change here is skipping the Ether as there is no need for it. Rest is straightforward.

	"Starting off by entering the Trainer School, getting the Quick Claw as it lets a Pokemon go first (with the right manipulation), and giving it to Mudkip before going into the gym. At the gym, we battle Youngster Josh for the experience (EXP) and took out his Geodude with 3 critical Mud-Slap for the double level up so Mudkip can use Water Gun while being in Torrent range thanks to the first Tackle from it. Next is Gym Leader Roxanne... nothing really special here. Got the Stone Badge and TM39 Rock Tomb from her, then left the gym. After leaving the gym, the same Devon Employee guy from before is in pursuit of that Team Aqua Grunt from Petalburg Woods as the grunt managed to steal the Devon Goods from him. Bumbling idiot! So as I am heading towards Route 116 when the Devon guy stops me to..pretty much want me to help him again to avoid him getting in trouble by Mr. Stone... so having no choice in the matter, I set out into Route 116 so I can get the Goods back from that no-good thief! This is where I capture the Abra and after doing that, make it to Rusturf Tunnel where that Grunt is now holding an old man's Wingull hostage. *Gasps* ...anyway, I confront the Grunt and defeated him a second time. Now the Wingull is free and I have the Goods back! So I return to Rustboro City to give the Devon Goods back to the employee only to get sent on 2 more errands! After testing the Match Call feature for Devon, I have Abra teleport me back to Petalburg City, which saves time as opposed to revisiting Petalburg Woods again and also having to be forced into a Double Battle with the Twins on the bridge. Back at Route 104, I catch Marill to use as a HM Slave and left Brendan at the entrance to Mr. Briney's hut.

	"Here, I go to Granite Cave first to take the Letter to Steven and skipping the Escape Rope actually saved around 1k frames due to picking it up, opening the Start Menu to use it, and the animations for using it as opposed to just leaving without it. Once done with the Letter delivery, I went onwards to the gym. In Emerald, the gym Layouts are different so I didn't have to face any trainers at all so I could get to Brawly without any problems. Not much else to note except this being the point when Mudkip evolves into Marshtomp. Got the Knuckle Badge and TM08 Bulk Up from Brawly and proceeded onwards to Slateport City. Improved it with better RNG.

	"Nothing really noteworthy happened in Slateport so moving on to Route 110. Another thing that differs between R/S and Emerald is the additional trainers and re-positioning of the ones from R/S. Walking in between them will result in a Double Battle, which would be far slower due to both of them having a Plusle and a Minun each along with them both spamming Helping Hand so taking the two PokéFans on individually is faster. After dealing with those two, I take on Brendan again. I proceeded to let Marshtomp finish things. After that, I had to face another 2 trainers in which one of them was able to be avoided in R/S but cannot avoid in Emerald due to the additional Double Battle bit that the game has. Took care of them and moving onwards to Mauville city.

Of course we deal with that pesky Wally and afterwards have to listen to that stalker named Scott, whom introduced himself earlier in Slateport City. Now that the distractions are out of the way, onwards to the gym! The gym pattern this time doesn't seem to be much different that I noticed so after beating the Youngster, I face the Gym Leader Wattson. Quick Claw manipulation was key in this battle and while the other 3 Pokemon were taken down with normal Mud Shot, the Manetric needed a critical Mud Shot to be KO'd. Got the Dynamo Badge & TM34 from Wattson and with that, I take my leave from Mauville City. Everything from that point until Meteor Falls is the same, with the exception of not catching Skarmory. At Meteor Falls, I take the bottom exit to Route 115 and cutting through Rustboro City again to return to Route 116 and caught a Taillow. Back at Rusturf Tunnel, I pick up HM04 Strength and the HP Up earlier and used them on Marshtomp heading to Mt. Chimney. I also stopped by Verdanturf Poké Mart to buy 1 Super Potion, 3 X-Specials, and 1 Fluffy Tail. For now, it may seem that I am behind by around 1k frames. Took care of that and from there, nothing really important happens so see you at Lavaridge Town!

This gym's pattern is pretty simple that I make it to the Gym Leader easily. Haii Flannery! <3 ...sorry, couldn't resist! So onto the battle! STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) Torrent Super Effective Water Gun makes quick work of the first 3 Pokemon. Her ace Pokemon, Torkoal, on the other hand required a critical to go with it. Got the Heat Badge & TM50 Overheat from Flannery-chan and after listening to that jerk, Brendan, indirectly call us weak, we use the Super Potion here on Marshtomp and use Abra's Teleport to go back to Petalburg City.

	"At Petalburg City again, it's time to take on the Gym! The gym layout itself is pretty much the same as R/S so moving onto Dad's room! This time around wasn't too bad. Mud-Slap was very helpful against Spinda as it allowed me to use the 2 remaining X-Specials on Marshomp as well as preventing Slaking from KO'ing Marshtomp! It was basically critical Mud-Slap for those two aforementioned Pokémon then critical STAB Torrent Water Gun for the rest of the battle and that's all! Got the Balance Badge & TM42 Facade from Dad and get Surf from Wally's dad as a gift for dealing with his pesky son. Now that we are done with all of that, it's time to start preparing for the Pomeg Berry Glitch! Teaching Surf to Marshtomp at Route 103 to face the Twins Amy & Liv as they are needed for glitch setup. I managed to manipulate neither to use Helping Hand so I was able to KO both with Surf in turn 1. At this point, Abra will start gaining levels, but that's fine. Nothing time losing.  Now with that done, I move on to Route 118.

	"Once I arrive in Route 118, I battle the two trainers in the way in doubles as it is faster than battling seperately before making it to the Weather Institute in Route 119. Here I will lose a few frames to get back in Torrent range so the other battles will be a bit easier. Once we get to the sexy Aqua Administrator Shelly, I take this time to KO both Abra and Taillow. After kicking Team Aqua out of the Weather Institute, I manipulate the Castform to have the needed value for the Pomeg Berry Glitch coming up and leave here so I can get to Fortree City. From here on, damage manipulation was very important as I needed to get to Marshtomp to 1HP before Fortree City. Again, Brendan shows up late like always and wants to battle. I manipulated Slugma to damage Marshtomp with a Max Damage Ember, also putting me in perfect RNG range to crit KO Grovyle the turn after KOing Slugma. This, unfortunately, put me with the WORST RNG for the Pelipper! At this point, I had to manipulate for the least amount of Protects as possible... despite what was implied, Pelipper WILL use Protect turn 1 and on turns when it knows it cannot get a KO. It will attack when you are in sure-shot range to KO and problem is that doing that WILL get Marshtomp KO'd. Not much else to say there. Now for the next important step, I needed to battle Ninja Boy Hideo and manipulate the second Koffing's Sludge to not Poison as I'll already be at 1HP from the damage after the level up from the previous Koffing. After this battle, I pick up the Pomeg Berries next to Hideo before entering Fortree City.

	"Alright, finally made it to Fortree City! Now for the big changes... firstly, I enter the Pokémon Center and deposit Abra in Box 1 Slot 3 and Castform in Box 1 Slot 4, switching its moves so Powder Snow is in the second slot. Then I teach HM02 Fly to Taillow and used the Pomeg Berry on Marshtomp. After that, I proceed over to Route 120 to meet Steven & manipulate the wild Kecleon that he wants me to battle to have the EGFL RAM value needed which is the value of 07DF8F87. Once I got it, I needed to to make it change to value 47DF8F87 before using the Fluffy Tail to leave the battle. Now that everything else is done, I go back into the Pokemon Center to withdraw the Bad Egg and go to the gym. The battles from this point on are very short thanks to the Bad Egg having a corrupted move which makes battles end instantly once the B button is pressed after the moves are revealed. With that said, breezed through the gym, got the Feather Badge & TM40 Aerial Ace from Winona, and left the gym. Once outside, I teach Skarmory Fly and use it to fly over to Ever Grande City. We are nearing the end!

So thanks to the Bad Egg, the battle with that pesky Wally is even shorter now and same goes for the other battles. Other than the path change, everything else is nearly the same. Moving on to the Pokemon League portion! I only have 6 Gym Badges.. I won't be able to get in! Or am I? The two guys standing guard of the Elite Four entrance let me through anyway and in all honesty, they should both be fired for it! Anyway, Elite Four & Champion battles are quick thanks to the Bad Egg and with that said, this run is over!
