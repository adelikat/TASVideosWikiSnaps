	": Hello, turbofa.  All around, this is a good, clean run (I'm also glad that you came back and significantly improved on your last submission!).  The 'cutscene jump' in stage 4 (with the snow) was particularly eye-catching, and it was also a bit surprising to see how brief the final boss fight actually was.  While not too remarkably entertaining, this was indeed nicely optimized.  Congrats on your first published run!
