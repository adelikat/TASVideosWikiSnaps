	"Well, yeah. We manage to beat game 14 (probably the "hardest" difficulty due to faster ball speed and no Catch function) by channeling our inner Luigi. The AI have a few patterns, and some of those patterns can be exploited by just... not moving.

	": So in some ways this submission is trivial but in others it is very much not. On the one hand it has very few inputs, basically all of them are menuing. We have rejected runs with a lot more input than this. On the other hand, ensuring that the game actually reaches the end does take a little work.

	"The response was surprisingly positive here for a game that largely plays itself. I find it kinda funny as a concept, a little long to watch but not heat death of the universe levels of long.

	"If a run aiming for fastest gameplay came along, either we'd have to consider the two runs against each other (which feels kinda eh), or we figure out how to accept both. Note that this does not and will never mean that a run that simply trims a few frames will be published alongside a run that doesn't. At best that would result in playground. At worst rejection. I would only ever consider it for cases where strategy greatly differs between TASes, but that's a discussion for later.
