	"The hardest difficulty to start the game at is Skill Level 2 (expert), which was selected here. Apparently, this effectively starts the game at 2nd loop difficulty (meaning this TAS effectively ends play at loop 4 difficulty). From what I can tell, loop 2 start difficulty decreases the loftiness of your jumps in the Deadly Forest and increases the speed of vines, crocs, and boulders compared to loop 1 start difficulty.

The jump loft is so low that I had to let the screen pause in places to A) line up vine cycles so I wouldn't lose too much height and/or die and B) manipulate vines to have a fast enough sway to keep up with the screen scroll better. The speed and initial positions of the first two vines cannot be manipulated—they always start swaying that slow—and it is a very suboptimal pattern. It is so suboptimal that it is faster to die and respawn higher up the vine, which allow greater risks to be taken later. Despite this section looking suboptimal, I examined it very carefully. I predict the only practical way to improve it would be to program a brute forcer to find a faster solution.
