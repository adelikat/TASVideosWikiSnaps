	"Most significant time save in this run is due to a glitch that I found in the level 1 boss fight. If you kill the boss in a specific frame you trigger health and ammo replenishing 256 frames faster than normally and finish the level that much faster. I was quite lucky since this specific frame is only 35 frames away from the most optimal battle I could find thus providing a 221 frames time save. Another significant time save is

	"achieved by using shotgun in levels 1 and 2 instead of handgun saving about 160 frames. (Due to equipping it in level 1 with the cost of 57 frames, the time that shotgun actually saves obviously reflects much more in level 2). (Time saved in level 1 = 239 f)

	"While getting more lag frames with shotgun than handgun, it saves big chunk of time most notably in the mid-level "mini boss" and the end of the level mini boss fights. Switching weapon to homing missile in the boss fight is better, because its slightly faster and its by far the best weapon to use in level 3. (Time saved in level 2 = 156 f)

	"Shot gun strategy for the final bosses ends up saving lots of time compared to previous homing missile + grenade launcher strat. Time save comes from being able to use shotgun for the ultimate final boss. Luckily the ammo count is perfect for this strat. Final shots have to be delivered with handgun since you would otherwise have to take a hit or you would be too far away to hit with the shotgun well enough. (Time saved in level 5 = 52 f bringing the total amount of time saved in this run to 474 frames.)

	"To previous TASers. Without your effort in the currently published movie, which I greatly used for reference and from which I gained lots of valuable information about some very nice tricks and strats, this run would have certainly turned up to be far away from what it is.
