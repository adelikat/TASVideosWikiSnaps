	[a href=https://www.speedrun.com/btbcwfi rel=noopener external nofollow

	", I feel. Given that this game has no credits of any kind that I can find, or at least none accessible from the main menu, I've added "all missions" as a branch in order to make it more clear what's happening here, making it consistent with SRC and marking that it's a full completion run. I love it when a plan comes together!
