	"Enemy pushing - Usually an NPC is impossible to bypass. However, it is possible to clip through them via an enemy pushing you fowards. To do this you need to approach the NPC until their dialog box appears. Once this happens the game registers you as 'in' their hit box. Once this happens an enemy can then push you through.

	"Enemy clipping - Usually, it's impossible to bypass walls. However, it is possible for Ikachan to clip vertical walls
	$LF
	"thanks to badly programmed hitboxes. Basically, whenever Ikachan approaches an enemy hitbox the game automatically pushes him out. However, building up enough speed before this and using precise timing, it's possible for the game to push Ikachan through any vertical facing walls. This will not work with horizontal walls, as Ikachan has different physics moving left and right.

	"The goal of this run is to use an Attack Star to clip through a wall towards the beginning area, and reaching the top of the screen. Doing so automatically starts the ending.

	"-The Japanese version is used because the text is slightly faster. There are no other differences.

[p 
	"- In order to damage Attack Stars in the boss fight, Ikachan must be Level 2 or higher. Any lower and he won't do any damage.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- Due to an oversight, it's possible to end the battle with one Attack Star still alive. Even better, this Attack Star is able to follow you around.

[p 
	"-I use enemy pushing to get past the blob with glasses blocking the spacesuit, and enemy clipping to get past the one tile roof blocking the way to the exit. After that it's just a mad dash to the finish line.
