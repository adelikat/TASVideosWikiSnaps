	"Enemy pushing - Usually an NPC is impossible to bypass. However, it is possible to clip through them via an enemy pushing you fowards. To do this you need to approach the NPC until their dialog box appears. Once this happens the game registers you as 'in' their hit box. Once this happens an enemy can then push you through.

	"thanks to badly programmed hitboxes. Basically, whenever Ikachan approaches an enemy hitbox the game automatically pushes him out. However, building up enough speed before this and using precise timing, it's possible for the game to push Ikachan through any vertical facing walls. This will not work with horizontal walls, as Ikachan has different physics moving left and right.
