	"Bizhawk (Gambette core) loses a few frames in loading and possibly lag. It is mostly faster to jump to avoid lag, although in some situations it isn't. I redid every room multiple times to ensure that all lag that could be saved was, which allowed me to get under a minute and thirty seconds. The extra speed allows you to complete the final room much quicker, which is mainly why it saves time. Less damage is taken than the previous run due to this. The animation of losing the potion in the final boss room doesn't lose time because you have to wait before you can shoot a knife.
