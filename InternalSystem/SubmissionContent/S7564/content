	"A daredevil climber has decided to scale some skyscrapers.  Various obstacles impede his progress including some that at least make a degree of sense (randomly closing windows that will pinch his fingers, girders falling from higher up on the buildings, and frayed electrical wires from signage); while others which make less sense are also present (a giant condor rapidly laying multiple eggs that fall onto the climber; and a mad doctor trying to pelt the climber with various objects like flower pots, buckets of water, and baskets of fruit from open windows).  If the climber successfully scales a building, a helicopter is waiting at the top to give him a ride to the next building.

Pushing up on the control causes the climber to raise his arms to the next ledge, then pushing down on the control causes him to pull up to that ledge.  Cycling up and down is required for progress.
