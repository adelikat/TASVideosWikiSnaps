I went through the TAS and tried to do as much lag reduction as I could, but I still couldn't match the original's pace. Probably a version difference. The frame alignment is also slightly different, which means I have to do some workarounds to make some of the skips still work.

	"Previously, the RNG in this level was bugged. Basically, two RNG functions were conflicting with each other at the same time, causing many starting seeds to result in infinite loops that never finish the level. FractalFusion found that the fastest way to end input early and avoid an infinite loop would involve entering the level, exiting, and then entering it again on a specific frame, finishing the level in just 64 attempts.

[div class=p 
	"However, since this is fixed in 1.2.1, we don't need to do this anymore, and can just enter the level and end input earlier, right? So I sent the TAS to FractalFusion again, who looked at the new RNG and then told me how many attempts it would take to beat the level. So how many attempts does it take? Remember, the odds of completing the level are roughly 1 in 296 000.
