The first way is running to  a tree on the ground and then jump to that tree you have to change the the side and fall down at the same time. This glitch can be stored for later usage and it can be used for different directions, even horizontally if the squirrel runs down an egde, but it's useless since there are only short gaps and thew invert and decrease the speed.
