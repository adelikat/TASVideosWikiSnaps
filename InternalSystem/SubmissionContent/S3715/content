	$LF
	"The other character is the squirrel Benny. Climbing trees and swinging on poles is no problem for him. He uses acorns to kill enemies, this makes the run to be well prepared in the challenge mode.

	"Both characters can run faster until there boost meter is empty. To refill it enemies must be killed or climbing on a tree or a pole with Benny.

[p 
	"I found a glitch with the sqirrel to go faster. There a two different ways to perform it. The first way is running to  a tree on the ground and then jump to that tree you have to change the the side and fall down at the same time. This glitch can be stored for later usage and it can be used for different directions, even horizontally if the squirrel runs down an egde, but it's useless since there are only short gaps and thew invert and decrease the speed.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The second way to perform the glitch works only if the squirrel is on a limb. It's simply changing direction of the input while jumping towards the tree. This can't be stored but it can be cancelled.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There's also a glitch for the lion to go faster, it's so fast that the camera can't follow the player. You have to find a bull near an edge, gaps don't work. This bull must be unconscious lying on the edge and you have to perform a dash attack down the egde. If it's done right the lion will shoot out of the screen.
