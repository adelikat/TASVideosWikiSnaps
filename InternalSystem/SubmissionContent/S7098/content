	"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is the first game in a now extensive series of 10+ games that are still being created and released to this day. It was first released for the Playstation on September 30, 1999, and later ported to the Nintendo 64 and Sega Dreamcast. "Primitive" by today's Tony Hawk control standards, this game utilizes flip tricks, grab tricks, grinds, and special tricks, which can be done on street ramps, vert ramps, rails, and all sorts of other objects.

	"20 years after this game came out, BSGrind discovered that turning the Autokick feature Off sped up the skater enough to make a noticeable difference in runs.
	$LF
	"Also, though Tony is tied with Bucky and Rune for the fastest speed, Rune is the only one with the signature move Christ Air. Landing signature moves gives a small speed boost, and Christ Air only takes 20 frames to perform allowing usage of it on lots of small jumps.
	$LF
	"Christ Air also improves each Roswell heat by a second. I'm fairly confident this and the other uses of it throughout the run make up for the time it takes to switch to him from Tony.
	$LF
	"Using soft reset to exit stages to the main menu instead of Retry'ing them saves on out of game loading times. This also helps skip the opening sequence faster.
	$LF
	"I made sure to improve the in-game time on every level as well, mostly from optimizing the extra speed Autokick Off grants. These improvements vastly outdo the couple of seconds it takes to change this setting.
	$LF
	"As a bonus, I made sure to perform and land every trick (flips, grabs, grinds, and specials) that Rune has access to at least once, with the exception of spins, as 720, 900, 1080, 1260, and Mega Ollie (what the game names any spin higher than 1260) simply take too long.

	[br

	$LF
	"The biggest improvement here is the high jump off the quarterpipe that reaches the 'K.' I actually have to slow down before the jump to ensure I hit the 4th set of boxes and land on the quarterpipe below the 'K' for the next section.

	"I hit the grinds around the 'T' a bit differently, then use 5 Fastplant Christ Airs which saves a few frames. Landing in the water here for a frame doesn't slow me down more than jumping on the ramp would have.

	"However, I spent a lot of time learning how to optimize scores here, and came 2 frames shy of improving both heats by 1 IGT.
	$LF
	"Aside from the slow Kickflip to Indy and Fingerflip moves, Madonna, Rocket Air, and Benihana have the highest base scores.
	$LF
	"Repeating 1 of those moves in a heat would always be a lower score than the other 2.
	$LF
	"Crooked Grind and Smith Grind are the highest scoring grind tricks.
	$LF
	"Staying on the Smith for a couple frames, then spinning and holding the Benihana as long as possible at the end grants just enough points to edge into 3rd place.

	"Breaking down the IGT differences between this run and Nahoc's. Of course, based on which frame each run ends on, a 1-second IGT difference could be anywhere from 1 frame to 1 frame less than 2 seconds, so not all of these improvements are equal, but I hope this makes it clear that the entire run benefitted from the changes. The only time that did not have an IGT improvement was the first heat of Burnside, though it still had a few frames improvement over the old run.
