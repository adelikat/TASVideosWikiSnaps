	(__wikiLink|displaytext=All Platforms Challenge|href=/HomePages/adelikat/AllPlatformsChallenge)
	".  I went through the complete set of Atari Lynx games including homebrew games.  This game represents what I thought was the most entertaining and publish worthy of the set.  Thus it is my best attempt at completing the challenge!

	"The difficulty in real time of this game is absolutely evil.  Half the enemies are almost the size of the screen and do tremendous amounts of damage.  You invulnerability period is very short.  If you get into a bad position surrounded by enemies you can be clobbered from full health down to death in a matter of 1 second!  Those same enemies take 5-6 hits to kill which is a very long time because Gordo's throwing ability is quite slow.  In almost every case an enemy is too close to you to kill it before it hits you.  This means every enemy in the game requires either blowing through it by taking damage or repeatedly retreating in order to kill it.
