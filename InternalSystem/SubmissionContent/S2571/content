	[a class=extlink href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Lynx rel=nofollow 
		"Atari Lynx

	" in 1993.  The plot involves a renegade monkey, Gordo, that breaks out of a lab and frees all the animal captives....or something, yeah.

	"This marks the first submission for Atari Lynx.  The motivation of this project was to complete my 
	[a class=intlink href=/HomePages/adelikat/AllPlatformsChallenge 
		"All Platforms Challenge
	]a
	".  I went through the complete set of Atari Lynx games including homebrew games.  This game represents what I thought was the most entertaining and publish worthy of the set.  Thus it is my best attempt at completing the challenge!

	"The difficulty in real time of this game is absolutely evil.  Half the enemies are almost the size of the screen and do tremendous amounts of damage.  You invulnerability period is very short.  If you get into a bad position surrounded by enemies you can be clobbered from full health down to death in a matter of 1 second!  Those same enemies take 5-6 hits to kill which is a very long time because Gordo's throwing ability is quite slow.  In almost every case an enemy is too close to you to kill it before it hits you.  This means every enemey in the game requires either blowing through it by taking damage or repeatedly retreating in order to kill it.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"One way of conserving health is to take damage from a lesser enemy and use the invulnerability period to go through a more powerful enemy.

	"Gordo will stay running after jumping as long as you are holding right on the frame you land.  This fact can be exploited to keep him in run mode even while moving in different directions or pausing to wait for events.
