	"A single frame save on the very last fight. It took me a few days to set up Jaffar and tune it up for this game. Then I ran Jaffar for four days straight on this fight only to find there was a single frame to be gained. That frame was hidden in plain sight: it was the last one. The weapon (fire) activation was duplicated there, adding one frame to the whole movie.
