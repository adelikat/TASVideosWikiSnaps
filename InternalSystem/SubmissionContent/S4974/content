	"Most of the work in this speedrun was the creation of the maps for the game.  Due to the tiled view which scrolls one tile at a time, and the very limited amount of tiles, it is often not easy to find out how many tiles are being passed while moving.  Also, I didn't want to miss any secrets that I might be able to use, and I didn't feel like gluing screenshots even it was easy.

Unless it is currently in a place where the walking robot doesn't fit, in that case the plane turns 180 degrees.  By using well timed controls, such a 180 degree turn is also possible in the open.

		" The walking robot automatically aims.  It shoots in turn at everything that it can reach, but without regard for walls.  This makes it a very slow killer if there are many targets.  The plane on the other hand cannot aim and always shoots forward, making it more useful for targeted shooting.  The only problem is that you are always approaching something while shooting like that.

There's potential for seconds to be saved all throughout, possibly even up to 10, just by taking corners better, not to mention that some of the weird chokepoints I mentioned in my notes could have new strategies just waiting to be found. Unfortunately, I have to reject this for, just barely, not meeting the site standards of optimization. I'm hoping to see that improvement in the future, though!
