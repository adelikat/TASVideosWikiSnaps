		" In Stage 7, the final input on the keypad is delayed for a few seconds. This is because otherwise, the stage would have been completed in under a minute. That sounds like a good thing, except for the fact that it blocks progress. The game keeps track of how long it took to beat each stage, and displays your lowest time on the stage select; however, because the timer only measures in hours and minutes, not seconds, it will display at the end of Stage 7 a time of 00:00. If this happens, the remix stages don't unlock, and Stage 7 will not have a time logged. Presumably, this is because this game has 00:00 logged for each stage already, and once the previous stage logs a time other than that, the next one will unlock.

The more important part, the routing and puzzle solving optimizations, all look good to me. Nice work!
