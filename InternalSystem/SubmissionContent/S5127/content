	"Q Boy is an unlicensed game developed and published by Sachen in 1994. It stars the titular character, Q-Boy, on his search to track down the evil Dr. Mouse, in his attempt to steal the Flower of Dream and destroy the peace of the Q Galaxy. Honestly, this is a really good game, not only as a bootleg game, but as an NES game in general. It's tight, fun and charming, being better than some actually licensed games. It's one of my favorite games on the system, and it's one of the best pirated games ever, joining in with Metal Force and the the Zook Z games on Game Boy in terms of quality and fun.

	"As for the TAS itself, well... I started this TAS back in July of 2014, nearly 2 years ago. Yeah... that long, mainly because my TASing skills back then were crap, hell, I didn't even know what a TAS Editor was. Another reason being the improvements and such, and my overall motivation for the project. But at last, this movie is finally done.
	$LF
	"Actually, this movie is almost about 2 minutes faster than the original TAS of this game back then, DAMN SON TIME SURE FLIES.

	"This game has some rather unique mechanics involved, such as float jumps, shooting air puffs and other fun stuff. It really feels like it's own thing and not like a ripoff.

	"This game is FILLED with frame perfect stuff, such as avoiding refilling your power bar, avoiding spikes/lava, jumping while charging your shot, among other things.
	$LF
	"There's few glitches, but not enough to call them significant. There's also a frame rule thingy with the timer, which screws with u forever if ur not fast enough... sad D:

	"Dekutony had asked me to help get this finished up, so I did. The run was largely finished, I simply went over it and made improvements where I could find them, saving about 30 seconds overall. I found the game to be pretty interesting and the balance of health and power led to some interesting strategies. Unfortunately I think the entertainment value suffers quite a bit from long back to back autoscrollers and the maze in level 4. Still though, pretty good high quality unlicensed game.
