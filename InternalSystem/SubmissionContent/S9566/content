	"Perfect Dark is a first-person shooter released on the Nintendo 64 in 2000, it is the spiritual successor to GoldenEye 007, which means Perfect Dark has almost identical movement and very similar mechanics to GoldenEye 007. It has a speedrunning history dating back to when it was first released, and since then it has had a long and storied speedrunning history with many strategy developments. The individual level speedruns of this game are incredibly optimized because of this, with a points ranking system hosted on the-elite.net. I watched lots of runs on there to help me optimize this TAS.

[div class=p 
	"Perfect Dark also has an ingame timer that displays the current ingame time up to the nearest hundredth of a second. It’s not perfectly accurate at the end of the level though because there’ll usually be an extra frame or few of lag that doesn’t display on the timer. Your time is saved/displayed in full seconds, so individual level speedruns have the goal of breaking seconds barriers rather than grinding for every single hundredth. For this TAS though, sometimes the ingame time will be slower in the pursuit of the fastest overall real time.

	"Lag: Perfect Dark can sometimes be a laggy game, with a variable frame rate. For clarity I will be referring to each line of input as a tick (every 0.02 seconds since this is PAL with 50hz).

[div class=p 
	"Strafing: Running forward with Up-C and Left-C or Right-C is faster than running just forward. You also want to keep moving in full speed as much as possible, because if you let go of Up-C, you’ll lose your speed and will lose time accelerating back to full speed.

[div class=p 
	"Radial menu: In a real time run, you want to pause as little as possible. But there are some items/tools you cannot equip/select by weapon switching with A, so you have to either pause or use the radial menu by holding A until the radial menu pops up, and then you can use stick or directional buttons (buttons is faster) to equip whatever item you want. You do lose speed with using either pause or radial menu, but the radial menu is faster for real time runs because you can equip the item faster in real time, but using pauses is faster for ingame time because it stops the ingame time. You can switch to the radial menu much faster with TAS than a human because you can do it tick perfectly consistently but you can’t really do that as a human.

	"The Deep Sea level is the reason why this run is on PAL, there’s a trick to complete objective 2 by destroying two canisters to disable the Cetan megaweapon with the FarSight gun early instead of waiting for Elvis to reach the console to spend time to deactivate it via the console. This only works on PAL on full screen because the zoom of the FarSight uses the vertical video height to determine how much to zoom, and PAL has a high enough vertical resolution compared to NTSC versions to zoom the necessary distance. For comparison, the NTSC record on agent is 3:01, and the PAL record is 2:25 so it’s a huge time save, enough to use PAL for this entire TAS despite PAL often being a bit slower overall for the other levels (mostly due to worse framerate and slower lifts).

Head roll I turned off because it makes your head wobble like in real life, and it’s way better and easier for aiming since your aim doesn’t drift/wobble. Auto aim was something I had to choose, I opted for no auto aim because I didn’t want the auto aim interfering with my aim since I can aim perfectly in a TAS.

You need to uncrouch twice very rapidly (only pressing the R bumper for 1 tick each time) before/when you start falling in order to get a glitch called fast fall which enables you to fall at rapid speed, which allows you to fall fast enough in order to be able to get 5 seconds. This was pretty easy for me to TAS because I have the world record of 5 seconds myself on console, so I had the knowledge, but tedious to optimize every detail to get a lower decimal.

	"This is a linear level that revolves around these 3 sets of lasers that (are supposed to) prevent you from advancing the level until a cleaning robot comes and deactivates them. You can skip the lasers by double crouching and doing a very frame perfect (probably 2 unit precise or something) trick to walk through the lasers since Joanna is about a pixel smaller than the gap. Also about half the time, you will get “zapped” by the laser which damages you and stops your momentum and loses time vs not getting zapped, I was able to avoid the zaps though in this run but I’m not 100% sure how it works. You want to kill as many guards as possible since this trick is highly dependent on lag, if it’s too laggy it’s almost impossible to laser skip. On the IL runs you watch some of the cutscene to wait for the bot, but this is RTA so I just instantly skip the cutscene. I drop off the camspy, then during the data uplink upload wait I reequip the camspy to complete the objective of taking a picture. The rest of the level is just running to the ending.

These guards can sometimes kill the NPC Dr. Caroll (the floating TV lol) so I kill a lot of them on the way to the elevator since I have time to spare waiting for the elevator. You can bypass this locked door by pressing B through the elevator wall since it’s unlocked on the other side of the door. The stairs on this level are really hard to strafe fast because they are very tight hairpin turns. I opted to not grab the rocket launcher to kill the body guards, and decided to do 5 headshots with the Falcon 2 pistol since the rocket launcher generates a very laggy explosion. Then I simply run up the stairs to the helipad ending the level. I was really surprised that this was 51.48, because I thought I would lose a lot of time from the elevator likely being slower (elevators on PAL are known for usually being slower). This actually ties the PAL system record for this level despite instantly cutting the cutscene which really surprised me as well.

Then after some strafing comes an OOB. The door being opened by a guard before you get to there is really random, sometimes the guard won’t open the door in time and I didn’t know how to solve this besides redoing the whole start, luckily it took me only a few tries to get the door open. I tried to do this OOB in full speed, but I wasn’t able to do it since the railing is a very small space. The rest is strafing until the basement, where you have to kill all the guards in the basement to get the keycard that ends the level. This keycard is dropped by the last basement guard you kill.

There’s only one 14 achieved on PAL, the runner who achieved it (Joris) was able to help me out a lot with this stage and the ending especially because with all the lag and nuances of it, it’s actually pretty complicated. It also felt like the lag was higher on the emulator here than on console so that made things harder as well.

I also looked down a lot there because in addition to reducing lag here it also can make sharp turns faster. There’s two paths you can take, you can go on the streets after the alleyway (the most used path but you can get stuck a bit as the curb acts as a ladder which ruins your speed) or the sidewalk (the main problem is that you can get stuck on a guard which I narrowly avoided).

You’re essentially capped by completing this objective, so there was a lot of focus on tweaking with the inputs to pull out the mine as early a frame as possible and throw it as early as possible, you can speed up switching weapons (especially ones you just picked up) by doing an A press/weapon switch right before you switch to the picked up weapon. The ending was very lag dependent, you also want to perfectly time hitting the climbable parts of the sewer climbing up to throw the mine in order to get a “fast climb”.

Now for IL speedruns you watch most of the cutscene so you wait during the cutscene for the safe to be decoded and for the safe door to be wide open, so you lose no IGT. You’re intended/required to do this strategy to beat the target time to unlock the cheat. I decided to actually end the cutscene earlier losing IGT, so I had time to build up full speed, and then warp through the safe door when it’s barely open enough for me to get through to save real time, then you go to the ending of the level.

On the way to the ending, you need to complete the objective gain access to hangar lift (since we skip the hangar lift), this can simply be triggered by loading the area with the hover bike then continuing with the ending. The world record ending which involves shooting a guard to lure him only works on the NTSC-U version of the game since that is the only version where the ending door is open, on the other versions you have to do a slower ending which involves getting back in bounds with the hoverbike, going down the walkway far enough (the door will be locked otherwise) then warping through the railing with the hoverbike and finishing the level.

Instead of following your path, he will simply calculate the shortest hallway path to you when deciding which way to go whenever he is at an intersection, so if you are too fast, he’ll go straight to the stairs rather than following your path through the Star Map room since it is simply a shorter hallway distance.

	": I followed a fair amount of the work posted in the TASVideos Discord and how passionate you were while working on this TAS. I could definitely tell that a lot of love went into this since everything's well planned out and optimized throughout the run. While there's potential improvements to be made, those are generally small and mostly require some incredibly harsh RNG manipulation to get. Nice work!
