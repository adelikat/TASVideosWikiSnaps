	"First attempt at TASing Tintin in Tibet. This game is the most difficult game which I own for my SNES. Every little moving object on the screen is able to kill you and the game does not forgive the smallest mistake. While playing on the console you want to prevent every tiny energy loss but for this run I sporadically let Tintin get beaten up for example by some hotel employees. There are some points in this run which can be played a little bit better and faster, but for a first run I was able to beat my console record by over 10 minutes. I never imagined that a sub 25 minutes run would even be possible. In level 7 I made no mistake when I jumped into the scrub: the game has a bug at this point which lets you hit the bush even though you press down to get through it -.- I jumped there to prevent the "Tintin getting stuck" animation on this. In level 12 the wind direction is random, so I have to wait for tailwind to get across.
