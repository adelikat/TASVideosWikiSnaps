For some stages the bot found that the optimal way to beat them is to let one or two enemies through. It seems if you kill enough of them, the ones that pass through will just flee, which is faster than having to kill them.

	"Reading the FAQs, it seems it is possible to let yourself be captured and then rescued for double firepower. The whole process is just to slow to justify any extra frames saved from being able to double shoot. That is, at least for the 8-challenge category. If we played ad infinitum, then probably it'd be the best decision.

Now that we have seen a judgment for a failed submission, we now have the criteria that completes all unique content and difficulty.

	"The run was extremely impressive. BOTing this game showed tremendous strength over the 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=failed submission|href=/5260S)

	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/eien86

	]a
	". What I didn't expect was to see 
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/ThunderAxe31 
		"ThunderAxe31
	]a
	" finding improvements. This just tells you that the very nature of BOTing is extremely difficult to account for all variations that could yield better results. I don't fault 
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/eien86 
		"eien86
	]a
	" for this, since I share the same frustrations with my own BOTing; however, this BOTing can't be ignored for its strength. During my analysis, I noticed that some aliens were passing through and I was curious as to what was going on. The way I see it is...the BOT didn't need to finish up some small parts at the end of each attack wave, yet it detected the completion with fewer inputs. This just demonstrates that the BOT found detection errors with the game. Even though it was pointed out in the submission thread...I am personally glad to see such a condition in this game being demonstrated.
