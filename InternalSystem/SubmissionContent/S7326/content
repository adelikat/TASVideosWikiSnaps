	"Hello!
	$LF
	"I made this TAS using BizHawk 2.6.2 in the TAS Studio.

	"There's not enough information about this TAS to explain, it is just tapping buttons too fast so that it can reach the goal.

	"We have to fill 5 goal spots by placing the frog in that pit.

	"Its only one level because I don't like paying for games (I'm a school boy), hence, Demo Only. It is a fan game, can be viewed on :

	"The main thing I noticed is how much leading the frog to a different slot can save. I entered level 4 with only 15 frames saved, used whatever slot ordering looked intuitive and reduced my improvement to like 4 frames due to waiting. Then I swapped the last 2 slots and saved 200 frames with little to no effort. Another thing is really getting at the very edge of a platform so you can jump in the new moving platform sooner.
