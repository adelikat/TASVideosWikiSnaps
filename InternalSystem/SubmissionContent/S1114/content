	"This game is based on the graphic novel/anime series called Saint Seiya  aka Knights of the Zodiac. I included the opening and the ending for entertainment. I personally like the game music alot and I try to expose as many secrets as possible for enjoyment. The entire game is based on the story from fighting for the bronze cloth, retrieving golden cloth robbed by Ikki, until saving the goddess Athena twice.

	"The hardest part in the game is trying to figure out how much energy I should put in to kill the enemy because it can get random sometimes and I need to save energy too. To save walking time, I have to wear cloth but it takes alot of cosmos as I walk. And also I never used other characters since they are weaker.
