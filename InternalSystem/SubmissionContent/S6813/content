	"So a new TAS uh. Didn't I say there was no timesave left in the last submission? Too bad I guess, because we found out some months later that japanese people were speedrunning this game with a glitch, a glitch that is actually pretty useful in this TAS. So, what's different? Three things: Sign Glitch, Mog Push and Kilanda Skip. I'll explain these more in details.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"First, Kilanda Skip. I named it like that because, in all normal speedruns, we go to Kilanda at the end of year 4. It's a fast dungeon, and gives good strength artifacts. But I was thinking, maybe taking the boat takes too long, what other dungeon can I do? So I decided to do Mushroom Forest cycle 3 instead. This skips the need to get 500 gils, since we don't take the boat, and reduces a lot of time due to less loading zones and less overworld movement. In total, this saves approximately 20 seconds. The reroute also consist of not taking Sasuke's Blade in Mushroom Forest cycle 2, since we take it in cycle 3 instead :P

[div class=p 
	"Sign Glitch, probably the most interesting glitch in the game after Infinite Gil Glitch, can be triggered while reading something (a sign, mostly) and taking damage at the same time. This puts the character in an interesting state where he takes priority over everything. That means we can basically push everything pushable in the game, at normal speed. It's used in River Belle Path cycle 1 and 2, to kill monsters sooner and push them to get their keys close to the fence. But mostly, it's used to push the chalice in the miasma streams. It's faster than carrying them by 1.5 to 2 seconds. In total, another 20 seconds saved.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"And last, the dumbest thing I've ever created, Mog Push. Uuuuuurgh. It's simple: when Mog gets tired, I push him. It's inspired by sign glitch, but the difference is that Mog is a piece of ****. His hitbox is super hard to move correctly, and finding the perfect frame is just some luck. Pushing Mog is useful in Mushroom Forest cycle 2 and 3, but mostly in Lynari Desert, where I need to walk a LOT with him, in a hot environment (so he gets tired faster). Sign glitch and Mog push might look like unoptimised, and it might be true for some parts, but like I said, it's really hard and I did what I could. 20 seconds again.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"I also rerouted a bit the money collecting, as I only take 2 Worm Antennaes (500 gils each) in Tida, and I don't have tailor as my father's job. Instead I picked up the rancher job, which gives me enough meat to skip collecting a +3 strength artifact in Veo Lu Sluice cycle 2 (and also get through the rest of the game). I also take money from him almost each years to compensate for the lack of money. With a 200 gils in a chest in Mushroom Forest cycle 3, this makes just enough to finish the game. Talking about Mushroom Forest cycle 3, did I talk about the boss? No? Ok then. IT'S THE WORST THING EVER. It wasn't meant to be beaten with so low defense and strength. At half health, he stops using the only attack that can't damage you. I still miraculously managed to kill him in 39 seconds, which is a lot, but also very quick for what I had to work with.

	"The rest of the run is very similar, tho optimised a lot. I shaved some seconds in total by saving frames here and there. And I'm super happy about it :D

	$LF

[div class=p 
	"There will always be timesaves, tho this time, it's more than just rng. Mog Push and Sign Glitch are 2 complex tricks that involves moving a lot (including even sometimes moving backward to not pass through Mog or the chalice). So it might be visible where maybe it could save time, some frames, maybe seconds, I'm not very sure, because it's really about getting lucky to place yourself correctly. Otherwise, everything that was in the previous TAS was the same or better (except Goblin Wall because bad rng I 'm not really sure). So really not a lot of timesave left ;)

	"1h36 was a goal for a long time. Now that I got 1h35, I can say I'm done. Unless we find SOMETHING, there's no way I'm beating this. I might work on other TASes of this game in the future, like 100%
