	"Pokémon Blue Kaizo is an extremely difficult romhack of Pokémon Blue. Almost every trainer battle is mandatory, and most trainers have strong and well-balanced teams, and boss fights use many legendary Pokémon. Additionally, some of the routes are replaced with complex mazes. This TAS catches a Poliwag and uses it to win so many battles that it reaches level 100, and then uses a level 100 Dodrio to defeat the Elite Four.

	"When my Pokémon’s HP is at or below 20%, battles are in “redbar” mode. Enemy Pokémon’s sound effects no longer prevent me from selecting attacks, which saves around two seconds per Pokémon fought. This run would be an hour longer if not for redbar. When my Pokémon is not in redbar, getting hit to lower my HP is a priority. When I level up in redbar, I skip the level-up sound effect, unless I just defeated the last Pokémon in my opponent’s party.

[div class=p 
	"When Poliwrath KOs itself against a Kangaskhan just before Lavender Town, this reduces the number of “slow level-ups” that will take place before I use Rare Candy in Lavender Tower. Each slow level-up is about 150 frames slower than a fast redbar level-up.

	"Healing PP takes a long time. I avoid healing in Pokémon Centers unless absolutely necessary. Before Celadon City I have to be careful with my use of PP-restoring items like Ether, but in this romhack, the department store sells Ether so I can buy enough for the rest of the run in Celadon City.

	"When an opponent uses Explosion, its health bar is depleted instantly, rather than the slow decline that we see when KOing the foe with an attack. So it’s usually quickest to manipulate an Explosion miss, and if Poliwrath is faster, I’ll use Submission and miss first.

[div class=p 
	"In the battle with Giovanni, I have to defeat Gengar, but his AI is too smart to use Explosion against Poliwrath. Poliwrath needs two hits to knock out Gengar. In this generation of Pokémon, when you switch in a Pokémon, the AI chooses its move after your swap. So I swap in Psyduck to get immediately hit by Gengar’s Explosion, expediently getting the KO. I should have used Charmander, so I could later use the ablative Psyduck strategy against Lorelei’s Cloyster.

	"Because Pokémon Centers are slow, I only use them four times: At Mount Moon, when Poliwhirl's PP is depleted. At Cerulean City, which sets a teleport destination to Escape Rope from Bill's House back to Cerulean. In Lavender Town, which sets a teleport point to dig back from Celadon City. And at Cinnabar Island, which sets a teleport point for digging out of the old lab.

	"Some areas have the encounter rate set to maximum, which means the player will encounter a wild Pokémon every three steps, so Repel and Super Repel are used to avoid encounters. Some other areas have an encounter rate high enough that using Super Repel is faster than using luck-manipulation to avoid every encounter in the area.

	" is the fastest for the first battle, and after that I’ll never use it again. I teach it Cut and Dig, which it can learn quickly because it only knows two moves.

[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Psyduck
	]b
	" is caught on a mandatory encounter tile – the player will encounter a wild Pokémon every three steps in the grass on Route 2, and that grassy tile can’t be avoided. So I might as well catch Psyduck to use as my HM-ployee for Surf and Strength. If this encounter could be avoided somehow, catching Psyduck would be unnecessary, and a future run could use Squirtle, Poliwrath, or Snorlax for Surf.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Poliwag
	]b
	" is the primary battler for most of the run. This Poliwag has DVs of FFEE, which means 15 Attack, 15 Defense, 14 Speed, and 14 Special. Ideal would be FxFF, but I was unable to manipulate for those, and this Poliwag is close to ideal. It is nicknamed "!" to save time on displaying its name. I considered some other primary battlers to defeat Brock, such as Squirtle, Oddish, and Ponyta, but Poliwag was the best choice.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Poliwag’s key advantage is that it knows Bubblebeam, a “short-delay attack”. With battle animations turned off, there are still two types of animation in this game. Attack moves with a secondary effect, like Bubblebeam, have a shorter animation than moves with no secondary effect like Water Gun. Short-delay attacks are 60 frames faster than long-delay attacks, so this time difference adds up quickly. It also evolves quickly and learns a good set of moves; its only weakness is bulky Water-types like Slowbro and Vaporeon.

[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Fearow
	]b
	" is caught to use Fly. It’s best to catch it after most of my visits to the Pokémon Center, because each Pokémon in the party slows down the healing animation.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Dodrio
	]b
	" is caught just before Victory Road. It knows Body Slam and Hyper Beam, which are short-delay moves, and Drill Peck, which lets it hit Gengar when needed. In Pokémon Blue, when a Pokémon KOs its target with Hyper Beam, there is no need to recharge the move afterward. This makes Hyper Beam the strongest move available in a TAS, and Dodrio has some of the highest Attack and Speed of any Normal-type that learns this move. Its DVs are F1F4, with perfect Attack and Speed, and low defense is preferable because I need to knock out a Ditto on Victory Road.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"I calculated that Poliwrath would need 68 moves to defeat every Elite Four Pokémon, whereas Dodrio can do it in only 33 moves. I considered Seaking because of its instant-KO attack, until I discovered that in this romhack Horn Drill only has 1 PP. I considered Electabuzz, until I discovered that its Thunderbolt attack is a long-delay attack in this romhack, making it too slow in battle.

	"As Pokémon Blue is so buggy, the speedrun community has a particular definition of “glitchless” – glitches encompass errors that cause unintended changes to memory. These rules allow the use of Gen 1 misses (every move that is “100%” accurate has a 1/256 chance to miss, except Swift), and an oversight where the player can walk away from the second trainer when challenged to two battles at the same time. Major glitches such as Missingno or walk-through-walls cannot be used in this run.
