	"I don't honestly expect Rockman 1 ever to be completed in less than 10 minutes,

	"This newly discovered technique is very interesting, especially
	$LF
	"in that it makes it possible to cross walls in various places.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Because it also causes the game sound to shift, people who
	$LF
	"are interested of glitches should definitely try it.
	$LF

[p 
	"This technique was found two years ago, but because Megaman died when
	$LF
	"the technique was used, it was judged unusable by me, Bisqwit and Morimoto.

[p 
	"It was very fortunate that an insight struck me to try the technique
	$LF
	"once more before throwing it completely away, for it enabled yet
