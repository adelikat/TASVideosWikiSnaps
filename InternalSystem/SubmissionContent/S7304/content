	"The game is so easy that many people think that the previous TAS can no longer be improved. But after watching a series of videos about the game carefully, we found that sometimes the mines in some levels can not be fully loaded. Facts have proved that this is a small skill that can be used. In the third level, we made the mine under a ladder unable to load, thus avoiding climbing the ladder at one time. We improved the TAS with 9 frames in lecel 3, but because of the frame rule, only 8 frames improvement was kept to the final.
