Owl saves were a feature added in for the US and PAL releases of the game; the original Japanese version of the game didn’t have them.  Since 0th day is required to skip two items (the bow and quiver) 16 item low% is only possible on the US and PAL versions.

	"This inspiration for this run was that back in late 2016, the RTA world record for this category was 4:43:54 by Jimmie1717.  The run had several major mistakes, including one in Snowhead Temple that cost over and hour.  Not only was this run the world record for about a year, it was also the only publicly available video of a 16 item low% RTA run.  All other runners who had tried to beat the record (and there were a few) were too embarrassed of their runs to post videos of them.  Since low% is such an interesting run, we decided it deserved a good run.

	"This run was originally thought to be impossible on N64 and Bizhawk because a very important trick in completing the run, using light arrows as Deku Link, crashed the game.  However, while working on different TAS, I (omgatree6) ran into a similar crash using the hookshot as Goron.  Upon further investigation, I discovered that the crash only occurred if the game was paused after equipping a transformation mask.  Once that was discovered, a way of circumventing that pause was discovered, and the run became possible on N64 and Bizhawk.

	"After 10 months of work, we have this.  Since the TAS began, the RTA low% world record has come down by about 2 hours, down to 2:41:03 by Jimmie1717.  Despite this, our TAS manages to beat the RTA world record by about 47 minutes (the TAS is a 1:54:42 by RTA timing).  We accomplished this by using several tricks and strategies that aren’t RTA viable due to being too luck dependent, too difficult, or too risky.

This works because Deku Link is so short that when he aims roughly straight down and fires an arrow, his face is so close to the ground that the arrow spawns in under the ground.  We found this trick while in the planning stages of this TAS and it saves about 5 minutes over our original plan (the original plan was to hover on top of the temple, fall off the back of the temple out of bounds, and shoot the switch from behind while falling).

They’re manipulated to spawn far away because when shooting at something sufficiently far away with light arrows, the splash particle effect doesn’t happen.  When this effect doesn’t happen, the cooldown between light arrow shots is reduced from several seconds to just a few frames.  This allows us to fire off light arrow shots much more quickly than usual.  The Twinmolds are manipulated to spawn close together so that we can shoot the second Twinmold during the post-damage invincibility frames of the first Twinmold without wasting time aiming.  Lastly, the Twinmolds are manipulated to take a specific flight path so that their bodies won’t block any of our light arrows shots.  The Twinmold’s flight patterns change depending on what you do during the phase, so this part required quite a bit of trial and error to get a good pattern.

If we entered this fight with a full magic bar we could fire 2 light arrow shots during this phase, but that wouldn’t save any time.
