[p 
	""Originally released in November 1986, and later built in to the Sega Master System II, Alex Kidd in Miracle World is the first of several games to feature the big-eared Radaxian prince who was Sega's unofficial mascot before the creation of Sonic the Hedgehog. In this game, Alex Kidd must save his family and at the same time end the tyranny of Janken the Great. This game offered many different types of gameplay with an assortment of different vehicles, swimming levels, puzzle elements, and a rock-paper-scissors mini-game (called Janken) in addition to basic sidescrolling stages. Because of its diversity it was widely accepted to be far ahead of its time and was easily one of the most popular games for the SMS."

	[em 
		""punch to stop"
	]em
	" : I especially used this trick in the entrance of the shops and in the last room of the game. In this run I never punch unnecessarily. Sometimes I punch when there are no rocks/enemies, I do that because when you punch on the floor your speed goes immediately to 0, you don't have to wait for Alex to slow down. That's very useful to turn back quickly or in the shops where your speed must  be exactly 0 to enter/go out. But there is a problem: when you punch on the floor you have to wait 11 frames before you can move again. The solution to avoid this is to jump and punch in the air so that you touch the floor at the same time your punch ends. Thus, you don't have to wait.

		""the cam glitch"
	]em
	" : I used it to skip a few rooms in the last castle. It's easy to destroy the game with that glitch, so use it with caution. Watch

	$LF
	"You can use it almost everywhere the camera is moving. To do it, pause and unpause the game while the camera is moving. If you do it at the right time the camera will not stop and you will have a free tour of the game and sometimes a reset...
	$LF
	"The difficulty here is to manage to make Alex reappear on the screen. I think it's only possible when the camera goes down at the beginning.
	$LF
	"It's hard to understand what happen...
	$LF
	"During the (vertical) moving, the camera stops in each room. Then, there are 2 possibilities (depending on your X position) :
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"1 – The camera stops indefinitely in the room.
	$LF
	"	If you jump the camera will go up, but you will not reappear.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"2 – The camera stops some time and continues to go down.
	$LF
	"	While it is stopped, you see in the RAM that Alex is falling. If you jump just before (otherwise it will do nothing) the camera goes down, the camera will go up and you will reappear on the screen. Now just try to be at a good place and not in a wall...

	" Luck manipulation
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The only random thing in this game is the money in the boxes. It can be a small ($10) or a big bag ($20) of money depending on your position and the time when you destroy the box.
	$LF
	"In the first level I managed to manipulate luck for all the boxes without losing time. In the rest of the game, I didn't need to manipulate luck because I had enough money. But I did it nevertheless because I find it looks better to have only big bags. I always tried to get the maximum of money I could on my way. The only small bags you will see are places where I didn't manage to have a big one without losing time.

I calculated how much time it takes to get each bag of money. This was very long but now I'm pretty sure I use the best route.
