	"The time saved can be attributed to several factors. A large improvement is the starting platform which requires two less pieces to build, saving around 70 frames. Another thing I tried very hard to improve upon was the hieght of the stacked pieces. Most of the time it was hard to save any time, because Acmlm had done a very good job, but there were a few notable gains. Other than time saving improvements, this run does not use pause to manipulate the pieces, but rather left+right+down to delay the next piece, as discovered by alden. Doing this causes the current piece and next piece to flash, but this is far less distracting. I also found a small window for manipulation after the current piece has landed, but before the next piece appears. This causes only the next piece to flash, which is even less disruptive. This form of manipulation is also faster than using pause, because it only delays the next piece by one frame, instead of a minimum of three as pausing does.

	"When the run ends, the entire board is clear except for a single line of pieces up the middle. Not only is this the fastest possibility (not a single piece was wasted), but it also looks rather nice.
