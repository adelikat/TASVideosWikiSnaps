	" While the difference in input file length between this TAS and my 2013 publication is 2:49.99, the actual gameplay improvement is significantly larger.  Due to differences between the PSXjin and PSX-BizHawk cores, loading times are closer to the console (i.e. longer) on BizHawk.  This affects the timing on everything from loading screens between rooms, to how long cutscenes load, to how long it takes to call someone via CODEC. If this run had had loading times comparable to the previous run, it would have been under an hour.

	[em 
		"Metal Gear Solid
	]em
	", even with the proper Japanese BIOS, so while my initial plan had been to immediately start working on my any% improvement after finishing VR Missions in late 2013, I instead had to wait until July of 2015, when BizHawk officially gained PlayStation support.  Once that happened, I had the totally-not-crazy idea to work on both any% and all-bosses simultaneously, and of course stream the whole thing live since that process had worked out quite well with my 
	[em 
		"VR Missions
	]em
	" project.  Unfortunately, BizHawk's PSX core had to undergo another serious overhaul later that year, forcing me to start all over in January of 2016, but thankfully this came with the benefit of finding several new time saves.

	"The most immediately obvious change to

		"Integral
	]em
	" is that the game uses English voice acting and Japanese subtitles despite being a Japan-only release.  As a result, a few minor easter eggs (such as Psycho Mantis referencing you playing the Japanese-only 
	[em 
		"Policenauts
	]em
	" and 
	[em 
		"Tokimeki Memorial

	"Aside from the above, there are a number of changes and additions to the game between the original and 
	[em 
		"Integral
	]em
	".  A huge amount of extra content was added, including the actual difficulty modes from the PAL and NTSC versions (and a brand new Very Easy difficulty), support for the PocketStation, new hidden codec frequencies, a first-person mode, a new assault rifle for Snake, new alternate costumes for Meryl and Gray Fox, and an "Alternate Round" with new guard layouts for the various difficulty levels (which I plan to TAS at some point in the future).  It also included a third disc of 300 VR Missions, which would later be released separately in North America and Europe.  I already did a TAS of those.
