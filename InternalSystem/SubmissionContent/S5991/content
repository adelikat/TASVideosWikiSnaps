	"On Level 8, lettered pots must be collected according to the order of the letters of the english word shown in the upper-right corner of the screen. Pots with the same letters can be interchanged, but in the only case on Stage 2 the order to collect the two "R" lettered pots doesn't matter as the frame length will be exactly the same according to my test.

	": The TAS seems fairly optimized. At first glance there would be confusion as to why it was routed the way it was, however on level 8 the pots must be collected in a specific order.

	"The main concern I had over the TAS was the usage of the level select to skip to the final stages. However, given the fact that the game has a clearly defined ending (rescuing the princess at the end of the last stage) and that this can be considered a gameplay feature, it is acceptable. Completing the game from level 1 can be considered a form of full completion.

	"While some tricks in the game are kinda neat, the TAS is fairly repetitive. While the posts in the thread were fairly positive, the votes were fairly mixed, with nearly as many "meh" votes as "yes" votes.
