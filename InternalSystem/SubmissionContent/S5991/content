	"On Level 8, lettered pots must be collected according to the order of the letters of the english word shown in the upper-right corner of the screen. Pots with the same letters can be interchanged, but in the only case on Stage 2 the order to collect the two "R" lettered pots doesn't matter as the frame length will be exactly the same according to my test.

	"The main concern I had over the TAS was the usage of the level select to skip to the final stages. However, given the fact that the game has a clearly defined ending (rescuing the princess at the end of the last stage) and that this can be considered a gameplay feature, it is acceptable. Completing the game from level 1 can be considered a form of full completion.
