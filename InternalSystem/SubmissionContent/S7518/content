	"This submission is a 11 frame improvement over the previous publication, due to optimizing the 9th and 10th barn hits ending input sooner by removing some unnecessary down inputs while finishing in the same IGT of 15.22s. I am submitting this on behalf of MrWint whom I also added as co-author.

	"For my part, I found that you don't have to hit the top of the barn to get the knockback effect while also scoring the point. On the 9th point you can go even lower and hit the very bottom of the barn roof which leaves you in a lower position to get in place faster for the final scoring point.

	"I was unable to find a hit/angle for the 9th point to skip the final 4 down inputs entirely so I'm not sure if that's even possible to do. You CAN end input 2 frames sooner at the expense of 0.02s IGT which would make the run technically slower and is why I canceled the submission initially.
