]p
[p 
	"In an attempt to make aiming feel more precise, the game decelerates your aiming speed as you approach the accurate angle, allowing you to adjust for precision before firing.  While this is a good mechanic and subtle assistance for casual play, it's not so helpful when trying to go fast.  The solution is to deliberately aim wide for either two or four frames, depending on which angle you're turning from, and then "snap" back to the angle you'd normally be aiming at in the first place.  For example, if you were trying to aim at 255,166 (which is between right and down-right on the analog stick) you would first aim down for two frames to get Snake to snap back to that position faster.

However, if you unequip and then re-equip the weapon Snake is holding on the exact frame the HUD appears while also moving in the direction Snake was facing, Snake starts moving at max speed right away.  This saves two frames (or one in-game tick).

The previous submission originally planned to the same with using a save anchored movie file to skip the practice levels, but the emulator at the time (PSXjin) was not capable of playing back the movie file correctly. I'll use this opportunity to mention that the practice levels are not timed in game, and are not tracked in the individual level leaderboards for this game. Since this submission is aiming for in game time instead of real time, as well as cutting out a dead weight in entertainment while aiming for Moons, I feel that this is an acceptable use of a save anchored movie file.

Yes, it uses SRAM, but it does so only to skip the levels the community doesn't compete for, and those levels are mostly identical to the actual levels too, and very boring. So blank branch lets us avoid calling "Time Attack/Score Attack" out, since one can go for one or another for the entire run and still be comparable to this TAS.
