	"Jungle Hunt is a home console port of the classic Taito arcade game. Released in 1983 for the Atari 2600, it was a rather faithful port of the original arcade game, with almost all of the elements carying over to the system. With the games simplicity came much difficulty, jumping from rope to rope, killing alligators (looks a lot more like punching), avoiding boulders, and jumping over cannibals isn't easy. Jungle Hunt was generally well-received and is arguably one of the best games on the Atari 2600.

	"This run was a lot harder than my previous work. For one thing, the RNG was really hard to get around, especially during the fourth phase of the game. The way the RNG worked was based on how early I transitioned from the first to second phase of the game. The levels were simple, yet time consuming. I never remember spending so long trying to figure out the third and fourth phases of the game. It was worth it in the end, though.

	"Reptile River was quite straightforward. Avoid and kill the alligators... also get air so you don't drown. The entertainment also started in this stage, but it ain't that noticeable unless you look at the input log. There wasn't really any way to control how fast this level went, in other words, it was an autoscroller. You know what they say: EVERYBODY LOVES AUTOSCROLLERS!!

	"This was the hardest segment to work with. The RNG was a lot less forgiving than last time. The larger boulders were an greater numbers this time and they were a pain to deal with. I also try to make the entertainment more noticeable. I kinda succeed, but you don't move fast enough to make epic wiggles. There's also a couple frames were I duck on accident so That slowed the run down by a couple frames. All is not lost though.

	"Yeah, this was the segment that made me think: "My brain should be rotting by now". The RNG for the first happy go-lucky cannibal was okay and he was rather easy to get over with. But the second cannibal was a lot hungrier than the first. In other words, his RNG sucked. I ended up having to slow down to get him to hop in the right position so I could do the newly found "two jump" method (credit to Spikestuff) correctly and save more time.
