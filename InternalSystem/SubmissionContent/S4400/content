	"Oddworld Adventures II was a lot more easier to TAS than Abe's Oddysee as the control layout for the GBC was much simpler than the PSX. Dooty has improved much of my work all thanks to using frame advance and some other tricks which I didn't know about.

	"Samlaptop and his passion for the Odworld universe never stop to amaze me. His real time speed runs are just great. And since he is areal time speed runner, I asked if he would want me to optimize his new run, which was done mostly with slow downs. So, that was my contribution to this run; I advanced it frame by frame. Now, almost all Oddworld games have their TASes on the site. Just Munch's Oddysee for the Game Boy Advance is missing, but not for too long.

	" Suggested Description
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Oddworld Adventures II is a Gameboy Color port of Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus. The aim of making this game was to create a portabale version of the PC/PS1 game and to include as many stages from the original game as possible. The game is also an improved version of the original game (Oddworld Adventures) with Mudokons to rescue and GameSpeak was also improved. Watch your favorite Mudokon Abe as he beats the game as fast as possible without rescuing the Mudokons.

	": Looking at how the black-and-white sister of this game had obvious majority of Yes votes and posts, it then got awful rating, proving it was a Vault content, I'm accepting this one to Vault right away, though the feedback here was very scanty and ambiguous. Processing...
