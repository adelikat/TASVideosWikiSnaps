[p 
	"- Some actions or movements may seem unoptimized, due to having to handle luck for spaws, drops and enemies' behavior.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- Every object taken, either life, magic or horn, is necessarily useful and optimized for entertainment, I don't take more than I need, neither use more than allowed.
	$LF
	"There's only one passage in this TAS where I allow myself to have 2 horns too much in my possession (at the end of dungeon 7), because dying doesn't allow to reach the desire number (see below "death and loss of money") and killing 2 enemies to obtain their drops would have been longer.

[p 
	"- When triking during the fights, it is possible to shoot, push, raise or lower an enemy from a square, and then a better optimization of them.
	$LF
	"Note: The fact of shooting an enemy towards you, necessarily causes damage to the player.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- The fact of opening a chest or collect one of the crystals, will automatically mark a downtime of 4 frames, once the text box has passed. However, it is possible to counter this by hitting while entering an input in the opposite direction, just before the opening of the chest link to pick up.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- It is possible to collect any object by hitting with our weapon.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- It is faster to go out then re-enter in a room, once the boss defeated, because his death animation is longer.
	$LF
	"Note: It is not valid for the second dungeon's boss due to the configuration of the room.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- To leave a dungeon, commit suicide is generally faster than walk all the way back.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- Some enemies have the ability to disappear (eyes, mages), while others have the ability to freeze themselves to become invicible (false block red and blue) and for an undefined time in both cases, so it's faster to freeze them and slain them.
	$LF
	"Note: once the long sword obtain, it is no longer necessary to procced like that on the blue mages because they can be killed before they disappear.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- The blue and gold shells are only percussible from the front, it means that the player must be in front of them to hit them. Furhtermore, they are very robust, often in excess and dealing very consequent damages. The most complex solution is to take damages while manipulating their behavior. If the player's life is too low, the faster would be to freeze them.

[p 
	"- Enemies can overlap one another that same time during fights.

]p
[p 
	"- In the dungeons, there are slabs on the ground, the pattern of them is a cross chekerboard. Some of them do not have this motif and are actually triggers triggering traps, such as spears which spring from the walls or ghosts that spawns at random positions.

	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"This one plays as much on the drops as on the appearance of the enemies on the screen.
	$LF
	"I have not found any series of inputs or other, allowing to obtain a specific drop or placement of extraordinary enemy recurring ... So everything passes from the placement of the player arriving in a room, the menu break , Going through blows in the wind, stops, the number of hearts and magic ... Everything is good to cause changes!
	$LF
	"The goal is to gather a group of enemies in the same place, to kill them as quickly as possible, obtaining the desired drops if necessary, while manipulating the behavior of the enemies so that they do not move away.
	$LF
	"All the fighting were done frame by frame, to have total control over the situation!
	$LF
	"I used this manipulation to save time, but also to create unlikely situations, danger, or even prevent enemies from appearing on several screens in a row, for the sole purpose of avoiding a monotony related to the Back tracking.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- It's open (glitch):
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Basically, It is impossible to drop keys to any enemy of the game, because it is based on the principle of exploring dungeons to land in rooms, which once empty of enemies, will reveal a key as a fixed drop, allowing to be able to continue its way.
	$LF
	"After long searches based on drops, I came across this key drop, which surprised me a lot, because I know it is not normal (I play this game since I have 8 or 9 years old!), But it also made me smile, indeed, in my route planning, at the base I had to buy 12 keys to the merchant (480 horns) passing by a mini-game of chance 2 times One can only possess 255 horns at a time!
	$LF
	"So I pushed my research to understand how to get these keys, here are the conditions:
	[br 
	]br
	" 
	$LF
	"Do not get fixed drop in the current dungeon, have at least 1 key on yourself and manipulate luck by eliminating an enemy that has only to drop magic pots (refer to the "drops enemies" section). Indeed there are no other types of enemies that can favor this drop.
