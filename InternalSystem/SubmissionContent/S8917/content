	$LF
]h3
[div class=p 
	"This is an improvement of 24,429 frames (8:07.80) over the previous TAS. This improvement was made possible thanks to a new discovery where pressing enter without typing a command gets rid of the picture. This does make loading between typing non-directional commands a bit longer, because the game's keeping track of everything you see and own with text, but it doesn't have to load the pictures, saving up to 10 seconds or more per directional command. We press enter just before typing our first directional command (N/E/S/W/U/D/GO/CLIMB), which happens to be the 1st command in this game. Input ends on frame 18300 when we input the command "SHOO ZERD" (SHOOT ZERDON).
