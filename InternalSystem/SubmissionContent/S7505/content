	": This is a pretty short game, so there's not much to optimize and this beats the RTA world record. I'll note that the mouse only moving to its positions when necessary and immediately going back to 0,0 kind of make it hard to follow what's happening, but that's not really a big deal in my opinion. Accepting to Standard.
