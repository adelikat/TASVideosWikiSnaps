	"It's been a while guys! Completing this task was rather interesting, hard and easy on some parts depending about the situation you were in. I would have finished this run a bit earlier but I've had rather hard time for a few past months, that's why I was a bit outside from Rockman 2. Because I wasn't able to put much effor on Rockman 2 I decided to make more interesting run for this one. I have always wanted to beat this game but I haven't had time and courage to do so but now I was able to do ten times more than that! Playing this game through was really serious attempt from me even it was a bit reckless thing to do. Be sure to use Rockman (J) rom because this won't sync with Mega Man (U) at all, your movie stops when DelayWaterCurrent should occur, there's a really minimal difference in NEXT value. I bet different intro screen is causing it not to work. No need to be afraid about bots because refill manipulations are optimized and played by a hand and for a good reason too, only ones with bots are DelayStageClear glitches which are impossible to perform without them. Yes, DelayWaterCurrent is possible without any botting, you'll just need to get NMI's NEXT value to "1" which was somewhat easy in Iceman stage because conditions there was more better than we expected. We tried to keep eye on rerecord count because a few people requested to keep bot recordings safe too. Since I had to go out from school apartment because of autumn break, I forgot to save my record log for W1's DelayStageClear and I only remember my first botting took something like 50 000-56 000 rerecords and second attempt took more then 100 000 rerecords so I didn't include them in the run. Own personal playing and optimization took around 60 000~70 000 rerecords. I gladly introduce you to this ride of speed and entertainmnet.

	"There's a ridiculous answer for that a long time ago FinalFighter contacted me and said that he could use Deign's gameplay and put own new ideas and tricks together. FinalFighter saw through Deign's subpixel optimizations and he sometimes mentioned how well it was done. I opposed him and said there might be something I can test and find or even improve something, FinalFighter said it's fine for him to wait for my return. After struggling in the world of subpixels I found several ways to turn a few manipulations upside down and gain some frames and subpixels. Time by time and from technique to another I began to understand how this game somewhat works, I usually got some ideas straight from RM2 experience like positioning yourself in to the right position while crabbing ladders so you appear from the left position at the top of the ladders, for some odd reason Deign forgot to optimize some of these parts. That gave me even more inspiration and motivation to go further on.

	"The most important things are to keep really sharp eye and look for subpixels because they matters a lot and chooses your final result, this was heavily seen in Deign's run. They becomes easier to follow when you're forced to check them out all the time, so actually you grow, no you will grow up with them. Second is to check magnet beam lenghts because you must determite how long they are because you can't just spam them around, there's a rule how many of them can be in the screen at the same time before you can use another one and we all know it's 5. Sometimes it's possible to avoid this kind of situations so you could use different lengths as you please and find more interesting ideas later on, but be sure to know what you are playing around for. Pretty simple and powerful way to advance with this run was to combine ideas all around with different states of mind together. I hope there's not going to be much arguing about this run because this skips 2 and half stages and DelayStageClear makes next stages to look a bit glitched, especially when you go to next screen. These tricks put us in a whirl of pressure where we felt miserable but we found the way out, so we wish to have a little respect instead of hearing arguments all night long.

	"This is where everything started. In the most Rockman series you don't see this kind of stages because this stage is full of climbing. I had to level up myself with this stage because I wasn't so ready for some hardcore subpixel positionings. After struggling in the world of subpixels I understood the trick and continued forward from my private exercises. Firstly I understood sometimes you'll have to sacrifice subpixels in order to save them! Imagine a situation you have maximal subpixel value as possible and you must jump over a ravine, when you are on the very last X position and you'll have to jump -> you drop instead because subpixel position rolls over too much. Time by time after following subpixels I found a way to jump one frame faster in the first identical block room, the frame comes off from the very last block of the room when I'm attempting to jump. Two screens after I had a huge couldron of lag in my hands and I had to find a way to without losing my one and precious frame, so I begin to make random movements to see if lag calms itself. By doing this I found extra fast route out from this maze and I was more than satisfied with my results. In the next screens I found out that current run didn't face left in most of the cases when you were on the top of ladders. When you are on the top of the ladders and face left while performing your zip, it's 1 frame faster to do so. I fixed those and continued forward on. In the end I saved 9 frames off from this stage.

	"Before entering to this stage FinalFighter told me about a new trick which has the same speed up effect like in Dr. Wily 3 stage's water area, it's known as DelayWaterCurrent. It works when certain conditions are met with the enemies etc. and your NEXT valúe reaches number 1. FinalFighter made his first attempt with this room but I improved it by over 70-90 frames by investigating it for about two weeks. Of course I tried to combine magnet beam values in order not to lose so much time the beginning of room #3, because first room went so fast there were no possibility for magnet beams to keep up, that's why I can't shoot it so fast like it was in Deign's run. In the gate room I found a trick neat trick to save time which is straight from Rockman 2, when you hit the ceiling you drop down faster, right? So you can find better place for 40 and 41 magnet beam length values and speed up your progress. There's nothing new with the boss fight, just the same usual fight.

I restarted and played from the beginning again and compared things and I realized I had very strange behaviour with lag, in a word I had lag in unusual places. Like game tried to limit my playing somehow. No matter how I played the stage from the beginning.. end result was always exactly same or even more worse. In the last screen I tried to think where to consumne one extra magnet beam and later on I found a perfect use for it, when I'm performing my last zip before going to the gate room I loaded my gun -> dropped off -> went so right as possible -> turned left not to lose magnet beam -> turned right and shot magnet beam out -> took damage -> and jumped on the magnet beam to zip through the gate. This trick is also used in the end of Elecman stage. A little time saving comes from better boss fight where I moved myself more closer to boss, because I was more closer to him I was able to make things go more smoother without having silly 3 frames of lag.

Even this stage is almost skipped from the beginning it doesn't mean it was anything easy to do. This trick is one of the hardest ones in Rockman history and it made our attempts to look really miserable. First we tried manually to find certain values such as NEXT=0, we succeed in that but we still were far, far away from our goal. This trick needs a bunch of values to be in exact number. Over 3 months passed and FinalFighter contacted me about a new bot which could optimize things upside down. First results were pretty bad (because the success rate is exactly 1:1 327 665 or simply 1:250000), when bot was ran for 14~15 days it found the one and only polished success out from nowhere.

DelayStageClear also has a effect to shave some lag off in certain places, this happens because game doesn't draw everything in the screen (background?) screen. This glitch doesn't affect screen scrolling speed at all. About 9 frames or so comes from the beginning because of the glitch, after progressing and and trying to manipulate big refill to come out I found the most optimal route for it (X position was more than high enough and refill came out in the first shooting frame as possible) and I was more than happy with it. I improved gate room by hitting the ceiling and the boss fight with taking some damage and placing myself better to get some lag off.

In the next screens I found improvements not to make minimal jumps as possible inside a wall while zipping and glitching. In the room with background zipping I found more better way to avoid getting hit by a bullet, I optimized my X position and went to leftmost edge soon as possible -> pressed jump button and select two times in order to stop bullet animation while I went upper and upper, upper, landed and jumped. I also found 2 frames faster manipulation route for getting big and a little refill. Because I did big and minimal refill manipulation backwards I was able to land some pixels sooner to make my glitcing faster. Next screens are also optimized more better without jumping every frame while glitching inside the wall, also in the screen with select pressings was far more less lag and I avoided the final select pressing in order to save some time. I did refill manipulation backwards (Big -> Little), had a better subpixel positioning and I was able to gain a few frames because of them. Gate and boss rooms are improved by hitting the ceiling and placing yourself better to have a bit more lag free playing. Cutman fight is now 3 frames faster by doing so.

I lost 3 frames there on a purpose because magnet beams were conflicting with a correct manipulation. This DelayStageClear requires at least 5 enemies around of you and you'll have to reach about the half of the screen. This also took some time to perform and it wasn't easy task at all even this was far easier when compared to Bombman's one. Even I used some extra magnet beams to climb up faster it doesn't mean I lost more in W4 stage because my magnet beam value was 16 instead of 18.

It's still interesting this is the only stage that uses death as a shortcut and it feels like this game is compatible with Rockman 2. I bet Wily got some serious goose bumps after we harassed and glitched his plans all day long but he got his revenge because we had to sacrifice a big bunch of frames in the boss fight because of those glitched graphics caused by DelayStageClear! In the previous movie hit pattern went nicely 14 frames per. hit almost without any extra lag but because of that corrupted background the shortest time to hit was from between 16 to 14 frames depending about your time x shooting frame. 06C1 is a value to check Boss HPs out and it came really handy and easy to follow during the battle. I placed Rockman a bit more to the left incl. my movements from the first Wily Machine in order to find most optimal route out which was to hit Wily Machine 2 at xxxx5 frame from far away to avoid any extra lag not to mess select pressings up. I also tried different combinations and subpixel positionings but they didn't seem to have effect at all. This battle took exactly 3 days to perform because lag really confused my thoughts and I had to arrange things more radically than before.

In a word combination without reset or glitched level select screen is more than necessary. After that you'll have to call for Object5D which succeeding percent is extremely low.

	"Like I stated before this run started from a bottomless ravine when FinalFighter was going lend/use/copy Deign's work as a base project with new tricks he discovered but I opposed him and wanted to improve things over. It was more than fun to work with this because it was interesting to try different routes and other stuff out and not to have worry about things so much like in Rockman 2. I salute to Deign for using effort to this game which was the main influence and motivation to start this run. It's still interesting I found tricks that could have been found a long time ago like the trick to shave some lag off from boss fights, just to place yourself better. First I was aware I couldn't make any improvements over Deign's run but time by time I overcomed the "fear", accepted things how they really were and then I improved cases more further. In cooperative work with FinalFighter there's no such a thing like as "arguements" between us, we just accecpt things, find the absolute answer and think possibilities over and try to make them even more impressive. This game has a long history and the main player for making a list of previous efforts and many runs was Bisqwit who created this site in the past. The very first run was done by Morimoto itself without abusing game so much, if I recall correctly. I'm making tool-assisted speedruns because I want to surpass different situations with my own hands and even a little bit of effort makes me to smile. There's still much more I want to tell about my progress but sometimes it's hard for me to make up proper words and sentences. Also I want to thank #tasers channel where Japanese players gather to put their ideas together. Without FinalFighter's assistance, motivation and incredible investigation this run wouldn't have been done like this. Thanks for reading and supporting out project.
