	"This game is pretty dull from a gameplay perspective, but pretty interesting from an emulation perspective. It starts an HDMA at the end of mode 3 (end of scanline rendering) and then reads from the HDMA register in a loop to see when it stops. All of this happens in double speed mode. Pretty much everything needs to be perfect emulation wise for this to verify on console. GBHawk isn't there yet so I left this as Gambatte. Hopefully it will get there someday.
