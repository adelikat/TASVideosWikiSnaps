	"Slide Boy in Maze Land is a homebrew Atari 7800 developed by VHZC Games in 2021. It's a kind of simple puzzle game where Slide Boy moves around by sliding in a cardinal direction, stopping only when hitting a wall. While the mechanics are straightforward, this was a good TAS to make for practicing cycles. This is played on Normal mode through all 30 rooms. Survival has a fixed timer that doesn't replenish between stages and I'm not sure if it's beatable in the given time.

	"This level introduces sliding walls. There's a quirk that if Slide Boy gets into where moving walls and platforms would be, he gets pushed out until he's ejected. This ejection also makes player movement impossible until it's over. Generally movement should be done in such a way that Slide Boy can make immediate movement upon contact, saving a bit of time. This stage is one where it doesn't matter due to having to wait on the orbiting saw.
