	"This time around Rockman 2 has been maximized to it's end, so far that only few people can imagine. Making this movie required many years of work and hundreads of different investigations, plannings and trendemous amount of time and copypastings. After doing the previous run I heard news about the other techniques and they were related to screenscrollings and using Heatman's weapon to reduce black screen time after dying in the Crashman and Woodman stages. I began to work on my new run and got stuck in Crashman's screenscrolling I wasn't able to continue matter of what. Because I wasn't able to do anything for it I started my project from the beginning many times for fun and seek for other improvements. About a year after I was able to perform Crashman's scrolling by 3xItem1s and I got excited about it and I contacted Bisqwit after my great success. Not so long after Bisqwit said that he was able to bot it to work with 2xItem1s so I began to continue my progress further and further. Somewhere around the progress I spotted some improvements I wasn't even seen before and I had to many stages behind to the Flashman's stage because I found a possibility to break something that affected to your waiting time after boss was beaten (This was found by playaround when I was bored and used different subpixel positionings). When I reached again the Crashman's downscrolling I didn't ask for help I keep to do it for so long that I'll succeed and I did I even found the key for it, the time when it is possible to do there so I didn't have any problems with that part anymore. After that Japanese player called cstrakm found a technique to Airman's stage to get flying air devils to disappear just by pressing (left and then right) in the first possible frame. This was something special because I haven't ever seen that it works on any enemy. In the long room of Airman I had to abuse mother bird to get airfan enemy to disappear. Once I was done and searched for the most optimized route for the screenscrolling I played through Bubbleman stage and got stuck to that scrolling again. About month or two later in december FinalFighter contacted me if I would agree if he puts my movie in the public in Japan to search for persons that haves much experience with FCEUX and botting. Not for so long after FinalFighter contacted me and said that TaoTao have been trying to solve the mystery and he did. TaoTao was able to make Bubbleman's downscroll to work with 3xItem1s, 2xCrabs and with a huge refill and that version was 12 frames faster. About or over a week later I got a message from FinalFighter that Japanese player pirohiko solved the scrolling with 2xItem1s, 2xCrabs and it was 112 frames faster! and after that with four metal blades! ...and so on my progress continued and continued along with other players and I finished it.

He helped me with the screenscrollings such as Airman and Crashman scrollings also gave tips for different strategies. Bisqwit did a great battle in Dr. Wily 2 stage but this time I didn't copypaste it because I modified, tested and played it on my own in the end but most likely in the same way.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This run is full of the most glitched thing I've ever seen in my whole life! This game needs some caution and time to understand also it is interesting that subpixels doesn't matter so much in this game because of the weird randomness... Also there are much frame rules in the stages sometimes you can gain much time but after beating the boss you'll have to wait a bit longer and you'll lose few or many frames from your hands. This time around different level order is used because Woodman's stage is played as the last possible level. (Flashman - Heatman - Airman - Crashman - Quickman - Metalman - Bubbleman - Woodman) The main reason for playing Woodman as the last stage is that we can start from the roof when the stage starts because there are some glitching and stuff in Bubbleman battle.

	"I the main player of this whole project who started and ended it. I've been working this game for ages and got always stuck with the scrollings and I wasn't able to perform them matter of what even I tried really hard without any help. I played everything from the beginning expect Bubble and Woodman's fourth scrollings but still I felt right that it is OK to have co-authors and also everyone asked about it, wanted it and agreed. Even I did the most or actually almost all of the progress we decided to add more cooperative authors along. I gained trendemous amount of information and experience about this project and gained some vital ones from FinalFighter and TaoTao.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- I'm really amazed and impressed that such kind of help came from the far east, Japan. I thought there were none of possibilities for me to complete this movie on my own or even with co-authors. TaoTao's investigation broke the wall and I actively started to discuss about screenscrollings with FinalFighter and we began to join in the forces. Everyone shared knowledges to each other to understand the mechanism of screenscrollings further. This was somewhat interesting experience and I feel I owe everyone a cookie! This is also a great day in my whole time!

	"- I Began to investigate Tool-assisted movies after I saw morimoto & finalfighter's legendary Rockman 2 movie around the spring of 2005. I found TASvideos (formerly NESvideos) mark from the movie file and I went straight way to check the site out but I didn't register myself there for a long time because I want to knew more about community before asking anything harmful. When first time I got recordable emulator I had no idea how to use it or anything. First I though people are playing in real time but when I found save states and other features out I understood what Tool-assistance really is. I was so impressed and amazed and had a clear vision that I wanted to aim for more better results than what morimoto & finalfighter did. Shortly after I began to make my own movies about Rockman 2 and tried to understand game mechanisms a bit time by time. In the end my journey was really interesting because I had much willpower to know and train glitches and techniques so I decided to play Rockman 2 so much as I can, there was almost sleepless nights and days and I even played it over 12 hours in straigh because I really enjoyed my work (My friends though that I was turned to crazy when they saw/knew what I was going to do) I contacted TASvideos' adminstrator Bisqwit through email when I wanted to know more about glithes and tricks, I did that many times when I was curious about something. Close to next summer I joined to site and NESvideos channel to discuss with people. I found funny that Bisqwit didn't knew who I was for a long time but after discussing much about Rockman 2 in the channel he pointed me out.

Mr. gocha make Rockman 2 TAS Help site to gather skillful players around the Japan. Also FinalFighter contacted me all the time if he found something new, better strategies and tips for Rockman games. As a Gift in return I gave some of my discoveries and projects to him. In the end FinalFighter's interest towards scrollings came from TaoTao's investigation.

	"FinalFighter contacted me that mysterious Mr. pirohiko was able to perform Bubbleman scrolling and there was few different tests and we ended up using 4xMetal blades & 2xCrabs. Mr. pirohiko succeed with the first test on Woodman's scrolling once I was done with the Bubbleman stage. I didn't knew someone even could to perform that so fast... I was really amused. After that I saw few other versions that were a bit faster and one of them showed how to perform Delay+Death. FinalFighter and pirohiko gained more frames in the end. FinalFighter and pirohiko are the players who build, architected and think over the Bubbleman's & Woodman's scrollings.

[p 
	"These glitches are most known in Rockman 2. You can enter inside a wall by any of these items to start beging to zip throught walls. In my run first zipping happens in the Heatman's longest room, when I drop and place Item3 to left side of the wall and place Mega Man well before zipping. Rockman 2's engine thinks that you aren't supposed be in the wall and pulls you out, there exists few possibilities that may happen if you don't do they correctly like, you'll zip out of the wall because of the bad positioning, you got stuck in the offscreen because you didn't jump and press left in a correct time.

[p 
	"Using Item1s for zippings are classic and they appears almost everywhere in my run. It is good to use 3xItem1 before zipping placing highest Item1 to a bit upper because you can jump on it to gain some time, optimized performation should save arond ~ 20 frames.  
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Also it is possible to zip with Item2s and this only occurs in Bubbleman's stage last rooms when you've taken some damage and placed Item2 in a good position below the spikes and turn left when you are on Item2, it is good to find a good spot if you want to get your zipping longer with this technique. In the next room from the first Item2 zipping there is a corner and it means that if you place your Item2 up there you can zip throught the entire ceiling. Example:
