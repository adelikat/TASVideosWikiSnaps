	" (aka DMTM), that let you enter an upside-down pipe as if it is a normal penetrable pipe. So before the vine at 5-2, I did this and it saves 8,45 seconds.

	"The other remaining frames gained are at 8-4. Also, at 8-4, I was forced to make Mario to slowdown due to bad randomness that costs 8 frames. I could have done it to look more aesthetic. Anyway, maybe if I have free time to lose, I will redo the last part and replace this movie.
