[p 
	"This stage was the first one to be done for two reasons; it's a really small stage and the boss don't need to be killed, just half of his life bar must be drained away to receive my first gem.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Boss: Dr. Doom
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The strategy to beat Dr. Doom is pretty simple; never let him do his flying attacks and only knock him down when his green life bar is gone.

	" Time Gem
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This gem is supposed to make the hero move twice as quick, but it's not true; Wolverine normal walking speed is 144, using the Time Gem it goes to 208.

	"This stage is one of the easier stages for Wolverine or Spider-Man thanks to their natural abilities, but Wolverine was chosen due to his slightly faster walking speed, increased using the Time Gem.

	" Boss: Evil Sasquatch
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"To keep his combo, Wolverine must hit the boss twice then turn around and waste one hit, but if he is falling off of a ledge, turning around makes him land again on that ledge so he can start his two hit combo again.

	" Reality Gem

[p 
	"A rather useless gem to use on a TAS, it allows the hero to see invisible items.

]h3
[p 
	"Here in this stage you will need a character that can perform air combos, Iron Man and Captain America are the only ones that can do so. The faster character was chosen; Iron Man. The Time Gem doesn't increase the speed of special moves like the Iron Rocket Torpedo, but since there's some cut scenes where the hero walks atomatically, it was used again to save some time.
	$LF

[h4 
	" Boss: Evil Irom Man (x2)
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"At first glance it may seem unfair to fight two bosses at the same time, but it soon proves to be one of the easier boss fights of the game. Since they share the same energy bar, it's not beneficial to hit them at the same time as it will draw the same amount of energy regardless.

[p 
	"This stage is pretty straight forward, beat your way through until you reach the alarm that sets off the evil Pucks. The recommendable character to use in this stage is Spider Man, but he is one of the slowest heroes of the game, so it's up to Iron Man again.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Boss: Evil Wolverine
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The strategy to defeat Evil Wolverine is a mix between Dr. Doom and Evil Sasquatch's boss fights, abuse the fall off of a ledge trick and only knock him down when his life bar is gone.

[p 
	"There's a really stupid bug if you drop through the hatch too fast; you'll trigger the opening of the hatch, but you'll also land on the right ledge while the hatch closes, then you're stuck. 
	$LF

[h4 
	" Boss: Magus
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This boss fight may be the most boring fight of the run, but there's a reason for the strategy used; Magus will teleport just like Akuma from time to time, even worse is that he is totally invincible when doing so.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Power Gem
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The most useful gem of the game, the gem bestows Hulk's attack power to all the other characters. Obviously, Hulk will not benefit from it.

	"This stage is very tough, but equipped with the Power Gem Iron Man will have the perfect balance between power and speed to beat this stage.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Boss: Evil Daredevil
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The strategy here is pretty much the same used against Magus, but the Power Gem makes it a lot less repetitive.

	"I have to fight up against two bosses in this stage, but one at a time. First is a rematch with Dr. Doom, and then it's time to face Black Heart.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Boss: Dr. Doom
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Same as the first encounter with him, but now I'll have to defeat him instead of just losing half of his life. Too bad there's no ledges here to avoid some wasted punches.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Boss: Black Heart
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This fight can be pretty tough in real time, but with a few tricks even this battle look easy. Nice to have so many ledges here.

[p 
	"The hero jumps twice as high, too bad the heroes can use only one gem at a time, this one seems pretty useful in some places.

	"Near the beginning of the stage Iron Man will ride on a platform that is provided by Dr.Strange. All he have to do here is knock off evil Silver Surfer.
	$LF

[h4 
	" Boss: Evil Thing
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This boss fight is fairly easy even in real time, but it does require some manipulation if you want to make it as fast as possible, and of course; ledges!
	$LF

[h4 
	" Soul Gem
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Well, another useless gem. Who needs a gem that gives you more energy on a no damage taken run?

[p 
	"This stage is pretty straight forward, make your way through the desert, break the neck of a giant sphinx and then you should reach evil Hulk.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Boss: Evil Hulk
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Time to give Hulk a taste of his own poison. Okay, I will not complain about the lack of ledges here, but they would make this fight a lot faster...
	$LF

[h3 
	" Fortress of Thanos
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Another stage with two boss fights, first Nebula and then Thanos. Since the Power Gem will make any character as strong as Hulk, Spider Man is the character of choice for these two fights as his combos are bigger than the other heroes.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Boss: Nebula
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This boss fight is pretty straight forward, one big combo and Nebula's gonna cry like a baby.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Boss: Thanos
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The most difficult boss fight of the game, mainly because he is the only character in the game that can block. If you keep comboing him he will block and if you don't knock him down he will also block, in short any strategy that you shouldn't use against other bosses you must use against him.

[p 
	"The hero can attack from a distance without even touching the enemy. Of course you cannot use it otherwise there would be no plot.

[p 
	"Entertainment wise, the use of a different hero for each stage may be a good idea, but it will be alot slower.
