	"programming errors: some glitches on doors, hit placement on the character for smaller enemies, jumping and falling through some floors, on one boss who has a damage system similar to Dracula from Simon's Quest (tall freaky dude in the "Yellow Level with elevators")

	"Um, so this time a bunch of alien stuff is taking over the world and the X-men's foes. your job is to kill the naughty alien stuff, which can replicate matter (and yes, you. hence CLONE WARS... its not just some cheesy Star Wars knock off...maybe...)

	"Making Movie:

	"ahem...DESYNCING SUCKS! so when you play this movie back, have SOUND ENABLED and make sure the rate 44100. should it Desync, it will most likely happen inside the Pyramid with moving spikes. Wolvie will be hit by a spike and it goes to hell from there.

	"It was only difficult because of Desyncing. oh, and it randomly froze at points, so i need to download the newest version. i played mainly on 16-25% slowdown.

	"Personally, i dont know if this is an entertaining movie. there are still some errors (i admit them up front even though i know ill get them pointed out), but its mostly because all i do is walk back and forth or fall or fight monsters for an extended period. looking beyond that, i THINK its ok.

	"i use Wolverine because he is Strong and Fast. Nightcrawler is almost as agile and can teleport, but his strength isnt the same... i think. besides that, Wolverine has no Mutant Power Charge Up Bar, but can heal himself above BLINKING.
