	"This run aims for the fastest time. Using an instant kill move that has a chance with luck manipulation not to miss. It doesn't seem to work well with certain characters, so these fights had to be done normally. Ky Kiske was picked because he had the fastest overall instant kill animation along with some acceptable damage combos and resets.

	"This guy couldn't be luck manipulated for whatever reason to land the move on him, so this is the first one we had to take on normally. I did a jump in on round 2 because he was going to do a different move that i couldn't interrupt.

	"Again these 3 (Sol, Testament,Justice) couldn't be luck manipulated whatesoever to land the move on. We've spent days trying to crack all and Chipp too.
