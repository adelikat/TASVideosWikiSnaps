	(__wikiLink|href=/5956M|implicitdisplaytext=5956M)
	". Instead of using nihon shobu kumite, you have a much longer effort to take down your opponent.  I can only imagine how hard you put those 128 cores to work! After checking out the different responses, it does seem very sensitive to get those inputs at the right frame.
