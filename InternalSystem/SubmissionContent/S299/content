	"Ninja time again. It´s improved pretty much.

[p 
	"Truncated pointed out some mistakes I did and I wasn´t 
	$LF
	"happy about those. Even though the game looks pretty simple, 
	$LF
	"and it is really, it´s hard to make things good and fast. 
	$LF
	"Mostly because the controls. They are a bit clumsy and you 
	$LF
	"have to judge when you can use the shadow magic for best 
	$LF
	"result. 
	$LF

[p 
	"Anyways, in my previous version I didn´t take damage 
	$LF
	"because I thought it was useless in a game like this. Well, 
	$LF
	"screw energy. Most of the time improvement comes from the 
	$LF
	"bosses. I think I killed almost every boss a bit faster and 
	$LF
	"also I takes damage at boss 1 and 3 to be able to kill them 
	$LF
	"faster. I also fixed some minor stuffs, mostly jumps that 
	$LF
	"could have been done better, and now they are.

	"About the story again ;) You are a pretty cool ninja that 
	$LF
	"decides to clean up in the drug world. And some bad guy has 
	$LF
	"kidnapped a few kids, which I don´t have time to save =) 
	$LF
	"Poor bastards.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Hmm, stuffs happens for a reason. For example: I don´t 
	$LF
	"stand as close as possible to the robots (forth boss) 
	$LF
	"because then I would knifed them and they would not have 
	$LF
	"been hurt. I don´t knife the ninjas (second boss) more then 
	$LF
	"needed because 1. It takes some time to knife em. 2. I 
	$LF
	"couldn´t knife em because I was not in the right distance, 
	$LF
	"and sometimes the ninja refuses to knife. Anyways, it´s a 
	$LF
	"lot faster.
