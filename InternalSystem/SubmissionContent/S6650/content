For the majority of the game I try to make the player in front do bunny hopping as much as possible.

	"for the boss, his drone that he sends out is the only thing that can damage him, and it will only damage him if you shoot it.  however wether or not the drone goes near the boss is completely rng, the path was manipulated to be as close to him as possible, and this resulted in a death of player 1 to get a good rng pattern.  I am sure this can be done faster but honestly it was hard enough as it was to get this pattern.

	"the first area has wind that can push you up or to the side, this is useful to get to areas faster or unable to reach.  This is also a stage that is really frustrating with RNG due to areas with falling objects.  I had to really focus on getting a good pattern in order to jump though them without getting hit.  we grab a weapon powerup for player 1 that will be used for the boss and the next area.  There was also a glitch I found that allowed me to avoid grabbing a ledge near the end, if you get the player on the top of the screen, and use the other player to move the screen upward, you can skip the ledge grab all together, this saved 2 seconds.

	"the 2nd area has a few things you need to shoot to continue, a switch that is located in one of the wind turbines lets player one go through doors.  we also make the 2nd player grab a weapon power up for the boss.  There is a ball like thing that needs to be destroyed in order to finish the level.
