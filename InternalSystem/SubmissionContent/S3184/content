	"MediEvil tells the tale of one very deceased knight's quest to rid the land of undead legions and the wicked magician that created them. The gameplay is very reminiscent of the action-platformers of old, consisting largely of running around each stage whilst hacking up baddies. But there is also a good share of puzzles to be solved. The tale, speaking of, is of Sir Daniel Fortesque (the knight) and his battle against evil forces, and the magician who started it all, Zarok.

	"In the beginning I had first thought that MediEvil had no means to skip levels, it really didn't seem like it did, until a user at TASVideos (SkyChase) informed me otherwise. At first it began with the Lake, then the Enchanted Earth, and then many levels more with the discovery of the level looping glitch and the inventory glitch in conjunction with each other. Many thanks to Groobo as well, he helped discover many uses of many things, including nearly all skips, tricks, glitches, and what not that you will see in this movie. Perhaps the real difficulty in this run is the level looping glitch, you must maneuver Dan in pitch blackness, and basically guess where you are in the level, of course, with TASing tools it does make it easier, but it is still not an easy glitch to use, TAS or Non-TAS. Aside from that, I guess laziness, and lack of time played an effort in the making of this run. Not only did I have difficulty in doing the run, but making sure it was entertaining, was definitely difficulty... As MediEvil is the standard hack and slash game (well in this case you could consider him a caveman as I use the club in the majority of this). The real problem with this game, is that the camera follows Dan from behind, however, the camera can be moved by the player, which means moving the camera even a tiny bit could save, or gain more frames. Normally this is an ideal game, but when knowing that barely moving the camera can result in frame gain/save, it makes this game quite difficult to TAS. Also, MediEvil is one of those games where the first possible input isn't always the best, though this is mostly with manipulation. Due to this, I had to test things both in frame advance, real time speed, and reduced speed to figure out what was the best bet. Obviously this run will not be the best run of MediEvil on the planet, and I myself don't think it's the golden TAS of 2011. But with the effort and difficulty of this 3D game, I think I'll need a 2D game to work on haha.

		" If Dan falls below the levels original surface, he will eventually fall so far below the level that he loops from the top, eventually allowing him to fall anywhere on the level, as long as you have enough time to fall. If Dan falls past the level's normal kill triggers he will start to do this glitch, and if your currently doing it, and fall in a area out of bounds that is not a kill trigger, you will re-loop the level, until you fall back in the level, die, or hit a kill trigger. Whilst looping, Dan's speed must not be 0, or he will die. Once you have found the area you want to fall at (usually the exit trigger), move the controller directional keys/stick around in circles until Dan re-enters the level. However, due to the majority of kill triggers in this game, the glitch is almost entirely impossible to be effective, unless used in conjunction with the Inventory Glitch.

		" Select is used to open the inventory, just like in most games. However, in MediEvil, if the inventory screen is brought up, and the player uses select 2 times simultaneously, it will close and reopen.. During this small time between the closing and opening, Dan can move, and jump, attack, etc. Though it is barely a second, Dan has enough time to jump out of the level, which usually would result in a death. When the inventory screen is open, all enemies, objects, and most triggers are frozen. Luckily, that means kill triggers too, and this is how this glitch is so useful, it allows us to loop levels without the limits of death.

		" The Asylum Grounds - Unfortunately this level can not at this time be skipped, so I must do Jack's puzzles. Due to not killing any enemies, more are created when I get the mouse following me, as such it is nearly impossible to avoid getting hit while being optimal, so I tried to settle for what I got. I used luck manipulation to move the cats around so the mouse could follow me as fast as it could. Eventually I scare it at the earliest point so it runs like a cheetah straight for the elephant, which ultimately scares it, completing the puzzle. Note: If the mouse is scared too early, you have to repeat the puzzle, this is why I do what I do. The chess puzzle is done quite nicely. For those who are curious, if not hit within a certain period, the chess pieces move, so what I did was necessary.

		" The Asylum - I don't think this level can ever be skipped (unless we can skip the Gallows Gauntlet without the dragon armor). So you must go through destroying everything in your path in the house of the mad. Sometimes you'll notice that I swing my weapon, and I hit nothing. This is intentional as it allows for manipulation. I heavily take damage in this level to save time. In the 5th room of The Asylum, I push the enemies towards the lava in the center to be able to hit the majority of them at once. The only sad part is they can't be pushed into the lava from this. When the chest drops, I hit it at the earliest frame where it will kill all but 1 enemy, however, I maneuver Dan in a laggy sorta movement to where the energy bomb kills them all. I myself am not entirely sure why this works, but it does. I also save 1% of the club so that I can use a glitch on it in a later level. I could still have the club at 0%, however, the whole point of changing to the sword is to save time after I kill the last straight jacketed lunatic (I really don't know what they're called, but this sounds like a nice name for them haha).

This is why the dragon armor is needed.
