	"Dr. Robotnik's Plan B is a ROM hack of Sonic the Hedgehog for the Sega Genesis, and was submitted to the Sonic Hacking Contest in 2016. This hack is known as a boss rush, which is where you go through various rooms fighting various bosses with different mechanics. All the bosses have been changed, having none of their original patterns and instead having brand new and very diverse mechanics.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"This hack includes 7 new bosses, one for each of the original Sonic 1 zones. Some bosses have a "rush mode," which is reminiscent of Sonic Advance 2, where when the boss gets hit enough times, it changes its attack pattern (and sometimes mechanics) and it becomes more difficult to fight.

	"Green Hill's boss is the good ol' wrecking ball boss, however instead of jumping on platforms to fight the boss, he instead opts to fly along the ground swinging his wrecking ball over himself back and forth. After taking 6 hits, the boss will fly in the air, making the wrecking ball swing around him instead of just above him. Even with these changes, the boss is easily dealt with.
	$LF
	"For the first part of the fight, I opt to roll on the ground to get as many hits in as I can. I get 5 hits in when he first comes onscreen, and then get 5 more in when he comes in from the left side. I did NOT get 6 hits in on the first time through, even though I had plenty of time to do so, since that would put him into rush mode, and in rush mode he's offscreen for much longer at that point, costing a bunch of time waiting for him. After i get the 10 hits in, I jump twice more to get the final two hits in and finish the fight.

	"Marble's boss features fire! You are intended to wait for the boss to be vulnerable to be able to hit him, but because I have rings, I can damage boost to hit him without having to wait for him to get rid of the fireballs around him. After 4 hits, the boss will go offscreen, come back onscreen and come closer to the ground, and do another fire shield move. This time he will hurl the fireballs at wherever Sonic is standing, but with a clever damage boost and good positioning, it's possible to damage the boss and not have to worry about the fireballs. My invulnerability timer runs about the same time the boss is killed, which requires me to do some precise dodging in order to avoid dying to the fire. Once I escape the fire, the boss is done!

	"Spring Yard's boss begins by the boss flying over your head and dropping spikes on the ground. After dropping 3 spikes, the boss will form another shield around him, this time made out of bumpers and spike balls. Your goal is to hit the boss by using the bumpers to get up to where he is without hitting the spiky balls.
	$LF
	"We can do this fight in two cycles by hitting the bumpers in specific ways in order to get three hits in every cycle. For the first cycle I use the left screen boundary in order to hit one of the higher bumpers in a way that allows me to bounce on the boss three times. For the second cycles, I showcase a slower way of getting three hits in by bouncing up and right on the second bumper. The danger with this method is that you have a better chance of getting hit by the spiky ball and missing your chance. After getting all 6 hits in, the boss is complete! This boss does not have a rush mode.

	"This boss hurls bombs and missiles at you in order to try to damage you. These projectiles release bubbles when they explode, allowing you to stay alive underwater. I get the first four hits in when the boss comes up from the floor, and then actually delay hitting the boss when he comes down from the upper left. Delaying my hit in this way allows me to hit the boss 4 times, saving THREE SECONDS over having to wait for him to come back down a third time to get the last hit in. This boss also does not have a rush mode.

	"Star Light's boss is another boss that attempts to drop stuff onto your head. Instead of spikes this time, it's bombs! After dodging various bombs, you'll have to bounce 3 bombs back into the boss to damage him, since he is too high to hit from the ground, even with a roll jump. After the second cycle of bombs, he goes into rush mode, where his bombs are upgraded to eject more projectiles when they explode that can also damage you, and the bombs are also not dropped straight down, but instead have momentum left and right. After dodging 5 more bombs, we can get the last two hits in and finish the boss! The boss hits are NOT done on the first possible frame, as it's actually faster to wait a couple frames as it hits the boss sooner than if you hit the bomb on the first frame possible.

	"Scrap Brain's boss feature the lovable treadmill, which you must run on in order to avoid the spikes that are right behind you. Not only that, but you also have to avoid the bombs that Robotnik drops onto the treadmill, which explode and launch projectiles. After dropped 3 bombs, Robotnik will come down and launch a spike towards you. Then he will go back up in the air and repeat. I abuse the fact that treadmills don't affect you while you're in the air to avoid being sent back left, and I can get 4 hits in on the boss in one cycle. Jumping while under the spike allows me to avoid taking damage and getting crushed. After 4 hits, the boss will break the wall and go into rush mode, where he will hover in the air and spawn electric balls that will attempt to home in on you. Once the balls are offscreen, he will come down and charge you with another spike. We can abuse this charge to get 4 hits on the boss in one cycle. One more cycle and two more hits, and the boss is defeated!

After the boss is defeated, you chase him down a slope and watch him attempt to make his escape. Aaaaaaand this escape fails because Sonic hits him for the final time, and the game is finished!
