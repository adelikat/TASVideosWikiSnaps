	"Barbie Super Model is a simple game released in 1993 for the SNES. It stars Barbie, everyone's favourite model, who needs to go to 4 different regions of the world in order to fulfill her modelling career. Each stage requires the player to walk to the right, avoiding obstacles, to learn the modelling routine, then return to the runway to perform for thousands of adoring fans. This game taught me how to be beautiful.

	"There is no RNG in this game that affects the run. All "enemy" placements are predetermined and the only bits of RNG involved in the game are the photo shoot segments and the runway buttons, none of which are required for the category.

	"Each hit in this game loses time, so there is no form of damage boosting required. The main strategy we employed was pressing the correct button on the correct frame (imagine that). The entire walking/driving/skating/biking section we hold Y as this speeds up Barbie by approximately a factor of 2. The fastest method for finishing the runway sections is to spin, which in the 1st stage is mapped to X and in every other stage is mapped to Y. Why they've done this I have no idea.

	"Barbie's only weakness is bees, which thankfully are not in this game. What is in this game, however, is Barbie moving back and forth on every single frame. This is not only a gorgeous display of both driving skill and Parkinson's disease, but also a complicated movement strategy that took a ton of time to input and saved absolutely no time.

	"The most complex section of this run was stage 3-2 wherein we didn't have to move at all but chose to anyways. There is 1 pixel where you're safe and it just so happens to be the pixel you start on, but since we vibrate in this stage, we had to come up with other methods of dodging enemies. Stage 4-1 also includes a pixel-perfect placement on the bottom pixel of the map to dodge the walking man at the end of the stage, so we had to stop vibrating for that one. Most other stages have no noteworthy aspects.

	": This branch of the game is seen as too trivial on our site, because its time is the same as the real-time record has. Even if the current RTA run that literally ties with this movie never existed, the available RTA leaderboard shows that this game doesn't provide for the kind of competition we look for here at tasvideos.

	"By nature, this game doesn't have gameplay that is entertaining to see TASed, so it can only be accepted to

	" if it meets the criteria. But it doesn't meet them.
