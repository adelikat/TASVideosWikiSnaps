	"When the first keypress of the next block is different from the previous one , it allows the next block start moving 1 frame ( at 30 fps ) faster . So place the blocks one to the left and one to the right will be much faster. There is a tetris perfect clear way in this movie, but it needs more keypresses so it will be slower(about 0.1s). This TAS is obviously not the fastest, but it's too hard to make all blocks move in the way witch needs fewest keypresses.
