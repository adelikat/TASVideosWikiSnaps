Any time I pause when driving is to get the toon patrol to appear behind me - any sooner and they are in front.  In general the driving is improved, and avoids all cars whenever possible.

	"The fight with Doom is improved, and could possibly be even better since he is very random.  Pausing one frame can cause him to do something different.  During the fight I stop punching him because he moves out of range, and once Eddie stops moving forward when punching he cant get started again without stopping first.
