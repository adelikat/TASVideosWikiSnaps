	" with regards to what was allowed in an attempt to define what "vanilla level design" was. In a way that I can best explain it, think of it as a few steps removed compared to the later Old-school Level Design Contest. If you want to read a more nuanced take from someone who's a part of the SMW Central community, I recommend reading 
	[a href=https://smwc.me/1555521 rel=noopener external nofollow 
		"DeppySlide's writeup of VLDC6

[div class=p 
	"There are a few levels with branching paths and dragon coins on each path that don't necessarily require grabbing to get the 5 needed for completion. I focused on obtaining the most possible dragon coins without needing to restart levels mainly to keep the pace of the TAS to a more reasonable manner. That means if, for example, a branching path where each path has two dragon coins, only the fastest branch will be taken. However, if a level has more than 5 dragon coins that are obtainable in one run then they are obtained. This does lead to an issue with one level where I do intentionally slow down to show off where a dragon coin would be if the 5 dragon coin limit wasn't in place.

I didn't try much score manipulation to reduce the end of level lag as I knew at some point the score would be too big for any meaningful work on that to matter.

The third exit is considered fake since it functions as how YOSHI'S HOUSE and TOP SECRET AREA in vanilla Super Mario World works where touching the horizontal edges of the screen leaves the area but doesn't count as a level clear. However, this fake exit was what caused this level to be disqualified since the judges counted that as another exit, breaking the rule on having only up to 2 exits in a level. Due to that ruling I have to consider reaching the fake exit as part of the "all exits" goal.
