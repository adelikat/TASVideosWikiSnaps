	"The next day I checked the forums and noticed that Bob Whoops was doing a speedrun of this game too. We exchanged movies and it seemed both could be improved a lot.

	"I made a  new movie 'combining' these movies AND changed nearly every route of both Bobs and my movie to save a little time in every level.

	"Aside from solving the puzzles, the game seems very
	$LF
	"obvious and I can't see how one could fail to create
	$LF
	"the fastest possible movie, considering that Lolo
	$LF
	"is as fluent in movement as Pacman.

	$LF

[p 
	"Although I know what you mean about the movements, and it might not be as hard for a trained player to play like this Lolo fmv as like the rockman fmv, it is still impossible to play like this without some sort of help.

[p 
	"I absolutely disagree with the 'I can't see how one could fail to create the fastest possible movie'-part. My first attempt was far from perfect, and so was Bob Whoops. Bag of Magic Food is making a new Lolo2 fmv, and the first 5 floors look really good, but far from perfect (I already made an fmv of the first 3 floors before Bag of Magic Food started his run, and a lot can be improved there)
	$LF

[p 
	"This fmv isn't perfect aswell, (I know a level where I could improve one square) but is something not a lot players could make (without having it seen first).

	$LF
	"I'll reject this submission, but I will publish the improved
