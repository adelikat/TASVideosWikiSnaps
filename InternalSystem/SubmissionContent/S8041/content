	"New double orb glitch and high jump zipping were used in this movie. New double orb glitch was used at Creaking Skull and Manticore boss fight, totally getting 6 orbs from 2 bosses, which is doubled compared to former movies. This glitch is also used in Graham fight to skip his 2nd phase. High jump zipping allow Julius zipping and teleporting almost anywhere like Soma, creating a lot of shortcuts.

	"4 orbs can be aquired from Manticore boss, and with new zipping glitch Julius can access Manticore boss room easily from the very beginning of the game, so it is better to beat it first for Julius. Julius need to jump high to avoid tons of lags cause by 4x visual effects. But after that, we do not have much way for Julius to access the throne room easily, even with the new zipping glitch.

	"Using the teleport room to go back to Castle Corridor was still the best choice. Then we have 2 routes for Julius: one route is going to the throne room directly, and beating Graham with 4 orbs; another route is longer but Julius could pass through and beat Creaking Skull, so he could beat Graham with 6 orbs. The later route costs more time before Graham, but can beat him much faster. After some tests the second route wins, and was used in this movie.
