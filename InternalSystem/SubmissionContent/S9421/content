	"The run is performed on the Sinclair ZX Spectrum +2A. Fast Food synchronises its game engine to the screen's refresh rate, and therefore generally runs marginally (~0.1%) faster on 48K than on 128K versions. However, 128K versions of the Spectrum run their Z80 processor at a slightly higher clock rate, and the +2A and +3 also have some improvements in memory access speeds; this means that the 48K version lags significantly more during extra life cutscenes. The +3 is a disk-based system, and Fast Food has never been officially released on disk, so the run uses the +2A and loads the game from tape.

Wizza (yellow) behaves exactly the same as Bonzo, except that he moves slightly faster than Dizzy. Pippa (pink) consistently moves towards Dizzy, and moves slightly slower than him. Fido (blue) seems to aim for somewhere in front of Dizzy, but moves at the same speed as Bonzo.

	"There are four food types that appear in the game too: pizzas move around the maze randomly at a low speed; burgers do the same but at a higher speed. Chickens actively run away from Dizzy at a speed slightly slower than him, and milkshakes actively move towards Dizzy at a low speed.

Monsters are also temporarily removed when Dizzy collects a shield and then eats a monster shortly afterwards; removed monsters respawn after a few seconds. Finally, there's an invincible powerup that makes you immune to monsters, and the aforementioned slow down and speed up powerups.

	"Dizzy is one of my favourite 80s/90s videogame series, and Fast Food is my favourite of the spinoffs. Yes, it's a Pac-Man clone, but it's a very well done Pac-Man clone with lots new (at the time) twists on the formula.

This game was very unique though, having the clone qualities of Pac-Man...but not exactly. At first, I thought it was Wizard of Wor. Anyway...this run looks good.
