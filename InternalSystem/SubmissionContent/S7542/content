	"Invaders from space are coming to get us! This game takes the Space Invaders formula and changes it up a bit. Instead of 6 rows of aliens, we get one mothership, one row of aliens, one row of alien cannons, one row of alien shields. Our weapons are useless against the shields (blue circles) but can destroy the cannons (mushrooms) and aliens (aliens.) We do not need to destroy the cannons to win, shooting around them to hit the invaders is faster. Once all invaders are spacified, Gohma, er uh, the mothership comes down to get us. The mothership is killed last as it'll respawn infinitely if there are still invaders alive. It's also pretty difficult to hit as it reacts very quickly to your movements and shots.

	"We also take intentional damage in this run. The square blocks act like the shields from Space Invaders only that they don't take damage and cannot be killed. They do serve a purpose though. If you get hit, you turn into a little robot and can use the shield as a new ship, which removes the shield from play. This is critically important because some of the invaders are initially in spots where we can't shoot them because the shield is in the way. So we take a hit, grab a cannon and get back to work without losing time because we can't shoot again anyway until the previous bullet is cleared from the screen. Routing this makes it so we don't have to rely on them to move down/laterally on the screen, and we have full control of the battlefield.

	"Once the mothership is toast, you get a point. The manual says that the first side to reach 10 points wins, and that's as good a win condition as any. We get those ten points and we win. Yay!
