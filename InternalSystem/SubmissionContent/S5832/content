	"since there are no (known) glitches for this game, we revive H ending for submission, although without any of the glitches that made the SNES run fun. This clocks (pun intended) in at 4 minutes, a bit over twice the length of the SNES best TAS time for H ending, due to the lack of glitches and the general slowness of the port.

	", we have 
	[a href=/userfiles/info/46713824525438699 
		"a WIP
	]a
	" that shows that this run is quite improvable. But even though we can sometimes publish movies with known improvements, that WIP (unlike the one linked in 3876S) is almost finished. Theoretically, if we accept this submission, that WIP may be finished shortly and submitted just to prove that this run has been bested. Rejecting for sub-optimality.
