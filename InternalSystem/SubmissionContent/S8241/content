	"Because the blue lum power wasn't well understood, Rayman didn't fly optimally everywhere (at maximum vertical speed). In order to fly at maximum vertical speed, he has to go downwards for 1 frame before using the blue-lumed helicopter. If he punches during an ascending flight, he will drop the speed and has to go downwards again to recover it. Based on this new knowledge, I saved:

	"In Wretched Ruins Screen 1, I missed an obvious optimization because I copied the Any% route at the trampoline just after the death abuse. It is possible to directly reach the chain on the left side. It saved 57 frames, plus 3 other frames saved thanks to the next framerule at the end of the level. So far, I saved 596 frames.

	"In Mega Havoc 3, the first ascending flight has been optimized, it saved 26 frames. However, I saved frames on a temporary blue lum, so I had to reroute the following section. Indeed, a longer blue lum means that I have to wait longer before using a normal helicopter after a fast plum-jump. I lost 1 frame because of that. And I lost another frame because of the next framerule. So the new Mega Havoc 3 is 24 frames shorter. So far, I saved 620 frames.

	"In Razor Slide Screen 2, a faster movement to get the 25th lum saved 6 frames. Then I lost 1 frames after exiting the level. This transition is different, the normal framerule doesn't apply here. Something else is interfering which I don't understand. So this new optimization saved 5 frames.
