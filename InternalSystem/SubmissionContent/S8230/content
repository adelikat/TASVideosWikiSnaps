	"For those who don't know, this is the famous Super Diagonal Mario 2, better known as the most HILARIOUS hack ever! This hack was made by a Brazilian called Lester Vine and you can find this

For this reason, I was obliged to use the "Faust" core because it is the only one (in this emulator version 2.6.3) that works together with the script for Super Mario World hacks with SA-1. The BSNES core unfortunately doesn't work with this script (maybe it does now, in the new released version of BizHawk).

	": I think this movie is insane. For the entire duration of it I was unable to figure out what's going on. But the part I did get is this hack is loaded with jokes and variety. I'm not familiar with it, and there's little to no information what is even normal gameplay in this game, so it's hard to understand what is and what isn't a glitch. But the movie itself is also loaded with creativity, so it never gets old. In this context, being unable to figure out what's going on is exactly what we want from a glitchfest! And it's obvious that the amount of work behind this is far from mediocre. Even without too much feedback (which we would need if the result was questionable), I think this movie is definitely the thing we want to encourage to end up having more cool playarounds in the future. Accepting to Alt.
