	"The 11 frames improvement is due to uses of Jumpman`s (aka Mario) movement pattern which its RAM address is $88. I did manipulate it at stage 2. When used correctly, some pixels may be gained which was 2 in this case. Result is easily noticeable with RAM address $46 which is Jumpman's X position. The technique is only useful when jumping then waiting after. In others words, at the very first jump. However, without the uses of memory addresses, we can only see it is really improved when Jumpman reaches the 2nd elevator. Otherwise, at first glance, it seems as fast as any other method.
