[p 
	"No, but this game has a dynamical difficulty system. It's depended on what grade your grenade/rocket weapon is in. Generally speaking, the better weapon you have, the more enemy the game will be in. In order to play the game at the hardest level, one needs to upgrade his main weapon to the 4-way rocket.

[p 
	"Yes, sucide can be abused to have only one jeep on the screento avoid lags, and the game-over player can "borrow" a life from the other to join boss fight, and then commit sucide again. This can be a faster way than this movie uses, but I deprecated it for the sake of entertainment.
