[p 
	"Same as in previous submission, but now I considered that pressing Right just before the pre-level lag starts, you gain 2 pixels. The game has no X-subpixels, and Y-subpixels don't alter randomly as in the first game, so subpixels were not optimised here. X-speed is always 2 ppf.

	"If you are blinking from being damaged you can't scroll the screen up. This means even when you can damage-boost up, you still have to wait until you stop blinking. 
	$LF

[p 
	"On the other side, there's a moving platform in clock tower level that starts moving down and left once you spawn it with screen scrolling. FiskerN lost a bunch of frames waiting for it to go up again to be able to reach the platform above. I instead take damage to prevent scrolling too fast anf spawn this platform at the very moment when I'm over it already, so I jump & reach the upper platform easily. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Though this caused the last in-level elevators to start movig later. I mean, I make the screen scroll up til the end later, and it scrolled right then later too. The result is some lost frames because I had to wait while the last elevator goes up enough. I tried to scroll the screen so fast that I would be able to jump on that last elevator BEFORE it goes down. but a silly couple of pixels didn't allow me to reach the last platform that early D:

	"Much time was saved thanks to picking less R/R icons. Each icon costs 4 frames on he countdown.

	"Somewhere you could pick boxes to go further faster, where these boxes are on your way. But it almost always causes lag, and while you don't lose frames picking them, the throw animation is quite long.

	"In Western World there are these falling stones when you ride the wagon. It falls when the screen reaches some point, and after you activatad its fall you shall release Right to let the stone fall. The strange thing with the first stone in all 3 rooms is that you shall

	[a class=extlink href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8C07PDwnw8 rel=nofollow 
		"Spiiin
	]a
	" and we didn't know how to pull several balls in a row from that platform, because you need to fall to the void, hold to the right, sliding down the left corner, and press Right+B to pick it. You need something to damage-boost you off the hole. You can use the Rabbit himself or the water drops for that. I didn't try this glitch out originally, but goofydylan8 made an awesome work to have as much balls as he liked. Remember the water flushing you off the plate platforms? Let it flush you off and at the first frame of fall press Right. You will dive 
	[b 
		"into
	]b
	" the block and would be able to stand on the block below! Just jump from it with a new ball.
	$LF

That makes her to read the different value from RNG and make the move I need. In my previous submission I got all the chain of her moves perfect and applied no delay, but here I lose 87 frames.
