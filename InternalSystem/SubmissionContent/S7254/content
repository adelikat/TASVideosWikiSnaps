	"Doc Louis's Punch-Out!! is an exclusive game that was released only to Club Nintendo Platinum members, and only in North America. It is by far the shortest Punch-Out game, and is really more like a demo for Punch-Out Wii. The game consists of only three different fights (all against the same opponent, Little Mac's trainer Doc Louis), fewer than even the arcade games, and the total in-game time is faster than SNES Super Punch-Out!! despite the ingame clock running faster.

	"While going through the menus as fast as possible does mean the fight times can only be seen by slowing down playback, I opt to do this anyway to save time. Due to Warm-up and Training already having a TAS with visible times.

[div class=p 
	"-This is why there's so much punching at the air during the fight. The sets of punches when Doc comes back to the center can't be done as fast as possible, or they'll land before the timer for his next move starts,

	"delaying the next attack. For the sets of two the first punch is delayed, and for the set of three, it's the second punch.

[div class=p 
	"-Starting here intentionally blocked punches are used to start the timer for the next attack sooner. This doesn't help for short delays, such as the one between the first two attacks. A two-star punch will slow the clock down for longer after it lands than a one-star punch, and three-stars are even better. However, Doc will regenerate all his health if his health gets too low, so a three-star punch can't be used in this fight.

[div class=p 
	"-A little trick is added onto this fight, that was developed by zallard1. after the RJ countering his "Duck this one!" attack, I opt to throw a right hook first instead of a left hook. Starting a buffer with the same side punch wastes 3 frames over an alternate side one, and it turns out if we were to start with an alternate side one, we would have to delay the last hook in the buffer sequence by 3 frames. This gets rid of that, meaning I can buffer all 4!
