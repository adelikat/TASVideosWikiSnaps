	"Super Mario Bros. 3, played on the Super Mario All Stars version for the Super Nintendo. I believe everyone is familiar with the game, but if not: Super Mario Bros. 3 is a game in which Mario must travel through 8 worlds to rescue the princess Peach from the evil clitches of Bowser.

	"Although, there is a technique that allows you to move faster than the game ever intended and it's only possible on a modified snes9x controller. When you press both left and right at the same time, Mario shoots backwards to the right at higher than top speed. This run uses the same route as the published NES run, as it's the fastest, only travelling through half of world 1, and world 8 through use of the warp whistles.

		" Level 1: I hate the beginning to this level, it's harder to do in this TAS than the NES one because when you're at top speed, you travel faster than the fire flower shots, so optimization is terrible. I think I did a pretty good job in the end though. After the first couple seconds, the level gets easier. Stage's time is 289.

		" Castle: The beginning of the level abused a lot of ducking, the conveyer belt part was done pretty well, the third room with the P-switch was also done well, the forth room was perfect and the most difficult because there's a Boo near to the ground at the beginning that will follow you when you're heading in it's direction with the Left + Right trick because you're facing backwards, but luckily he can be avoided by turning around for only one frame at the beginning. The boss fight was as perfect as I can get it, and finally, stage's time is 376.

		" Bowser's Castle: Entering the level with a star saves time because you don't take damage from the Thwomp, and it preserves the fire flower for Bowser. The clip through the wall after the Thwomp gets annoying on the SNES because you're moving quicker so you have to slow down a bit when you land before duck-jumping, and if I did do it a couple frames slower than it's possible, I don't think it matters because of the subsequent frames lost due to manipulating the Bowser fight. Like the NES, Bowser must jump six times to secure the fastest death animation. If he only jumps five times, he will take a giant leap before you can finish him, and thus, wasting time. After the fight I try to get some last minute entertainment in by glitching into the ground at first, then letting Bowser's fall push me out. Then I twitch in the beat of the screen's shake, and shoot fire balls at the fastest possible rate out the right side of the screen. Final stage time of 373.

	"TASes of this game can get rather boring at times with all of the auto-scroll levels in world 8, but it gives me a chance to pull off some stunts, and all of the other levels get to be quite interesting.
