There is a frame that exceeds maximum speed just before reaching.Release → (when Kirby facing right) at this frame and press → again when falls below the maximum speed. Repeating this in the midair, the speed value will loop through: 512, 496, 536, 520, 504, 544, 528… Averaging this in 520, faster than normal running.

	"So the entertainment is absolutely superb. The TAS uses numerous techniques and forms of mobility to move throughout levels. From speed cycling to getting pushed ahead a little further by your partner to even zips. The goal works well, it provides unique goals to complete in each level but doesn't include the extra tedium that would come with a true 100% run. The audience absolutely loves it as well.
