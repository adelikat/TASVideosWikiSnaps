	"The game starts out with 4 colours to remember, but after every level another colour is added. This means level 2 has 5 colours, level 3 has 6 colours, and so on... until level 9, which has a whopping 12 colours. In some of the later levels (especially the final two), the speed of the colours flashing gets significantly faster, with level 9 being practically impossible in real time due to this.

	"RNG is manipulated to get the fastest solutions and save fractions of a second. But with ~100 combinations over the course of the whole TAS, the timesave adds up quickly. Finding the fastest solutions was a pain in the backside, especially in level 9, but it was worth it.

You did exactly what I would have done...where you "compress" the inputs. In this case, you created the inputs with the right combinations to save as much time. This is probably best summed as an exercise in "Menu Navigating".

	"The other thing that I checked was your claim on RNG manipulation. From what I can see, it is controlled by delays or the lack of. So basically...when a new pattern is initiated, it would change on different frames. Because of this, this makes it more difficult to manage...as input controlled RNG would have been easier (IMO) with less effort. It's no wonder you surpassed 10,000 re-records.
