	"I discovered a sliding glitch which allows you to move at a much faster speed than just walking. This is done by pressing away and then forward twice in quick succession. I also did a few small optimizations from my previous TAS that I wasn't aware of before.

[div class=p 
	"Round 1) This is mostly the same as before, only that I stay slightly more to the right than before. This allows me to still beat the opponent in 4 side-steps, but I'm more to the right, which not only helps in Round 2, but also saves 6 frames for this round as the opponent has less distance to walk. Even the smallest distance more to the right won't allow me to defeat the opponent.

[div class=p 
	"Round 2) This is again mostly the same; the combination of the sliding glitch and being more to the right than my previous TAS means that I can attack earlier, and save using a whole punch. This saves 39 frames.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Round 3) This is where most of the frames are saved and the sliding glitch gets to shine. In my first TAS, normally defeating the opponent was just 5 frames slower than using the side-step glitch again, but this time I save over a full second. This is mostly just by meeting the opponent much earlier than walking, but doing this saves punching two times extra and also being able to attack earlier. With the new glitch, beating the opponent in the traditional fashion is significantly faster than side-stepping.
