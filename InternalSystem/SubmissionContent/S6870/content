Watch as she whips enemies, climbs ropes in odd ways, & even screenwraps on her adventure to the end of Dracula's castle.

	"Legends is actually a much deeper game than it appears on the surface. A much later release than the previous two GB titles it takes the formula and adds a few new details such as controlled jumps, burning mode, soul weapons over sub weapons, & collectibles for an alternate end sequence. There's also a very slight nuance to the jumps that function similar to a "regrab" in Super Mario World. During a jump if the player attacks and holds jump during the attack animation they will fall slightly slower than normal. Although slight this is used multiple times in the run to both regulate my jump height and even manipulate bat enemies offscreen. You also have the ability to cancel knock-back if it occurs on the same frame as landing on the ground.

	"This stage was extremely hard to optimize as there are multiple spots where lag management is key. This becomes a difficult balancing act. In the end destroying things such as candles & enemies is generally in your best interest as the slight time loss from jumps is often outweighed by less lag frames overall. You can even delay/prevent lag frames in some cases with a small jump. This becomes beneficial when you can delay lag frames enough that you will eliminate one by the time you reach the door, end of the laggy spot, etc.

They are a big contribution to the stage 1 lag and if left to linger they can really cost you time. I do jumps in certain spots to manipulate their direction. To take it a step further unknown to the audience I am randomly holding jump during the end portions of certain jumps to do this as well. This doesn't actually impact my jump at all but for some reasons the bat enemies respond to this.

As long as you're not in Burning Mode it's actually slightly faster to wrap than sliding down while holding jump.

It's worth noting that when I made the climb up in Burning Mode before heading back to the right I jump to force the camera scroll up.

Two, they'll be useful for the next TAS of this game. Finally... They don't affect my decision. All of these improvements are in the first stage. The rest of the run looks incredibly solid, and as far as I can tell, no tricks have been missed at all, including the rest of the tricks shown in scrimpy's video. It's clear you've learned a lot since you started the run: The tricks used for said improvements are used to their full potential over the rest of the run (i.e, you're not constantly losing time from not knowing something important). Implementing improvements in this game would take far more effort than just basic resyncing (the lag gets thrown off immensely even for small improvements, and the entire run would have to be redone from scratch), and given how long it seems to have taken to make this run (BH 2.3.2 was released in June 2019, so I'm estimating at least a year of work), I can't possibly ask you to redo everything just for a few seconds of improvement in a 20+ minute run. Plus, even in the first stage, you were able to reduce lag much better than I was able to in my WIP (a good 20-30 frames over me, and I thought I did a pretty dang good job), so it's clear that there was a lot of effort put in even from the very beginning.
