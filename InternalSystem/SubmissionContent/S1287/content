	"This run came about due to the fact that the Duck Tales games or so fun to TAS :)  Guybrush mentioned doing this run some time ago, and I said that I don't think that OmnipotentEntity's run could be improved by even a single frame.  He proved me wrong, and soon I was working on it along with him.

	"This run is a modest 85 frames (about 1.5 sec) faster than the current published run.  It comes from several minor tricks that all saved a handful of frames (some disappointingly small compared than what I would have thought).

	"1) Upon obtaining a treasure at the end of the level, Scrooges vertical velocity is carried over to his descent in the next level.  This means that grabbing it while accelerating downward will make him fall to the ground faster in the next level (as opposed to walking into it for instance).  Unfortunately scrooges initial vertical velocity of a level is only relevant in the moon level.  By minimizing my velocity, I was able to pass over the two enemies without losing horizontal motion.

	"2) Maximizing vertical acceleration.  Scrooge's y coordinate was particularly helpful here.  When going up a rope, it is best to get as much acceleration from a pogo jump (or regular) jump before going up even if it means the screen scrolling at a later frame.  Scrooge's height carries over to the next screen.  Creative uses of this makes up much of the improvements.

	"I'd like to thank my partner Guybrush for his eye in spotting small optimizations.  I'd like to thank the previous authors OmnipotentEntity & Genisto who contributed a majority of the tricks/routes etc.  (This run is only 4.5 sec faster than Genisto's famtasia run)
