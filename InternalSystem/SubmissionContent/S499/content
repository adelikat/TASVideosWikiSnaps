	"There has been a lot of talk about doing a run on this game in 'expert' mode, but I still wonder if the slower pace in order to get through the game would really lend to a better movie to view.  Perhaps, maybe I'll try it later.

	"A few improvements:
	$LF
	"1) Used the fireball to get past the blocking robot, so I didn't have to pick up the armor in 1-2
	$LF
	"2) Used the fireball to kill the bosses of stages 3, 4, and 5.
	$LF
	"3) Used the fireball to get as many of the lasers in stage 5 as possible.  This is where the bulk of the speed increase came from.
	$LF
	"4) I used the 'P' powerup in stages 6 and 7 because of the boss for stage 6.  The 'P' is the only reasonably fast way to kill him.
	$LF
	"5) I killed a few more random enemies, just for the heck of it.
