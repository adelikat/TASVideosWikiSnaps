	"With no doubt, the main difficulty that arised was the routing for this time attack. It was especially tricky, because of two things, namely the truck speed boost and the final goal to finish at the school’s stairs. I have tased many routs to be now satisfied with this one. One important thing to note is that

		"sections
	]a
	". The only thing that was quite clear form the beginning was, that I needed to end somewhere in the blue area, such that I was done near the final stairs. I tried many routs in my head first, before starting to tas them one by one. However, it quickly became clear, that getting the boost (yellow) at the very beginning was not a good idea. I realized, I needed to finish the purple area first before any other one. After that though, I had to try out pretty much every single route, which seemed to be at least a little bit promising (that’s also where most of the rerecords come from). After comparing the results of each route, this submitted one ended up being the fastest.
