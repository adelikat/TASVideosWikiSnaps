		"I

	" first became interested in this upon seeing ALAKTORN's alternate strategy for Fog of War; thinking that it was a shame that a game could be broken in this fashion and yet remain improvable, I subsequently worked to implement that strategy under TAS conditions on the theory that it could be spliced into the rest of the run.  That theory proved to be well-founded and prompted further scrutiny from criticaluser, ALAKTORN, and 
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/klmz 
		"klmz
	]a
	"; what you see here is the result of their combined strategising (and my occasional splicing) - this is the fourth and hopefully final time that improvements have been added to the run.

However, I don't think that destroys the entertainment. While perhaps the authors could have played the last mission, that brings in arbitrary goals which I am vehemently against. That said, I think this glitch is unique enough to deserve it's own movie. Accepting as a new publication.
