	"This is my version 3 of this game which is now 10 seconds faster than my previous (canceled) submission and 54 seconds faster than the current published run.

	"Some notable improvements from the published movie:

[ul 
	[li 
		"Level 1 - collected enough pods to get all the speed upgrades.  This allows me to complete it 8 seconds faster!
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Level 2 - collected as many pods in order to max out missles and guns.  this allows me to complete the first 2 bosses faster. This also allowed me to collect the "force" (which comes in handy later)
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Level 9 - took the alternate route that changes the order and make-up of the levels, the new route saves about 10 seconds
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Level 23 - instead of running out the clock I use the "force" shield and kill the boss instead, saves about 10 seconds.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Save the children levels - it is faster to save only 1 instead of all of them, I tried some "bizarre" strategies to defend the remaining child.  I make a pseudo drama out of both levels.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"Saving 1 child is 2 seconds faster on both levels (4 sec total)
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		"Bonus levels - shooting all the targets results in getting the 1up which costs about 70 frames.  Therefore I intentionally miss the 1st target.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"In addition every level is completed at least 10-30 frames faster
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"At times I shoot for seemingly no reason, the point is luck manipulation.  By shooting I make the turrets not fire when they appear on the screen.
	$LF

[p 
	"I aimed for the highest score possible without losing time.  You will see that this time I shoot all the boats I can and get bonus points whenever possible.
