	"I started this TAS with the old Yabause core and experienced several sync issues, but thankfully with the new update there were no issues.

	"Deppy has two movement options, A for jump and X for dash. By dashing it slowly drains the fuel meter, which also happens to be the health bar too. Health management plays an important part since Deppy is constantly dashing throughout the level, therefore gas cans must be collected in order to refuel the meter.

[p 
	"Most levels take a path where gas cans can be collected without slowing down too much or having to scale up or down the level a bunch. Throughout the levels there are batteries which provide invincibility and zero fuel usage, these are all avoided as they take too long to regain speed.

	"During each platforming section it's ideal to get a dash as soon as possible, rather than waiting a bit to take out enemies. So this is why in some situations I simply plough through everything or just jump over them.

	"For the Boss fights charging up the fuel meter to the max provides the most damage and is faster than spamming weaker attacks over and over. When fighting Hi-Jacker it is faster to use quicker dashes since it keeps Deppy in the air and waiting for the next opening takes too long.

	"Final Stage: There are 7 phases to this boss, the first six start with avoiding a laser and then proceding to attack the boss two times. Some hits are delayed so that Deppy doesn't get hit by one of the weapons. Waiting for an opening is faster than getting an earlier hit and taking damge since recovering from a hit takes some time. The final hit is timed so that it skips a longer walking animation after the explosion, saving a second each time.
