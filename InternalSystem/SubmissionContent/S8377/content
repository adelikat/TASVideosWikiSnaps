Propeller is slower than other powerups for most other levels, though. This TAS starts by collecting Ice in 1-2, then goes to the red Toad House in World 5 to collect a Propeller, Penguin, and Star which can be equipped between levels. These items are used to save enough time in subsequent levels to make up the time spent going to the Toad House and a lot more.

	"This TAS uses an RNG seed known as an 8-Cycle. Usually, random events are determined by calling different values in a cycle of ~1.7 million values, and there's no way to manipulate that. But sometimes, RNG seeds lead to values that are part of cycles of different lengths. By knowing what RNG we want throughout the game, we find an 8-Cycle which has RNG values which lead to our desired events and is quite easy to manipulate from there. Using an 8-Cycle has a few side-effects throughout the run. Most noticeably, the clouds in 1-1 and 5-4. Instead of spawning all fluffy-like, clouds now spawn in incredibly dense balls of cloud. Although it cannot be seen, this has the same effects on the poison clouds following Mario in 8-1. The other place where this is noticeable is the lava particle effects all throughout World 8. There is usually only one or two particles on screen and they shine very brightly. Gameplay-wise though, the game runs normally.

Once Mario has left the ground and/or stayed on it long enough, he loses ~0.1 speed (3 speed running normally; 4 speed fastest normal slide). Temporarily, it's fastest to start a penguin slide and jump once Mario has 18 slide timer so he can have 4 speed until he lands again. But looking ahead, it's faster to slide on the ground until Mario has 5 slide timer and jumping with only 3.9 speed, then be able to cancel or reset penguin slide instantly and at will. This is done in the first room of this level to cancel penguin slide just before entering the pipe and save a few frames. Slide timer is heavily manipulated in every level from here on out.

This is useful for a variety of situations. In the start of the main room of 5-4, Mario crouches, lands on an enemy midair, and then barely twirls under a vine which acts as a solid ceiling. Once he is on the right side of the vine, he shoots ice to do an ice-assisted corner boost. During this corner boost, he can hold left and wall jump off of the vine. This allows Mario to get up onto the top of the level very quickly and is used frequently throughout this level.

	"If Mario starts a penguin slide and then slows down below a certain speed, then he cancels the penguin slide automatically. By starting a penguin slide at a very specific speed, however, before accelerating Mario is already below that threshold and therefore cancels his penguin slide after a couple frames. This is used for a few things. Firstly, it is used for faster acceleration. This method of a fast accel is slower than the slide and spin jump method, but it's still used whenever a spin fast accel isn't possible. It is also the fastest way to crouch with penguin because Mario can immediately crouch jump out of it while still getting the full benefit of the fast accel. Lastly, if Mario starts a penguin slide and it cancels the moment he falls off of the edge of a platform, then once the animation of canceling the penguin slide finishes, he can perform a midair jump. This is used with a frozen micro-goomba near the end of this level to continue much faster.

Now, however, the speed is stored into Mario's penguin speed and decreases identically to penguin slide speed instead of instantly losing it upon contact with the ground. On a regular steep slope like the one in the 2nd room of this level, Mario can build up to 4.32 speed. This tech is known as hyperspeed, and is used as often as possible from here on.

So Mario can slide and do whatever with penguin and then as soon as he needs the triple jump, he can cancel penguin slide, shoot an ice ball to reactivate his triple jump, and get the triple seemingly out of nowhere.

When sliding down a step slope, Mario's slide speed will accelerate up to 4.07 speed. If he has this speed and lands on another steep slope, he gets up to 4.15 speed.

	"At the end of the first room of this level, there is a rotating pipe-cannon which Mario must enter to continue the level. He can only enter the pipe when the green pipe is facing up. When the pipe-cannon spawns, the green pipe is already on top and in a couple seconds, it rotates away so it can no longer be entered. Previous TASes have had to wait for a very long time for the pipe to rotate all the way around so they could enter it. However this TAS is different - it skips the cycle. To set this up there are a couple parts. The first objective is to manipulate the camera to load the pipe as late as possible. The only known way to do that is to travel in the opposite direction for a couple seconds before quickly turning back. This can be done by wall jumping on a rightward wall to get leftward momentum for a couple seconds and then wall jumping on a leftward wall to get rightward momentum before allowing the camera to change directions and catch up. As soon as the pipe is loaded, Mario needs to be going as fast as possible so he can make it to the pipe before it rotates. The solution was to bring two mechakoopas from earlier in the level, then throw them midair to create a right and left wall to use as described, then use an extra height penguin slide jump on the rightward frozen mechakoopa so Mario can just barely make it to the pipe without having to slow down. There is currently less than a unit of leniency with making this cycle.

	"Previous TASes have also relied on propeller for the run because of a trick in the 8-Airship boss fight, called bombless. Bombless is ground pounding at the top of the screen in a very narrow window to register a hit on Bowser Junior without sending a bomb his way. Propeller is the most straight-forward way of getting a bunch of height, but there are other options. Shooting ice immediately after a wall jump does not only allow Mario to accelerate faster, it also allows him to slow down quickly. By doing this and then twirling back to the wall, it's possible to climb individual walls infinitely. This allows Penguin Mario to get to the top of the screen easily, and by manipulating Bowser Junior's up/down movements with the time Mario hits him with the first bomb, the TAS can still perform double bombless with penguin. This method of bombless is a few seconds slower than propeller, but the rest of the level more than makes up for it.

This TAS does one better though. Bowser's first fireball is aimed at a very specific angle to break the first 2 columns of bricks and leave a 1-tile gap in the 3rd column. By crouching into 1-tile gaps and then un-crouching, Mario is automatically pushed to the right. This TAS does that here. Once Mario is clipped inside the wall, he crouch jumps 6 times and then is completely above the level. Up here, Mario can run and penguin slide right unhindered. After the fireball section of this fight, there is an event which triggers and the screen moves downwards regardless of where Mario is. There is an off-screen limit of how high Mario can stand above the screen, and this limit can't kill Mario, it can only move him or stop him from moving. Once the screen begins lowering, this limit lowers with it, and it slowly pulls Mario down through the ceiling and back into the level where he's supposed to be.
