I start off by riding down the wall, since it's faster than just falling, dismounting the wall a bit early in order to hit the most steep bit of the slope on the left with the back wheel. I get a wheelie off that and carry it all the way to the wall, maintaining most of my speed going up. On the top part I angle myself so that my back wheel touches the ceiling, giving me more speed through the horizontal part and allowing me to hit the sticking out bit in the top left corner with the back of the bike. I then bounce off the wall with my front wheel, ending up with a wheelie for the final part.

	"Usually the longest level, but here I make quick work of it by employing some very precise jumps. I start off with a wheelie as usual, though this time I carefully manipulate my speed to land at the beginning of the next platform, to build enough speed to clear the gap and then jump to the wall. Landing on the wall close to flat allows me to scale it up to the checkpoint, skipping the bottom right platforming section. After that, I make sure to land as far left on the platform as possible, to get all the speed I need to bounce off the next platform all the way up to the wall. It's still not enough to land flat on it however, so some very precise inputs are done to accelerate off the sloped part but still stick to the wall, allowing me to drive straight up to the goal, skipping another platforming section to the right.
