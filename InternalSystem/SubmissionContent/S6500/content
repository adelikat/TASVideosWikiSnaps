	"the previous submission from nitrogenesis misses alot of time saves that may be hard to spot.  in this game the screen updates every 4 frames, so it's important to spot any place where it doesnt take 5 frames to update.  places where it will take 5 frames to update is if you collect too many coins at once, hit a block from below, or run on a falling platform.  there's also weird properties with Mario's speed which I dont exactly know myself, however after some experiments I believe I got some pretty optimal speed changes.
