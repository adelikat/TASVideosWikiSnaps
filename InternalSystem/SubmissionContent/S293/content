	"Darkwing Duck time! Frenom and I decided to compete yet 
	$LF
	"again and this is the result after MUCH hard work.
	$LF

[p 
	"I improved my previous attempt with almost 1 minute. This 
	$LF
	"is because loads of minor optimizions and almost all bosses 
	$LF
	"are killed a bit faster. Also, this run contains more 
	$LF
	"jumping then any other game. This is because when landing 
	$LF
	"after a jump Darkwing will freeze for 1-2 frames and it also 
	$LF
	"takes some frames for him to accelerate. So once I jump I 
	$LF
	"have to continue ;)
	$LF

[p 
	"And the re-records is NOT correct. I compared my run with 
	$LF
	"Frenoms a couple of times and swoosch! His re-records were 
	$LF
	"in my run. The correct re-record number is around 10000 I 
	$LF
	"think.

	"I also take more damage this time to save time.. And thatÂ´
	$LF
