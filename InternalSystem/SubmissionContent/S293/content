	"I improved my previous attempt with almost 1 minute. This 
	$LF

	$LF
	"are killed a bit faster. Also, this run contains more 
	$LF
	"jumping then any other game. This is because when landing 
	$LF
	"after a jump Darkwing will freeze for 1-2 frames and it also 
	$LF
	"takes some frames for him to accelerate. So once I jump I
