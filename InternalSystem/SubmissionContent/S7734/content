	"This submission is for the Game Boy Color version of Wizardry: Legacy of Llylgamyn which is the second game in the series if you go by Japanese release numbering. The game expanded some of the mechanics of the original including making alignment super important, making good grind spots few and far between, and emphasizing exploration of a somewhat "living" area.

	"The current publication for Wiz: LoL shows off the SRAM glitch which is definitely worth a watch. However, it doesn't show off the actual game, so I took it upon myself to work through this TAS and let people watch the full game being run in a very understandable 100 mph and entirely in Japanese.

	"The GBC releases of the original Wizardry trilogy are different from the other versions. The maps are smaller (though with a similar layout) the mechanics are a little different, and the default party starts at level 3 instead of 1. This gives you access to second level spells right off the rip, which is important for the boss fights. The game also loads and processes encounters way faster, whereas the NES versions have that slight delay.

	"Right off the bat, we roll 3 fighters with 20 strength. Strength factors into hit chance and damage calcs, like levels but strength is more impactful. However, though the premade fighters are level 3, their stats are garbage. Rolling new ones is very worth it. This allows us to do 6-13 damage with a broad sword, which is the minimum we need in most situations (we do farm a better sword before the bosses, more on that later.

	"The mages come with two very important spells - Katino and Melito. Katino is a sleep spell. If you put an enemy to sleep, melee hits do double damage and they obviously can't act if they are sleeping. By sleeping some of the stronger enemies we can punch above our weight class quite a bit. Melito is a small AoE spell that we use in the second boss fight to deal with the surprisingly weak minions he comes with.

	$LF
	"we can hit for 6-13, we want to fight as few of them as possible. The group size is rolled at the same time as the HP and we can look in RAM to see what HP they're rocking, (around 0x14A6) and keep finessing the RNG around until we get something we can kill. RNG is affected by every frame and every action so we can keep making minor changes and re-rolling until we get a possible win.

In this room we trade the gold medallion for a crystal vial (holy water) which acts as both a healing item and a "bypass a tile you can't get past without it" item.

	"The thing about forced door encounters like this is that enemies drop closed treasure chests. Normally you'd bring a thief to identify and disarm traps, as locked chests can drop items, but you can also wing it and just open it and hope it doesn't kill you.

[div class=p 
	"This chest serves two purposes. It gives us a boat so we can take a shortcut on level 1 between 5 and 4, and through the magic of RNG forcing, we get a Sword of Slashing. This ups our damage considerably as it adds more damage, has additional swings, and lets us hit for well over 30HP on a good roll. With this, we can kill the boss fights much more quickly so this is worth it all-around. The trap we got was a Gas Bomb, which has a chance to poison everyone in your party. We avoid it through sheer force of wil- I mean RNG manips and it's off to the boss.

They come with Crusader Lords (25-45 HP, mage spells) and regular Crusaders (2-16 HP and Montino)

The fight actually goes somewhat smoothly and we barely get by. We delay some frames so the priest gets the crystal (so we don't have to trade it around) and we use our alignment trick to get back to the castle.

	"In "friendly" scenarios, doing the opposite thing of your alignment can cause you to change. If you're good and attack a friendly group you have a chance to turn evil and vice versa. We go to the nearest forced encounter, leave them alone and our priest turns good. Since we're incompatible with the floor, game boots us back to town, where we cross the river using the boat and get to level 4.
