	"I decided to TAS this game because it is ridiculous and difficult. I think it is still optimizable on the ride (because I recently found a new glitch that does not need to collide with an enemy, only for "jump into the wall").

	"While the first player take a damage with an enemies, you have to jump on its head with the second player.
	$LF
	"For a moment, the second player is found next to the first player and bellow the vertical position of the first. (the effect is off when the first player leaves the collision mode, the second player finds himself on the head of the first player).

	" Pass through a soil  :
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"If during this state the second player collides with a wall, he finds himself "detached" from the pull of the first player. And it therefore passes through the soil.
