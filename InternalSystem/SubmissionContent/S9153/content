	"I had been working so hard and for so long on other projects, that I forgot how much fun I have with Zelda projects. I'll get to those eventually, but for the time being the goal of this project was to prove to myself (and flex) how good and efficient I've become at 3DS TAS projects. I knew that completing my Majora's Mask 3D TAS wouldn't be that hard or take that long, but I still surprised myself with what I was able to do with that, especially considering I basically had to redo more than half of that TAS after finishing it once. After finishing that, I was sure that I could finish an Ocarina of Time 3D All Dungeons TAS in a matter of weeks. I am wildly more familiar with this game and had quickly thought up some neat route ideas that would likely be considered too hard to be done in a real-time speedrun. I also believe that All Dungeons is an incredible category for Ocarina of Time 3D, featuring some of the coolest, flashiest, most technical tricks and routing considerations of any category. Additionally, I wanted to show off some of the new timesaves that I thought up since finishing my Any% TAS that could have been implemented there. I did not want to retread old ground by updating that TAS, so this felt like the best way to improve those things by proxy. I also knew it length would be manageable to complete a TAS for. And yet, this movie is nearly 3 times longer than anything else I have finished. It's likely a little less optimized than my other movies, as I often wasn't frame hunting specific section for hours as I have done in the past. But even so, I feel pretty damn good about how well this turned out. I'm very happy with the finished product.

A real-time speedrun of All Dungeons would also begin that way. However, the route used in this movie collects the Kokiri Sword and 40 rupees to buy a Deku Shield and enter the Deku Tree as normally intended. A large number of the rupees collected here are obtained from bushes that randomly give 1 rupee, 3 rupees, or no rupees. Manipulating the RNG here took a very long time. The goal of entering the Deku Tree in this route is not to complete it this early, though. This movie only obtains the Slingshot and immediately leaves the dungeon. The slingshot will be necessary to complete this route later on, but also has an application for a big timesave prior to when it will be fastest to complete this dungeon. It ends up being a little faster to obtain the Slingshot now and come back later to finish the dungeon. An invisible seam is used to quickly reach the Slingshot room.

I want to avoid anything unnecessary that will prevent time from passing such as talking to the owl at the entrance to this area. This can be avoided by alternating between pulling out the sword and a Deku Stick frame perfectly while within the trigger. The Any% route and the All Dungeons RTA route would not have a Deku Stick at this point, so this is another benefit to making a detour for an early Deku Tree trip. This movie uses a FESS to quickly cross Hyrule Field. Rolling into some trees in this area have a chance to drop Deku Nuts or a Deku Stick. Grabbing either one of them here when I have time to burn will prevent the route from having to go out of the way to get them later. I wanted to get both a Deku Stick and a Deku Nut drop but all of the other trees that can drop them are too far away to still make it to the Market before the bridge at the entrance closes at night.

	"In the Hyrule Castle area, this movies skips more owl text by immediately grabbing the vine wall while inside the trigger to start the text, delaying it activating. At the top of the wall, frame perfect weapon swapping can be used to leave the text trigger area without the text starting. Normally, this map would need to reloaded to spawn Malon, an NPC who gives Link the Weird Egg item which is used to clear the path at the end of this area. This can be avoided by getting out of bounds using a precise seam walk to get out of bounds. Link can walk up the line where 2 walls meet if they are sloped enough and he is walking slowly enough. This particular seam walk is incredibly precise. From this out of bounds area, Link can enter the castle moat water while out of bounds. Waterboxes always extend infinitely downwards, so Link can swim into the small patch of water coming from the crawlspace in order to float up to this small alcove without moving the crates to jump across, skipping the weird egg. The little patch of water coming from the crawlspace isn't real water on the N64 version, so this particular method of skipping the Weird Egg only works on 3DS. This skip was not known while making my Any% TAS and ends up saving roughly 30 seconds with additional timesave coming from the owl text skip. Link needs to wait to enter the crawlspace until it becomes day because guards will be blocking the path once inside if it is still night. This movie loads the next area on the frame that it turns day.

	"I was able to manipulate slightly better guard patterns than my Any% TAS which saved a few frames. However, the biggest timesave in this segment is due to skipping the Zelda's Lullaby cutscene. By dying on solid ground on the same frame as entering the cutscene trigger, the cutscene will begin but then will be interrupted by the death cutscene. This still gives Link the song and clears the cutscene. This skip is possible due to a cute easter egg in this area where a guard throws a bomb out of the western window if Link shoots at it with the Slingshot. This is reason for going out of the way early to get the Slingshot. The detour causes it to not save as much time, but I estimate it is still roughly 30-45 seconds. Where this bomb lands is completely random which is why this skip is generally not done in an RTA speedrun. With the randomness in this movie, Link was just barely able to make it to the cutscene trigger before the bomb exploded.

The route is very similar to what would be done in real-time, but the movement is much more challenging, When carrying Princess Ruto around, it is not possible to roll or sidehop, so backwalking is the primary form of movement. However, there are a ton of enemies in this dungeon so preventing Link from targetting these is very difficult. This movie often had to manipulate the camera against walls in such a way that none of the Shaboms (the bubble enemies) were visible. There is also a lot of randomness in how these enemies move. The switch used to open the Boomerang room has a Navi text trigger on top of it that can barely be avoided by landing on the very edge of the switch. However, I accidentally realized that triggering the text on the same frame that the door opening cutscene plays will break out of the cutscene early and saves some time.

	"The wrong warp earlier did not use up the Farore's Wind warp point set previously, therefore it can be used to quickly reach the entrance of the dungeon. This movie then uses the Biri (the jellyfish enemy) to megaflip across the gap, skipping a large portion of the dungeon. The slingshot is used to position the enemy for the megaflip. The blue switch in front of the door normally needs to have a weight placed on it for the door to remain open, but a well timed and spaced roll allows for a 1 frame window to open the door before it closes. A trick Boomerang shot is used to hit a switch in the room before the boss without climbing the wall. A TAS can essentially use gyro aiming to snipe a target in only 1 or 2 frames. Interacting with gyro on Citra is very difficult though as the interface is not easy to work with frame by frame. Much of the gyro aiming used was done by hex editing the values needed. This took a very long time for me to figure out and become efficient with, but it was made a lot easier with my

Finally, the end of the fight is just a matter of chasing Barinade down, using the Boomerang to stun, and dealing damage. The blue warp takes a few seconds to be interactable after the fight. Due to the way this blue warp works, after triggering the warp, it is possible to lose several seconds waiting for Ruto to start talking to Link based on how the camera and Link are positioned. I spent a long time entering the blue warp trying to get a basically instant cutscene start. I'm happy with how fast it ended up being. This cutscene cannot be skipped in the same way that the Deku Tree cutscene can be skipped due to Ruto's text messing with how the warp works, unfortunately.

In the Lost Woods, the owl is skipped once again. Link damages down to 1/2 of a heart using the business scrubs and travels over to the Sacred Forest Meadow. This next sequence is incredibly precise, and it's remarkable that everything here ends up actually working. The Wolfos in this area is used to do a glitch called 
	[a href=https://pastebin.com/nmNF9698 rel=noopener external nofollow 
		"Quick Putaway (QPA)
	]a
	". This glitch involves putting away a Deku Stick while it's in Link's hand the frame that he is damaged. If the broken Deku Stick exploit is then used, the damage value used by the Deku Stick will be glitched to set multiple different damage types. This is because the Deku Stick is immediately put away when it breaks. The game reads the value of the item in Link's hand to determine which damage value should be used, but because Link's hand is empty, it reads garbage data that is interpreted as multiple damage types. One of those damage types that is set is Megaton Hammer damage. So when Link gets QPA, he can then break the Deku Stick on the Wolfos in the middle of the entrance to this area to open a hidden grotto with the hammer damage. It is important to note that jumpslashing the Wolfos back will kill it, but hitting its front will cause it to block which prevent broken Deku Stick from being achieved. It is necessary to contact the Wolfos in a small area on its side in order for this to work.

The game wants to trigger the death animation but it also wants to load the grotto. The game won't do the death animation until Link hits the ground, and the grotto won't load until the death animation is no longer queued to be triggered or a new area attempts to be loaded. The game can be paused to quit out to the title screen while the grotto is still queued up to be loaded. However, the title screen acts like a cutscene, so what ends up happening is a similar situation to the FWWW used early at the Deku Tree blue warp. The game tries to add the value 4 to the area that is loaded, which is supposed to take Link to the title screen, but it instead is trying to take Link to the grotto. So instead of going to the title screen, it sends Link to the grotto and add a value of 4 to that area. This takes Link to a different grotto in this situation upon loading in from quitting the game. Additionally, a game state is triggered known as Attract Mode. This is the mode used when the title screen is active. This mode disables the touch screen, allows Link to use any item in any area, and prevents the game from being paused. The summation of this grotto glitch is known as

For instance, when Link tries to return to the Farore's Wind warp point set earlier (which is easy to use because the DHWW state allows Link to use Farore's Wind anywhere), instead of taking Link back to his house, it adds 4 to that entrance which ends up taking Link to the Hyrule Market Entrance area.

If the game tries to load a room number in a map where that room doesn't exist, the game will crash. The coordinates where Link spawns could also put Link out of bounds when he loads in. In the case of Link's house, the room number works with Hyrule Market Entrance so that the game doesn't crash, but the coordinates would end up putting Link way out of bounds. The box in the image below shows roughly where Link would end up.

	"Things get even more complicated. In the DHWW state, loading zones take a little bit longer than normal to become active upon loading into a new area. This gives Link enough time to enter a loading zone and trigger Farore's Wind as the loading zone becomes active. This technique causes what is commonly known as a void warp. When used in conjunction with DHWW, it is known as a Death Hole Void Warp (DHVW). In this instance, the Farore's Wind Point will take Link to the map where Farore's Wind is set, but with the coordinates and room number that would be used upon exiting the grotto. However, the coordinates that get set when exiting a grotto are determined by the coordinates at which Link enters the grotto. So if Link enters a grotto on the eastern edge of it, he will exit towards the east. Normally this isn't important, but when you look at where the grotto coordinates are when shown on the Hyrule Market Entrance map...

Because of this, if Link initially enters the grotto while dying at exactly the right position on the eastern edge, there is just enough room to have him barely land on solid ground in the Hyrule Market Entrance if a very precise control stick angle is held while he is airborne. I found that there was less than 3 in-game units of leeway for the position to enter the grotto which is very difficult to achieve when the Wolfos is trying to push Link around. For reference, Link travels about 6 in-game units every frame while walking in a straight line.

However, that Farore's Wind warp point is still set because that particular DHVW implementation does not use up the warp point. Because of this, Link can use Farore's Wind in the loading zone for this area to do another type of DHVW which takes him to the map of the loading zone but with the coordinates of Farore's Wind (which are still the coordinates for Link's house). This uses the Farore's Wind point, which would otherwise need to be dispelled anyways, and saves several more seconds by putting Link closer to the next loading zone he will enter.

He then opens the hidden grotto with glitched Megaton Hammer damage by breaking the Deku Stick on the Wolfos during a jumpslash. The Wolfos kills Link in midair just before he enters the grotto at a very precise position on the eastern side of it. Quitting out of the game triggers the DHWW state and loads Link in at the wrong grotto. By returning to the Farore's Wind warp point at the same time that the grotto exit load zone triggers, Link is taken to the map of the Farore's Wind point with the grotto exit coordinates. The DHWW state causes the game to add 4 to warp point which takes Link to the Hyrule Market entrance just barely out of bounds. With a good control stick angle Link can barely land on solid ground. Then Link can do another DHVW in the nearby loading zone to go to the Hyrule Market with more favorable coordinates. This sequence has not been done in an RTA speedrun due to it's difficulty.

A HESS can reach higher speeds than a FESS making them pretty much the fastest form of movement from here on out. Link can also use the Master Sword to immediately blow up a chu as the damage source. Because the BiT file has 50 Bombchus to burn through, HESSing can be done liberally whenever it saves time without really worrying about running out. A hidden grotto is uncovered and Link performs the DHWW glitch once again. After respawning after the game over screen, a new glitch is performed known as Farore's Wind desync. When Farore's Wind gets set, several values are stored such as the map, room number, and coordinates for where the warp point should take Link. When Link is in a grotto, the coordinates get set pretty much instantly. However, the map data for the warp point takes a few frames to update. By dispelling the warp point, resetting it, and then returning to the warp point as fast as possible, Link will get set to the map where the old warp point was set with the coordinates and room number of the new warp point. When in a grotto the coordinates used when setting a warp point are for the last non-grotto entrance. In this case, it is the coordinates for entering Kakariko Village from Hyrule Field. In DHWW mode, a Farore's Wind point from Hyrule Market to Hyrule Market Entrance goes to the Shadow Temple. With the Kakariko Village coordinates, Link is placed just above the loading zone for the Shadow Temple boss room. With precise air movement, Link can reach the loading zone.

The gist of this glitch involves cancelling the the animation of the Hookshot connecting with a surface that it can pull Link towards. When this happens, Link still gets the vertical velocity that the Hookshot would have given him when pulling him towards the surface, but the game will no longer stop him when he reaches the end of the where the chain should be, so he keeps going up. There are several ways to cancel the Hookshot animation such as cutscenes, dying, or by overriding them with another animation. In the 3DS version of this game, the Hover Boots and Iron Boots were changed to be inventory items as opposed to gear items, allowing them to be equippable to the X, Y, I, and II buttons. Along with this change, an animation for butting on and taking off the boots was added. This animation can be used to cancel the Hookshot animation and travel upwards at high speeds.

I then discovered that a Giant's Knife spin attack had enough range to deal damage without stalling the boss. After clipping, Link can perform a jumpslash while out of bounds and still land the hit.

Odds are it would end up saving less than like 2 seconds if it did end saving any time at all.

	"As is becoming routine for me, I keep my TAS projects a secret, only telling a few friends until I'm ready to release them. This time around I told no one. Because of this, I find it very important to take inspiration from every bit of Ocarina of Time TASing I can get my hands on. Specifically, I frequently referenced 
	[a href=https://tasvideos.org/8036S rel=noopener external nofollow 
		"SwordlessLink's Glitchless

	" movie and 
	[a href=https://tasvideos.org/8662S rel=noopener external nofollow 
		"homerfunky's All Dungeons, Temples, & Ganon's Trials
	]a
	" movie, which were both submitted and published roughly within the last 2 years. I believe that these movies are both very high quality and were great assets during this project.

During the making of this movie, I would occasionally ask sneaky, vague questions in the Ocarina of Time 3D Discord server, only to realize that Freddy had already answered the question months prior. He also unknowingly helped me save a lot of time in this movie in various places.

This is much faster than the already fast RTA WR All Dungeons with the time saves possible with tasing that bests it by over 15 minutes.  While the author mentions that there could be some minor improvements this tas definitely passes the bar for optimization.

	"Note: I had trouble getting this to run with Citra Nightly 1815,  benstephens56 noted to use a newer version of Citra to be able to right click the game title in Citra, then Disk Shader Cache -> Delete. This somehow fixes that crashing on trying to open the game. I was still having trouble running the movie since it kept getting stuck on the name entry screen, but after deleting the savegame (which the submission notes), and also closing the newer version of Citra, the tas movie was able to play to the end.
