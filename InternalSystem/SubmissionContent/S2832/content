	"There is a bug when coming out of the mini-game.  During the mini-game you will eventually tap the real mysterio.  When this happens, rapidly tap the Y button.  If the timing is correct, he will not reappear in the fight.  He will be frozen and invisible for the rest of the fight.  This allows for Spiderman to laydown a brutal (and unfair!) beating on his frozen, invisible self.  I found this trick in a FAQ on GameFAQs.
