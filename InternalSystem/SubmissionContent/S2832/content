	" fast paced 3Dish-2D platformer for Nintendo DS.  I picked this game to TAS because it was fast, had a large variety of movies, and a ton of amazing abilities that can be exploited with the variety of web slinging Spiderman can do.

	"There is a bug when coming out of the mini-game.  During the mini-game you will eventually tap the real mysterio.  When this happens, rapidly tap the Y button.  If the timing is correct, he will not reappear in the fight.  He will be frozen and invisible for the rest of the fight.  This allows for Spiderman to laydown a brutal (and unfair!) beating on his frozen, invisible self.  I found this trick in a FAQ on GameFAQs.
