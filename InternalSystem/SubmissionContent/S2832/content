	"Spider-man 2 is a 
	[b 
		"very

	" fast paced 3Dish-2D platformer for Nintendo DS.  I picked this game to TAS because it was fast, had a large variety of movies, and a ton of amazing abilities that can be exploited with the variety of web slinging Spiderman can do.

	$LF

[p 
	"There is a bug when coming out of the mini-game.  During the mini-game you will eventually tap the real mysterio.  When this happens, rapidly tap the Y button.  If the timing is correct, he will not reappear in the fight.  He will be frozen and invisible for the rest of the fight.  This allows for Spiderman to laydown a brutal (and unfair!) beating on his frozen, invisible self.  I found this trick in a FAQ on GameFAQs.

	" Faster beginning of web slinging

	"When standing still and using a web sling, it is slightly faster to jump for one frame and then sling in order to avoid the slinging animation.  This was discovered by SonikKustar

	" High Speed Corner Bounce
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Meh, I need a better name for this.  If you do a diagonal websling into a precise part of a corner of a ceiling, spiderman will hit his head but then counter to accelerate up after the corner.  This is used to avoid grabbing some platforms and jumping on to them.

	"If you stay too close to him when he turns around, the game will go into the mini-game (thus costing a whole lot of time).  This is why I sling far away from him and then return.
