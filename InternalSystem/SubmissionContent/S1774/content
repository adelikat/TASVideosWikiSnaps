	"In 1 player mode, a single controller controls both characters but only 1 at a time.  The player can freely alternate between the two and the CPU takes control of the other character.  The CPU player is immune to damage which is an advantage.  In the published movie, this it taken advantage of to avoid damage by rapidly changing characters.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In 2 player mode, you can control each character simultaneously.  The immunity trick can not be used and both are always vulnerable.  As a result I have to take more damage and stop more to take care of enemies.  But there is a huge advantage with 2 player mode because I can coordinate the 2 characters better.  Once can pick up an item while the other heads for an exit, for instance.  This also gives me the chance to perform antics with a player while another is doing an action; increasing the overall entertainment value.

[p 
	"Overall, the change results  in most of the 47 second improvement.
