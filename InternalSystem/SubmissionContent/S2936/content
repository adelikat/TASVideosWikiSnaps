	" on my sourceforge project.  It includes the movie file, submission text, Lua script, and spreadsheets.  I highly recommend using the PunchoutStats.lua script if watching it in an emulator.  It shows all the damage, health, and timers which makes it clearer what is going on.

				" Improveed phase 1 by 2 frames, but it wasn't enough to improve the clock time.  But it was enough to beat the 16 frame rule that is on all fights, so it was a 16 frame real time improvement

				" Managed to improve the clock time!  It came from better luck manipulation at the beginning of each phase in order to throw the first blocked punch as sooner.  This is a really random game!

		" Bald Bull
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" Improved by 2 frames but not enough to improve the clock time or beat the frame rule.  I've known about these 2 frames since 05 but never had a reason to fix since it doesn't improve anything.

		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" Improved the clock time from 58.61 to 58.00!  There were 2 minor strat improvements here.  First is to not throw a punch after dodging his first hook.  It is 6 clock frames faster to just wait instead.  Another frame came from a strat change in phase 2 that involved getting another random star.  So this strat is now even more random than before.
