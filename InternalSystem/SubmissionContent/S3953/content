		" Frogger can hop onto the extreme edge of any tile with precise positioning via moving platforms. This is why it looks like he's standing on water in some levels (like World 1-5), though the game considers him basically on that lilypad. The game doesn't actually allow hopping on water (or through cars or snakes) because the game checks if Frogger should die the same frame he can start a new hop.

				" If Frogger hops onto the edge of a tile of non-moving ground, he will only take 2-7 frames to realign himself on the tile. While he doesn't look like he's even moving, he can move as much as 14 pixels (7/8 of a tile) in 3 frames this way. This can sometimes be helpful, though when moving back onto grass or brick, it saves time to be properly aligned on a tile.
