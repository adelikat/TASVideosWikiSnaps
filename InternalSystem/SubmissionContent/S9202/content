	"This game is a pain to sync. Even if you think you're doing well, it will desync if you're not careful. I believe the issue is the movie alternating between key pressed / not pressed at every frame. This can saturate the system's buffer or even go out of phase when doing the playback. For the next movie, I'd recommend holding inputs for a few solid frames instead of alternating so quickly.
