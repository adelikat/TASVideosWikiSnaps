	"This level is pretty much identical to the previous TAS up until the very last part, other than optimization. It actually ties the amount of lag to kill the enemies, so I don't lose time by not killing all of them. I save a few seconds by not dying, and going to the very left and zipping down to the start of the stage and exiting from there.

	"The first section is all optimization improvements. The second section takes a whole new route, by going right and zipping down twice directly to the boss room, and then reloading it by leaving. This saves a few seconds. In the first part of the boss fight, I manage to one cycle it instead of two, by closely monitoring the health of the boss.

	"This level is the most changed compared to the previous take on it. I zip at the end of the first room, which if carefully guided using frame precision, makes me end up in the room after the Matic fight! I skip the entire level and the Matic fight, which is harder than the final one. On the last hit of the boss, I save a few frames by slashing instead of holding up, which allows me to end the movie a few frames earlier.
