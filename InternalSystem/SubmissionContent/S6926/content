	"Bugz (circa 1977-1999) was a famous rap artist that starred in the group D12 (aka Dirty Dozen). After an intense water gun fight, Bugz was hit by an SUV. I don't know why someone brought an SUV to a water gun fight, but clearly there's no way you can lose by doing so, as long as you spraypaint "NERF Subocean Underwater Vehicle" on the side. 16 years later, ArtcFox decided to pay tribute to this tragedy and created Bugz for the Uzebox (of course exercising a few artistic liberties). You can re-live the rough and tumble lifestyle of this troubled man by squishing bugs (not Bugz, as he was already squished by the SUV) and collecting cookies throughout 21 unique levels.

Pressing any direction while in the wall will eject you back to the 128 position. BUT, if the wall you're clipping into is only 1 block high, and you're over halfway up, AND your vertical momentum is 0, then pressing any direction will eject you to the top of that block. This usually takes a couple frames to set up correctly, and your x-speed is 0 afterwards. It's only useful when you can't jump to a certain ledge normally.
