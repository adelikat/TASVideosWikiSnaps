	"Columns is a Tetris based game, that, instead of having pieces forming several shapes, the player controls 3 jewels above each other, and to make the jewels on the filed disappear, 3 or more of the same color must be lined up horizontally, vertically or diagonally. In Flash Columns, the player must delete the flashing piece.
