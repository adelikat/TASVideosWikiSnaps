[p 
	"Nothing major here.  The sewers portion in this game is normally shrouded in darkness; making it a bit of a pain to see what's going on and requiring use of a Bulb in order to light it up (you gotta use a new one each time you enter).  Since about 1/3rd of the game is spent crawling around down here, I went ahead and accessed my inventory a couple of times, during the course of the run, in order to light most of these areas up for better viewing enjoyment. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In total, these tradeoffs cost approximately 121 frames. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"With that stated, some areas I simply didn't have an available Bulb handy to light up.  Item RNG in this game can be time-consuming, so I compromised here and spaced out which areas I choose to light and which ones I decided to leave dark.  For the most part, the dark areas are very brief while I choose to light up the ones which were longest.  Hopefully this provides an interesting contrast between the two.

[h2 
	" Explanation for foregoing a time-saving glitch
	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"There's a bizarre glitch which allows you to, basically, instant-win every boss battle in the game.  As I understand it, it requires having at least one Key in your inventory (in which you should have highlighted).  During a boss fight, if you rapidly press down+left across the room while mashing the 'B' button, this causes the screen to briefly go haywire as the game proceeds to also give you a set of Invisibility Potions (normally only obtainable in the overworld by visiting fellow Addams Family member Thing).  Here's a video demonstration made by fellow TASVideos member

]p
[p 
	"I decided against using this glitch, mainly, due to me seeing it as quite redundant from an entertainment perspective (I find it rather cheap to use, as well).  I believe it's far more entertaining to see boss fights in this game quickly beaten due to figuring out the best optimized strategy over spamming a glitch in every boss fight.  
	$LF

[p 
	"That's my justification for foregoing it.  I hope the effort made in optimizing the boss battles outshines this alternative.

	$LF

[p 
	"Right off the bat, I waste no time trying to grind additional items and weapon levels.  Since I'm doing any%, most of what I need will naturally drop for me over the course of the run (with a slight exception, later on).  While traveling south along the road, I've got to move very slightly over to the right a few times due to the globs generating a bit outside of my current weapon's attack range.  This changes as soon as I quickly upgrade to gun level 3 (Crescent Wave; 2 dmg/shot).  Before dropping down into my first trek through the sewers, I obtain the Dynamite from fellow Addams Family member Pugsley.  This item has essential use early on against the first two bosses.  Upon detonation (either via contact or timer), it causes 1 dmg/per frame for 30 frames.  In conjunction with firing a weapon with frame advance, this can cause MAJOR damage in a very short period of time. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I chose to light up the dungeon in here due to it being one of the longest in the game (and being the very first one, as well).  In terms of annoyance, the green blobs found down here are one of the game's biggest annoyances.  They have a massively high chance of duplicating upon being shot, and can take very many of them before finally being destroyed.  They do have a nice side-effect of being able to generate many items at once though, which I take advantage of often to stock up on supplies/weapon upgrades.  About halfway through, I'm forced to take damage from an orange Mutant Frog in order to quickly advance.  Enemy manipulation in this game was challenging, in spots, due to trying to get favorable enemy spawn points (and to compensate for my, often, limited attack range, as well).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Toward the end, I generate one last blob in order to upgrade to the level 5 gun (Cannonball Shot; 3 dmg/shot).  This gun will get through a bit over half of the game, as it does very nice damage per attack.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Towards the end in this section, I had the challenge of maneuvering past a green blob that was blocking the corridor giving access to the end of the dungeon.  I wasn't successful in getting it to not generate (and I had already taken my only free hit prior), so I eventually uncovered a clever solution of shooting it down while rapidly moving up+left away from it.  This allowed me to BARELY (and I'm talking one frame here!) slip by it without losing time or taking damage.

Here, I squeezed up just close enough to Crab Arms in order for the dynamite to fully detonate on him on every stick used, while blasting away at him with my gun.  This caused his 6 HP bars (x127/RAM Watch) to diminish extremely rapidly!

	"A succession of green blobs were generated early on to obtain more items and upgrade to gun level 6.  The damage level remains the same, and the gun now has a larger (i.e. more annoying) circular attack range.  However, it also leaves me one step closer to obtaining level 7 (Pyramid Beam; 4 dmg/shot) upgrade.
	$LF

[p 
	"On the overworld again, as I navigate upward and across the highway I decided to generate a rather rare giant tarantula monster.  This thing has a LOT of HP, so I don't bother directly engaging with it.  I found it to be more entertaining to generate it here (and spent 1 frame shooting at it, making it steaming mad!), as I continue onward underground.

	""Solving the puzzle" on this one initially took me a while to figure out.  With alternating cracking whips in either of its hands, I had a very limited range where I could place Dynamite.  Since my gun shoots out projectiles from only the left side, I also had to dealt with it having brief invincibility when striking with its right hand.  The optimized strategy I found here was to immediately lure it toward the bottom of the screen, setting Dynamite directly in its way the entire time (as well as spraying it with my weapon).  Once along the bottom, I was able to maintain an easy patter where Tricera-Whips would back away from me (when I approached) and then pursue (as I laid a booby trap for him to collide with).

[p 
	"Once back above ground, I go visit Morticia to grab THE most important sub-weapon in the game: Missiles.  These bad boys, on every use, fire off 6 heat-seeking retorts that damage struck foes for around 63 1/2 HP, each!  Specifically, when viewed in RAM Watch, when enemies (such as bosses) have a very large life bar, this weapon will damage for it down (rounded) to either 64 or 127.  So for instance, say a fired missile at a boss lands twice.  You'll see its HP bar register '64' and then '127'.  All in all, this sub-weapon is essential in defeating certain bosses in any short amount of time!

This boss wields a giant handheld shield that negates all damage, with the exception of dynamite, until he briefly exposes himself to strike with his sword (which emits thunderbolts in a three-way direction).  And unlike Tricera-Whips, he can't be baited into following you close enough for successful dynamite blasts, either.  The quickest solution I found here was to:

Its also impervious to dynamite, as well.  After approaching dead ends for those options, I uncovered that the fastest strategy in winning here was to simply spam, spam, spam missiles!  I had to move around the screen quite a bit to generate the fastest landed strikes (about 2 landed shots/per 100 frames).  But overall, I'm very satisfied with how quickly the final result turned out (I did 4 passes, total, on this one getting it optimized).

	"Finally: No shield and no tricky invulnerability periods!  Despite having access to the missiles, the quickest solution here was to simply get in its face and pump 'em full of lead (...or pyramids?).  It also has the HIGHEST HP of all boss monsters in the game (19x127!) so having the strongest gun here was essential.

[p 
	"Strategy wise, I had to figure out the fastest way to evade its primary attacks while maintaining a near constant stream of fire on it.  Around every 2 1/2 seconds, it emits a large fireball down the center, followed by a very quick three-way spread of bullets.  After emitting the fireball, I had to quickly move Fester out of the way toward the right, while moving back to position in time in order to slip around the bullets and continue firing.  It took a couple of passes to figure out, but I'd say overall this was slightly easier than figuring out Boss #4.

The green blobs have evolved into a more spiked variety.  Fortunately though, I upgrade to the max level gun (same power, but faster and with better range) which makes handling them now trivial.
