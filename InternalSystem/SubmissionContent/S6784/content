	"In this epic RPG, you have to fight an evil religion that tries to take over the world. But during this takeover, they apparently affected shops. Using a newly found glitch, Janus was able to make the run nearly 12k frames shorter (including the lag from BizHawk) from his normal run.

	"After re-working my PSIV runs, I wanted to look again at my old runs to see if they could be improved. In 2017, a Youtube/Twitch user found a glitch that happens when you try to switch weapons in any armory. First, you need an accessory (that you equip in your etc.) at the very first slot of your item inventory. Then, go to a weapon shop and switch Ryu's weapon - it's doable on a regular console, but emulators make your life much simpler. When you get to the screen where you can switch said weapon, press A and then B for the very next frame. This will bug the game into believing (in Hometown when you first start) that you want to switch the Nature Whip, which is worth 40k. You can do this A/B trick for as much money as you want (I think the limit is 12M).

	"But what's more, you can give glitched weapons to the members of your party! If the accessory you have in your list can be bought in groups of 9 (think fishing baits), pressing left or right on the glitched screen can give them an "item" weapon. You can give them one of 9 different weapons, depending on the number of accessories you want to exchange. I used 6 (the moondrop), which makes whoever has it "equiped" attack twice in a row. 4 would equip the van. ext., which I believe also makes the attacker attack twice in a row; other weapons may have elemental properties but they would only attack once. But that glitch equipment only works for people NOT in your party, starting at the 5th slot. So when starting the game, you can only do it for Nina (when Ryu leads the party) and Sten (when Ryu is #2 in the roster). If you want to equip other members, they need to be between the 5th and 8th slots of your party (with Ryu being between slots 1 and 4); the Hex editor can shop you the exact order of your party.

	"One more thing: to effectively activate the glitch, you either need the attacker to equip something defensive (works inside a battle) or win a battle with their new weapon.
