	": The system bus memory address for the current level is $85 and it increments every level. Loop 1 is 0xA0 through 0xAF, loop 2 is 0xB0 through 0xBF. Then it resets to 0xB0, which means loop 2 repeats forever. If you set $85 to any of those values it forces the level layout that corresponds to that number, including the difficulty. And yes, loop 2 is more difficult, even though in later levels it might be similar. Since the game is coded to stop changing after the second loop, I'm accepting this movie to obsolete
