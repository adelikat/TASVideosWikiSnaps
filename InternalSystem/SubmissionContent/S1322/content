	"My second speedrun.  I played the heck out of this game when it was out, and it is probably my favorite beat-'em-up Ninja Turtles game.  Unfortunately, unlike TMNT2, there are not many programming bugs that can be exploited for quicker speed, and the Foot soldiers are harder to hit (they have ridiculous invulnerability frames, particularly during their jumpkicks).  However, it's still a fairly quick playthrough, and entertaining to watch.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"There's certainly room for improvement, as I sometimes delay my movement and attacks intentionally to get the Foot to come out in better locations.  I also use Raphael for the majority of the run, who has both the quickest and weakest special attack.  The speed of his drill makes it quick to get from place to place during the enemy waves, but certainly slows down the boss fights.

]div
[div class=p 
	"When possible, I try to throw Foot soldiers instead of drilling them.  Drilling bounces the body very high, and results in a slower death.  However, sometimes the recovery time and mobility of the drill makes it worth it to use where a throw would also be possible.

	"If you damage an enemy in this game without killing them, they have ~15 frames of invulnerability time after their reel animation; so, with enemy waves, you generally want to kill them in one hit if you can.  This rule applies to bosses as well; however, if they don't go into their reel animation, you can hit them again quicker.

However, he's more than happy to begin the spin just after you hit him, which makes him invulnerable for the whole thing anyway.  In the last part of the fight, I'm forced to jump kick away, wait and drill since he goes tailspin happy when he's almost dead.

Because most bosses don't give me a convenient way to die before the fight and dying takes so long, I can only do this in a timely fashion on Krang, who takes forever to come out.

[div class=p 
	"Krang was an interesting boss to fight.  There are two notable things about him.  When he separates into two different parts, only his top part is vulnerable to damage, and when they recombine, Krang is invulnerable until he stops flexing.  Also, Krang has a shock attack that he can use to negate damage, which sometimes keeps me from double-hitting with Mike's kangaroo kick.  (On a side note, I hit Krang three times with one kangaroo kick once, something I couldn't replicate with the next boss.)

He often gets hit twice by the kangaroo kick, and I gun to do this every time, although there are times when I have to let it hit once, or he'll be able to attack me when I land.  I also intentionally miss a jump kick once to get him to teleport away from the corner.  The fight's also notable because he never once does his lightning attack, which is kind of a shame since he has autoguard for days on that.
