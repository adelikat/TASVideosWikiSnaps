	"Using this method effectively usually involves taking a line that's slightly curved, due to the fact that going in a direct line usually does not give the fastest speed, especially when going directly upward.

	"The game's physics tends to move DK closer to cardinal directions while doing this strategy, which may result in forgoing speedgrinding being faster when diagonal movement is involved.

	"If speedgrinding is done over a long distance, the optimal angle to use may change, due to how the game handles rotation.
