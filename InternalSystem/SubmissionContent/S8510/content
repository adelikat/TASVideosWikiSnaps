This homebrew is very much a take on what the original NES Metroid would be like on the Atari 2600 with the limitations therein. -Darkman425

Much of my time was spent removing items to see how much time was cut at the end. I eventually ended off seeing the big picture and starting over from scratch with the bare minimum to perform a "Low %" run. I quickly realized that I needed to collect items that were "On-The-Way", to be as effective as possible. The following items were in the vicinity and helped to make an any% (33% items):

	"During my analysis of this game, I was noticing that jumping was being affected when hitting the edges of a floor from the edge near the bottom. Because of this, I started using it to interrupt my jump so that I could land earlier and continue my progression without the long wait in the air. Well, I did this a number of times in various places and one attempt got me lodged in the floor. At that point, I noticed you can do a 50% duty cycle jump and continue upwards...as long as the floor had another block above where you stood. After I made this discovery, I talked with Darkman and he mentioned that a map existed of the game. I used it to figure out places that would benefit from this glitch and continued cutting large chunks of frames, bypassing lots of rooms towards my next destination.

[div class=p 
	"At the beginning of the game, there is a missile to the left. Trying to execute this glitch early failed...probably because of the added abilities of the "Hi Jumps" boots, which probably has the upward acceleration to skip detection and cause this to happen in the first place. If this is not the case, then it might still be possible to perform this early missile grab and cuts another huge chunk of frames.
