	"Gangplank Galleon: Used warp-barrel in every stage. At the boss I locked the screen so that the boss would throw the egg earlier.

	"Crocodile Cauldron: Same as Gangplank, warp-barrel in every stage. At the boss I used Dixie so that I could hit the boss faster.

	"Krazy Kremland: In the 4th level I took + barrel which speeded things up. In the end of 5th level I had to do a slight turn so that I could get the barrel shot by enemy to dissapear faster so I could finish faster. In level 6 I used a shortcut.

	"Gloomy Gulch: In level 4 didn't use any parrots, that's why I had to take a hit at the end. I used a little glitch in 5th level, I took damage from enemy so I could jump again from air.

	"K.Rool's Keep: All 3 castle levels desynced A LOT! Don't know what caused it. I abused a glitch in level 3 and got myself in the wall :D In 5th level climbing caused lot of problems becasue of desync. I could only advance small sections.

	"The Flying Krock: Nothing special here. Bees turned up from nowhere because of a glitch. I used flying enemy for my advantage in the rope section. Nothing special at the boss, I only did some funny tricks there.
