	"This run takes Arcs route because it is the fastest one at the moment.  I tried some damage boosts on places but no luck.  Enjoy!

	"On stage 2 I dont wait for the elevators, I merely let them go off screen for a split second then they go back down.
	$LF

	"The next noticable differance is on stage 4, I take damage on the dragon and kill it at the same time rather than let him float around and take charge.

	"On the 2nd quest, I pick up the dagger to throw faster, the Javelin takes too long to throw 2 at a time.

[p 
	"The 3rd stage on the 2nd quest is done extremely faster than the 2nd because of the dagger and also the enemy stays low to the ground to kill easy.

	"The rest is pretty much the same as the 1st quest except for boss movements because they are technically "advanced"

	" Good improvement over a famtasia run.  (How often is a run obsoleted by another run almost twice its length?)
