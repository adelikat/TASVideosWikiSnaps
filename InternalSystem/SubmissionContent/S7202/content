	"Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee is a 2D side scrolling platform game released in 1997 for the PS1 and PC. This movie beats the previous movie by 4 seconds (294 frames faster when the movie file is replaced) thanks to some new strats in the Zulags and time saves in the Monsaic Lines.

	"Often abbreviated as DDG it makes Abe invisible and can corrupt his sprite and eventually become invisible at some point allowing him to get past things that would kill him. Abe will die if he falls of a ledge or gets zapped. A video made by Sligfantry can show you how this glitch works:

[div class=p

[div class=p 
	"By timing this glitch perfectly you can make Abe stop and turn. To set it up, Abe needs to be standing near a ledge (pressing up whilst tunring arround) you will be able to make Abe do a backwards jump. Notice that when you press the opposite direction to where Abe is standing at the incorrect frame, Abe will just jump up and stand. But if you time it perfectly, Abe will jump backwards and possibly jump to another screen. This will allow you to jump backwards to areas and skip Zulags. In a 100% run it will allow you to get to secret areas quicker and it skips a section of StockYards Escape after finishing the secret area. Sligfantry's video can show you how this glitch works:
