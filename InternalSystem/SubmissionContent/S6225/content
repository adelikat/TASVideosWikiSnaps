	"Mari0 is a PC game developed by Maurice of 
	[a class=extlink href=http://stabyourself.net/ rel=nofollow 
		"stabyourself.net
	]a
	" in 2012 that combines the classic Super Mario Bros. with the puzzle-platfomer Portal by giving Mario a portal gun. The game launched with 2 "mappacks", with the one most people played being the Super Mario Bros. mappack containing the original set of levels. This TAS instead showcases the other mappack which features 18 Portal-inspired puzzles spread across 9 different levels, along with the multiplayer mode which saves 10.3 seconds compared to singleplayer.

	"This is where the speed/entertainment trade off comes in, but not how you might expect. It would be optimal to skip rebinding player one's controls, as this would still provide the further-right spawning point of player four, but without the few extra frames setting up controls for use in libTAS, as player one is not used to solve any puzzles faster. However, I didn't think this would be as fun and instead chose to use all four players.

For the last puzzle, a cube is stolen through the previous room by dropping the cube on one of the few frames before it gets disintegrated by the emancipation grill, which is faster in multiplayer thanks to the quicker grabbing of the cube and the lack of lost speed from dropping the cube in front of the player.

	"Subjectively, the difference in challenge is hard to spot due to how fast-paced the game is, and how short the levels are. It just flashes by and then you're watching the fanfare. Actual difference can only be spotted if you know the game well, or if you watch the movies side by side in slow motion. To an untrained eye this movie just feels generally superior.
