	"Stage parts: where have stones dropped, to get the clock timing save time (except for before have high HP enemies), where can save time by reducing HP (such as saws)then get heart restore HP to save time. When driving in the corner place jump can save time. Attack will increases a frame, so as far as possible attack and attack in the jump. Jump speed will change walk-speed go to half, so when necessary jump jump distance as possible.

	"Boss parts: Attack the boss efficiency depends on the attack rate of the protagonist, lateral attack once every 28 frames, vertical attack every 48 frames, but continuous vertical attack time can adjust the jumping into 29 ~ 31 frame at a time. Blue and green damage is one, yellow and red damage is two. Change to red attack just to get a better Angle. If the soccer movement distance is long, there will have more lags, so every boss has a corresponding strategy.
