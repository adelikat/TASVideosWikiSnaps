	"I'm very glad we could finish this run much faster than I had hoped. After submitting the warped run, things that at the first glance looked really dark started to lighten up because of a strategy that didn't force us to redo the same level 50 times in order to find the best solution for the previous strategy. So much effort was put into this, and of course the rerecord count here is far from right as an uncountable amount of movie files starting from scratch were created during the process.

	"I had fun experimenting and finding new tricks for this. Some tricks I found while playing in real-time helped me discover various things for 1-3 and some other levels. This run is extremely hard to optimize, but I'd say Aglar and I, (aglar especially) did a great job in optimizing. Towards the end of the run, I was just out of ideas. Luckily, aglar came to the rescue in some cases to make world 5 really cool. :)
