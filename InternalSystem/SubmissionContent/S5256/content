[p 
	"Web swinging, unlike many other 3D Spider-Man games, is based entirely on what object Spidey is swinging towards. For example, if the distance between you and the object is far, Spidey will do a slow, long swing to get you there. If it's medium distance, Spidey will do one fast swing, and so on.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Optimizing web swinging is all about finding the magical object that Spidey will fast swing towards.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Another aspect of web swinging is a 'web zip', which is where Spidey shoots a line forwards and launches to that point. It's very fast, but it only works in special situations, such as being in tunnels or on the ground.

[p 
	"Spidey has four different web abilities that can be done by picking a direction on the C-Stick.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The first is web gloves, which greatly boosts Spidey's punching abilities. They always last for 5 punches, no matter where they're used in a combo. Used for every boss fight. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The second is Impact Webs, which lets Spidey shoot a ball of web at an enemy. It's quite similar to normal webbing, except it deals damage and also takes time to reach its target. Used in a few situations where I need to travel immediately or to deal with multiple targets at once.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The third is the Web Dome, which protects Spidey in a dome of webbing that explodes after a certain amount of time or when a button is pressed. Unlike the previous TAS, this is used extensively.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"You see, whenever Spidey falls off a ledge, he has 2 frames to do any ground move he wants before the game puts him in an 'air' state.  If Spidey uses Web Dome during that time, the game will rocket him upwards. This is used to speed up long climbing sections, and also to pull off some unique skips.
