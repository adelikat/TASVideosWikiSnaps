	"Undertale is a 2D role-playing video game created by indie developer Toby Fox. Undertale has three main endings: Neutral, True Pacifist, and Genocide. This TAS achieves the Neutral ending, which is the shortest of the main endings and is considered the standard ending to the game. In this ending, the player must defeat Photoshop Flowey and leave the underground. The TAS is optimized for Z/Enter presses and then time.

	"The idea behind the Z Button Challenge may be familiar to many due to Super Mario 64's infamous "A Button Challenge". These kinds of challenges simply involve completing the game while avoiding using a certain controller element as much as possible. In the case of this TAS, said controller element is the Z/Enter buttons. These 2 buttons have the same function, which is moving forwards in menus and advancing textboxes. Because the 2 buttons do the same thing, they will henceforth be referred to as just the Z button or Z press. The Z button is the most important button in the game, along with the arrow keys.

[div class=p 
	"First, it's important to accurately define a Z press and the concept of half Z presses. A Z press has three parts to it: when Z is pressed, when Z is held, and when Z is released, and together, this forms one complete Z press. Usually, it's the pressing that's useful, because that's the only part that advances textboxes and menus. However, sometimes it's sufficient to just use the holding part (the "half Z press"), which allows us to close the "You Won" or "But nobody came" text at the end of battles. Now if we map out the required Z presses to kill a one-hit enemy, it would look like this: We need to press Z to advance to the monster select menu, we need to press Z again to start the attack, we need to press Z again to attack, and we merely need to hold Z to close the "You Won" text. So, how many Z presses is that total? The naïve answer would be four, three to kill the enemy and one to close the "You Won" text. However, we can do better. We can actually do it in three by simply holding out the third Z press to be used for the half Z press, because the half Z press only requires Z to be held, not actually pressed. In this fashion, closing the "You Won" text doesn't add any additional Z presses to the run, since the final Z press just leeches off of a previous Z press. So in conclusion, since that last Z press counts in some contexts but adds no additional Z presses in other contexts, we refer to it as a half Z press.

The run involves following the Genocide Route for most of the run, killing a certain number of enemies in each area and afterwards killing the final boss. Then Genocide gets aborted in Hotland by not fulfilling the kill requirements and thus a Neutral ending follows instead of the Genocide ending.

	"Wall humping is a movement technique where the player oscillates between facing up and facing down each frame. This technique is performed by holding Up and Down simultaneously while against the bottom side of a wall. This can be useful in certain circumstances such as when you are moving left or right but need to be facing up or down. In rooms where the player is in contact with and between two horizontal walls, this technique will cause the player to move at double speed, as the two walls both move the player simultaneously.

	"In Undertale speedrunning, wrong warping refers to entering a room and being placed at the default location in that room rather than the door the player entered from. When the player touches a room transition, the variable global.interact is normally set to 3. Then once the player reaches the next room, the game checks if global.interact is set to 3 and if it is, the game runs the code that places the player at the appropriate door marker. However, if global.interact is not 3, the player is not moved from the default location in the room. This default location is manually assigned per room by the game developer and is often closer to the middle of the room than the door marker is. There are several methods of triggering a wrong warp, all of which achieve the same result: setting global.interact to 0 (the value for full player control) while transitioning to the next room.

	"Text corruption is a glitch which allows changing cutscene text in some, but not all cutscenes that have multiple sets of textboxes. Certain text boxes, such as dropping an item, use a variable called global.msc. When a textbox is created, the object creating the textbox assigns a value to global.msc, which is then used to lookup which set of text to display. By creating such a textbox between the cutscene's sets of textboxes, global.msc is changed to something unexpected, and so the following sets of textboxes will display the textbox that corresponds to the current global.msc value instead of the cutscene text that is meant to play. This glitch is used in the lab cutscene to shorten Mettaton's second set of text.

	" RNG Manipulation
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"Undertale's RNG is determined by a seed that advances each time RNG is called. By calling RNG a different number of times, different outcomes can be achieved. Text calls RNG twice per character per frame and so changing how many frames text is displayed is the most common method of RNG manipulation. RNG is manipulated for various reasons such as getting particular monsters in random encounters and determining which step count random encounters will occur on. One thing to note is that the function randomize() is called upon loading into the game and this function sets the RNG seed based on the system time. However, after this initial seed, RNG is no longer affected by system time until the save file is reloaded or the game is restarted. RNG manipulation is used throughout the run and for the most part this is accomplished by delaying clearing text by anywhere between 1 and about 25 frames. Usually, the unlikelier an event is, the more frames it costs to manipulate RNG. While this does lose a small amount of time each time it's done, the various timesaves afforded by manipulating RNG more than make up for the few frames lost in the process.

	"Ruins is the first section of the game. We begin with the first Flowey encounter where the speed of the friendliness pellet is RNG manipulated to be as fast as possible. A few rooms later, the first glitch in the run is performed. By interacting with the sign next to the door and entering the door at the same time, global.interact is set to 3 by the door, then to 1 by the sign, causing a wrongwarp. Doing so allows hitting the second switch without hitting the first switch, saving a Z press. Additionally, doing the room in the wrong order this way messes with the cutscene since Toriel is still waiting for you to hit the first switch, meaning you're unable to progress. Fortunately, hitting the switch updates the game's plot value, which tracks how far you've progressed through the game. Most cutscenes destroy themselves upon entering the room if the plot value is too high, so leaving and reentering the room will cause the cutscene to despawn. This also skips the extra dialogue at the end of the room, saving more Z presses. A few more rooms later, we run into First Froggit. It allows you to get LV 2 and increase your ATK/HP/EXP stats, but there is an issue. The game doesn't consider this a kill for the purpose of the Ruins kill counter, which means that you can choose to flee instead. Killing costs 1 extra Z press over fleeing, but the extra EXP gained from killing it is useful later, so First Froggit dies despite not counting as a kill.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The kill requirement for the Ruins is 20, so we kill 20 Whimsuns, as it is the only 1-shot enemy in the Ruins. 1-shot enemies are good because they can be killed in 3 Z presses each, which is the minimum. Switching rooms after every kill causes the step count required to get an encounter to be much lower. Reading a sign in the room with the 20th kill skips the third phone call event. After 20 kills, we advance through the rest of the Ruins, holding Z for long periods of time to avoid additional Z presses exiting "But nobody came" encounters. For some of the "But nobody came" encounters, skipping it via menu-buffering is slightly faster than sitting through it.

Snowdrake is also a required kill, but the game counts him. Lesser Dog is technically not a required kill, but sparing or fleeing from him will set a flag that aborts Genocide. If however Lesser Dog is never encountered, Genocide is not aborted. This detail is abused near the beginning of the grind, where by leaving the room on the frame the exclamation mark appears over the player's head, the encounter is skipped entirely. This saves 3 Z presses because Lesser Dog takes two turns to kill instead of one.

	"Directly after Lesser Dog Skip, we trigger the second Sans/Papyrus cutscene on the same frame as an encounter, causing both to start at the same time. Doing this allows the player to skip some text and retain movement during the cutscene after killing Ice Cap. An invisible wall blocks you from getting close to Sans and Papyrus, whilst going back to the previous room resets the cutscene, so the best strategy is to progress the step counter to get more kills, even though grinding in this manner without switching rooms is usually sub-optimal. By getting an encounter while the second set of text is starting, you can regain movement afterwards again, since that set of text usually locks movement.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"The rest of the grind is spent in the first few rooms, killing Ice Cap every time due to being the only 1-shot enemy. Once we get to 9 kills, switching rooms to reduce the step count becomes slower with best-case RNG, so we stay in the room after Box Road. For the 16th kill, switching rooms is faster again, so we move to the ice room after killing Doggo. After the 16th kill, we get to LV 8, which allows killing Dogamy and Greater Dog in 2 turns instead of 3 later.

The same is done with Woshua for the same reason in the next room. Afterwards, we kill 16 Moldsmals due to Moldsmal being a 1-shot. Temmie is also a 1-shot, but due to only appearing randomly after several scripted encounters later (which would need to be skipped) and due to Moldsmal appearing as a double encounter, killing Moldsmals is fastest.

By opening and closing the menu and then interacting with the dog bag, closing the dogfood text gives movement during the cutscene. We use the Z presses used to progress Mettaton's first textbox to close the dogfood text and to drop the stick, which triggers text corruption, shortening Mettaton's second set of text to item drop text. This saves Z presses overall by reducing the number of textboxes to mash away.

This allows us to kill Asgore in 6 turns. The other weapon option would have been the Burnt Pan, which has a similar quad system; however the pan's attack bonus is lower than the gun's, meaning it only does around 496 damage and thus can't kill Asgore in 6 turns. At the end of the battle, Asgore has a long set of dialogue that can be skipped twice as fast as most of the other text in this game. Following this text, we select "FIGHT" and kill Asgore. Flowey then appears, finishes off Asgore's soul, and steals the six human souls. Normally, Flowey would close the game here.

The first three phases have nothing particularly noteworthy. After the third phase, however, we begin taking damage.

Each row has an alarm (a timer that ticks down each frame) that's set at a fixed value for the first word and then randomly for each one afterwards. Additionally, each time that one of the alarms is triggered (when a word spawns), 5 frames are added to all alarms. So the strategy for minimizing the amount of time this phase takes is to minimize the number of words that spawn while also minimizing the time it takes for the words in the second row to spawn. Effectively, this means that we should RNG manipulate the second row alarms to be as low as possible and RNG manipulate all other row alarms to be high enough that no extra words spawn.

The fastest way to complete this section is to ensure that the gun doesn't turn past a certain small angle range. Within this range, the gun takes the shortest amount of time to point towards the next target. Outside of this range, the gun takes an increasingly large amount of time to point towards the next target based on the size of the angle.

We take advantage of this by just waiting out the fight until the damage dealt becomes much higher.
