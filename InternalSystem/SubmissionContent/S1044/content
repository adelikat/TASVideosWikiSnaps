	"Super Turrican 2 is a side scroller shooter who's origins originates all the way back to the Amiga console.  You have 4 weapons at your disposal; laser, spreader, rebound and smart bombs, num num.  I opted for the rebound as much as possible because it has the highest damage. The game is face paced, fun, and fricken hard.  It makes Contra feel like a day at the spa at some parts.  The game has an incredible difficulty due to the fast paced action, the fact that enemies do not get knocked back when hit, and collision detection is really bad and in some parts of the game standing as far as one "Turrican" away from a enemy or projectile will still damage you.

	"I made the movie running at 3% in snes9x almost the entire game.  There are a lot of auto scrolling stages and their scrolls speeds were not manipulatable.  I found this to be the most frustrating part of the entire making as there isn't much to do to make it exciting so I used a general rule of "just keep moving."  I do bend this rule at certain parts for show and entertainment for the idle animation of the Turrican shooting his machine gun, I thought it matched up nicely with the scenes I chose.

	"My favorite stage has to be stage 1-2, I really enjoyed planning the route to get all the gems, manipulating the enemies and it just turned out real seamless and is stunning to watch IMO.  The game is just played so fast and I did my best to make sure every move I made near enemies was the last possible moment to move without being damaged and it shows and payed off.  I also enjoyed the stage with the lasers very much.  It took me quite a while testing different methods to try to get past the lasers as fast as possible and im pleased with the end result, I thought it was gonna look horrible when viewing it at 3% of normal speed, however the slight pauses I made are barely even noticable when playing at normal speed.

	"My least favorite has to be the two underwater stages, the controls are very sluggish and it will often look like I missed a chance to slip by an enemy because of the collision detection or that I could have moved in faster after the enemy, I assure you I did my best to naviagate this stage, there are still some frames to optimize and I plan to do this, however I feel the end result as of now is worthy of a submission as it does blend seamlessly.

	"I was also dis-satisfied with the 2nd to the last stage, the scrolling is very bad, and the controls are sluggish when moving from left to right.  What bothered me most is I tried to aim for every shot is counting, but since it shoots 3 dots at a time, if I hit an enemy with one, the game is so quick that it can seem like im actually missing, so I decided to only shoot when the enemy was close or could at least hit them with 2/3 dots.  I couldn't think of anything else to do, so the stage looks quite boring (which it is) up until the boss.

	"Side Note:  I've never actually played this game until I started this run, suppose I sort of ruined its lasting appeal on me as everytime I play it I see it frame by frame now due to playing in slow motion so much. =)
