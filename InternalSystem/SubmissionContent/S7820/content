	"Puzzle & Action: 2do Arukoto ha Sand-R, known in US arcades as Puzzle & Action: Treasure Hunt, is a 1995 arcade game co-developed by Sega AM1 and CSK Research Institute (CRI). This is the third game of the Puzzle & Action series of games where players progress by completing mini games to reach the end. A year later this game was ported by CRI and is pretty much a perfect port of the arcade game. This TAS uses the Saturn version of the game since it's both arcade perfect and MAME's emulation of Sega Titan Video games are imperfect.

	"The main plot is simple: the main characters are treasure hunters who found a huge treasure chest. However, a band of thieves steal it from behind them. Now the treasure hunters travel the world in order to get their loot back. They gotta get past each boss's pawns through completing weird mini games and then challenge each boss in their own separate challenge.

	"At first I thought this game would be pretty easy to make a TAS for, albeit a bit long. Unfortunately I seem to have the unfortunate problem of just running into interesting RNG manipulation challenges. I originally tried to make a "1 player, all games" run that I mostly completed but at a certain point it became pretty clear that if I'm doing annoying RNG manipulation to get the last few games I might as well instead just make a proper 2 player run.

	"This game has a difficulty rank system that makes the games progressively harder the farther in the players are. The game also ranks down anytime they fail a mini game round. The difficulty select at the start also affects the game's starting rank. What influences rank is simple. Completing mini games successfully increases rank up until it maxes out, and failing mini games decreases rank. difficulty rank influences in a one or multiple ways:

	"RNG is usually dependent on the timing of inputs. Delaying inputs in places is used to influence RNG when it can be helpful. For what mini games show up, the only part that I know influences the selection is at the start of a stage where the frame the player shows up to the selection determines availability. The problem is that later stages have a LOT of mini games to get through so I mostly influenced the selection to the point that the first few games are on the quicker side.

	"Some mini games get adjusted to the presence of 2 players and requires both players to cooperate to get times similar to playing solo. This leads to a wash for some mini games in terms of completion time. The main benefit of using 2 players is that the impact of RNG for multiple games. This reduces the amount of RNG manipulation I do end up doing. Also worth noting that in the even that both players reach the goal on the same frame, priority goes to player 1.

The player cursors persist between rounds so the next triangle can be selected as soon as possible via maneuvering in the precious round. For 1 player the worst case RNG scenario is having the correct triangle appear in opposite far ends every round. For 2 players, each one starts on one side and the cursor persistence can make selections ever so slightly faster. This is the 2nd fastest mini game.

	"There's a very obvious way to improve this. Simply get better RNG in mini game order to get the fastest games possible. However, this is much easier said than done since it's hard to say a given set order is going to be faster through a big chunk of mini games that all have to be completed. If someone could figure out the order without having to play through all the games first would make routing a better mini game order much easier.
