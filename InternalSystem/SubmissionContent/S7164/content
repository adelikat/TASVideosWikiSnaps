	"Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles is a RPG created by Square Enix that follows a different approach in gameplay to the main series. In this game, the goal is to collect drops of myrrh at the end of dungeons to protect your village each year from deadly miasma that plagues the world. Your caravan travels the world, discovering the secrets behind the monsters' existence, and fighting their way through evil. In this TAS, the caravan is formed by one character, helped by a moogle companion, and saves the world in a record time.

Some things that need to be manipulated are dungeon bonus conditions, random events, and loot drops. A seed is created when entering a section of the overworld, so any changes must be done prior to this (most of the time at the miasma streams). It is sometimes possible to manipulate bad RNG while losing no frames, but it's rare.

The set is decided by how many points you get in the dungeon which relies on the dungeon's randomly-selected bonus condition. Having less points is faster at the end, so if set 1 is needed, we go with low points. If a higher set is needed (and fast to get) we try to get a practical condition like "Don't cast spell" or "Don't heal yourself" ("Don't" bonus conditions start the points counter at 100 points).

]h4
[div class=p 
	"Sign Glitch is the main glitch used in this run. It consists of interacting with a readable object (like a sign) and then taking damage while the text prompt is still active to cancel out of it. It gives the character's hitbox weird properties where it can move/push many things by simply running into them that were either previously unmovable (active monsters for example) or that were movable at a slow pace (items and inactive monsters). It does not work on everything, but it is used in a lot of instances during the run. Due to the incredible difficulty and precision needed to control where you push objects, it's not practical to be used in most RTA runs. The main glitch used in RTA runs is the 'Infinite Gil Glitch' which can be used to duplicate money, but this glitch requires the use of multiplayer mode (which itself requires the use of a Game Boy Advance and link cable) which thus makes it not possible to TAS.
	$LF
	"It should be noted that on many occasions I push things without using the Sign Glitch. This includes something I refer to as 'Mog Push' where I run into the moogle carrying the chalice to make him move faster (especially when he becomes tired). Also whether using the glitch or not, walking into any object continuously tends to make your character model eventually phase through an object and stop pushing it. The workaround to this is to stop running into the object for one frame (or some variation of this) so don't be surprised if you see my character doing any strange stuttered movement.

	"There are many effects your character can be affected by. The most noteable statuses in this run are burning and being slowed. Being on fire reduces your defense, but increases your speed. The reason it's not used more can be due to health regulation. Being on fire speeds you up enough to allow you to outrun the safe zone of the chalice that your companion moogle (Mog) carries which causes you to take additional damage by being in the miasma. Being slowed can seem bad, because it affects your casting speed and your movement speed, but it does not affect your normal attacks. For this reason, it can be quite useful to be hit by a slow spell instead of a damaging or hard crowd control spell (such as a thunder stun or blizzard freeze) while attacking stationary things like bosses.

	"The hitboxes in this game are very janky in how they operate. Most have vertical components and visuals that don't necessarily match up to the attack itself. These are a persistent challenge throughout the run to manage, but with careful movement I am able to squeeze out extra optimizations by abusing their properties. An example of this is that I can often skirt around the edges of attacks by using my character's combo attack animations with some specific timing. This can allow me to just barely evade the hitboxes of enemy attacks when my character does a little jump during the third hit of a combo. Additionally, for some monsters it is important to initially attack them in a certain way (the side vs. the front) as this can impact their reaction times enough for me to get extra attacks in safely that I wouldn't be able to if I had done the other option.

	"The final dungeon is accessible at the earliest in the in-game year 5. This is when the Lynari Desert dungeon is first made available and where the unknown chalice element is located which is required to pass the miasma stream to the final dungeon. However, the river that you sail across to reach the final dungeon's miasma stream is also dried up in this year. Due to this, the Veo Lu Sluice dungeon also needs to be completed this year prior to going to the final dungeon so the river's flow can be restored. Each year passes after 3 drops of myrrh are collected (1 drop from each dungeon), and there's no known sequence break to get around these requirements to finish the game. The dungeon route is very similar to RTA, as it simply does the fastest dungeons possible, but there are many differences inside the dungeons themselves compared to since RTA runners cannot guarantee what items will drops and need to plan around more realistic expectations for how much money and materials they can get.
	$LF
	"The main difference in the routing of the TAS is going to Mushroom Forest's third cycle at the end of year 4. This saves a trip to Mount Kilanda (which saves some travel time, gil, and gives a better strength artifact), but is also significantly more difficult and is viewed as not really being a viable route for human runners to save any time trying to attempt going for.

	"Here is where everything changes significantly. Normal RTA runs (and my last TAS) tend to craft the Warrior's Weapon in year 1, and then craft Master's Weapon as early as possible to last for the rest of the game. I decided to try completely disregarding this strategy for a much more exotic new one. I craft Novice's Weapon at start of year 2 (which involves me making another unusual choice of picking the blacksmith faily), and Valiant Weapon in middle of Year 3. Novice's Weapon is much weaker than Warrior's Weapon, but the logic behind this choice is to save time farming for items in Mushroom Forest cycle 1, and then skip the first trip to Marr's Pass completely.
	$LF
	"As a result of these choices, a lot of the earlier dungeons are slightly slower, but it makes for a quick and easy weapon craft by my character's blacksmith father. Valiant Weapon is chosen for it's strength +1 higher than Master's Weapon, and its focus attack proves to be very effective. (The Lilty's master's weapon focus attack is quite lackluster in comparison.) The valiant weapon's hitbox and invulnerability potential (it has something similar to 'counter' in a small frame window on its focus attack) makes it quite nice to have. It also ends up saving some use of food and thus menuing, but it requires a special random event to be manipulated so I can get an ingredient required for crafting the weapon.

Taking the ferry to pass the river costs 50g (we traverse this 2 times in total), going to Lynari Isle costs 300g, and coming back costs another 300. Skipping Mount Kilanda saves 500g. The main method of acquiring gil is selling items, and since we don't need mythril as an ingredient for the Master's Weapon anymore, we can sell it with many other of the starting items. The game starts you off with 200 gil. It costs 70 gil to craft Novice's Weapon (30% discount from father) and 500 gil for Valiant Weapon. Overall, much less gil is required than the old route, and this saves some time farming for it.
