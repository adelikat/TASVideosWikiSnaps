	"When MrTASer approached me, about Peril, I (nymx) became quickly interested...especially when he asked if I could share in finding any cuts.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"To start off, this game was very well done and I'm really surprised to see something like this on the Atari 2600. Second, MrTASer provided a really good set of inputs, as he made a very good showing in his efforts. At first, I was having trouble finding anything...but after running through this game multiple times, I started to notice mechanics to exploit and began finding cuts.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Because I was annoyed at a frame rule issue, I kept going back and trying to find more cuts. Eventually, I found more movement optimizations from playing with the helicopters collision detection. I'm not sure about other Atari 2600 games, but these sprites act in the same manner as the C64, where collision is against pixels and not the box of the sprite container. Because of this, and a funky movement the helicopter exhibits when turning, I was able to sneak around some corners faster because of the propellers being smaller.
