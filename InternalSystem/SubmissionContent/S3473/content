	"All the bosses have their level,when fight to him,a high level make his health long.Boss’ level depend on each character’s rank and how many hours passed.When you play in each stage,no matter death or not,if you don’t continue or finish a stage,time will pass an hour.After finishing a stage,your character will get a rank.Only 8 boss have their additional chips,and are 8 level or above,if you defeat such a boss,you can obtain no only a life up or energy up item,but also additional chip.

[p 
	"This run plays in 54:33,both X and Zero have average show in this run,due to the level system on a boss and aim for their additional chips,both characters must improve their rank in virus stages,so I open the way for them after intro stage.

]h3
[p 
	"I redo a new version witch differ from my “X,100%” run,just the same speed.Boss fight,I use charge burst as each hit,the speed is not change,no delay in this part.Also take damage at the last shot,that can actually change the RNG wicth let cannon fire safe after a few cutscene delay.Then cannon will be fired,and open the virus stages.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Because of Zero’s joining,I choose Zero,collect black armor for him and use death to escape.Then X comes here again,and obtain ultimate armor for him,and finish the rest area.Let X up to SA,and Zero is not change.

	"After that,all 8 bosses are lv9 for Zero but lv7 for X,so choosing Zero for the first stage.

[p 
	"The miniboss is an autoscroller.The first miniboss can emit some fish or “help” guys,the “help” guys will respawn when you come back in some stages,they are just as 1up and health recover,also I can manipulate how many health should I get.Black Zero is able to remove gunshot,this help me do a “all gunshot clear” show in the third miniboss.

	"Gizzly Slash
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"X has enough rank for this,you can see he always uses giga attack as movement,that can no jump higher,but also avoid or destroy some enemies.In a same distance,ultimate dash is faster than dashjump,but after obtaining hyper dash from Gizzly,dashjump is used as often.Without Ground Fire’s help,X has to use his ultimate dash to destroy the trucks.

[p 
	"Because Zero spends more time than X,I tested,it is more than 11seconds.Zero has not enough fast that waiting for lava flow more one time than X.The Ride Armor in the second area of this stage,always push back when wound from where it face to,I turn it left when taking damage that will push me to right.

]h3
[p 
	"Many time bombs are setting beside a wall,destroy the bomb and the way will be opened.Without Twin Dream’s help,Zero must give the bomb 2 hits combo,then the bomb explode and give damage in a narrow range.Due to that,Zero has to keep enough distance and slash or use f-spasher as the last hit,avoiding damage and delay.For Gaea Armor part,hyper dash is necessary.With scrolling screen,letting the Sigma virus respawn,Zero touch them 4 times,gets invincibility in several seconds,allow him to stand on the spike for the armor part(thanks someone’s trick).

	"Izzy Glow
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The EX tank in this stage only can be collected by X’s Ground Fire,that’s why Zero’s 100% run is impossible.For faster,X wound a lot,in order to get through some spike board.Miniboss have three ones,the black one can be destroy and reduce its HP.The higer one is faster to drop down and fly away than the lower one.This is the reason I manipulate the black one on below.

	"Dark Dizzy
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"In the first area,X can use Wing Spiral trick without waiting,and the armor part also requires X’s f-laser.Due to Dizzy’s low level,I can defeat him when I just use up my health.

	"Dynamo
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Because of Skiver’s weapon,Zero can’t use SDC anymore,but a new trick is used,we call it SCC(slash crouch cancel).It is a little slower than SDC,and will proceed in a short distance.Also,Dynamo falls very fast,he will not come again.

	"There is a Gaea Armor part require jumper,this is why I defeated Skiver so soon.I am waiting for jumper and it just finished!This is Zero’s show time now.Jumper is equipped,it help Zero jump higher,with his double jump,enough to obtain the armor part.

[p 
	"This stage require Gaea Armor,and the armor have just completed!Though it has a big deficiency at being slow,but it has a very short charge burst,be able to touch spike without death,and destroy black boxes.The shutter can be got through after getting pressing damage invincibility.Squid goes down relatively fast,but his invincibility actually didn’t change(30 frames).
