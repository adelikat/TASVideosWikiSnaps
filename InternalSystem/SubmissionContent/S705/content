	"This movie was hard to make.  This game is only random until you start the match. Depending on how I pressed the buttons before entering a match I get a certain set of blobs that appear in a predetermined order.  Though frustrating at times I used this to my advantage, making the player appear as though he can tell the future.  This movie is entertaining because it is played on it's hardest skill level, and at the fastest rate possible. This can be seen by the constantly rising score due to the player constantly holding down (1 point is gained for each block that the player passes through while holding down.).  While advancing from opponent to opponent it is possible to enter the battle without ever seeing them in the pre-tourny dialog, but only for one frame.  This seemed to save a lot of time.  My only regret is that I didn't press start for the last time bonus. :(

	"My seemingly very low re-record is count mostly because I used a run that I had perviously made to study my flaws, and the predetermined blobs helps a lot for that. :P
