[p 
	"Normally a game (or game mode) can't considered as properly beaten if you don't go through it all from start to finish. However, in this case I considered it worth to make an exception, in order to skip the first three iterations necessary for accessing the fight with Dr. Boskonovitch. In my opinion it improves the entertaining much, while bringing minimal technical demeterits. Here are my three reasons:
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" As far as I could tell, there are no differences between each time you face the main quest,

		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"With that said, I wanted to point out that (in my point of view) a single iteration of this game mode can be already be considered as a full playthrough, as the fight with Dr. Boskovitch would actually appear as a bonus that goes outside of the common. After all, we already allow movies starting from SRAM if it's for the sake of starting a second quest or an unlockable game mode. I understand that this is not exactly the kind of cases we've seen until now, but that's because this game is giving an unique situation, so the final judgment will set a new borderline in any case.

	"Optimizing a Tekken Force TAS is a very complex task. There are countless possible scenarios in each fight, as you often have to manipulate two foes at the same time, while at the same time advancing as much quick as possible through the level. Then, add to that that there are multiple playable characters available, whose are all very different from each other. In order to make a (supposedly) perfect TAS, there would need many years of study about every game mechanic and all its possible applications... Which in my opinion would not be worth the effort. I believe that it makes much more sense to just go with applying all the already known techs, while at the same time putting enough optimization in order to make the resulting TAS relatively hard to improve. I hope that this movie will encourage more people into trying to research and improve TASing for this game mode. If you want to know about the specific strategies I've adopted through the TAS, keep reading.

	" The character choice
	$LF
	[a id=heading-4001

[p 
	"With what I just said, of course I picked a character that I'm already familiar with. Still, I had to carefully study his

	" and 
	[a class=extlink href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAA6eMpOfB8 rel=nofollow 
		"obscure quirks
	]a
	", as well as figuring out which moves could be useful and in which situations. From what I've experienced while researching, it seemed to me that Yoshimitsu is a very slow fighter, except for a couple of moves (Fubuki and Side Kick). On the other hand, he features many weird moves that allow him to do fancy stuff that give him unique advantages in Tekken Force situations, mostly for killing enemies out of screen and moving quickly around with freedom, even if still having a target locked.

]h2
[p 
	[a class=intlink href=/Forum/P/421634 
		"Discovered
	]a
	" by Spikestuff. Each foe has either a scripted spawn that triggers when you reach the end of the current screen, or a spawn point that it's triggered when you walk past a certain distance. However, in the second case, they won't spawn if the foe slots are still occupied while you reach their spawn point, thus they will never spawn. So it's possible to skip many foes by travelling through the current screen as fast as possible, before the current foes do disappear from being KO'ed. I mostly do this by defeating some foes by using moves that make Yoshimitsu travel far and fast.

	"We run towards the right, until we get to present our Shoulder Attack to a clueless Crow. While our target is still locked on the corpose of the innocent Crow, we do a full Shark Attack combo towards it. Not only we'll get insanely far quick, but the ending attack of the combo, that is the infamously unreliable Kangaroo Kick, will conveniently meet the armpit of the only foe that our short race against time wasn't unable to prevent to spawn. We'll then cover the remaining of our trip by an Evasive Side Spin.

[p 
	"We'll now quickly deal with the stray Crow by using a Fubuki, and then get to the right for the scripted spawns. Two Hawks will present at the same time, and this time we'll be able to hit both of them at the same time with a Left Kick. We start stepping all the way backwards like a crayfish, just because a single Hawk is going to spawn on the bottom left, and give it a Side Kick.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"At this point we use a Meditation move, and press the back direction at the right frame in order to turn backwards, despite the fact that we still have the target locked on the last foe. This allows us to prepare for our next move sooner, as we will begin attacking before that we have the next target locked, as the foe will not be yet spawned... We use a Moonsault Slayer, which will gracefully place our green sword on an unlucky Hawk that has just spawned offscreen.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"We then adjust our position and get some distance from the right side of the screen, then we dash again while the new Hawk offscreen mistakenly thinks to be out of the range of our Side Kick. We then make again some distance with the right edge of the screen, just for preparing a Sword Impale that will end inside the guts of another Hawk.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"We then ahead for the left side of the screen again. A couple of Hawks will spawn at the same time, and this time it will be they who have the kindness of willingly come into their demise, in the form of a Zig Zag combo, just like it happened during the screen 2. Right after that, without even having to adjust our position, we perform a Moonsault Slayer that will fall on a very healthy Hawk, right after he spawned.

	"We begin exactly like this: one step forward, then a Shark Attack combo. Well, with some minor positioning for manipulating RNG... which ended having the upper Falcon behaving in the most convenient way possible: an evasive backflip. This way, not only he kets rekt by our Dive Bomb, but he also won't hinder our movement in the slightest, allowing us to get as far as possible towards the right.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There will be spawn points ahead that we can't skip, so we'll work out an ad-hoc strategy. We turn towards the left, as we have our target automatically locked on the other Falcon that spawned at the beginning of the stage, and we'll carefully adjust out positioning by walking backwards at the right speed... right after having a new Falcon spawning, we turn towards him and then we'll go all the way with an Evasive Side Spin. Since we're touching the wall, the Evasive Side Spin will make use slide on it. That's a quirk of the walls in Tekken Force. In the meantime, the two Falcons will get close just for experiencing a Flash Attack combo exclusively for them.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"We use a short Evasive Side Spin in order to grab a chicken and adjust our position at the same time, then we perform a Sword Spin that will grind two Falcons at the same time. Another Evasive Side Spin for adjusting our position again, and we go with a Moonsault Slayer that will end a huge Hawk before he even figures what's going on. The other one will meet our Left Kick.
