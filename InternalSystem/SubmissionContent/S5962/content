	" found on Nicovideo.jp, while improving it there and there; the movie length for this submission is longer due to the extra fight faced after the credits. Since there are specific in-game conditions for triggering it and beating it results in an additional ending cutscene, the goal for this run falls under the "best ending" specifics.

	"While this game has been only released in Japan, it must be noted that is pretty known thanks to an unofficial English patch. Also, the glitches abused in this movie are so severe that even people not familiar with the game can tell that something wrong is going on for the sake of speed. The audience response was very positive. Accepting for Moons.
