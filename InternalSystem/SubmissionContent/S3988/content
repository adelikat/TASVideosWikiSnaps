	"In fact, there are 3 japanese versions of this game.
	[br 
	]br
	"In the first japanese version, there are only 8 levels and only one layout for each. Missing levels are 4 and 5 in the US version. Option, character select, item select and level select screens are also different. Bosses have different weapons. Mashing button are less permissive in the JP version. Other interesting difference is that, in the level 1, you have to defeat Katanal and Echigoya in the same place. So you don't have to quit the first area and you save a lot of time. 
	$LF
	"Finally, 180° reverse roll is absent in the first JP version.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In order to respond at this lack of levels in japanese version, an second edition was published and called Tenchu: Shinobi Gensai. This version almost matches with US and PAL versions with a level editor directly offered by the game (you're not obligated to unlock it with a cheat code).
	$LF
	"There is also a supplementary short cutscene just after the end of the level 5 (Katoaka's Senpuku). Funny thing about the PAL version is that gives you kunai instead of shuriken and the 50 Hz makes the sequence breaking of the level 9 more difficult.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The first JP version seems to be less challenging and interresting to TAS, but may be Shinobi Gensai version will offer a good challenge because of the layouts are very well thinking (particular shorcuts are impossible). Furthermore, Sephyr0sS and Riskbreaker Y have chosen the US version for one reason : it seems to be the fastest version given the layouts.
	$LF
	"I really wanted to help them. That's why I choose the US version.

	"Introduction
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"According to me, there are some really important points in order to understand choices that I have made. 
	$LF
	"First, the game is divided into 10 levels and each level has 3 different layouts. By layout, you have to understand that some ennemies are located differently in the level. As you maybe doubt, it can influence drastically how you are going to deal with the level (and the time that it will take to achieve it).
	$LF
	"Those layouts are randomly chosen just before the level starts (see "tricks" section for more information).
	$LF
	"Second, you have at your disposal several items. The most interresting are bombs and mines (who deal damages) and the special item: Lightfoot Scroll (abreviate LFS). This scroll boostes your movement speed for 5 seconds (which represents a gain of about 15 seconds in real time; definitely a must-have. You choose item that you will carry on before the level begins (in a screen I call inventory).
	$LF
	"This item is unlock by obtaining the rank "Grand Master" in the first level.
	$LF
	"Third, about the ranking. Quite simple to understand. Here is rank you can get (best to worst):
	$LF

[p 
	"At the end of a level, you're evaluated. 300 points if you beat the level, 100 points if you've never get spotted, 20 point if you kill someone without being detected, less 20 point for each time you've been spotted, etc... If you reach the grand master, you'll unlock a special item (specific to each level). To get it, you've to earn 400 points at least; shortly, go to the end without being spotted.
	$LF
	"Fourth, increasing amount of items in the inventory. When a level ends, depending of your ranking, you'll get some extra items. Grand master ranking gives you 2 more of each item, Ninja ranking 1 and Novice ranking... are more complicated. See tricks section for details. I don't know what happens when you get Thug and Master Ninja ranking; Master Ninja is quite dificult to get and Thug only happens on the last level. 
	[em

				"Ennemy parry: The enemy parry behaviour can be manipulated if you press the square button at a certain frame. By doing this, it's possible to make him never parry.

		" Called by myself "FACS" (for Fall Animation "Cumulet" -Belgian Word for roll- Skip). When he falls, the character will follow a strictly vertical way and make an animation when he hits the ground.

				"Quick enemy stand up:

		" When an enemy is projected because of an attack, you can make him instantly stands up by hitting him when he's just on the ground. The most important in this trick is the fact that if a character is laying on the ground, he's immune to everything. The time he'll lay depends on its life; the less life he has, the more he will "sleep" (to give an idea, I measure about 20 seconds against a boss with 15 H.P. left).

	"In the speedrun, we use roof in order to keep as more stealth as possible. In the first version, I walked straight away intentionnaly to get the novice rank by being spotted. In the version you're wacthing, I use two LFS instead of one. I run so faster than some gards doesn't pop and some others doesn't have time to spot me. So I get the Ninja rank which also satisfy me as I get one LFS and one mine.

	"First boss: Manji. If one day you try speedrunning it, you'll remark something strange with your movements. What happen is that there are ennemy above you and it drives the game crazy. Killing Manji with a such random constraint is a challenge espacially in a speedrun. I had to deal with it (you can see an ennemy fall, the one who throws flames).

	"Just a crazy level where we have to use the grappling hook too much Q_Q. I optimize the hook aim speed with camera where it's possible. You also probably notice that I take damages near the end. In fact, this guard really bothered me. In another slower version, he simply ran straight foward felt but here, I didn't find any way to reproduce that. The better I found is I do: I start a side hit and at the same time, the guard hits Rkimaru. That interrupts him and obliges the guard to straff on his left and he falls, finally. And before you ask, no he didn't let throw the hook.

	"Boss: Onikage (Round 2). More difficult fight. After throwing the bomb, if he is projected backward, he'll be blocked into the wall and it becomes impossible to hit him; if he is thrown on his left, he will be blocked into the corner and that gives him 100% parry for the next first attack. So, no other choice than his right. I'm also obliged to let him attack me; that let him get down the "platform" (I don't know what it is). If I attacked him up stairs, either he felt in the stairs or on the roof and it definitely took more time than I choose to do.

	"Finally, here we are! This last level is really longer than all the previous. I make a roll in lava to avoid damages (and an animation that freeze me), I chain infinite air jump to skip the guard and in a cool "V" path over the lava (suggestion is coming from Veisper). Finally, I roll through the wall for fun (it just a few frames faster than jumping).
