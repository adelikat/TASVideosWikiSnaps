	"This run plays the "Flashing Columns" mode. In this mode, you have to remove a flashing gem at the bottom of the screen. There is also a timer that records the fastest time. I decided to go with the novice mode because there are less colored gems which leads to a faster time. I also believe that since there is more gems, it would take longer to destroy them, thus decreasing the entertainment value. And of course, In traditional TASvideos fashion, I set it up to the tallest height of columns.
