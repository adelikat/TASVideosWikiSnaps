Your goal in this game is to score points by driving over dots on the road, thus removing them. Unfortunately, the computer's driver has orders to stop you, and it knows only one way to do that...by crashing into you.

	"As this games moves from level to level, the game gets faster and faster. This game makes it all the way to Level 9...where a mysterious error occurs. This completely ends the game, as I have found a another limitation of these Compute's Gazette games. Thus far, this has only occurred with games that are based in B.A.S.I.C. In this case, I'm shocked that it seemed to be from a low and unexpected value.
