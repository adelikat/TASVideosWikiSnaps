	"This is the third installment of my attempt to take Red Scarlet's "Two-Item Run" to the next level by only collecting the Maru-Mari throughout the game. The door glitch is used to gain access to Norfair, thereby able to travel to Ridley's Hideout, and it is also used for access to Kraid's Lair. Again, only the Maru-Mari is "collected," but missiles are gained from bosses to complete the game. I haven't before this seen a run through Mother Brain's Lair, Tourian, without the Ice-beam to freeze the metroids.

	"-The ending alone is enough to watch the movie. My first attempt was a test run for response and the second, although seriously flawed, got serious raves about the concept. So, hopefully this one will cover all the bases. Improved are the following (just about everything would cover it, but specifically):
