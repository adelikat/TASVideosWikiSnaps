	"In the tutorial, there are multiple text boxes that will stop Kingsley if a flag is enabled. This flag is the same one that, if you press triangle, skips dialogue with an NPC if you've already talked to them. If you press triangle as the last text box fades out, it will trigger the flag, so the text boxes don't stop your movement. Activating the flag also lets Kingsley move 10 frames earlier when leaving dialogue.

		"Upwarps

	" are a very common glitch throughout the entire run. The collision detection for walls breaks if you're heading into the corner where 2 walls meet. This means you can get Kingsley a lot farther into the wall than expected, and when you're far enough inside you can jump to the top of the wall. They're useful throughout the entire run, letting you skip huge parts of dungeons or lead a boss OOB.

	"These require you to use an enemy to give you the speed needed to enter the wall (currently, no 90 degree wall has been able to get an upwarp without an enemy). I've made an image to show off the setup (the arrows are facing direction). If you make Kingsley run straight into Wall A, you will need to sidestep into Wall B to get upwarped. If you make Kingsley run into the corner of A and B, then you won't need to sidestep. The enemy needs to attack Kingsley towards the corner to correctly be upwarped. 
	$LF
	"In both cases, make Kingsley jump before getting hit. It'll make Kingsley upwarp as soon as he's far enough into the corner. If he's still on the ground, he'll be pushed out of the wall. There are also certain spots with geometry close enough to a wall that it'll let you upwarp with little effort, like with chests placed too close to a wall.

	"We start with Kingsley getting his shield from Aunt Adeline, then heading to Old Wrinkle to start the True Knight test. After Old Wrinkle's dialogue we set the text flag, so the text boxes don't make Kingsley stop moving. We then get our weapons, and are expected to fight the Seargent, but we can skip weapon training by upwarping to the statue and running to the next room. 
	$LF
	"Grabbing boxes at certain angles lets you move them without running to the other side of it. Before most cutscenes I'll make Kingsley jump, it lets him move forward during the cutscene. With training done, we go on the King's quests and must find the True Knight items, to become a True Knight of course. Our first quest is to head to Sea Town through the Castle Basement's foxhole and stop Gallagher.

	[br

	" will only let you get one or two attacks on him before jumping away. The amount of cannonballs he fires is RNG, but you can easily manipulate it by moving around. All bosses are affected by double/triple hits, where the collision from Kingsley's sword is applied multiple times. It's easiest to do this when you attack while turning to the left/right. I try to do it as much as possible in fights.

	"After defeating Gallagher we return Briny Jim's galleon, and get armor and an axe as a reward. Sadly we'll have to head to Carrot Castle after every dungeon as it's the only way to progress, there currently isn't a way to get past the gates without talking to the King/Queen. There's hardly time for congratulations from the King, as we're given our next quest: Help Poorluck village from Snuff the Dragon. This time we head to the foxhole in the Carrot Castle Grounds.

	"We step on the switches to open required doors, and then step on the floor tiles in a certain order to get a key. We save this key for later as well, by upwarping above the door and heading to the portal. In the "Slime" room, we ignore having to slide on the slime, instead upwarping straight to the portal, and we upwarp again to skip grabbing another green key. After upwarping a few more times, and using a key we saved earlier, we head to Snuff.

	"After his defeat, we learn from Nando that "Snuff become so fat and lazy that he had a machine built to bring the food directly to his cave." We have to reverse the machine so it starts sending food back to the Poorluck villagers. After this, we jump in a certain way to skip Lucy's dialogue, which also lets us skip Tartrazine's dialogue. We turn Snuff's knife and fork into a heavy sword, which is made light by our True Knight gloves. Afterwards we report again to the King/Queen. Our next quest is to go to Rosary Village, the town of Beermonks.

We get a cup on the house, which we give to Tufnutt to give us access to the Mayor's office. We talk to him, who gives us the password to the Abbey. In the Abbey, Abbot Harry tells us to make an antidote we'll have to collect three herbs that grow in the catacombs, which is the 3rd dungeon.

Our reward for taking out Clarence Darklord Jr. are magic boots and a crossbow. With the magic boots, we can cross a previously inaccessible area in Poorluck village to take out Judas, who

We basically ride Judas, by staying on his collision he pushes us with him to a corner. Anyway, we defeat him and learn that Judas is actually Sir Rufus, who was put under Bad Custard's magic spell. We head back to the King/Queen to discuss our findings. Just like before, we're hardly congratulated before our next quest: Cornflour, the master wizard of the Fruit Kingdom, had his magic robe stolen, so we head to Aphasia to help him.

The next room is fairly straightforward, and the third room has us upwarp with the assistance of a chest. We upwarp again in the next, and the next 2 rooms we use keys we've saved from earlier. Another upwarp before shooting a bat holding an arrow, which raises the ground. The next room is cycle based, and the one after that has another upwarp. Another cycle-based room, where we head into

	" is super easy. After almost every attack he will try and teleport away from you, but you can stun him before he actually teleports, which I abuse to take half his health bar before his first teleport. Then I just kept wailing on him until he went down. After he's defeated, Kingsley meets Bad Custard for the first time, who tells us that his dark knights will utterly crush him (spoilers: they don't).

	"Anyway, we run to Cornflour and give them their magic robe. Our reward is a Magic GEMSTONE for our shield, which will help us reach the Dark Night's castle. Instead of running back to the King/Queen just yet, we can barely hop our way over the next island, and enter Gustav's cave.

[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Gustav
	]b
	" is similar to Reggie, because after a few attacks he'll jump away. And just like Reggie, we can stun him and get multiple hits on him before he does so. Gustav is Sir Orson, another knight under Bad Custard's curse. When running back, we take damage in a certain part of the river to crossover again, and enter the foxhole to Rosary Village, where we can now use our magic GEMSTONE that creates GEMSTONES for us to jump over, and reach dark knight Oscar.

He is completely stunlocked as we repeatedly attack him, and return him to Sir Gawain. We then go back to the castle, and learn the GEMSTONE Cornflour gave us was our last item needed to become a True Knight. We head back to Sea Town where we can use our True Knight gloves to raise Rex's anchor, and enter his domain.

We run back to the King/Queen and now having freed all True Knights, we get our final quest: Go to Skull Island through the foxhole, defeat Bad Custard, and reclaim Queen Angelica's magic book. In Skull Island, by falling in a certain area of lava, it warps us in front of Bad Custard's custard pot.

	"He has two phases. In the first you wail on him, and the second phase starts after his first health bar is gone. He'll run around the arena, throwing fire spells at Kingsley to make him take damage. After Bad Custard is injured enough, he'll run right in front of his custard pot, and Kingsley uses this opportunity to push him in and boil him alive. We get back Queen Angelica's magic book, and return to Carrot Castle, where the knights hold a big Jamboree for Kingsley.
