	"This TAS is a run of the 9 Hole course in Wii Sports, with the goal of completing the course as fast as possible. Time begins when "9 Hole Game" is selected and ends when the ball completely enters the cup on Hole 9 and does not come back out.

	"Prior to beginning the run, I choose to enter the Expert course 2 times. Once is so that the "AB Check" is cleared before the run begins, and the second time is to generate a new set of RNG for the winds on the course. All wind speed and direction is determined and locked as soon as "9 Hole Game" is clicked. In most holes, I opt to hit the flag and drop into the hole rather than go for a direct chip-in. This is because the direct chip-in camera slows down the transition into the next hole and wastes a slight amount of time. Throughout the entire run, I only use the Driver as it launches the ball farther and faster than any other club. On certain holes I use "redline", which refers to the wobbling red line that appears on the power meter if the shot is too hard. Redline shots are the same power as full power meter shots but curve to the left or right. On two holes I purposefully land in a Water Hazard instead of onto the fairway because it begins the next stroke more quickly.

	"Before the first swing, a tutorial is skipped the instant it is about to appear leaving only a "ding" sound. The first swing lands the ball into the bunker but rolls it onto the fairway before coming to a rest. This allows the next swing to reach the necessary power to hit the flag and achieve an Eagle.

	"Most notable timesave is available on Hole 7, by getting a Hole in One instead of an Eagle. This requires both good wind and pin RNG. Another timesave is found on Hole 8, where a flagshot would have saved time over a direct chip-in if the wind made it available. On several holes I appear to take a moment before hitting the ball, this is because I have not found a faster way to use the emulated motion controls to swing instantly. Additional timesave is available with more favorable winds on holes like 9.

	": The optimization of the actual gameplay seems good. However the TAS is optimized for RTA timing (start of 9 holes) rather than TAS timing (power on). The TAS does a bunch of additional menuing to affect winds. Waiting does not seem to affect the winds. It is not known whether or not this additional menuing is particularly necessary in a TAS aiming for TAS timing but figuring that out would require redoing the whole movie, since later courses can be heavily wind dependent. This menuing strategy was done as optimally as it could but a future TASer might discover it is not needed.

	"The movie also sacrifices score for time, something that some folks found detracting from the entertainment value. In other words, this TAS might take additional shots or land out of bounds or in the water to save time. I did personally wince slightly at those instances but I understand why it was done and the votes are overwhelmingly positive.
