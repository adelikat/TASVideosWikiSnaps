	"This is a 2193 frames (36,55s) improvement over the current Goonies 2 movie. This is my second version of this TAS, this version is about 5 seconds faster than version 1.

	"So what's new in this movie? Well, one big change is that I save a lot of time by getting hit in the back by enemies. You will see this very clearly when you're watching the movie. Getting hit in the back by an enemy is 4 frames faster than jumping over them, but only 1 frame faster if you're wearing the Hyper shoes.

	"There are some other differences too, I manage to make some new jumps, place bombs at different places, enter doors faster and just generally improving almost every room.

	"You will notice that some areas might look somewhat sloppy, but that's because it saves more time than to wait to manipulate luck. It often takes a lot of time to manipulate luck in this game, since luck is frame based. I stop for a few frames once in the movie, for example. Things that are luckdependant are for example enemy movement and placement. I tried hard to optimize all luckbased events in the game.

	"The route is still the same, I didn't find any faster route than the one Walker Boh takes in his movie, so Walker's route, as far as I know, his route is the fastest possible.

	"I'd like to give special thanks to Walker Boh, for making the previous movie and finding out the best route and some really helpful techniques.

	"This movie took a long time to make, I redid it three times before I got this movie. Very timeconsuming, but very fun to make :)
