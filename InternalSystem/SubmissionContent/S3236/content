	"Here is the longest awaited obsoletion on the site, it took 7 years to brake the curse, and 4 talented tasers; arukAdo, Cardboard, Bablo and scrimpeh.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"Originally started by Cardboard and Bablo, they tased up to Stage 3-3 and then lacked interrest/time (pretty much like all preceding attempts), thats where the two of us took over.

	"We end up beating 
	(__wikiLink|126M|Phil and Genisto's old movie)
	" by 
	(frames|amount=5857)
	" (~20 seconds are from removing the dance after beating dracula).
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"Bablo and Cardboard did decide to use the jap rom, the stage8 is red(blood) instead green and some other small details are uncensored in this version (boobs for exemple), the timing have near no difference, I believe this rom choice should not be an issue.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"Im not sure if the run sync on others version of snes9x, we tryed to beat their movie but with not much success so we decided to just keep going with what we got.
