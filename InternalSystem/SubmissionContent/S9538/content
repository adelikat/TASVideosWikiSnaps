	"Hello! This is a TAS of the Pal version of Punch-Out!! featuring Mr. Dream. This version inspired Phred's Cool Punch-Out 2 Turbo. You may be wondering why I chose this version and not MTPO Pal. Well, PO Pal has some tricks that don't work on any other version. These tricks are hard to pull off, but save crazy amounts of time.
