	"this is about a 109 frame improvement to the publicaion, that comparison is coming from the fact that I synced the old move to bizhawk: http://tasvideos.org/userfiles/info/54179018669846944

	"One trick that has been found since the publication is you can get an early start if you jump and attack at the same time, this skips a cutscene of Rick trying to get up and it allows you to get up to speed faster.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"So a trick that you will be seeing throughout the game is the ability to freeze your animations by pressing the B button every other frame.  this is helpful for many bosses as you can do slide kicks at them (which does 2 damage instead of 1 damage from normal attacks).

	" Stage 2

[p 
	"in the elevator rooms, I found that if you slide then jump as soon as the level ends, you can get slightly closer to the level end trigger.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I also found that in the next room, you can jump and freeze Rick's slide to keep your full speed going before you start to slow down at the end.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"for the boss I just use jump slide kicks on the eyes.

	"in the 2nd room, I have to use a chansaw on some babies. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"for the first phase, it takes 2 hits for each baby to die, so I do that.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"once the 4 babies fall down, I try to hit all of the ones that would normally rise up last, so each of those parts would speed up.

	"the next room is really laggy, if a blue ghost gets onto you, your controls are reversed, and if another one latches onto you, the game will slow down.  it's pretty much impossible to avoid the lag spike.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"for the boss, I just do the slide kick spam and use the slide kick to end the level faster.

[p 
	"after the cutscene with her, the portal will start throwing enemies at you, I mostly tried to kill them as soon as possible to prevent any lag.

[p 
	"first room is just an autoscroller, nothing too special about it.

[p 
	"to free Jenifer, I do one slide kick and one normal attack.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"the big blue man I just have to move away from and avoid.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"one skip used at the end of the stage requires hitting the cutscene trigger as you do a slide kick backwards, this skips the cutscene and ends the level sooner.

[p 
	"the octopus is fairly easy to do, just throw back his projectiles into his eye.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"the final boss has some lag in it, one thing I was able to do was to get some early hits on it by punching in the air instead of doing kicks, as it has a slight reach to it.  I cant do slide kicks to the boss for the first phase as doing that will cause a soft lock.
	$LF

[p 
	"and Jenifer is rescued and the Splatterhouse is gone, or is it?

	": We're comparing this to an old Gens run, so let's do a level-by-level comparison to confirm that the gameplay is actually better. Timing was generally done from fade-in to a black screen, but exceptions were made for some levels with small cutscenes that had significant lag differences between emulators.

	"Bizhawk emulates a lot more lag in some levels, which is either unavoidable or not worth avoiding. A few frames were unaccounted for for unknown reasons, but there were actual gameplay improvements made in about half the levels. My best estimate here is that 128 gameplay frames were saved overall. Part of the timing difference is also that Bizhawk uses a 
	[a class=intlink href=/PlatformFramerates

	" which makes this movie appear a few seconds longer.
