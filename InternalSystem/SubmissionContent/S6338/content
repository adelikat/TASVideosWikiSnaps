Timing was generally done from fade-in to a black screen, but exceptions were made for some levels with small cutscenes that had significant lag differences between emulators.

A few frames were unaccounted for for unknown reasons, but there were actual gameplay improvements made in about half the levels. My best estimate here is that 128 gameplay frames were saved overall. Part of the timing difference is also that Bizhawk uses a
