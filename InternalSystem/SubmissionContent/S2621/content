	"Slash Mode is an unlockable feature where the challenge is to kill 100 bad guys/victims as fast as possible. BB1 is overall a better game for reasons that are irrelevant to this TAS, but BB2 has a better Slash Mode, with an on-screen timer and more variety in enemies and environments. Slash Mode is also a good choice for a TAS because there is only one loading wait.

This is used when the opponent has front stance, which some of the later enemies use. It's also required for the 2nd kill, since there's not enough time to switch to high stance and set up a spinslash.

	]dt

		"This is a special move that only a few characters have. Tony must be in high stance to perform it. It's the fastest kill method because there's a glitch that sometimes causes the enemy to spawn abnormally close (1000 instead of the usual 4000) while executing it. Since this is a TAS, sometimes means always. If both the distance and position are perfect, the enemy spawns right on your sword and dies immediately. This won't work against front stance because the opponent's sword gets in the way.

[div class=p 
	"The performance here cannot be replicated unassisted because of the luck manipulation. For every kill except after the room changes, the attack has to be initiated before the position of the next enemy is even determined. The spawns pop up in random positions and attempting the spin-slash glitch puts them very far away half the time. Furthermore, frame precision is required to prevent the enemies, especially the later ones, from blocking or getting neutral blade contact.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"On top of that, you have to manage your movement to avoid walls. Enemies will not spawn too close to walls. The spinslash moves forward and to the left, and takes so long that there's not much time to both reposition and manipulate the next spawn. The sequence can take the least amount of space by stepping to the player's right between iterations, forming a tight circle. It's most difficult in the first room (skinny hallway) and after kills 31 and 51 (facing the wall).
