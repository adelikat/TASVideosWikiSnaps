		"Bubsy in Fractured Furry Tales
	]em
	", known more commonly as 
	[em 
		"trash
	]em
	", is a 1994 platformer game released exclusively for the Atari Jaguar. It involves evil fairy tales running amuck or something and purrfect platformer gameplay.

	"Similar to the 
	[em 
		"Sonic the Hedgehog
	]em
	" series, Bubsy relies on a momentum system to gain and lose speed. However, the game lacks any sort of coherency with its level design, so often casually attempting to go fast means you run into something and die immediately.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"That said, momentum in this game is fairly complex. The max speed cap is 2048 pixels per frame, and any time Bubsy becomes airborne from falling or jumping his speed immediately gets halved, with the exception of sloped surfaces which can allow him to preserve or lose more speed. It's also possible on downward slopes to build up more speed by letting go of the arrow keys, since the speed cap only applies while a direction is being held.

[div class=p 
	"Bubsy's signature move is gliding, which slows his falls and is fairly broken as a mechanic in general. Like the previous two games, 'glide boosting' is possible by pressing the glide button every other frame during the end of Bubsy's jumps, which saves a lot of time throughout the game. It's also possible to exceed the vertical speed cap of 3840 pixels per frame by holding glide during it, which leads to some pretty wild shenanigans when navigating out of bounds. Finally, so long as Bubsy doesn't touch a wall, gliding can be used to 'unleash' previously built horizontal speed in the air even from a complete stop, which is useful when needing to turn around while platforming.

[div class=p 
	"The main reason this run was made, clipping refers to a variety of techniques to get Bubsy through walls and out of bounds, which often lets him completely skip most 'fun' levels of Flipping A Switch and Dodging The Whatevers.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Through the run there's four different methods of clipping done:
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"1) Gliding into the corner of a wall to enter its hitbox, then jumping to get pushed through the wall.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"2) Entering a slope at the right sub-pixel to avoid a wall collision check, then jumping to get pushed through the wall.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"3) Building up a large amount of vertical momentum via uncapped speed to clip through floors, notably allowing for fast horizontal and vertical speed out of bounds.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"4) Clipping via an object pushing Bubsy through a thin floor or wall.
