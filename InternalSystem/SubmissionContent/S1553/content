		"Dynamite Headdy
	]a
	" is a game of Treasure (Gunstar Heroes, Alien Soldier), in which the hero can attack the enemies by launching his detachable head into them. It has several autoscrollers and is not very fast paced, but makes up for this with its colourful levels and great variety. Nearly every scene has its own enemies and new concepts, which makes it fun to play and maybe enjoyable to watch. It consists of 9 stages with are divided in several scenes. The closing curtain, props, spotlights and curtain call at the end provide a theatrical theme giving the player the role of the spectator. Enjoy the show.
