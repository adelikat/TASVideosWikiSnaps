	"This is my Track and Field TAS, an attempt to improve upon the existing track and field movies.  There are 3 published movies:  
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Arc's|href=/34M)
	", 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Phil's U Version|href=/36M)
	", 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Phil's E version|href=/35M)
	".  The goals are a bit scattered between these movies and I felt a single movie could combine the best of these movies and leave us with 1 polished publication.  In addition, 3 events were improved with new tricks and better optimization (100 Meter dash, 110 Hurdles, and Triple Jump)

Normally, if you land past the marker on before the final jump, the attempt is stopped immediately as a foul.  But if you begin jumping at the last frame and get a 45 degree angle every time you can jump right past the dirt!  It looks like the game didn't intend this to be possible, but I am not sure.
