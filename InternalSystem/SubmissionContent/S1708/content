	"This is my Track and Field TAS, an attempt to improve upon the existing track and field movies.  There are 3 published movies:  
	[a class=intlink href=/34M 
		"Arc's
	]a
	", 
	[a class=intlink href=/36M 
		"Phil's U Version
	]a
	", 
	[a class=intlink href=/35M 
		"Phil's E version
	]a
	".  The goals are a bit scattered between these movies and I felt a single movie could combine the best of these movies and leave us with 1 polished publication.  In addition, 3 events were improved with new tricks and better optimization (100 Meter dash, 110 Hurdles, and Triple Jump)

[p 
	"1) Attempt to get the best score/time/length in each event at least once.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"2) To show the major consequences of seemingly minor mistakes in play or strategy.  Otherwise, simply showing off quirks/oddities and hidden bonuses in the game.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"4) Aim for fastest time without interfering with 1 or 2.  (This is essentially a "Doesn't WASTE time goal.  Simply put, I do my actions effeciently and find the first frame possible for handling menus, transitions, pausing, etc.)

	$LF
	"Attempt 3 - I show a quirk in the game that allows you to make the 3rd jump from past the dirt as Arc did in his first attempt.  Normally, if you land past the marker on before the final jump, the attempt is stopped immediately as a foul.  But if you begin jumping at the last frame and get a 45 degree angle every time you can jump right past the dirt!  It looks like the game didn't intend this to be possible, but I am not sure.
