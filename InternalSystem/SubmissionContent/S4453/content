		"Spikestuff's calculations

	", this run saves time where it actually counts. Overall, this run looks to have more consistent play than its predecessor, and the audience seems to be a lot more satisfied with it.

	"This run features a lot more segments which appear to be done very well, and was noticeably improved in quite a few levels. While the amount of noticeable issues (at least to me) are not non-existent, they are fewer in number, and apparently less noticeable than last time going by the audience's comments.

		" Jumping lower or shorter while doesn't get you as far does allow you to jump again sooner, or perhaps bounce off of enemies.

		$LF

I can at least confirm that it syncs fine with this setting set in the DTM on 4.0-3601 (you normally won't need the a/v sync hack for this one, since "proper" a/v sync was introduced in 4.0-3595).
