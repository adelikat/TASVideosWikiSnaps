I have to slow down at the start to break the barrier because of how weak the default right arm is. However, right after I break this wall, I get what I’ll call the “strong arm.” (I don’t know what the official name is if there is one, because this game has little documentation.) This one shots most things, including breakable walls. After this, just to show off a fun glitch, I land on the very edge of the button that doubles as a trampoline. This clicks the button but negates the bounce. Does not gain nor lose time. After this, I make my way into the coin room. I can conserve the extra speed from the conveyor belt for a while by jumping off the conveyor belt. Then I get the coin and leave. A little while later, I have to wait for the crusher to open.

Something interesting about these pipes is that they act like conveyor belts in the sense that you can run on them to increase/decrease speed from the speed that it applies to you. I jump past the moving platform to reach the second pipe. After exiting the pipe, a fall stun cancel is used before I collect the coin. One more fall stun cancel is used when I break the final wall. I use some glitched floors in the next section to speed up the switchbacks slightly, but the first real application on a glitched floor shows up here at the end. At the end of the last wire, I hit the edge to cancel my falling velocity as I turn around. Then, I use the glitched floor on the same platform, once again canceling my falling velocity.

	"I really thought this game was a good platformer. Too bad it wasn't released. I think it would have had a bigger following. Thankfully, we have GameGlitchGuy that speed runs this game very well. So there was confusion at first, since I don't normally see PAL games for the SNES. After all that got cleared up, I started to see that things were in much better shape than I originally thought. Having dealt with PAL games myself, I can certainly say that your submission time is a good effort...having the disadvantage of speed associated with an NTSC version. On the flip side, I do see places where the WR deviates, with routes, to get certain power-ups that help out tremendously. I'm not going to say that more time can't be found, because I do believe some is there for grabs. So...that level of effort goes beyond our expectations for acceptance. We've seen a lot of progression with many popular games. If this one had more of a following, I'm sure strategies would become more evident.
