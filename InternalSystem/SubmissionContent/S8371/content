	"The run was performed on the EU version of the game, which has all the features of the US version. However, at the end of last year it was discovered by RTA runners that the Spanish language in particular has faster textboxes which, throughout the run, save close to 30 seconds over US. One of the major reasons as to why I chose US/EU is because, in the Japanese version, the attack multipliers for the Bros. Attacks, the POW damage calculations and the max bonus points that you can get from the level up roulette in the Japanese version have all been changed in such a way that you can only finish each boss after Tolstar 1 turn slower compared to the US/EU version, making up for a total of 3 turns lost which is over 30 seconds slower. This becomes even more relevant in the first fight against Popple & Rookie. On the US/EU version it’s possible to skip Rookie’s animation of unlocking the flame attack that he can do against the bros, which he unlocks once he is at or below 40 HP. However, on the Japanese version it’s impossible to deal enough damage to kill him before unlocking this animation, which loses another 35 seconds on top of needing an extra turn to finish the fight.

	"The Mush Badge gives an attack bonus based on how many mushrooms (including super, ultra, and max mushrooms) you have. This bonus is added on to the base damage. On the US/EU version, each Mushroom and Super Mushroom increases the bonus by 51/256 points, and the total is rounded down to an integer. Ultra and Max Mushrooms do increase the bonus slightly more but are rarely ever picked up in the run. The reason why Mush Badge is essential to the route is due to its synergy with the Chopper Bros. move. This move is supposed to do many hits that do a small amount of damage, quickly decaying to 1 damage per hit. But the Mush Badge bonus damage is added to every hit, so the total damage is effectively multiplied by the Mush damage bonus. TAS can do a maximum of 27 hits per Chopper Bros. using autofire, which can add up to insane amounts of damage the more Mushrooms I have.

These trousers are especially broken on the US/EU version not only because of the Mush Badge being significantly stronger than on Japanese, but because they only cost 250 coins and both bros can wear it. On the Japanese version, they raised the cost of the #1 Trousers, from 250 coins, to 1290 coins, while also only making them wearable by Mario. This, in combination with the Mush Badge, enables me to essentially kill every boss after the solo fight against Popple in 1 turn except for Cackletta at the very end of the game.

I do that in order to manipulate a Tolstar fight with only 1 additional textbox as well as a Lucky hit in order to finish the battle 1 turn faster. The reason why I go for 1 textbox this time and not 0 is because, even though I only had to lose 4 more frames to get a 0 textbox fight, at the end of that fight I was unable to get a +3 on POW for Mario, which is required for this route to work.

On the fifth turn she gets down to 10 HP after using the Chopper Bros., which is when she starts her long attack, and I finish her with one last Knockback Bros.

Before this minigame I manipulated RNG such that only 2 of the 10 spirits spawned 2 spaces away and required a spin jump to get.

	"In this minigame you’re forced to hit 30 moving blocks in under 25 seconds in order to complete it, and the speed that they move at is governed by RNG. However, there is a neat little trick that was discovered at the beginning of this year that greatly speeds up this minigame and the next one found in Joke’s End. When creating this minigame, the developers forgot to make the blocks intangible after you hit them once, so during their animation of moving upwards and then disappearing it is possible to actually hit the block again with Mario with a jump on the second frame after he lands while the block is at its lowest point. This jump has a 2 frame window and Mario is the only one that can do it twice, since the moving blocks from Luigi’s side are placed a little too high up for him to hit them again. This saves a bit over 5 seconds over normally completing the minigame while hitting the blocks once each time with Mario.

The only way to save time during this minigame is by manipulating RNG for the last statue to spawn the blue orb after the first bounce, which is the earliest it can spawn. This saves 122 frames over the worst possible outcome where it spawns after the third bounce. It’s the only one that is RNG dependent, the other statues are always consistent.

	"This is the minigame with the most potential for optimisation by far. When you take damage during the minigame, the snail takes a short speed boost towards the end time which saves almost a second for each fireball that hits you, so after getting to 15 score I try to take damage as often as possible. Note that every time the bros take damage, they have an invincibility period of about 2-3 seconds before they can take damage again, and depending on which bro is hit and what angle he’s hit from, the platform will tilt in the opposite direction while having no control of its tilting for that invincibility period. So, I get the last 6 points by knocking the energy orbs back while both bros already have i-frames. Taking damage as often as possible saves over a full minute over not taking any damage and going for the highest score.

	"Just like in the last block minigame from the Hooniversity, I’m able to hit the blocks more than once in this minigame as well. In Hooniversity, you’re only able to hit the blocks a maximum of 2 times before they despawn due to a much tighter window and you’re only able to hit them with Mario, however in Joke’s End this window is a lot more generous (4 frames instead of 2) and the developers placed the blocks from Luigi’s side low enough for him to also be able to hit them more than once. Because of this, I am able to hit the first 2 blocks that appear 15 times with each bro, finishing the minigame in just under 5 seconds, saving close to 15 seconds versus the intended way to complete the minigame.

	"During the Peach escort quest, Peach can get captured by the spiked Goomba enemies that are present inside of Teehee Valley. There are 2 ways in which she can get captured. The first way is if the spiked Goomba is loaded too early, it will target the Princess and capture her. To rescue her after she gets captured, you must go down the pipe that’s present in each of the 4 rooms and go through a small hallway, which is very slow. Once she is rescued, she will go back to the beginning of the room and the spiked Goomba that captured her will no longer spawn in that room.

	$LF
	"There is an alternative way in which she can get captured though and this is where this inaccuracy lies in. If you go too far away from her, she will go off-screen and get unloaded, which will cause her to immediately get captured, even if there are no enemies near her.

	"This becomes a big problem in the third room of Teehee Valley. The RTA strategy for this room involves walking up to the end of the first step of the staircase and waiting there for about 5 seconds, which sets up the camera perfectly to barely not have Peach get captured by a Goomba and also to not have her unload. The problem is that on emulator, this strategy does not work, as she gets unloaded as soon as she is off-screen (9 frames after she becomes completely invisible), whereas on original hardware she gets unloaded about 2 seconds after she is no longer on-screen. After spending over 6 hours trying to come up with a different method to not load the Goomba too early but also not unload Peach, I couldn’t find any results, so unfortunately the only path forward was to get her captured on purpose and lose over 15 seconds compared to RTA. This was one of the most disappointing timelosses, but it was entirely out of my control.
