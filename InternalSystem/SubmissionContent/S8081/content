This glitch happens as the raft and recorder's routines run at the same time, and makes the recorder send Link to the wrong place, to the upper left screen of the dungeon where he was supposed to go. Before looking into the details for this strategy, you might want to understand how the recorder works.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Recorder sends Link to the entrance of dungeon he has completed. The dungeon order is determined by the direction he was facing. Ascending order when looking up or to the right, and descending order when looking down or to the left. For example, if he has finished level 1, 2, 3 and 4, and has never used the recorder, whirlwind sends him to level 1 if he looks up and blows the recorder once. If he repeats it one more, it sends him to level 2. However, since the destination of the recorder is always follows 1st quest, the dungeon order of 2nd quest is slightly different from 1st quest. For example, L2 in 1st quest is located in the same place as L3 in 2nd quest. Considering this, the game designer intentionally changed the recorder order in the 2nd quest to 1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 8, 7.

[div class=p

]div
[div class=p 
	"(i) When Link blows the recorder, the game determines which dungeon to send him to.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"(ii) Then the game proceeds to pre-position him to the left of the screen where he will be transferred (because the whirlwind actually scrolls from left to right to take him).

[div class=p 
	"(iii) If Link boards the whirlwind without being disturbed, he is transported to the dungeon determined in (i).
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The key to the glitch is (ii). When Link clips the block on the left side of the dock and blows the recorder, the whirlwind's path overlaps with the dock (it doesn't matter how far apart they are, as long as the two locations are horizontal to each other). This causes the recorder and raft to run simultaneously, canceling the recorder's and only executing the raft's routine to scroll up the screen. The result is a wrong-warp to the upper left of where Link should have moved.

And the second is that the cave has an animation of Link walking up and down the stairs, which takes about 2 seconds if you repeat entering this shop; a secret place you enter by burning tree, on the other hand, doesn't have this animation. The shop near L3 hidden in tree can avoid this delay, so we do not buy the shield here.
