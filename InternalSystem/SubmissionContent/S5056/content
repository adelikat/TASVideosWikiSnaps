	"This run is 2458 frames faster than the previous movie by Explosion Pills. I found a trick that enables the flooz to start flowing much quicker than in the published run, and decided to run the entire game since it's short and fast. Another improvement discovered was not ending stage 6 facing the bonus pipe, because the x2 bonus takes a good chunk of time to vanish. Because of this game's RNG all the puzzles are completed quite differently, so this run might be worth a watch even if you're very familiar with the last movie.

	"For some reason, FCEUX 2.2.2 glitches up the graphics on the opening copyright message. This doesn't affect gameplay and the run will still sync regardless. I used FCEUX 2.1.5 to record the YouTube video (there are probably other versions that it works with, too) and suggest encoders do the same.

	"This was a pretty fun but challenging TAS to make. Trying to solve the puzzles with turbo was quite the challenge, and required a fair amount of planning. The amount of time I put into this run definitely made it feel longer than 3 and a half minutes.
