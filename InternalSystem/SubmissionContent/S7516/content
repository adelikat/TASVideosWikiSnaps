	"I was thinking about what the old tas does and I thought about how unoptimized it was to go all the way up to the top of the level with the bridge to get the key that alone overwrites the time it saves with the first reset so I thought about taking the key with me and then juggling the bridge and the key up to the black room unlocking the door and after getting the chalice using the bridge to clip back to the yellow room the only reason I ever went above the room with the chalice is that I thought it would take me one room down and that would be faster but it took me the room where the black key usually is at the start which is even better saved a full second and a half on skill level 1
