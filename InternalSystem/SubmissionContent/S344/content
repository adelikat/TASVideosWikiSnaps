	"I take damage in some spots to save time, and in stage 2 to 
	$LF
	"get a boost over a ledge so I don't have to stop, kill the 
	$LF

	"The flying stage AGAIN is hell, the boxing robot part 
	$LF
	"EASILY sucking up more then 200 re-records and took me all 
	$LF
	"night and the early part of this morning to get done. To 
	$LF
	"give you a idea, I started the boxing segment at 5AM, I only 
	$LF
	"got it finished at 11AM going at the slowest emulator speed 
	$LF
	"and re-recording.

	"This game is easily one of the most fun games I remember on 
	$LF
	"the SNES, having beaten it on hard without a emulator (never 
	$LF
	"crazy hard) and are going to be working on some other 
	$LF
	"favorites too like Cybernator, Pocky and Rocky and more.

	"Sparkster is a -VERY- hard game, its easier then it looks, 
	$LF
	"on crazy hard everything moves twice as fast. This game is 
	$LF
	"almost as twitch happy as Sonic is

[p 
	"Oh with the genorator mid-boss in the last level I take 
	$LF
	"hits because I would have had to wait for two cycles of his 
	$LF
	"spinning orbs, and its quicker to hit a crystal, get hit, 
	$LF
	"flip hit two more crystals, get hit then get out.
