	"Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is a remake of the original Super Mario Bros. with some new game modes, including a challenge mode where coins and time remaining are crucial to gaining the target score and a race mode where Mario competes against Boo to reach each level's finish flag pole first. While this mode looks like a direct port of the NES game, there are different physics and glitches, making optimizing Deluxe a very different task.

	" and welcome to our community.  You have chosen a very noble game to attack. As some members have mentioned, you are not at all bad at this game; however, you are coming up short against the site's existing record: 
	(__wikiLink|href=/6277M|implicitdisplaytext=6277M)
	". Even with 1301 of blank frames that I trimmed, this movie still has some issues. I may have trimmed blank frames, but there are other inputs that I'm not really encouraged to touch...mainly the ones after you destroy Bowser. These are not necessary for the timing, but can be accomplished afterwards by the publisher to get the completed ending sequence.

	"On the good side, you are 16 frames behind the current publication. Not bad for a first run; however, it does fall short and I am bound by the rules to reject this for optimization...as any successful submission will have to beat all known records to be acceptable. Thank you for participating in our community and I look forward to more of what you can do.
