	"Well hey! aranDUMgametaser here with another hot hot movie improvement. This time around, I improve mmbossman's nearly 8 year old SM3 movie by 7109 frames via optimization, minor route changes, and better emulation resulting in faster strategies and a lot less lag.

Venom was optimized by doing aerial kicks and uppercuts on him, which saved about 4 seconds in total. Additionally, I ended the Venom fight with him as close to the wall as possible, unlike the last TAS which required him to move all the way from the left side. This lets me knock him off the building as soon as its available.
