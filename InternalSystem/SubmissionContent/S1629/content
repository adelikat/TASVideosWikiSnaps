	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"As usual for this game, this run (v4) did not take me more than two weeks to make. Luck-manipulation was merely from scrolling text at different times, made easier using frame search. Note that unlike in previous games, the RNG depends (usually) on the frame count only, not on anything else (e.g. when the delays occurred). So it does lose me time in the run, although it makes my job easier.
	$LF

[p 
	"After doing a practice run and finishing the 
	[a class=intlink href=/1603S 
		"Splinter Cell run
	]a
	", I took a crack at the Machop run again. All my runs start with the same Mudkip because its nature and IVs were just too lucky. The practice run had a L15 Machop with +Atk and 13 Atk IV. The run after that, which I had intended to submit before I gave up near the end, had a L14 Machop without +Atk and 30 Atk IV. I took a gamble with that Machop and ultimately it backfired (though I could have figured out earlier). By changing the order of Pokémon catching, I tried one last time to catch a good Machop. I came across a L15 Machop with +Atk and 28 Atk IV, and as a result, you are reading that run's submission text right now.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"By the way, there is a way to check IVs in memory, detailed somewhere in the Pokémon Sapphire thread. Of course, I didn't check every Machop; it's far easier to check its Attack directly instead. I don't know where or how nature is held in memory, but I don't care since it shows up in Pokémon summary anyway.

	" Luck manipulation during battle
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"As a general summary, anything with chance (Quick Claw, critical hit, accuracy) can be luck-manipulated. This applies even to opponent move choices, but not always.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"First, many moves normally have 100% accuracy. In order for it to miss, you first need to lower the opponent's accuracy or raise own evasion somehow (some moves such as Swift and Aerial Ace are not affected by any accuracy/evade modifiers and thus never miss).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Second, most opponents play for the immediate OHKO (a.k.a. killer instinct). This means that if a move will OHKO your Pokémon, you can never get the opponent to make a move that won't. Detailed below:
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" If an opponent's reserve Pokémon has such a move, it will come out as soon as possible. That explains why the second Pokémon sent out has a tendency to destroy the player's Pokémon.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" If your Pokémon is low on health, the opponent will even showboat and try to KO you with a weak weapon, and it may even be possible to survive as a result, but such events are uncommon and not worth playing for.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" There is a fine line between the opponent playing for the OHKO and not. If the opponent plays for the OHKO and has 100% accuracy moves, only a Quick Claw activation (first attack) and an immediate OHKO blow yourself separates victory and defeat (although in uncommon cases you can survive with almost no health) or else an accuracy drop/evasion raise.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" If the opponent does not play for the OHKO, it is bound to have a move that does no damage, and you can use items such as X Attack and loaf around while the opponent plays the no-damage move. If the opponent does not even have 100% accuracy moves, ignore the above and make moves miss.
		$LF
	]li

		" It really is a big difference. That's why it's important to keep health up, even if it is faster to take damage.

	]li
]ul
[p 
	"There are some loopholes in the AI, such as trainers bent on using items first, double battles where the trainer(s) pick a random opponent to attack rather than the most logical choice, and some trainers switching to a Pokémon you are weak against just because it resists your last attack (not bad in itself though the extra hit against a feared Pokémon may come in handy). Generally, though, opponents are smart when it comes to killer instinct and there is not much you can do about it.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I use mid text speed. This allows control on text speed, making luck-manipulation easier. Text can always be scrolled the fastest by autofiring A and L (if L=A) in alternation.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"For example, if I have to manipulate an Overheat miss followed by a Low Kick critical, mid speed allows me to manipulate for the miss (1/10), then manipulate for the critical (1/16), rather than manipulating for both at once (1/160) as on fast speed.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Mudkip/Marshtomp is used in part of this run. Mudkip is Water-typed but its evolutions are Water/Ground. Water/Ground is not weak to anything but Grass, to which it is double-weak. Because of this, Grass Pokémon are often sent out second as a priority. Since Mudkip and evolutions are better used as a physical attacker, I choose the Naughty nature (+Attack, -SpDef) and its IVs happen to be very good as well (30 Atk IV, 31 SpAtk IV). This is actually from the previous run, since its IVs were that good.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Mudkip has the Torrent ability, which allows a 1.5x boost for Water moves if its HP is at 1/3 or lower. Mudkip also serves as a total HM slave after Machop is used, learning Rock Smash, Surf, Dive, and Waterfall.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Machop/Machoke is used from where it is found to the end. Machop/Machoke is Fighting-typed. Its weaknesses are Flying and Psychic, so attacks like Aerial Ace, Wing Attack and Psychic will OHKO it, and Pokémon with these will be sent out second. Machop is entirely a physical attacker, and I came across an Attack IV of 28 (out of 31) with the Naughty nature (+Attack, -SpDef). Along with 0 SpDef IV, it has the worst Special Defense possible, but that turns out to be irrelevant.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Machop has the Guts ability, which allows a 1.5x Attack boost when afflicted with a status condition. There are five status conditions: freeze, sleep, paralyze, poison, burn. Only paralyze is feasible, since the speed drop is dealt with by Quick Claw, and the full paralysis effect is a chance thing. Paralyze also works to double Facade's power. The 1.5x Attack boost turns Machop into a OHKO machine, although it is slow to start because of the initial uphill climb to gain levels and experience. Machop is also the HM Strength user.

Also, between two areas that change songs, before the transition, I can use the bike to get the current song to fade, so the game doesn't have to wait as long before it fades completely.

I need at least 6 Earthquake PP since Dusclops has an ability that makes me use 2 PP per move against it (but the last one only sucks 1 PP because then there's only 1 PP left).  X Attack is required to OHKO Dusclops, and I let it use Future Sight. Curse and Shadow Punch result in failure, while Confuse Ray does produce at least a couple extra confusion messages but I was somehow unable to prevent a third. As for Future Sight, most unexpected miss ever.

So I sought a better Machop/Machoke, and now that I have it, I OHKO it out of my mind with a Cross Chop.
