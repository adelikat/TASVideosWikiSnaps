	"A frustrating game to play, and a frustrating game to TAS, but hopefully fun to watch done fast.  This is a dungeon-crawling type game with puzzles to solve and goblins to fight.  Playing through it normally one finds out quickly that it is VERY easy to die.  But the story is pretty cool, and it can be pretty humorous too.  I don't get the best possible ending here, in which the hero is rescued by a girl instead of a goblin (but hey, maybe some people would prefer the goblin), because that would take more time.

	"I don't know why, but when making this video, after completing just about every room I had a desynch when I played the video back.  Other times the screen would just freeze.  Sometimes I played through a fight to see what moves were possible only to find that a move I made before suddenly has become impossible!  So it is very possible that someone else might be able to find some ways to save some frames if they could figure out how to make this game stay consistent.  Anyway, hopefully this will be desynch-free for everyone.

	"on level 5 I turn into a mouse, and if I start moving after the trolls are next to me they squish me.  Here is one spot I might have saved time by drinking the water earlier (if you don't you keep taking damage from the poisonous air or something and die), but taking it too soon delays the guy, and he is attacked by trolls.  In the room where I walk in a funny pattern that is because if you step off of that path you are eaten by giant worms.
