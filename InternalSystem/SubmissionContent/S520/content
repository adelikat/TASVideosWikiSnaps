	"The making of the movie was alot of fun. I've learned how a simple game as Sonic and Knuckles, can be very technical and hard if your attempting to run through each stage perfectly without getting hit, or dying, and the quickest time possible. The most difficult part I would think is the boss battles, because each boss usally has a trick that you can exploit or do to defeat the boss quickly.With me playing through the game as knuckles in these conditions was fairlt hard, but I had very much fun doing so. I think people will like the result because noones ever did a sonic and knuckles 3 run using knuckles, playing the game without getting hit and aquiring the highest score and rings while trying to complete the game the fastest is very difficult. I was overall happy to finish the game in 71 mins but I feel that this run can easily be improved by 10-15 mins hopefully, and thats what i truly want. I want to see someone succeed my time attack , that would make me happy.
