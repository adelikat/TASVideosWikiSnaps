	" is an unlicensed game made for the NES and Sega Genesis, featuring - you guessed it - 52 different video games. The NES version was published in 1991, whereas the Genesis version was published in 1993. Both versions were published by Active Enterprises.

	]em
	" is game 49/52 in the NES version of Action 52. You play as a handyman dressed in light blue, shooting dark blue pins at brown tools such as pliers and hammers for 3 levels. If this game is selected on an unrevised cartridge, the ROM will crash. Luckily, the Rev A cartridge loads the game just fine.

	" for correcting the optimization errors that I found. I saw other weird parts that I can't explain, but delaying in those areas were necessary. There might be a way around them, but they are not obvious and probably would require some custom tools to do further analysis.
