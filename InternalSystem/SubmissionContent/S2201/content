	"The Faery Tale Adventure is an action RPG first released for Amiga in 1986 and ported to Sega Genesis in 1991. The plot revolves around three brothers who go on a quest to defeat an evil Necromancer and retrieve a Talisman from him. The game world is gigantic and normally requires hours of adventuring around to collect five Golden Statues to access a hidden city to find a magical flower, which allows walking on lava. There is also a witch, a sorcerer, a giant turtle, a dragon, a king, a princess, a golden swan... Oh well, most of this stuff is not seen in the TAS anyway.

	"Once again the in-human precision of controller input made a huge shortcut possible. This route would be insanely difficult to use on a console speedrun. In fact, it is not a trivial stunt even with all the emulator tools available. After all, the Citadel of Doom is protected by a lava pool and a force field barrier. In addition, the Necromancer who resides behind those obstacles can be harmed only with a rare Magic Wand.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"By a lucky coincidence, the lava causes only 5 points of damage per step. Glass Vials (healing potions), which heal a random amount of 4-11 points, can be used every second step. So with lots of healing potions and luck manipulation it is possible to get across the lava without the heat protection! Ha!
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Ok, the Magic Wand is the only weapon that can harm the Necromancer. There exists three Magic Wands in the game. Two of them are located far away in a dragon cave, but by another lucky coincidence, the third wand is in the hand of the Necromancer himself! By using a Gold Ring (a common time stop spell), it is possible to steal the wand from the Necromancer. No magic item is supposed to work near the Necromancer, but the spell effect lasts just long enough, so that it can be used before entering the area that restricts spells. So, I activate the Necromancer spawn trigger, then take one step back and use the Gold Ring, then run to the stopped guy and steal his wand.

[p 
	"Whew, this route works only barely!
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The only obstacle I was unable to skip was the force field barrier in the Citadel of Doom, so I needed to get the Crystal Shard to get past it. An undead spirit who lives in a crypt has the Crystal Shard, but he appears only late in the evening (he spawns at clock 22440) and wants a Bone from the Tombs of Hemsath. Luckily, there is enough time to fetch the Bone before the clock reaches 22440. In addition, I managed to collect all the required Glass Vials while waiting, which means that the movie should be very close to perfect at that point, unless there is a way to make the in-game time go faster.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Sleeping can be used to speed up the in-game time temporarily, but it is not possible to sleep until the clock hits 14307. Also, the player character only sleeps a fixed amount of time. Sleeping saved many minutes anyway.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In addition to the Glass Vials (for the lava), the Crystal Shard (for the force field) and the Gold Ring (for the final boss), I needed 3 red keys for the secret doors in the Tombs of Hemsath and one grey key for the crypt door. All of the items used in the run (except Crystal Shard and Magic Wand) were manipulated as item-drops from enemies.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Food is bought once to avoid starving. Starving would cause 2 points of damage every now and then. It would also make the walking dizzy (with random directional changes).
