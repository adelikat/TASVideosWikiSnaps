[p 
	"Hey there!  This is Hiryuu from ACMLM's board.  Long time viewer, first time submitter.  Since the introductions of myself are out of the way, let's get to the game at hand.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The following can be used in the description when and if this gets published:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Ranma 1/2 - Chougi Ranbu Hen was the third and last fighter that came out for the Super Famicom in 1994.  The series had three fighters, one RPG and one puzzle game based on Jaanken (or Paper, Rock, Scissors).  For those of you who don't know, Ranma 1/2 is an animé series created by one Takahashi Rumiko, who is better known for her work nowadays, Inuyasha.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This fighter is probably the better of the three in that it has the most features out of all three of the games and, overall, flows a lot better and most people that I know who have played this generally have a lot more fun.  This game flows more or less like the Street Fighter games that so many have played.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"What I aim for in this vid is, like most vids here, to beat Story Mode in as fast a time as I can.  I also add in creativity so that the vid, although fast, has some fun playing around while I'm at it.  If I was going for an all-out speed fest, this would likely be a stale vid, so I compromised some time for the good of the show.  Regardless, Story Mode was completed without damage and as fast as I could on the hardest level.  Each round has 100 seconds, though shown as 99 at the beginning, and took 5-8 seconds while trying to strive for creativity each time.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"End description.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Okay, now that the description's done, I'd like to give a brief synopsis of the fights as they went down, but first I'll give you an idea of what I used tactics-wise for the run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Combo System - Like many fighters, this game has a combo system.  However, the system itself is VERY limited and does not even show the amount of hits you accumulate in a straight row.  It is there, though, since certain moves can chain into other ones.  It's a little lax on the timing, so you do not need to buffer your moves so much in order to create the combos.  Just a good sense of timing and practice and you'll be ready to go.  For Ryouga's sake, I maxed out doing -7- hits in a single combo.  There were two version of that used: A broke 3 hit then 4 hit and a straight 7 hit.  The timing that is required to execute this move and the ability to set it up takes a lot of luck in order to pull it off.  If you do it correctly, however, you will perform a tremendous and even cruel amount of damage.  Your opponent won't know what hit him/her.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Dizzying - This aspect was used a lot in the game.  By doing a large amount of damage in a row, usually by combos, you can knock an opponent down and when they get back up, they will be in a dizzied state.  You can take this time to unleash more pain or a follow-up combo.  A common trick is that if you start early, you'll get a dizzy off a combo that's only about 3 or 4 hits.  However, dizzying a second time becomes nearly impossible, mostly because the opponent will be dead before it happens again.  So this will happen practically every battle you view once.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Varying combos, specials, and throws against time - As I said, this combo system allows you to vary your moves, but only so much.  This run aims to show the extent of you which you can take our lost friend, Ryouga, and put him to your own use and how fast you can do it.  Most people who have played this game may be surprised at the comboing that these characters can do.  Using Luck Manipulation, I attacked practically every weak spot that was available to me in style.  On hardest level without the emulation tool's help of slowing down, hitting the opponent every hit without them defending is practically impossible.  They know how to block on hardest level, so you must counterattack while they try attacking you.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Desperation moves - Although sporting a large deal of chance and a large amount of time, these moves can be used after taunting your opponent.  Taunting can be done by pressing the L shoulder button.  When this is done, your character will taunt or, in Ryouga's case, start an animation that shows he's charging up energy.  If you aren't hit during the two or three second charge up, your life bar starts to flash you can initiate a powered up attack, special, or you may use your character's desperation attack which lands an awesome amount of power if it connects.  If you're hit while your lifebar is flashing, however, you will lose your powered up status and you will have to successfully taunt the opponent again in order to attack.  For this reason, you would only pull these moves off if you can allow the time to do so.  Course, having Ryouga pull of a Full Power Shishi Houkou Dan is nice too.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I think I've covered everything, now let's do a brief overview of the battles at hand.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"FIGHT OVERVIEWS - Don't read if you hate semi-spoilers or don't want a guide while you watch.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"FIGHT 1 - RANMA SAOTOME
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Fans of the series should know that this would probably be a better fight last than first.  Oh well, random generation of character battles.  The two long-time rivals shall square off first.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Round 1:
	$LF
	"Right of the bat, you can tell where the usage of dizzying comes in.  The moment our friend Ranma hits the ground without bouncing he will rise in a dizzied state.  In a fast motion, the amount of damage will escalate.  Now to have fun with this.  7 seconds.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Round 2:
	$LF
	"Dizzying can also come from taking too much damage OUT of combo.  This is shown by Ranma taking a kick to the face in the air after surviving a combo.  The result here is his demise with a high hit combo.  6 seconds.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"FIGHT 2 - SHAMPOO
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Anyone like the nice scenery of this game?  The wooden porch of the famous Kiyomizudera, or "Pure Water Temple", in Kyoto at sunset.  Oh you're only here for the fights, right?
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Round 1: These two fights may have been better, but considering Shampoo being slippery, as she's quite fast, it became a bit of a difficulty. However, I exercised some hit and trips for the endings to make her demise as flashy as possible.  8 seconds.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Round 2: Same as the last but I exercised more aerial assaults and tossed Ryouga's Tanuki doll that he got for Akane into the mix for effect.  Hit and trip ending once again.  7 seconds.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"FIGHT 3 - KODACHI KUNOU
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Taj Mahal.  Kodachi sure can pick them.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Round 1: This shows the non-broken 7 hitter that I spoke of.  As far as I know this is the most you can make with this character and perhaps the game.  The timing for it and the chance for it to happen is quite rare so I used it when I could.  Right around frame 9420 would be a nice shot for this TAS's preview screenshot if it gets published here.  Nice ending.  7 seconds.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Round 2:  Your basic bowl over.  Kodachi didn't stand a chance.  8 seconds.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"FIGHT 4 - UKYOU KUONJI
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Ah, spatula girl.  If anyone wants to know why she's using those to fight, watch the animé.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Round 1: Another bowl over.  You can see I like the headbutt chain a lot by now.  6 seconds.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Round 2: Same deal but Ukyou finds the floor at the end, hard.  Started to vary up my chains with throws at this point.  7 seconds.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"FIGHT 5 - MOUSSE
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"That coat on him is big for a reason.  That said, the Statue of Liberty looks nice.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Round 1: Mousse gets bowled all over New York City.  7 seconds.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Round 2: Same deal, but more cornering.  Go Shishi Houkou Dan.  6 seconds.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"FIGHT 6 - MARIKO KONJYOU
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Some American Football stadium, I think.  Yea, we're going against cheerleaders this time.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Round 1: This was one of those rare times where I could time a combo at the start that didn't dizzy the opponent after 3 hits.  I succeeded in hitting her in 5 hits and then finished her off with a 6 hit.  Though it is preferred for all out speedruns, it wouldn't be too much of a run if I did the same trick over and over again.  It would get boring fast.  There's another trick that I know of that is used later as I'll point out.  5 seconds.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Round 2: Mariko gets knocked back and forth with a constant barrage of power from Ryouga.  Poor thing.  7 seconds.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"FIGHT 7 - GENMA-PANDA
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Yes, you fight a panda too.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Round 1: Genma-Panda's big size means a big target.  I had fun chaining up BAKUSAI TENKETSU on him in both fights.  Classic over and under attack for the end.  7 seconds.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Round 2: As I said, Breaking Point owns.  8 seconds.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"FIGHT 8 - TATEWAKI KUNOU
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Tatewaki Kunou, age 17, about to get beat up at Niagra Falls.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Round 1: This was an interesting setup, since the CPU decide to follow me up instead of trying to anti-air me from the ground.  Kicked Kunou in the face, proceeded to drive him into the pavement, dizzied him, and comboed him with a blast at the finish.  Truly a decent fight out of all of these.  6 seconds.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Round 2: Barrage assault from air and ground.  Not as impressive as last time, but I was going for a change in pace for the moves that were being shown.  7 seconds.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"FIGHT 9 - AKANE TENDOU
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Show watchers know that this fight wouldn't happen unless it was in a fanfic.  Ryouga loves Akane too much for this.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Round 1: Brought her the toy he gave her.  This fight shows the Broken 7 combo that I spoke of.  It was out of sheer luck and chance that both of them comboed together.  A knee to the face for the end.  8 seconds.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Round 2: Used the non-broken 7 this time.  Weaved up and down and ended with a blast.  6 seconds.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"FIGHT 10 - HINAKO-SENSEI
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Someone want to tell me why Hinako would be in the Savannahs of Africa?  Please?
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Round 1:  If this was Super Smash Brothers Melee, I'd have points off for Stale Moves.  This is one of those fights that I mentioned earlier that are fast but really aren't that great to watch over and over again.  5 seconds.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Round 2: You should be used to the pummeling by now.  Straight uppercut for the win.  6 seconds.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"FINAL FIGHT - HERB
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"What I find bad is that Herb wasn't in the animé, he was in the manga in his own arc, yet he had a voice actor just for this game.  Man, the watching possibilites if this would've been in the animé.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Round 1: Pummeling with a double BAKUSAI TENKETSU at the end.  6 seconds.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Round 2: Well, you'll have to watch this last fight.  I'm not giving it away.  It was a fun setup, though, let me tell you.  8 seconds.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"That's all the fights.  The final SCORE was 737800.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"And that concludes my long and drawn out description of this run.  I had a lot of fun making this.  I imagine that it's possible to make this faster but this was a first time job and I imagine that the job I did could be improved with practice.  I hope those that know and like this game take the chance to play this game and possibly beat even beat this time attack and/or make it look more flashy.
