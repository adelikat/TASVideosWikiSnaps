	": Hello, julius_x, and welcome to TASVideos.  This run certainly beats the current published TAS due to the far quicker textbox speeds contained in the JPN version.  However, per the site's

	", time gained through shorter text boxes cannot be the sole reason for obsoleting a run.  There must be significant gameplay improvements, also.  And unfortunately, most of the battles throughout the run are significantly slower than the current published TAS.  I posted a table outlining specific times in the thread.  Two of your boss battles were faster, however, which I hope encourages you to study the current run's tactics and make further improvements upon them.  The current TAS is definitely beatable!
