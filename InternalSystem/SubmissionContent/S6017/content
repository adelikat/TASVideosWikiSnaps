]h4
[p 
	"This run is done on the USA version of Top Gear 2 and uses English Text.  The goal of this run is to get to the credits as quickly as possible (100%) using the fastest known methods currently possible.  I started making this TAS on 5/6/2018 and finished it on 6/12/2018.  This TAS uses TAS only viable tricks on some portions of some tracks.  The RTA run which is held by RallyFTW with a time of 2:46:05.650 which was completed on May 22nd, 2017.  This TAS beats the current World Record by a staggering 20 mins & 28 seconds! This TAS can definitely be improved by another 2 1/2 mins or more if other times saves come about in the near future.

	" About the Category
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"100% Super Car Wall Glitches is exactly what you'd expect it to be.  Basically, you take your car through the entire game (54 tracks in total). The game originally has 64 tracks, however, I get to skip 9 of them throughout the entire run.  This run heavily relies on frame perfect skips which in turn allows me to end tracks quicker than the developers intended.  This category was entirely an addon to the 100% category as an extension, which could promptly be named "NG+" (New Game Plus).  This category is great for those who have completed the game for the first time initially and what a little more of a challenge and better overall experience.

	" Console Differences 
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"As previously mentioned in my other submission: Top Gear 2 was the only Top Gear game to be released on multiple consoles at a time.  Top Gear 2 was released on SNES, Genesis & Amiga CD 32.  Top Gear 2 is the most optimal on the SNES version and this TAS will be using the SNES version for the most optimal gameplay and performance.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Regional Differences 
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Top Gear 2 and all of the other Top Gear games, all have different regions in which the game can be played.  Top Gear 2, and all of the regions don't have any major updates that limit the current categories of the game, and all regions kind of play exactly the same.  The only thing that changes from region to region is the aesthetics & Password inputs this includes: Brighter HUD & CPU 2nd place is noticeable, JPN version and EU version passwords differ from the USA game. Some characters on the password screen will include, Left & Right arrows for moving the cursor to a certain position to change a letter or number.
	$LF

[h4 
	" Wall Glitches
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Since this category does allow what is called a "Wall Glitch", I will be able to exploit the game in an unintended way.  The way Wall Glitches work is this: A wall glitch is a glitch that allows the runner to make the game think he/she has finished the race by hitting the wall.  An object needs to be in contact with the hitbox of the car in order for the glitch to work, however, not all walls are the same.  The game will then proceed to find the next correct move to make since it has your first place finish stored in memory, it then will "warp" you to the finish line, thus ending the race in a prompt manner.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Automatic Vs. Manual 
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"There are two types of transmissions in Top Gear 2.  One is Automatic, which increases your speed automatically (go figure), and the other one is Manual, which you can tune yourself.  Before Manual transmission was used, we used Automatic.  The switch from Automatic to Manual was faster, so much faster than it saved around 10 seconds.

[p 
	"Ayers Rock is the only track in the game that will have a sunset backdrop added on.  In addition, not only does this look really cool, it makes it feel more engaging since every other track after this will be the same standard backdrop color.  Ayers Rock also introduces the first "trick" in the run, called Barrier Skip (not referring to Wind Waker).  What is Barrier Skip? Barrier Skip is when the car can go in between the arrow merge signs and keep a little bit of speed.  Outside the playing field, aka the race track, there are dirt, grass, & objects preventing you from traveling outside it’s intended boundaries.  I had to slow down at the start because I got really bad RNG from the car setups along the way.  This track has 5 laps and all 5 laps are the same.

		" Australasia: Sydney 
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"Unlike the previous 3 tracks, Sydney opens its doors and introduces the rainy element in the game.  Unlike dry conditions, Rain can affect your cars forward momentum with sliding.  Thankfully sliding has been resolved, so going really fast won’t be bad.   Found by RallyFTW, if you are traveling into a curved turn, you can rapidly tap left or right on the directional pad, in that direction to cancel out your sliding animation.  This trick can also be applied to snowy levels, however, some levels have sharper turns, so not every turn can be done with this trick applied.  An example would be Zurich and Munich both snow levels with sharp turns.

]ul
[p 
	"Loch Ness or Nessy for short introduces a new element called fog.  You might be noticing a trend here with these elements rolling in, where the first 5 stages will introduce the elements besides snow.  Loch Ness also introduces Speed Ups.  Speed Ups are ½ a nitro, so using a nitro perfectly near a speedup will be tacked onto your speed total for an extended amount of time.  Speed Ups can also be a reversed role to nitro.  If you grab a speed up and then use a nitro, it will also have the same effect.

[p 
	"BIG BEN is back and better than ever! With that terrible unfunny joke out of the way, London will introduce the first sharp turn of the run.  Sharp turn as in, not Ayers Rock sharp, like slow down all the way sharp.  However, in the TAS (Tool Assisted Speedrun), I use the arrow barrier skip to avoid the sharp turn and keep my speed.  The arrow barrier skips are 1 frame and require really precise inputs, however, this proves no challenge for the TAS (Tool Assisted Speedrun).

		" Britain: Sheffield 
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"This is the track that the game developers intended to use the gas element but failed to do so.  By this point 7 tracks in, you would think they would have introduced it a little earlier than this.  The gas tank animation is still on screen, however, doesn’t do anything besides go down and warns you of running low on gas by 3rd lap.  Personally, I feel they did the right thing here and kept the player racing at all times without stopping for gas refills.  Sheffield is the first of many tracks that will warn you when your fake gas is running low.  Sheffield also introduces Puddles into the game.  Puddles are tiny water pockets on the road to slow your car down but are avoided to maintain speed.  Nitro’s on this track are spread out and you will notice a trend from here on out, that I will wait a little bit then use a nitro, wait a little bit then use a nitro.  The reason I do this is that if I were to use the nitro’s any sooner, I lose all of my speed from a steep hill, however, I don’t lose speed, as I use the nitro at a perfect frame.

		" Britain: Stonehenge
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"Stonehenge features the famous standing stones.  This track has 3 laps and is the last track featured in Britain.  You will notice that I am able to keep my speed, after boosting at the finish line on each lap, that’s because again I timed my nitro just right to make sure I kept my speed there.  It doesn’t lose any time so I might have well used that method, throughout the track.  I also am skipping the jumping animation, the reason is that, if you use a nitro and jump over a speed bump you lose 10 MPH, losing 10 MPH would cause a time loss.

	]li
]ul
[p 
	"Welcome to Canada.  Canada Banff is another one of those tracks that include a speed up.  You will notice throughout the track I will use a nitro right before picking up the speed boost. I also lose a little bit of speed, and lower my gears to increase my speed faster, the reason I do this is because if I stayed in 6th gear and picked up the speed up, I wouldn’t have gotten a speed value above 232, the higher  the gear you are in the slower the ½ nitro will be.  However, this is not always the case for normal nitro use after the 1st nitro at the beginning of races.  On lap 3 you might have noticed that I was still going 230 MPH while obtaining the speed up which increased my speed from a fully used nitro, I did this because I wanted to go fast, but I hit the roadblock next to the jump because I would have crashed, and going outside of the track would caused me to slow down even more.  Hitting this roadblock gave the same amount of speed after that section, from the previous 2 laps.

		" Canada: Niagara Falls 
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"As previously mentioned Rainy stages have the slide animation cancel so I am using that trick effectively here.  Niagara Falls is an interesting track, it’s interesting in its own ways.  Firstly it’s the only track in the first set of 10 tracks that will introduce a sharp rainy corner on a track.  This is also true for Sydney, but Sydney doesn’t have a sharp turn, as it has a wide turn with rain.  Niagara Falls will prepare you for a later track called Madrid.  Niagara Falls has 3 laps and all 3 laps are the same.

		" Canada: Toronto 
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"Toronto is the third track in Canada and will be the first track to introduce a 2 lap track up until this point in the game.  Toronto will also introduce a new element called grass.  The grass is slippery in Top Gear 2 so be careful where you end up placing your car.  Toronto will mostly prepare you for Japan: Hiroshima since that track also has a lot of grass on both sides of the track.  Toronto also has a cool thing about it and it's not the only track in the game that will have this, however, you can almost use all of your nitro's in succession without running out beforehand.  The track Toronto also prepares you for is France: Monaco.

[p 
	"Vancouver or as I like to call it "Van Cover" will be the 16th track and will be the 2nd track to have nighttime driving.  Vancouver is interesting because this is where the game decides to ramp up in difficulty, which would make sense since it gives you 15 previous tracks to race on.  Vancouver another one of those tracks that will prepare you for a later race called: Japan Kyoto.  The nice clean race here, nothing too out of the ordinary just yet.

Top Gear 2 has a funny backstory when it comes to naming race tracks.  In particular, this will be the first instance of copyright avoidance by the developers here.

You might have seen a pattern by now, and that is, each track or every 2 tracks you will play will be either really difficult, which mean the follow-up track will be smooth and nice, or reversed statement.  At its heart is Tahrir Square and the vast Egyptian Museum, a trove of antiquities including royal mummies and gilded King Tutankhamun artifacts.

Bordeaux will is not a difficult stage to deal with and was an overall fun experience. The track has a nasty turn at the start, so in order for me to keep all my speed I need to slow down in order to make the turn, otherwise, I would hit the merge signs on the righthand side.  Bordeaux is a warm-up track to Hiroshima and Yokohama.

MONACO IS A REALLY GOOD TRACK .... okay sorry caps lock was stuck :) Anyway, Monaco will be the 18th nighttime track and will be the first track to allow the runner to use all of your nitrous in succession without running out.  Since Monaco has extra nitro's, there will be no need to slow down at all, meaning avoiding cars will be a lot easier as they come earlier.  Monaco will prepare you for Japan as that country is basically all two laps beside Yokohama.

Cologne is another one of those tracks that is fun to play.  Cologne will be the 22nd track and will feature long downhill sections.  These long downhill sections are perfect for keeping my speed after a nitro is used. Since Cologne has nothing special to offer besides downhill I decided it would be funny to continuously press Left and Right on the D-Pad to somewhat annoy the viewer, however, this doesn't go on for very long and ends after lap two finishes.
