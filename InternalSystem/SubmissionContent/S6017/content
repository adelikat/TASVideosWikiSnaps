The game originally has 64 tracks, however, I get to skip 9 of them throughout the entire run.  This run heavily relies on frame perfect skips which in turn allows me to end tracks quicker than the developers intended.  This category was entirely an addon to the 100% category as an extension, which could promptly be named "NG+" (New Game Plus).  This category is great for those who have completed the game for the first time initially and what a little more of a challenge and better overall experience.

The way Wall Glitches work is this: A wall glitch is a glitch that allows the runner to make the game think he/she has finished the race by hitting the wall.  An object needs to be in contact with the hitbox of the car in order for the glitch to work, however, not all walls are the same.  The game will then proceed to find the next correct move to make since it has your first place finish stored in memory, it then will "warp" you to the finish line, thus ending the race in a prompt manner.

Ayers Rock also introduces the first "trick" in the run, called Barrier Skip (not referring to Wind Waker).  What is Barrier Skip? Barrier Skip is when the car can go in between the arrow merge signs and keep a little bit of speed.  Outside the playing field, aka the race track, there are dirt, grass, & objects preventing you from traveling outside it’s intended boundaries.  I had to slow down at the start because I got really bad RNG from the car setups along the way.  This track has 5 laps and all 5 laps are the same.

Thankfully sliding has been resolved, so going really fast won’t be bad.   Found by RallyFTW, if you are traveling into a curved turn, you can rapidly tap left or right on the directional pad, in that direction to cancel out your sliding animation.  This trick can also be applied to snowy levels, however, some levels have sharper turns, so not every turn can be done with this trick applied.  An example would be Zurich and Munich both snow levels with sharp turns.

You might be noticing a trend here with these elements rolling in, where the first 5 stages will introduce the elements besides snow.  Loch Ness also introduces Speed Ups.  Speed Ups are ½ a nitro, so using a nitro perfectly near a speedup will be tacked onto your speed total for an extended amount of time.  Speed Ups can also be a reversed role to nitro.  If you grab a speed up and then use a nitro, it will also have the same effect.

By this point 7 tracks in, you would think they would have introduced it a little earlier than this.  The gas tank animation is still on screen, however, doesn’t do anything besides go down and warns you of running low on gas by 3rd lap.  Personally, I feel they did the right thing here and kept the player racing at all times without stopping for gas refills.  Sheffield is the first of many tracks that will warn you when your fake gas is running low.  Sheffield also introduces Puddles into the game.  Puddles are tiny water pockets on the road to slow your car down but are avoided to maintain speed.  Nitro’s on this track are spread out and you will notice a trend from here on out, that I will wait a little bit then use a nitro, wait a little bit then use a nitro.  The reason I do this is that if I were to use the nitro’s any sooner, I lose all of my speed from a steep hill, however, I don’t lose speed, as I use the nitro at a perfect frame.

You will notice that I am able to keep my speed, after boosting at the finish line on each lap, that’s because again I timed my nitro just right to make sure I kept my speed there.  It doesn’t lose any time so I might have well used that method, throughout the track.  I also am skipping the jumping animation, the reason is that, if you use a nitro and jump over a speed bump you lose 10 MPH, losing 10 MPH would cause a time loss.

	"Welcome to Canada.  Canada Banff is another one of those tracks that include a speed up.  You will notice throughout the track I will use a nitro right before picking up the speed boost. I also lose a little bit of speed, and lower my gears to increase my speed faster, the reason I do this is because if I stayed in 6th gear and picked up the speed up, I wouldn’t have gotten a speed value above 232, the higher  the gear you are in the slower the ½ nitro will be.  However, this is not always the case for normal nitro use after the 1st nitro at the beginning of races.  On lap 3 you might have noticed that I was still going 230 MPH while obtaining the speed up which increased my speed from a fully used nitro, I did this because I wanted to go fast, but I hit the roadblock next to the jump because I would have crashed, and going outside of the track would caused me to slow down even more.  Hitting this roadblock gave the same amount of speed after that section, from the previous 2 laps.

Firstly it’s the only track in the first set of 10 tracks that will introduce a sharp rainy corner on a track.  This is also true for Sydney, but Sydney doesn’t have a sharp turn, as it has a wide turn with rain.  Niagara Falls will prepare you for a later track called Madrid.  Niagara Falls has 3 laps and all 3 laps are the same.

The grass is slippery in Top Gear 2 so be careful where you end up placing your car.  Toronto will mostly prepare you for Japan: Hiroshima since that track also has a lot of grass on both sides of the track.  Toronto also has a cool thing about it and it's not the only track in the game that will have this, however, you can almost use all of your nitro's in succession without running out beforehand.
