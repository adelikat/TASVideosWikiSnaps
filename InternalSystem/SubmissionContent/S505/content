	"I improved phase 1 of Mr. Sandman by 1 second. Unfortunately, because you have to wait for his second sleeper pattern, this does not improve the overall time.

	"The cs glitch was avoided in Phil and Genisto's run because they claimed it was boring.  I hope this run proves otherwise. I tried to make it as fast and as entertaining as possible while the clock is stopped.  The cs glitch results in some bizarre strategies, especially Soda Popinski and the second Don Flamenco fight.  I use the select trick and get knocked down twice in order to achieve the fastest clock time.
