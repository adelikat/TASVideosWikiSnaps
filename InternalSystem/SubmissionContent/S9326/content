[div class=p 
	"I feel like "Phantasy Star III is the black sheep of the series" is a phrase like "Mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell." If anyone knows anything about the subject, it's this exact sequence of words, and not a whole lot else. The game was almost intended to be this way from the very beginning, too--the plot takes place an indeterminate time in the future, far away from the previous games' location in space. As if to say "yeah it's not entirely canon, we'll get you the proper game soon, hang on." (And they did, PS IV is the best jRPG on the Genesis and one of the best of the 16-bit generation. It has an easter egg side dungeon that references this game, and an easter egg monster elsewhere, but otherwise this game never needed to happen.)

[div class=p 
	"Phantasy Star III's story takes place over three generations, and you direct the story as you choose who you want your hero to marry. Of your two choices, the story changes and your son changes, who becomes the new hero and has their own marriage decision at the end of their adventure. Of the four possible grandchildren, they all take the same quest to conquer the Dark Force and save their worlds.
	$LF
	"Essentially, the worlds as we know them have been split into two factions--the descendants of the hero who sealed away Dark Force 1000 years ago, Orakio, are hardy and are associated with cybernetics. They fear the residents of a land of magic and monsters, who descended from Laya, another hero who helped Orakio but eventually went to war with him after their quest was complete. As the game begins, the Orakian prince, Rhys, has forsaken his duty-bound engagement to an Orakian princess, Lena, from a neighboring nation, as he has fallen in love with a mysterious woman named Maia who washed up on-shore without her memories.
	$LF
	"On the wedding day of Rhys and Maia, a dragon steals her away, proclaiming she was a descendent of Laya and never would belong to a filthy Orakian! Rhys valiantly begins a quest to save her from capture by her own country, and proves his love to her through challenges arranged by Princess Lena and Lyle, the man later revealed to have been a Layan prince who can transform into a dragon. They give their blessing to Rhys, and shift the moons into a position to reveal a sandbar, allowing the Prince, who is NOT a dragon or a magic-user, to enter Cille and rescue his bride. At this point, you can either choose for Rhys to marry the Layan Maia, or the Orakian Lena, and rule over their people. This decision decides which nation has a hero to defend themselves when the moons attack 20 years later--Lena and Lyle's actions awoke powerful forces from 1000 years ago, and your chosen son has to conquer one of the moons to save his kingdom. The third generation gets the task of conquering the great evil that arranged the entire plot, the demonic form of malevolence from millennia past, Dark Force.

[div class=p 
	"PS III is hard to play, mostly because it's kinda boring and slow-paced. Storytelling elements, while they exist, are kinda lacking in-game, and just kinda happen through occasional conversations. Once a character joins your party, they often never speak again or have much of anything to do with anything. The game mechanics are very unusual for a jRPG--characters start with all the spells they ever learn, their TP costs never change, and you can make them stronger by re-balancing your focus in that class. Either your single heal is strong or your group heal is strong, that kind of thing. As you level, you get more points to balance around, but since bosses are strong against magic and dungeons are largely exercises in tedious attrition, it's generally just easier to focus on making your characters' physical attacks stronger to the point of ending battles fast. Grind, buy stronger knives, win, repeat.
	$LF

	"And the story falls a little flat, as all four possible Third Generations devolve almost immediately into the same set of fetch quests: Get 5 party members, get the 5 weapons, unlock their hidden power, conquer the evil. The endings are different but kinda all the same, too, so it's a little disappointing.

[div class=p 
	"This is the most well-known glitch in Phantasy Star III--this is the one that ACMLM used in their run. Escapipes are your "escape the dungeon" item in Phantasy Star games. In PSIII, at the completion of a generation, the game forgets to re-set where the Escapipe is supposed to send you, meaning you can immediately go right back to the entrance of the final dungeon of the previous generation! However, this is really only useful in one particular place: The start of Nial's quest in the Second Generation, if you chose to marry Lena. All five other possible uses of this glitch either send you to a locked city you have no means of escaping, or they send you right back to where you already are, saving no time at all. With Nial, however, you get the opportunity to do the First Generation's final dungeon again, and fight Rhys's final boss again, and upon the victory, the game acts like it's the end of Nial's quest, you can marry his two choices, and then the game continues to the Third Generation!

	"The Pron Glitch
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"At the moment during the Third Generation that the five sacred weapons are powered up with the secret word, the game searches your character inventories and replaces the sacred weapons with the data values of the Nei weapons. If a character's inventory is completely empty, however, the game bugs out massively, and writes weird values in certain spots of memory. Player sprites are glitched out, theire locations on screen are temporarily misaligned, and most characters have their names altered permanently, usually by changing the first letter to a P. (Aron's name is changed to Pron, for example, hence the name of the glitch. Teehee, Pr0n.) This is why our final party is Pron, Pieu, Para, Paya, and Wren. Someone didn't want to Play along...
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Along with these cosmetic changes, though, there are also incredible stat changes that can occur for the first character found whose inventory is empty. While the men often get downgrades to some stats, the women become faster than anything else in the game and gain a defense stat so high that even the final boss can only do 0 damage with a non-magical attack! These stat changes only affect one character, so I chose Laya in this TAS, as I will explain later in the walkthrough section. Mainly, this glitch is used to give Dark Force someone to target to keep my offensive characters alive as long as possible without any time-wasting healing being needed.

	"The Surprise Glitch
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"This glitch provides the bulk of the time save for this run, and was what influenced me to make this improvement. If you Surprise the enemy to start a battle, you get a free turn to attack without response. If, during a Surprise turn, you attempt to cast a Technique, but do not have enough TP to do so, the game wigs out and just ends the battle, declaring you the winner and handing you the XP and Meseta (money) that you would have obtained if you had won legit. This obviously saves a ton of time, not just through ending the battles immediately, but also by changing the game routing: No longer do I need to enter towns and buildings to buy weapons for the path to the bosses, I can just glitch my way through with an un-equipped party! Since you cannot Surprise a bossfight, however, one does still need to bring some weapons to those. Thus, the First Generation in this TAS becomes a balancing act of running from as many battles as possible while using this glitch as often as needed to buy a sword and a gun and just enough levels to beat the first bossfight in three turns. We're set up for the rest of the game at this point--after the Lyle fight, all battles are run from until the very final dungeon.

	"There is also another glitch that occurs when your sacred weapons are made Nei--if a character had their sacred weapon equipped when the transformation happens, they keep the boost to their Attack stat! And then when you equip the Nei-weapon, you get the full increase of the new superweapon added on! ...However, this glitch is entirely cosmetic for the stats screen, and the actual in-battle stats are calculated properly, as if the inflation never occurred. So, while this glitch technically happens for both Kara and Laya in this TAS, it does nothing in actual gameplay, TAS or not, and I will not be mentioning it further.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Also, while this is not a glitch, the most famous exploit in PS III is also related to Escapipe usage. As soon as you begin a new game, if you sell your Boots and buy an Escapipe before you start the wedding abduction sequences, you can use that Escapipe while in the castle dungeon, and reappear back in town! The exit is still blocked, however, and the developers were clever enough to put in a secret message if you talk to the king again, who tells you that while what you did would normally be smart, you're instead trapped and have to restart your game! A very cute addition by the devs, but obviously pointless for a TAS.

Wren's guns are treated like magic in this game, in that his Attack does not influence their damage, but enemy Defend also cannot protect from their bullets, so Wren is the perfect character to directly mow through King Cille's high Defense as well.

Before the cataclysm, apparently, there was enough time to build several gigantic spaceships to send all of Palman civilization into outer space, to hopefully find new solar systems to call home, far far away from the reaches of Dark Force. But Dark Force hid a piece of itself in each and every ship, and by PS III's time, only two of the ships have survived, Alisa III and Neo-Palm. It is not revealed how Neo-Palm survived Dark Force's attack 1000 years ago, but Alisa III found success with five heroes: Orakio, Laya, her brother Lune, and Orakio's two droids, Siren and Miun.

		"Dark Force taunts the party one more time before going back to a 1000 year sleep, the hero destroys LaShute with a Megido spell, and Mieu saves the party with a Grantz spell she picked up back on Sage's Isle. Then the ending plays. For Aron, the Alisa-III is sucked into a black hole, and when they come out safely on the other side, they are approaching planet Earth, for a good future! For Nial's other son Adan, the ship is instead saved from the black hole, and then they also approach planet Earth, for a good future! For Ayn's son Crys, the ship is saved from eartquakes, and then they approach planet Earth, for a good future! And for Sean, the ship meets up with the Neo-Palm, and the sister ships promise to travel the stars together for mutual safety, presumably so they can eventually land on planet Earth, for a good future! ...All of which is weird, because according to the ending of Phantasy Star II 1000 years ago, planet Earth had already been destroyed, and the humans came to Palma in their own spaceship, and were the reason Palma exploded in the first place! This contradiction goes unexplained (can black holes cause time travel?) and PS III's Earth reveal was entirely corny anyway.

	": Honestly, it's amazing how a single new glitch can both streamline and complicate the game so much. You'd think being able to instantly win every non-boss battle would make things way easier, but it was clear watching that it turned the EXP/Meseta routing into a careful dance of figuring out what's most profitable and manipulable. Weirdly, I feel like the endgame would be the worst part of that, since you could in theory instantly clear every battle on the way, but the little bits of extra time might pile up too much in comparison to the time that could potentially be saved on Rulakir and Dark Force with the extra levels. I think you did a great job with the balance on that. The few battles that actually needed to be fought throughout the run felt like they couldn't possibly go any faster, and that's saying something given how every other battle that was "fought" ended instantly.
