[p 
	"This is a side-scrolling platformer/puzzle game based off Part II and III of the Back to the Future trilogy.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In Part II there are 30 items scattered throughout 16 streets in three different time periods. In order to get an item you have to get a key to unlock a door to the object room. In the object rooms you have to jump around and collect all the clocks and then a trophy appears which ends up being one of the items. Each item also has its own secret room to be dropped off in its correct time and place. Only two object rooms are completely unreachable and the only way to reach them is by getting a seed, planting it in 1955, then going to 2015 where it becomes a fully grown plant you can jump on. Part III is the same thing except there are only 10 streets in one time period (1875) you have to deal with. That means you don't have to worry about time traveling or having to plant seeds to reach certain places. The object rooms have pieces of gold to collect instead of clocks and a large block of gold appears after collecting all the small pieces of gold instead of a trophy. In both Part II and III you can collect the star icons that pop out of enemies to throw stones as your projectile weapon.

	"There is a sprite limit in this game that only allows 7 or 8 sprites on the screen at a time. If there's already at the limit, the items that are supposed to appear on screen at that moment won't show up (like some very important radioactive fuel units). The fish are the worst to deal with because they blow bubbles which means extra sprites on the screen.

[p 
	"I have to have 10 radioactive fuel units to time travel to an adjacent time period (1955 to 1985 or 1985 to 2015) but to time travel from 1955 to 2015 it costs 17. Sometimes I'll be running around looking for radioactive icons to time travel in this run because they get used up very quickly and I need to time travel so much to get to streets that aren't connected in that particular time period. The game will only allow you to have up to 40 of them and they stop appearing when you collect 30 of them. I go into bonus rooms where there are radioactive fuel units (there are 40 in that room). Also you can make them reappear by entering and exiting the screen via time travel or street exit but they only respawn about 4 or 5 times then they stop respawning.

	"I tried to kill the long waiting sequences for the slow-moving enemies. The worst enemies in the object rooms were the little frogs because their behavior is random (they can climb ropes and poles). Sometimes they get in the way when you try to climb a rope or slide down a pole and other times they won't. There are also these white glowing balls that home in on you if you stand in an area for too long. I also noticed something about the setup of these rooms. The clocks you collect are part of the background and they are always at the bottom left-hand corner of a "block" (16 pixels x 16 pixels). There are also pellets that fall from the top of the screen which appear in different patterns depending on randomness. Another interesting thing about the object rooms is that the type of platforms match the time period you are in.

	"It was really hard to decide which way to get the pieces of gold was the fastest because there were so many possibilities due to the breakable/placeable parts of the room. In some object rooms you literally have to wait for the falling blocks to pile up so that you can jump up to a higher area. I have tried getting up to higher places without having to do so but I couldn't find a way. The slow-moving enemies weren't really a problem in these object rooms. They still have the weird white glowing balls that try to home in on you.
