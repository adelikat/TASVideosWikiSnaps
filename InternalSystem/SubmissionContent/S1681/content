	"In addition to better precision, I found a multitude of new shortcuts and tricks.  I also exploit several programming errors.  Most noticeably is the ability to pass through solid objects.  This allows me to skip the boss fight of world 3 completely!
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Also, I used a speed potion in 1-3 as well as better abuses of speed & beachball potions.  It seems that there is a slight bug with them.  If you get ahead of the camera and move at the right angles you can get ridiculous speed boosts.  With the beachball I am able to completely move out of view of the camera.
	$LF

[p 
	"More abuses of the height boost by hitting corners.  If you dribble the ball into the edge of a platform you get a nice height and speed boost.  I use this numerous times to make jumps otherwise impossible or to cut corners more tightly.

	"The results of these tricks are quite apparent; leading to a much faster completion time and a much more entertaining movie.

	"I found that to return to a checkpoint, I don't need both glover and the ball resting on the ground before pausing.  I simply need the ball to be touching the ground on the frame that the game pauses.  This saves a load of time in a number of levels.

Notice that I smack the flying creature with the bowling ball just before hitting the crab creature.  This was to get him to recoil higher in the air.  This results in him attacking sooner after the crab is defeated.

I abused the pause+return to checkpoint to avoid the cutscene animation of smashing the button after the whack-a-mole game.  This also meant I didn't have to die, which saved some time.

I manage to get it to land on the wall (which is normally too high to get up to).  Then I use him to bounce glover up there.  This saved 1 cutscene.  It also meant skipping the hand wall much quicker.  Note: the reason I didn't get the ball onto the right side of the wall is because it is angled and the ball would roll off.

The big timer saver though is that I found out I don't need the big potion in order to move the big wooden box.  Glover can't move it himself, but for some reason, hitting the ball against it moves it!  I think this is a bug in the game.

	"I used ram addresses to find the boss HP.  It turns out his arms have 3 hp each and the body has 3.  But the body can't be damaged until the arms are destroyed.  Each has an invulnerability time as well.  So I crisscrossed hitting the arms to avoid having to wait for the invulnerability time.  I made each hit count this time and didn't miss a ton of shots.  The results is a lot cleaner looking and much faster.
