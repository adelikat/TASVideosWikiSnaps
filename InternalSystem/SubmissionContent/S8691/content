	"As mentioned above, a new method of zipping was discovered about a month ago that blew this game wide open again for TASing. If you are sliding in a narrow slide chute and the ground gives out beneath you while there is still more ceiling above you, you can wedge yourself into the ceiling by jumping on the exact frame the slide would end. After that, pressing facing left will cause you to zip at an extremely high speed. Since the Eins item(rising platform) can create these parameters on any ceiling, there are new zips on every stage after acquiring it.

As such, Grolla went from being relatively easy to manipulate a perfect fight in the previous route, to being one of the most restrictive RNG manipulation hurdles in the run with this route. I had to sacrifice a few frames to manipulate the optimal pattern, but I am certain using Hourglass to start the game on a different system clock value could theoretically yield a slightly faster fight.

You lose far too much time from jumping over all the pitfalls, and there's no way to kill the bat before it opens without Liebea's or Trauare's weapons. Furthermore, as a general rule, using Eins to do a zip through the ceiling just for horizontal movement is slightly slower than just sliding along the ground. When zipping through a ceiling, you gradually fall out of it if your entire hitbox isn't inside the wall/ceiling, so the higher you start the zip from, the longer the zip will last. And when using Eins to do a ceiling zip, you have to place the Eins low enough for Tia to stand on top of it for one frame, and then wait for the Eins to rise up high enough while Tia's sliding on it to get her high enough into the wall to get a decent zip distance.

You can make the 4 lemon fight faster by chaining frame perfect jumps before the fight to start much closer to Freudia and hit her sooner with your first shot, but there's no way to do this fight without getting hit by one of her attacks since you're much more restricted on movement keeping her under constant iframes.

While holding down the shoot fires Stachel in a uniformally oscillating up-and-down pattern, this fires them much less frequently than mashing at 20hz.

My first TAS was optimized by simply manipulating a small drop from nearly every enemy in the fortress stages, but you need so much more ammo now with zips that you have to take a decent number of big ammos. Because there's no avoiding them, you ideally want to route them in so you grab them you have 20 or more ammo. That way you get the quick refill ticks at the start of the animation, but skip the slower ones near the end.

Instead, it will always be consistently the same set of values regardless of how quickly you used up the previous cluster in a stage. But because the first cluster is based on system clock, any improvements made to earlier stages or changes to the ammo route that effects earlier stages will be impossible to resync.

You also want her to start on the 3rd thread again, and then go left on the first crossover. And lastly, you need her to not release any broodlings at the start, which kills half of your potential patterns anyway. You may notice the pattern I took did not meet all of these conditions, since she started on the first thread instead of the third. But since the first cycle's god pattern is significantly less probable than the second(I think), and I couldn't find a different one anywhere in the remote vicinity of this RNG, I took a 2nd cycle that was only 4 frames suboptimal since there weren't any god patterns within the limited amount of RNG values you can hit between cycles. The time loss comes from having to wait for Bosspider to cross over you at the start so your first shot doesn't hit her point blank.

The one before the OoB requires two Eins to pull off because of how quickly you approach it at terminal velocity. You need one Eins that's high enough to set up the zip quickly as well as one lower Eins to land on beforehand.

	"These same graphical glitches were present in my 2015 runs, and the consensus seemed to be it was because I was using System Memory for the Surface Memory setting in hourglass, which couldn't be changed because it had an effect on sync. I get the same graphical glitches in Windows XP regardless of whether I'm running the game through hourglass or not, and regardless of what graphical setting I'm using(I was able to get the run to sync with System and Local Memory). I also get them while running the game through hourglass in Windows 10, regardless of what graphics settings I'm using. Basically I have no idea how to get rid of the graphical glitches but I know it's possible since Bernka's runs didn't have them, and would appreciate any light anyone can shed on it.
