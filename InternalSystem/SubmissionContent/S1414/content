	"Where's Waldo is a simple game on Practice mode, but you can easily get frustrated on it. Poor timing is used in the programming, making you wait about 5 seconds before each level sometimes. The Subway Level requires extreme logic on hard mode, where if the picture of the wizard touches your arrow, the time limit rapidly decreases. The last level of the game is a slot mackine, where you have to matck 3 Waldos(Waldi?) to beat the level. The levels are, in order: Train Station, Forest, The Cave, The Fairground, The City, The Subway, the castle, and the moon.

	"Making this movie was extremely hard. I gave up twice, pressed the buttons at the wrong time a ton, got swallowed by wizard even more, and did a TON of sweeping. On the city level, I sweep to make the subway level easier. On the Subway level, I backtrack to manipulate the wizard to go to the space I want him to go to. Please enjoy. This took me a month.
