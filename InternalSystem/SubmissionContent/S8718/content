	"Jet Set Willy II+ is an enhanced remake of the sequel to the sequel to Manic Miner, written by one of the original JSW2 developers in 2017. 30 years after his wild party and massive ordeal in cleaning up, Willy tries to remember exactly how it happened; however, his memory is a little hazy and he may have confused some of those events with his favourite episodes of Star Trek.

	"The run is performed on the Sinclair ZX Spectrum +2A. JSW2+ does not attempt to control its framerate, it simply processes the game as quickly as it can at all times. 128K versions of the Spectrum run their Z80 processor at a slightly higher clock rate, and the +2A and +3 also have some improvements in memory access speeds. As a result, the game runs fastest on these models. The +3 is a disk-based system, and JSW2+ has never been officially released on disk, so the run uses the +2A and loads the game from tape.

	"Jet Set Willy required all 83 items to be collected before the game could be completed; JSW2 increased the item count to 175, but only required 150 of them. JSW2+ requires 298 of 325 (or 330); while technically more items can be left than in JSW2, this isn't the case proportionally, and results in more of the world being visited. Only the minimum number of items are collected and the slowest items to collect are omitted.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"As mentioned previously, JSW2+ does not attempt to control its framerate. When there is more to process, the game runs slower. As a result, the first action of the run proper is to turn off the in-game music, as this provides a considerable speed boost to the game.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"In addition, the run attempts to minimise jumping, as the game slows down a little while in the air. In best conditions, the game runs at approximately one in-game frame every 0.03 seconds, slightly faster than JSW2. For the rest of this section, "frame" refers to in-game frame.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Willy moves horizontally at two pixels per frame, whether on the ground or in the air. This means he travels across a cell in four frames. If this movement would cause him to enter a cell which contains a wall, it will be skipped and he will not move horizontally. Willy can turn around at any time while on the ground, but will not move that frame; however, unlike in past games a jump performed that frame will result in Willy moving horizontally while jumping.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Willy's jump carries him in a fixed arc, unless interrupted by a wall or floor. A jump lasts 18 frames, reaching a peak of 20 pixels above his starting position, allowing him to collect any item up to five cells above the ground he's standing on. This jump can be performed while stationary or while walking, the latter landing him 36 pixels away on flat ground. If he hits a ceiling during the jump, the jump will be cancelled and all movement, both vertical and horizontal, will stop, leaving him to start falling the next frame at 4 pixels/frame. If his horizontal movement is impeded during the jump, the jump will continue as normal without the horizontal movement until either the wall is no longer in the way or the jump ends. If Willy lands on solid ground before the jump is fully completed, or on completing the jump, the jump will be cancelled and he can continue walking without stopping. If he is still in the air on completing the jump, he starts falling at 4 pixels/frame.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Internally, staircases are cells which teleport Willy up or down a cell when you walk into/off them in the correct direction. His visual position is then lowered depending on his horizontal position to create the appearance of a smooth ascent/descent. Collision detection with guardians is done using his visual position, but everything else uses his internal position, most notably jumps (which can cause him to instantly shoot upwards six pixels before even starting the jump). If jumping onto a staircase means he lands on a cell having already moved partway into the next cell, he won't be warped upwards but instead will be able to walk through the staircase (this is an intended mechanic). It's also possible to jump through a staircase without landing on any of the cells that make up the staircase, in which case Willy will just continue his jump as normal; the run usually does this as it is faster than landing on it and falling.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Ropes swing in rooms in a fixed pattern; if Willy touches a rope he will grab onto it. Moving in the direction the rope is currently swinging climbs down the rope, and moving in the opposite direction climbs up it. Some ropes allow him to climb to the top of the screen and enter the screen above, although others prevent this.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"When Willy is standing on a conveyor, the game will internally press the movement key corresponding to the conveyor direction. In most cases this will force him in the direction of the conveyor. However, if both left and right inputs are pressed together, he will continue moving in whatever direction he is currently moving. This means if he walks onto a conveyor, or jumps onto it from below, he can walk against the direction the conveyor is moving. However, if he falls onto it from above, he can only stall movement before being forced in the direction of the conveyor. Many conveyors are disguised as normal platforms, and even some staircases are conveyors.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"JSW2+, like JSW2, has a quirk with regards to the edges of conveyors - if only one of the two cells Willy is standing on is a conveyor, Willy can jump in any direction, even directly opposite the one he is currently moving in. This is used a few times in the run to walk against conveyors that otherwise can't be walked against.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Willy can safely walk off a floor and land up to four cells (32 pixels) below; when jumping he can land up to two cells (16 pixels) below the starting point of the jump. Falling any further will cause him to die on landing. He will also die on entering a cell which contains a nasty (static enemy), or if his sprite touches that of a guardian (moving enemy) or arrow. JSW2+ ignores enemy collisions in some circumstances involving ropes that I don't fully understand.

It's possible to softlock the game by visiting certain rooms without clearing them, preventing you from passing the room from right to left.
