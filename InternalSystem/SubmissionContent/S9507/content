	": It always amuses me to see these lengthy rpg games being tased since it really shows exactly how quickly someone with perfect control of the game can defeat it.  Enjoyed the interesting glitch where you can cause a fight with a normal enemy right on the tile that is usually reserved for the boss, causing the boss fight to be considered complete.  I imagine this skips massive amounts of leveling and other preparations since the bosses are a non factor.  Normal fights are also kept to a minimum, and can be skipped with delaying frames.
