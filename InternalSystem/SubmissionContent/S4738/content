	"I noticed this game while browsing through old runs. It looked pretty fun and also easy to improve due to the intense lag. Most of the ~700 frame improvement here is lag reduction.

	"Getting a shooting powerup also helped reduce much of the lag, even though it also costs a couple frames to equip it and shoot behind you.

	"I thought this game was pretty cool, I had actually never heard of it before I saw it in the movie files. This was a side project as I struggle with the other ones. I suspect its probably possible to get a few more frames of savings, but I think 10 seconds of lag removed is enough to get this run more in line with current standards.
