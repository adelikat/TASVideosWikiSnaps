	": This was a nicely executed run, with some decent checkpoint skips. It's interesting to see a game which has a difficulty slider in the percentage range, instead of preset difficulty levels. It doesn't affect this particular run, though, because of it using 100% difficulty. The lack of audience responses does this submission a hindrance, and due to this, the entertainment value will be solely at my discretion. The run was decently entertaining, but I do not feel that it was entertaining enough to warrant a Moons rating.
