	"i should note something right off: i grab either ALL or NONE of the blue spheres in "Andy's Asteroids". a few people said it would be more entertaining getting them all, but in some instances (2), i couldn't get them all and nifboy said ALL or NOTHING, so i went with that. yes, some time is wasted at a screen afterwards, but it at least makes the repetetive "Andy's Asteroids" somewhat worthwhile.

	"i think people would like the result because this is a classic game with a lot of variety (seriously). and this one has an extra level the SNES version doesn't (Intestinal Distress). however, the SNES does have "Who Turned out the Lights?" which is missing from the genesis version. also, i personally find this version more fun than the SNES one.
