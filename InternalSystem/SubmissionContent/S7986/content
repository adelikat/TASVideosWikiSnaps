	"This submission is for Warlor-- er, Wayne Gretzky Hockey for the NES (I wonder how many times I'll get to use that joke.) It had real player names and relatively fast paced action but overall wasn't a very good game. You might recognize some sounds from other Bethesda NES titles like Where's Waldo?

	"Thanks to ViGadeomes for the review, I'll just mention that for timed games you won't be able to potentially delay game completion indefinitely, and there's little room for speeding it up really. So I think we should just look at a potential future improvement and go from there, because it's not often that a TAS would not even enter gameplay.
