It was the only place I managed to improve (I touched the entire stage 3), and then I just waited for the framewar to end to test that place again, and surprise, my instinct hasn't failed me, lol. It's just 3 frames faster than the fastest WIP by Memory but otherwise the framewar indeed looks done.
