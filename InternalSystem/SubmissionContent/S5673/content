	[em 
		"Track & Field
	]em
	" is an arcade game developed and published by Konami in 1983.  
	[em 
		"Track & Field
	]em
	" was developed to coincide with the then-upcoming 1984 Summer Olympics, and the original version (Japan's 
	[em 
		"Hyper Olympic
	]em
	") was licensed by the International Olympic Committee.  The game features 3 buttons, and no joystick.  
	[em 
		"Track & Field
	]em
	" rewards rapid button presses and precise timing in a unique and exciting way, and these concepts would define the genre for years to come.  Players would resort to all manner of trickery in an attempt to eke out as many button presses as possible, and button damage was rampant, causing later controls to adopt button guards for the Run buttons, and finally replace both with a trackball.  
	[em 
		"Track & Field
	]em
	" also bred fierce competition, particularly because players could compete head-to-head.  So much so in fact, that the game was at the center of history's largest arcade video game tournament, the "1984 March of Dimes International Konami/Centuri Track & Field Challenge", with over 1 million contestants worldwide.  Of technical interest, the game features early digitized speech, and is one of the first video games to feature parallax scrolling.

	": There has been a good amount of discussion about the goals of the submission, with the consensus being that the submission should have aimed for the highest possible scores. While maximum score is a valid category, going for the fastest completion is also a valid goal choice for this game. Going by the audience reception as well as my own thoughts, the game is just not Moons material, so fastest completion and maximum score are the only two valid categories.
