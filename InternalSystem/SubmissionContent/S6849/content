	"This is one of those games that will likely never see much activity or get much love. Like its predecessor, it has many shortcomings. Once you understand the game, I'm of the opinion that there is some fun to be had with it though (at least for a while). In 2014, I made a console speedrun of the game. While I expected a TAS to look very similar, I've still been interested to see how it would turn out. It took 6 years for me to get around to it though.

	"When this game was still "pristine territory", it offered an enjoyable routing exercise. The game expands on the first Ikari Warriors game, by including more weapon upgrades and each stage now ends with a boss. There are several routing options that initially make sense and needed to be tested. The number of options is however still fairly limited. Once they had been explored, the fastest route was quite easy to identify. The same route still applies to the TAS.

	"The first Ikari Warriors game ran at 15 fps. In the second game, it was bumped up to 20 fps. Cranking up the speed like this didn't come without drawbacks though. While the first game was lag-free, there is a bit of lag in the second game. Not a lot, but a few lag frames are unavoidable in some of the more crowded areas.
