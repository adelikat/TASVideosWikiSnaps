	"Some of the mouse inputs were a bit awkward to work with, mostly the letter scrolling and opening the cell door, which took 2 clicks.  It was also awkward to do the input for opening the lock as it took me awhile to figure out where I needed to keep the mouse.

	"Open the letter to start the game, take the pin off the picture of "Lovely Maria" to use it on the cell door, after holding the mouse to open the door, go to the guard's office.  Next you will interact with 3 items.  The wallet will tell us that it belongs to the guard, who has a picture of Maria inside, implying she has been cheating on us with the guard.  Next we find traces of poison on the soda can, the same poison used on us.  Finally we examine the security tapes to witness the guard delivering the letter to us.  After solving our own murder, we end the game by looking out the window to see our final view of the world, thus ending the game.
