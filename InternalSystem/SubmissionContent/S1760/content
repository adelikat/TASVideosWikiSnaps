		" I simply wanted to make a TAS of game that was familiar to me. During my childhood I had owned around 30 games for NES and when I looked at the videos on this page I noticed that this was one of few games I had back then which did not have a TAS for it. That is why I ended up with this.

	"I am very happy with this run, even though I am a beginner of making videos like this. Throughout the game I tried to play as accurate as it was theoretically possible. My main enemy during this run was the lagging, which I tried to reduce as much as possible.

	"The first level where you encounter lagging. Basically it occurs when a given number of enemies are on the screen at the same time. I am trying to kill as many enemies as possible to reduce this, if you see that the game is lagging and I nevertheless kill the enemies that is because you would lose time of doing so.

	"On this, I first thought you would earn time by going to the bonus stage and there kill you off right away and get teleported forward. This was not the case however, after taking both the ways it turned out that the non-bonus-way was the fastest by around 50 frames. Skipping the bonus also makes the movie more entertaining because at the bonus level the game stands still for some time.

	"One thing here worth to mention. On the third last chain that I climb up, I climb on the right side and just manages to kill the chicken. I did about the same thing in level 2 but this time it was tighter! I had 1 frame to turn around, jump and hit it. I tried it for a long time and didn't think it was possible, but then I suddenly made it - I must have done something special in the frames before that because I could only do it once which is very rare, but once is good enough!

	"A TAS of this game has earlier been submitted by Mukki in 16.22.78. However, on that video he plays the slot game between each level which takes about exactly 2 minutes. The improvement in the levels themselves are thus about 53-54 seconds and it is mainly because of more accurate playing, lag reduction and better boss strategies.
