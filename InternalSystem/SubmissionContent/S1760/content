		" I simply wanted to make a TAS of game that was familiar to me. During my childhood I had owned around 30 games for NES and when I looked at the videos on this page I noticed that this was one of few games I had back then which did not have a TAS for it. That is why I ended up with this.

This was not the case however, after taking both the ways it turned out that the non-bonus-way was the fastest by around 50 frames. Skipping the bonus also makes the movie more entertaining because at the bonus level the game stands still for some time.

I tried it for a long time and didn't think it was possible, but then I suddenly made it - I must have done something special in the frames before that because I could only do it once which is very rare, but once is good enough!

	"A TAS of this game has earlier been submitted by Mukki in 16.22.78. However, on that video he plays the slot game between each level which takes about exactly 2 minutes. The improvement in the levels themselves are thus about 53-54 seconds and it is mainly because of more accurate playing, lag reduction and better boss strategies.
