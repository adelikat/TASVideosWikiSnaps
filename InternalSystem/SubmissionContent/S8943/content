	"There is a selection of difficulty, but it only starts you off later in the game. According to the rules, this would be skipping content, so I start on the first level and play through to Level 20. On the final level, the last increase of a character occurs. The magazine article backs this up...so I decided to play it safe and stop on level 20.

	"I have spent about 1 1/2 years TASing this game. I've manually TASed, I've BOTed, I've tested strategies and routes...and now here is the final effort. The biggest issue is controlling RNG, which in this game...is EVERYTHING! You move one frame...RNG changes. You should a bullet...RNG changes. Pick up a spur...RNG changes. In fact, I dropped BOTing this game because I couldn't come up with any automation to assure the best optimization. I'll just say that I used every tool to get these results.
