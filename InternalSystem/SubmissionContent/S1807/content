	" Why this game
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"I decided to take on my first bigger challenge by trying to improve an already published movie. After some thoughts about which game to choose it suddenly just appeared to me - Why don't try it with one of my favorite games of all time, StarTropics!?

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Mike - the main character - is a 15 years old base ball player who comes to visit his uncle who lives on a tropical island. But once he comes there he is told that his uncle has been kidnapped and it's up to Mike himself to bring him back.

	" Technical things about the Game
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The game is quite similar to the "Legend of Zelda" games. You play it in two modes, one where you're in the tunnels -  kinda similar to the dungeons in Zelda - where you face enemies, and are of course able to attack them. The other is when you're walking in less dangerous areas and your only action is to be able to talk to people. For more info, especially about the weapons, take a look at

[h3 
	" My thoughts of it
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"To me, the greatness of this game lies within it's difficulty. I promise that if you're playing it for the first time and don't use any walkthroughs or other cheats, it will take you a good time to get through it. It contains two of the greatest riddles (I think) in game history, even though one is kinda destroyed if you play it on emulator, and for most of the tunnels, you have to do something unexpected in order to get through them.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" A small necessary spoiler
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"As we all know who have beaten this game, it has a great ending. However, in this run you want see it all since I'm abusing a programming error which cuts about half of it. I won't tell about it in detail but just don't wait for the full ending ok.
	$LF

[h3 
	" 8 Frame Rule
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This was a feature I discovered early in the TAS. It works about the same as the 21 frame rule in SMB. Basically it works in the way that the screen can only start to black out in a frame dividable by 8, sometimes it's differs by one frame but that's basically how it works. I think I managed to gain a few seconds by having the knowledge of this mechanism as I from here will refer to as 8FR.
