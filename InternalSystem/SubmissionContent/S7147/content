	"Solomon's Club is a puzzle game released in 1991 for the Gameboy. It differs in a few ways from the more well-known 1986 Solomon's Key on the NES. Notably: The stages are smaller in size; Dana (the player character) can visit shops to buy upgrades; there are no warps.

	"The "jump after falling" glitch from the NES version does not work here. The quick recovery from accurate jumps onto blocks also does not work.

	"The shoes upgrade gives faster movement and more horizontal jump distance, so it is the first shop purchase. The hat upgrade lets Dana smash breakable blocks using only one smack of the head rather than two, so it is the second shop purchase. After that, the shops are mostly avoided because they are an enormous time sink. The exceptions are two visits to stock up on fireballs used to save time in key levels, and then a final shop visit to get 3 water guns used on flames in the Solomon levels.
