[p 
	"You are an ace helicopter pilot tasked with rescuing prisoners of war from enemy camps and returning them to the home base.  There are a total of 64 POWs that need saving, but you can only carry 16 at a time.  Thus multiple trips to/from the POW camps are necessary.  The game ends when you lose 3 helicopters or all POWs are either dead or rescued.

	"Given that there are only 4 camps, this is a rather brief game when TASed.

		"In what seems backwards as far as a difficulty curve, the first group of POWs is strangely the most difficult because they have already escaped their camp and are spread out running around openly in the fields.  This requires multiple takeoffs and landings to pick them all up in the fastest time.
