	"Also just in time to be a week late for Halloween; the TAS clocks in at 8666 frames. No one can escape the number of the beast. Rev A was used but I'm not sure what the differences are.

	"Anyway, there is actual "gameplay" for a few seconds of menuing. You enter your name, birthday, and gender. Then you "ask a question" which is impossible because there's no question mark and very limited space to write anything in. Plus most of the cards are gibberish and don't really answer anything. So we just hit the spacebar to have it render nothing (which is faster than rendering not nothing) and get out faster.

	"After the shuffle relents and your eyes readjust themselves back to reality, the game shows your outcome, one by one for the 10 cards. To advance to the next card you can press any button, but it only opens up 255 frames after the card is shown, so we advance on the first possible frame.
