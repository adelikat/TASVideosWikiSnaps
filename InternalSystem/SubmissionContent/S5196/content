	"Metroid Prime Hunters is a spinoff of the Metroid Prime series for the Nintendo DS. The game notably plays a lot closer to more traditional FPSes than its console siblings and the focus of development was more on the multiplayer. The game was developed by Nintendo Software Technology instead of Retro Studios and runs off of a completely different engine. The story of the single player campaign is that a message about an "Ultimate Power" residing in the Alimbic Cluster was sent out across the galaxy. Samus and 6 other hunters compete to be the first to get the 8 Octoliths in order to get the Ultimate Power.

	"The goal of the game is simple: get the 8 Octoliths to gain access to the final area Oubliette and defeat Gorea. To get an Octolith you need to collect the 3 artifacts correspond with a Stronghold Portal that takes you to a boss which has an Octolith. There are six other hunters that you're supposed to fight along the way or something but in this TAS, we only fight two. Each Hunter has an affinity for a different weapon that you can find and pickup throughout the adventure.

	"When I gain control, I shoot the door and jump as soon as I can. I then morph and start touch boosting as much as I can before I hit the ramp. Downwards speed accumulates when you spam boost and if you hit a ramp with a lot of downwards speed, it will transform into horizontal speeds greater than that of which you can obtain by simply boosting on the ground. This is done a fair amount throughout the TAS.

Charging your Power Beam first requires you to shoot off a couple of regular shots and I want to start charging as soon as I fire the shot that kills the enemy that gives the drop. The charge beam will drag pickups to you.

	"An unmorph clip in the beginning of Data Shrine 01 allows me to skip going around the outside of the room and instead just enter the center of the room from the door that you're supposed to use to leave. It would be faster to just go straight into the center section and not bother making it visible, but I figured that having too many invisible sections like that would detract from the entertainment. In that central area, I do another boost clip to get underneath the first artifact and grab it from below. Collision in this game is essentially 1 sided so you can pass through floors from underneath and the like.

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Volt Driver is extremely overpowered in a TAS, it has a very short cooldown (4 frames at 30FPS, 8 frames in a 60FPS emulator) between regular shots and those regular shots do 14 damage each. Power Beam shots have a 3 frame cooldown but only deal 6 damage each. Volt Driver deals the second highest damage per second in the game, only beaten by Boost Ball, however Volt Driver works on a lot more targets than Boost does. However, certain enemies and bosses may have weaknesses to other weapons or resistances to certain weapons, and volt driver is a common resistance among later bosses. The developers didn't expect you to have volt driver this early so a lot of early-game bosses do not resist volt driver.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"It is important to stay out of bounds while grabbing volt driver because there is currently no way to get out of the middle section without Battlehammer. I land on the edge of the floor after grabbing battlehammer making sure to not get pushed inbounds or fall off into the abyss. I then perform a bomb unmorph jump to allow me to do the second reason I did the clip: I skip going around the outside of the room, avoid triggering a cutscene with Kanden who is the first enemy hunter, and gets me a really quick missile expansion that I use to do more missile jumps and missile pushes.

	"Dann, an amazing glitch hunter for the game and real time runner came up with this strategy for the Cretaphid fights. You're supposed to circle around the boss shooting the targets on the side as they turn blue, and then shoot the exposed core. With clever boosting and bomb usage, you can hit the targets on all sides of the boss from the inside. The core of this Cretaphid doesn't resist Volt Driver so I spam uncharged shots whenever it's exposed.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"As the boss is dying I head to the center of the arena where the Octolith will spawn. Normally 3 cutscenes play: 2 can be skipped, the other cannot. Normally heading to the center will overlap the two cutscenes that can be skipped and play out the unskippable cutscene. However by pausing the game for long enough after the first skipped cutscene, I force the second skippable cutscene to play at the same time as the unskippable cutscene, allowing for me to skip the otherwise unskippable cutscene.

	"Instead of escaping from CA the way the game intends me to, I take the Volt Driver door leading to what is normally visited after going to Vesper Defense Outpost to obtain Battlehammer. I have to go through this area regardless, and there is a portal I can use to get to my ship without going back through the rooms I already visited. Portals leading back to the ship tend to only work if they're meant to be used for a different visit and if you have only activated them during the escape of a different visit. So by taking the Volt Driver door, I make progress towards reaching the boss of CA2 while escaping CA1.
