	"This is an unreleased game by Nintendo, the sequel to the original Star Fox.  The game was completely finished but never released.  Instead, several elements from the game were reused in Star Fox 64, such as all-range mode and the Star Wolf team.  It's a pretty fun game; I recommend playing it if you like Star Fox games.

	"Andross is back with some new tricks up his sleeve.  Not only has he hired Star Wolf to combat Fox and friends, but he has also changed his attack strategy.  Instead of taking over the Lylat system linearly as in the last game, Andross sends his forces all over the map and launches missiles from several directions at once.  This forces Star Fox to fly around and take down the enemy bases strategically.  Of course, since this is a TAS, everything is dispatched speedily with no damage taken to Corneria or the Arwings.

		" It is faster to rapid-fire charge shots when in flying form, because normal twin blasters do 2 damage and charge shots do 10 damage to enemies.  The more powerful kind of twin blasters do 4 damage, so it is better to fire uncharged shots when in walking form.  This is why I beat Tal Kong with four charged shots, then use normal shots against the core.
