It is only then you realize that not only will you have to dodge spiders and snakes as you move from floor to floor, the building's security system (for some insane, ungodly reason) requires six signal pads to be triggered before the door will open for the elevator to the next floor.

[div class=p 
	"On top of all that, on each individual floor, the signal pads begin moving around once one of them has been triggered; making your task that much more difficult.  To add even more confusion; as each signal pad is triggered, a random effect will occur on that floor.  These random effects may impact you (the rat itself), the snakes/spiders, the walls of the level itself, or possibly even release a mechanical security guard hellbent on permanently interrupting your quest.

All enemy movement as well as signal pad movement is affected by RNG, thus it's absolutely possible there are better routing options.  While I feel there may be room for improvement in this area, changing RNG anywhere will affect all subsequent aspects of the run requiring significant re-syncing if not a complete re-do of all subsequent levels to that change.
