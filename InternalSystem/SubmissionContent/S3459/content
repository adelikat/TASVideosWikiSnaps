	"Treasure Island Dizzy is one of four games on a compendium called Quattro Adventure which also contained Linus Spacehead, Super Robin Hood and Boomerang Kid.

	"To win the game you must collect various pieces over the beach that were used to access other locations to finally escape the island. The controls for the game are quite simplistic and not very responsive so much of the optimization had to come from finding the optimal route.

	"To complete the game acquiring coins is unnecessary but you get a "bad ending" result after you cross the waterway in the boat. Not collecting the coins would probably save around a minute but I chose to collect to get the best ending.

	"Overall this is in my opinion far from the most interesting game but is completed quickly and hopefully is entertaining. It was on the list of ideas so I am hoping that there is a fan base out there who would appreciate the work.

	"Thanks to Bag of Magic Food for his help with route planning and help overall. This run would be worse without your input.
