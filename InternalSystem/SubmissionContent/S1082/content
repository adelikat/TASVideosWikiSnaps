	"Allright, this is my first TAS. I chose Zelda 2 as it's my favorite game, and I think it makes an interesting video if done fast. If you were following my progress on the forums, you'll know this is my second attempt. It's 1:28 faster than my first test run, mainly due to more precise play and better planning of items dropped from enemies.

	"The item drops to refill my magic (or get extra points) drop from every sixth large or every sixth small enemy, and they will drop only one of the two randomly. To get the one I wanted, I had to kill the enemy in a certain position. Most enemies were very co-operative, so this wasn't much of an issue.

[div class=p 
	"What I wasn't aware of in my first run though, was that some enemies do not count toward the six count, such as blue ironknuckles, red armoured stalfos, and the fire wizards of palace five, among some others. This led to some major backtracking, and accounts for about thirty seconds of the time saved from the previous run.

	"To manipulate encounters on the world map, I had to wait a few frames either on the map or in the last sidescroller screen. Some enemy groups were much more co-operative than others. Random encounters I did get into were deliberate, and overwrit a preset action scene on the world map. Each time I do this it saves a couple seconds.

	"For fighting against most enemies I come across, I use one of two main techniques unless the enemy is vulnerable to the sword beam.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The first I have dubbed the _Whirlwind Slash_. While in midair, if you swing the sword an alternate between left and right every other frame, you can hit the enemy three times in one attack provided you're close enough to them. I sometimes open this with a quick crouching stab followed by a whirlwind slash, allowing four hits in one attack. This is how I'm able to kill enemies so quickly even when my attack is very low. This saved a LOT of time, up until I got the downstab and it became somewhat less useful.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The second is the rapid downstab move I have decided to call the _Jackhammer Attack_ (because it sounds cool). Theoretically, you could press down every frame to hit the enemy but every four attacks or so you'll have to thrust for at least two frames to bounce back off the enemy, otherwise you'll fall through. I tried to do this with upward momentum whenever possible to not lose momentum as I strike the enemy.
