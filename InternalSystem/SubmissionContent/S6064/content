	"I jump over ledges and throw berries at enemies.  I try to not spend time attacking the grasshoppers and instead damage boost through them as it's faster.  a few instances where I have to jump over some worms that pop up as I don't want to take damage from them.

	"the most painfully slow level in the game.  first I have to ride the beetle to knock down pillars and to launch past the falls, then I have to shoot the other dude into the grasshopper 3 times, the 3rd time I wait because I cant hit him right away like the others.  I also have to manipulate the caterpillar to not sleep next to the golden leafs, then I have to wait for the spider to make webs to cross.  all extremely slow.

	"so yeah, this game sucks a lot, the SNES version is probably the worst version to play casually as it's hard to control.  the Genesis version is a lot better gameplay wise because the controls are better, I might do that version eventually, but I wanted to do this version as it's the most well known version.
