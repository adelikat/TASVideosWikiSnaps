The Sariens, who have a grudge against Roger's people, steal the Star Generator--a device to create a new sun out of a lifeless planet--from the Arcada intending to use it's power to destroy Roger's home planet of Xenon (think Death Star).

		"Certain commands in the game advance the random seed by calling the random function to yield a random response from the game.  One of these commands is simply typing 'y' and hitting enter to advance the RNG seed one step in its sequence.  This was used frequently to obtain an ideal seed value for a desired outcome.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"A spreadsheet for the sequence of random seed values was developed based on the randomization formula.  Though, this was initially created to aid in optimizing the slot machine sequence, we also realized that it could be used to predict and manipulate other aspects of RNG from Sarien guards, the rocks in the skimmer sequence, to even the drips of acid in the Kerona underground.  Utilizing this RNG-seed spreadsheet we determined a value for the initial random seed that would yield no guards patrolling on the Arcada as well as opportunity to manipulate the longest delay for the arrival of the Spider droid on Kerona.
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				"However, we were initially unsure how exactly to obtain this value for our initial random seed.  We knew the value was tied to how many milliseconds after midnight the initial seed was set, but we did not know the exact mathematical formula for how it was calculated.  Through a combination of brute force testing and mathematical calculations, we were able to craft a second spreadsheet which gave us the initial seed value based on the initial RTC time setting.  We then started the run with this RTC value set at assembly in the emulator.

				"Though possible, we did not use RNG manipulation to manipulate the rock placements during the Sand-Skimmer sequence.  c-square developed an lua script that attempted to avoid/control rocks during the sequence, but it was not utilized in the final TAS, as the sequence itself is a timed event.  Manipulating RNG would not have saved time, but may have made the movements easier.

				"We got lucky on the RNG for whether or not the skimmer is stolen in Ulence Flats and didn't require manipulation to not have it stolen.
				$LF

				"'y' commands are used a couple times on the Deltaur after obtaining the Pulse Ray to manipulate the appearance of guards instead of the killer droid.  Further manipulation could be utilized to eliminate guard encounters, but would take more time than just shooting the guards.

		"Arcada:
	]b
	" It is possible to complete the game without obtaining certain bits of information normally needed to progress in the game.  This run skips learning about the data cartridge from the dying scientist. It skips obtaining and later reading said cartridge to get the self destruct code for the Star Generator. (Side Note-these actions were made necessary in the VGA remake via copy protection/RNG means.)  Thankfully, Roger is only required to obtain the keycard necessary to access the lower levels of the ship and escape.

His remains are then taken to the underground caverns ignoring the spider droid.

Radiant figured out that you must be instructed to kill Orat by the underground alien before this method will work.)
