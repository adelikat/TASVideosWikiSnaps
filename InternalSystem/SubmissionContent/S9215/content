However, due to an oversight these effects only have a ~99.6% chance to occur, or rather a 1/256 chance to not occur. This is similar to a "Gen 1 miss." This is used extensively with the move Mud-Slap, which is supposed to always drop accuracy.

This is similar to Gen 1's bike shop instant text exploit, although it goes away after the level up is done. This is not used by this TAS, as so far there isn't any place where using a Rare Candy helps, but is considered possibly useful for this TAS goal.

	"The main change in this TAS is to simply not use Hidden Power, instead opting to use Mud-Slap (for ghost types) or bruteforce through with normal type moves, which ends up saving quite a bit of time. The timeloss from getting Hidden Power does not justify just dealing with Mud-Slap in Morty's gym.

	"Eventually, Iron Tail is learned in order to cover Raticate's type weaknesses. Iron Tail is notably learned fairly early: this is due to bag lag. The more TMs/HMs accumulated will cause more lag scrolling down the bag. Using the bag to teach Iron Tail and Whirlpool when this lag is minimal saves a considerable amount of time, more than trying to combine later menus gives.
