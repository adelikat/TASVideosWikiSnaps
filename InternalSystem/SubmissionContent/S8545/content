	"While working on the branchless "warps" run in 2019, I could not scrimmage through the ROM hack's levels with SMB Utility (which only supports .nes files); to this day, I still have yet to find a level editor suitable for FDS Super Mario Bros. ROMs. Even knowing that Tonkachi Editor, the unlicensed FDS ROM hacking tool used to make this hack, exists, it looks to be a complex tool to comprehend. I could certainly take a look at it and do research on it, but certainly, it can't match the simplicity of SMB Utility.

Perhaps if future improvements can be found in the earlier levels and executed without fail, this pattern might be re-earned quicker.

	" for the research on how Tonkachi Mario was built. I was pretty excited to finally have a run published here on TASVideos, and I feel quite proud about it too; It was nice knowing that I was careful about what I could submit as well (and I still am).
	[br

	"After two April Fools submissions, surely I knew the ins and outs of what could be published and what couldn't. I strived to make sure only the best-quality runs of mine were to be submitted and that I was given the okay from other users (especially judges).

	"Super Mario Bros. ROM hacks do not have the best chances of being publication-worthy unless something about them truly stands out, usually regarding gameplay elements.

While I couldn't make every improvement like I hoped (especially on World 4-2, World 4-3, World 6-1, World 8-3, and World 8-4), I'm surprised to have beaten Bacon_Hurricane_, Periwinkle, and Pixel_'s run by a lot.
