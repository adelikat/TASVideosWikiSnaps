The movie was first submitted as "100%", but didn't qualify under that category as proven by the published "100%" TAS on the NES version. Then it was changed to "warpless" because it didn't qualify for "100%", but doesn't qualify for that either as proven by the published "warpless" TAS also on the NES version. There is also the huge suboptimality issues throughout the run and fails under site rules as a result.
