	"This TAS is for the "Any% No Void Travel" category. This means beating the game as fast as possible without using the void travel glitch. To explain what this means briefly: the world in Star Fox Adventures is basically 1 giant map, and all of the levels are somewhere on this grid (it's technically 3 maps, but 1 map contains almost all of the levels). The game checks on each frame if Fox is in a grid cell which has a map loaded in it, and if Fox isn't, then the game freezes Fox in place and you softlock.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Void Travel is a glitch that effectively disables this collision check, and also prevents Fox from interacting with most triggers. This in turn would let us swim straight to the end of the game, at which point we would need to use a stale pointer that gets overwritten in order to trick the game into activating a save trigger.

[div class=p 
	"In this game, you play as Krystal and as Fox McCloud, in a quest to save Dinosaur Planet from destruction by the evil General Scales. Krystal manages to collect and release 1 Krazoa Spirit - but then she gets trapped in a crystal (lol) for the rest of the game, and Fox needs to collect and release the remaining 5 Krazoa Spirits in order to both free Krystal and save Dinosaur Planet (which has been torn apart into multiple pieces due to the Spellstones and Krazoa Spirits being removed from their original locations by General Scales). Along the way, you collect and place 4 SpellStones. You also collect and release 5 more Krazoa Spirits as well. At the end of the game, after releasing the 6th Krazoa Spirit, you save Krystal, but it's revealed that Andross was the real evil mastermind who was just using General Scales as his pawn. You then kill Andross, which saves Dinosaur Planet and beats the game.

	"The main initial goal of this TAS is to collect SpellStone 2 and SpellStone 4. Then, placing SpellStone 2 in the Ocean Force Point Temple unlocks the ability to place SpellStone 4, and placing SpellStone 4 activates the warp portal in Walled City so that Fox can warp to the 5th Krazoa Spirit Trial. Getting the 5th Krazoa Spirit then lets us get and release the 6th Krazoa Spirit a few minutes later, which sends us to the final boss fight against Andross.

[div class=p

[dl 
	[dt 
		"Ladder Grab Canceling
	]dt
	[dd 
		" When Fox rolls over the edge of a ladder, if we release the control stick, then Fox will fall past the ladder without grabbing onto it - which saves a few seconds. The only ladder in the whole game that this doesn't work on is the ladder which leads down from the sewers to ThornTail Hollow. This same trick also works on all grabbable/climbable walls in the game except for the one leading into the ThornTail Hollow shop. This trick is used basically everywhere in the TAS to save time, and RTA speedrunners of the game use it everywhere as well.
		$LF
	]dd
]dl
[dl 
	[dt 
		"Ledge Grab Canceling
	]dt
	[dd 
		" Certain ledges in this game have grab triggers on them, which means that Fox is supposed to be forced to grab onto them and drop down when he goes off the edge. However, by rolling back and forth almost exactly parallel to the ledge (but moving slightly close to the edge each time), we can get close enough to the edge that the grab trigger doesn't activate when we go over it, which lets us fall without grabbing the ledge (saving a few seconds). This is used a handful of times in the TAS, and is too difficult for RTA speedrunners to do.
		$LF
	]dd
]dl
[dl 
	[dt 
		"Shield Hovering
	]dt
	[dd 
		" By alternating pressing shield (R) and roll (X) while going down a slope, Fox can maintain his height while moving forwards. This in turn can allow us to get out-of-bounds and clip through certain walls which only have collision right where they touch the ground. Note that if Fox is more than a few feet above the ground, then the game will force him to enter his falling animation, and he will lose the ability to roll again in mid-air. As such, this trick is not as powerful as you might expect. Nevertheless, we use this trick 2 times in this TAS - both of which are in SnowHorn Wastes: once to unlock Dark Ice Mines Early, which saves us about 3 minutes, and once to clip through the gate blocking the 2 fuel cells near Garunda Te in order to save 5 seconds. Shield Hovering is used by the top RTA runners in order to unlock Dark Ice Mines Early as well, but most find it very difficult.
		$LF
	]dd
]dl
[dl 
	[dt 
		"Airswimming
	]dt
	[dd 
		" When Fox is swimming, he will only stop swimming when his feet touch the ground. But what happens if Fox enters a swimming state in mid-air, with no ground below him? The answer, is that Fox can continue swimming in mid-air, which is called an airswim! He will keep swimming until his feet touch the ground, at which point he will cancel his swim. This trick is used to skip paying the BribeClaw (and to skip some cutscenes) in SnowHorn Wastes, it's used to reach Cape Claw without opening the gate to get in (also known as Cape Claw Early), it's used to reach the 3rd Krazoa Spirit Early (and without needing to complete the LightFoot Village challenges), it's used to skip a cutscene with the Queen EarthWalker before unlocking Walled City, and it's used to reach the 4th Krazoa Spirit Early (which skips the need to collect/place SpellStone 3). This all saves a ginormous amount of time - probably over an hour! RTA runners also use airswimming many times as well.
		$LF
	]dd
]dl
[dl 
	[dt 
		"Camera Lock
	]dt
	[dd 
		" If Fox feeds Tricky on the same frame that he crawls into a tunnel or grabs onto a climbable wall/ladder, then the camera will enter a weird state. Fox then targets (pressing L) to get out of this state, and enters a different map. When Fox feeds Tricky again on this new map, the camera will lock in place - which will stay that way until Fox presses target again. If we lock the camera on the edge of 1 map and then enter a 2nd map, then we can bypass triggers which are located at the edge of the 2nd map! This is used three times in this TAS: twice to get the Ground Quake Early, and once to skip the cutscene of the Queen EarthWalker talking to Fox after placing SpellStone 4. This trick is also used by RTA runners as well.
		$LF
	]dd
]dl
[dl 
	[dt 
		"Ground Quake Hovers
	]dt
	[dd 
		" If Fox activates the Ground Quake spell right on the frame that he goes over an edge, then he will do the Ground Quake suspended slightly in mid-air. When this Ground Quake ends, Fox can do a frame-perfect roll followed on the next frame by pressing Ground Quake (a double-frame-perfect trick) in order to move a little bit further forwards in mid-air and activate another Ground Quake. This process can then be repeated to move Fox forwards in mid-air. This is used only once in this TAS - which is to skip the Ice Blaster (and, by extension, SpellStone 1) by getting around the flames in Krazoa Spirit Challenge 5. This is the only reason the TAS even bothers grabbing the Ground Quake, and this trick results in a net timesave of 15 minutes (even including the time it takes to pick up the Ground Quake)! This trick is extremely TAS-only.

[h2 id=EventStorageWarp 
	" Event Storage Warp:
	$LF
]h2
[div class=p 
	"Event Storage Warp (or ESW, for short) is a glitch which is so important that it gets its own section here! Essentially there are around 20 special ESW triggers throughout the game. When the player hits one of these triggers, it sets a flag that the player should respawn at the ESW trigger when they next die/void out with all of the game bits/memory set to what they were when Fox hit the ESW trigger. However, if you load a different file from the one that hit the ESW trigger and die, then you will still respawn at the ESW trigger you originally hit! Furthermore, if Fox saves after hitting an ESW trigger but before dying/respawning, then the lower half of save memory at the moment Fox saved will be copied over the lower half of the game's flags (which stores Fox's inventory and most important game progression flags). As such, we can hit an ESW trigger in 1 file, load a 2nd file which has an important item we need, and then die+save+continue, and we will respawn at the ESW trigger with the item we collected in the 2nd file! This is very useful, since there are 2 points in the game where we would be softlocked after collecting an important item (after getting K3 and K4), and this lets us escape with the important items still in our inventory!
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Note that if we hit a save trigger after hitting an ESW trigger, it will cancel the ESW (since the save trigger overwrites the ESW flags). Save triggers are points in the game that Fox respawns at if he touches them and then saves+quits and loads the file from the main menu. Also note that the file that gets overwritten when we next save after dying for an ESW is the last file that we selected on the title screen (i.e. the file we died on). Lastly, Fox's respawn position after doing a savewarp is stored separately from ESW data, and doesn't get updated until Fox actually hits a save trigger after dying and saves the game. This effect will be important for us later on in CloudRunner Fortress.
	$LF
]div

		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Walking With Shield-Canceled Rolling - The fastest form of movement in the game. If we press shield 29 frames after rolling and then press roll on the frame after this, we will be able to roll with a much higher average speed. This is about 7% faster than walking, and 4% faster than walking with rolling. Furthermore, we can completely change angles on the same frame that we roll following a shield press, which allows for really quick angle changes. We try to use this as much as possible - and basically only resort to walking with rolling when playing as Krystal (who can't shield due to not having the staff) or when Fox loses his staff.

[h2 id=SaveTriggers 
	" Save Triggers:
	$LF
]h2
[div class=p 
	"The way saving in this game works is as follows: when Fox saves+quits, he will respawn at wherever the last save trigger he activated was with all of the game progress/items he had at the moment that he saved. Some save triggers are activated from a cutscene playing (like when Fox lands on a planet), and others are activated from Fox walking into/colliding with them. If Fox dies and doesn't save, but does continue, then Fox will respawn at the last save trigger he hit with the progress/items he had when he last hit the save trigger (NOT the items he had when he actually died). As a result of this, if I'm just dying to re-load the map I'm on and Fox has just hit a save trigger, then I don't save after I die. You'll see this occur twice in the TAS (once to re-load glitched Ice Mountain after opening the gate, and once to re-load ThornTail Hollow after landing in ThornTail Hollow with some of the objects missing due to the Arwing Glitch).

However, DIME skips all of this by using a shield hover to get out-of-bounds. Shield hovering is when we alternate pressing shield and roll every other frame, which lets Fox maintain height on downwards slopes. It only works for a small amount of height before the game forces Fox to fall, however, so it just barely works to get us OOB here (RTA runners do this trick, but it's considered one of the hardest tricks of the run). Once we're OOB, we do another quick shield hover to get to the other side of the fence. After that, we walk around the map OOB, and then fall back in-bounds on the other side of the locked key-door.

More importantly, we skip past the cutscene of Tricky running to his mom, and we skip Fox needing to go to the Queen EarthWalker to watch a cutscene where he finds out that Tricky's mom is sick in order to get Tricky to come back to Fox. This trick requires us to get out-of-bounds, so we start by once again doing the 2 shield hovers needed to get OOB. We then navigate half in the wall out-of-bounds, and then we fall into the edge of the water while still half OOB. Since Fox's swim won't cancel until his feet touch the ground, this lets us swim in mid-air (known as an airswim), which we use to get behind an OOB wall. From here, we walk above where the BribeClaw is that we would normally need to pay to get back, and then fall into the tunnel (half in the wall) from above. We need to enter first-person mode (by pressing Z to zoom) at the edge of the map, since we skipped hitting a bunch of load triggers. This works in a couple of places in the game, where pressing Z at the edge of the map can force the next area to load. After this, we continue walking half in the wall, and start another airswim in the sewers. We cancel our airswim at the end of the sewers while half in the wall.

This works because in DIM, there's a special trigger called an ESW trigger. There's only about 20 of these throughout the game. When Fox hits an ESW trigger, the game sets a flag that Fox should respawn at the ESW trigger if he dies or falls into a void-out area. Furthermore, the game sets it so that Fox will respawn at the ESW trigger with all of the items/game progression flags set that he had when he collided with the ESW trigger after he dies. Most importantly, ESW triggers work across files. That is, if Fox hits an ESW trigger in file 1 and then dies in file 2, he will respawn at the ESW trigger in file 1! The next time we save, the last file that we selected from the title screen (the file that we died on) will be overwritten with the state memory is in after we respawn at the ESW trigger. In this case, we have Fox hit the ESW trigger in DIM, and then immediately save+quit. We then load the Krystal file and void out. This makes us respawn at the ESW trigger in DIM with our inventory/game flags in the same state as they were in the 1st file (in other words, a full file copy).

Notably, certain game progression flags would still be set to the values they had in the 1st file when we hit the ESW trigger. This is because only the lower-half of the game's state is copied when you save after hitting an ESW trigger (which includes the parts in memory that specify Fox's inventory), and the high memory bits remain unchanged. The high memory bits are mostly just used for minor temporary flags - with the 1 notable exception being the flag that says that Fox has already placed SpellStone 4.

Additionally, there is a LightFoot with a fire gem that spawns in this version of CC, and there's a save trigger in front of the SharpClaw Door in CC that isn't present in CC1. Lastly, this is the only version of CC where you can lower the water in the Krazoa Statue (this happens when you grab a Fire Gem from the statue. However, if you grab this Fire Gem when not in CC2, then the cutscene of the water being lowered doesn't play).

There's also a rock blocking the entrance to the Krazoa Statue by where the SharpClaw door was. This rock also blocks the SharpClaw trigger next to the SharpClaw Door - meaning that if we enter CC3 without having opened the SharpClaw Door in CC2, then there will be no way for us to open it here!

Walking all the way to CC and back just to open 1 door would be extremely slow. As such, we can use a series of ESWs to quickly reach CC with the SharpClaw Disguise (which will cause CC2 to load). After opening the door, we can then ESW back to CRF and continue on our way (with the flag that the door is open saved in memory, since this is copied with Fox's inventory flags when you ESW).

		" In normal gameplay, in order to get the 4th Krazoa Spirit (or K4, for short), Fox would need to first collect and place SpellStone 3 (or SS3, for short). After arriving back in TTH after placing SS3, Fox would then do a side-quest to save the dinosaurs in TTH from attacking bats to get another wallet upgrade. He would then use this wallet to buy the SnowHorn Artifact, and would use this in SHW to activate a timed challenge. After beating the challenge, the gate blocking the warp portal to K4 would open. This would allow Fox to collect and release K4. Releasing K4 is the trigger that allows us to reach Dragon Rock (the final level of the game), so we can't skip getting K4. However, by doing this glitch, we CAN skip collecting and placing SS3 (along with all of the associated side-quests that come after this), and instead immediately grab K4!

Only 1 tile in each row is safe to walk on, however, and if you touch the wrong one, the game throws Fox back to the start of the puzzle. The pattern for the electric tile puzzle is completely controlled by RNG, and it gets initialized when you walk past the sliding door up ahead.

The puzzle solution is represented in memory as a sequence of 6 numbers from 1-4 describing the safe square in each row, where 1 is the first column and 4 is the last column. There are 6 rows to the puzzle here, which means we want to get a pattern of 111 111. Since the game just picks a random number and divides by 4 for each row to set the puzzle's pattern, that means there's a 1/4^6 chance of getting the 111 111 pattern, which corresponds to a 1/4096 probability.

If it did, then the program would output a movie file representing the inputs that were actually done between when the save state was loaded and when the pattern was set.

Rather, the flag is only copied from the file that hit the ESW trigger (and the flag would need to have been set before we hit the ESW trigger as well). Since there's no ESW trigger in-between OFPT and TTH, that means we have no way to ESW out of here without the game resetting the flag that we placed SpellStone 4 - which would prevent us from being able to warp to K5, causing a softlock.

Once there, we are able to roll past the rock that's blocking the door to escape, since it only blocks Fox from entering the Statue Room and not exiting! It's worth noting that if we hadn't opened the SharpClaw Door here in CC2, then the door would completely block us from escaping this room, and we would be softlocked.

Each of these triggers will do different things depending on the direction that Fox hits them from. If Fox hits one of these triggers while coming from the bottom of the MoonStone Temple, he will activate the onLeave() method of the trigger. If Fox hits the trigger from the other direction (while entering the MoonStone Temple), he will activate the onEnter() method of the trigger. Here is what each method does for each trigger:

This works because the game unloads objects from the main map when you enter the MoonStone Temple in order to save memory, and it also resets certain objects to their default states. When you exit the temple, the game re-loads the objects in their correct states.

However, camera-lock can prevent the SharpClaw Door from loading, which is what makes this possible. Note that due to a CS that plays when we re-enter the block puzzle room in the OFPT Link map after having done Indiana Jones Skip (which would cancel camera lock), it's faster to do Fire Gem Clip to escape than to do camera-lock and solve the block puzzle normally (if the SharpClaw Door was already opened, mind you).
