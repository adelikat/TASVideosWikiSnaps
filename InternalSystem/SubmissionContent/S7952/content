	"With the ban on triviality lifted I felt like it would be a good time to let these Home Alone games shine. Since we end time on final input in the TAS, we can optimize a bit, nail down the bare minimum of things we need to do to win the game, and let it run out for the rest of the 40 minutes.

	"We make use of various glitches/bad AI pathing/etc through these runs to get our objective done very quickly. In this version we make use of a weakness in the AI pathing where the bandits can get stuck in a tar pit while simultaneously trying to catch you and loot the house. Since they can't do both at once, they end up walking back and forth in the tar and we run out the clock from there. I discovered this strat when I was doing RTA runs and initially had used the 2nd floor arcades but it's much faster TAS-wise to end on the table where we do.

	"While it may be boring to watch the game play itself out without anything really happening on the screen for dozens of minutes, I felt it was still worth making TASes for these to see just how quickly they could be "completed."
