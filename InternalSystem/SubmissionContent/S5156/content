	"Final Fight (Japanese: ファイナルファイト Hepburn: Fainaru Faito?) is a side-scrolling beat-'em-up video game produced by Capcom. Originally released as an arcade game in 1989, it was the seventh title released for the CP System hardware. Set in the fictional Metro City, the player controls one of three characters: former pro wrestler and mayor Mike Haggar, his daughter's boyfriend Cody, and Cody's best friend Guy, as they set out to defeat the Mad Gear gang and rescue Haggar's young daughter Jessica.

	"I need to mention in the current published by CReTiNo, the user £e Nécroyeur lifted a discussion about the  level of game, I mean, to set hardest instead of normal as a good choice to make a improvement of the published.
	$LF
	"So CReTiNo and I decided to make a hardest run and right after we indentify some improvement spots, we managed to save lots of frames in every stages until arrival in Subway. By the way, In the first three areas we didn't notice any difference of level of the game. 
	$LF
	"But this, by the contrary, the enemies as Axel appears faster and extra life. While we were at Subway stage, we came across the first point of change, the enemies comes with more life bar but that didn't make such a big deal until the upcoming boss - Sodom. Sodom stole us more than 900 frames due to his extended life. By this reason we took aside the idea of making this run in hardest settings and we moved to the default settings. This would not go anywhere. Really!
	$LF
	"Our conclusion: A hardest run can't show anything better, just more Life bar from the enemies and bosses making long and boring rounds, that's why we opted for normal one, but if it is the wrong way, reject it.

	"Guy is a light and agile character, although he takes less damage from his enemies, but we can save more frames due to his speed than Haggar is able to. Haggar takes only advantage against bosses such as Sodom and Rolento because the fights don't have other enemies bothering while we face 'em.  
	$LF
	"I did some test before of deciding between Haggar and Guy. Haggar had saved 27 frames in fighting against Rolento, while playing with Guy we just save more while passed through the stage.
