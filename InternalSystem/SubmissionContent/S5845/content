	"  Movement follows a grid system where Ares and monsters will stay within their square tiles and can only attack linearly (not diagonally.)  To reach the end, you must traverse 40 odd floors.  Bosses are varying degrees of skipped in this run.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The majority of movement uses a late game magic which can be acquired early, and the anti-stuck feature when that magic is unavailable.  The limiting factor then becomes how much map I have revealed on each floor as I can move to any revealed point.  A glitch is used on nearly every floor to copy map data from one floor to the next.  An item dupe pays for potions to speed up movement.  To beat the game I need a particular sword to damage the final boss.  Get warp magic, get mana potions, rush to sword, beat game.
	$LF

[p 
	"The main glitches used are only available in the Japanese release of the game and are frame perfect.  They save so much time that the Real Time speedrun uses them even with the lowish success rate of frame perfect tricks.  This TAS was made to fix the success rate of those tricks and see what time I can get.  The item dupe sequence gives a peek into the real time run experience.

These 2 new submissions didn't get much attention either, despite of how cool the glitches are. If you're looking at this game for the first time, you can understand why it doesn't excite many people: repetitive gameplay, repetitive music, flipping level layout that makes everything hard to follow. And that's true to both this movie and the currently published run.
