	"This run was actually not that bad to do. I was managed to beat all of the existing records. I was also manage to find out a lot of shortcuts to beat these levels faster. I was able to optimize everything by the stairways, and the ladders. Rolling on the final boss was the fastest way possible. I grabbed the big fish at the end. That way, I have enough stamina to beat the game.
