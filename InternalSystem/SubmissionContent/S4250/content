	"This is a 100% completion of Uniracers, starting from a blank SRAM. "100%" is defined as getting a gold medal on every tour with every Uniracer. The idea is, if you like watching a level completed, why wouldn't you want to watch it completed the exact same way 47 more times? Also I feel like this is a very underrated branch of Uniracers. You see, when Uniracers first jumped to the top 10 of the SRL Popularity charts, it was all the rage to run any%. Few races of 100% were ever performed. I created this movie to show, not only is it a short and fun category, but accessible, too. One need learn only one trick to complete it!

	"The Tabletop is a very interesting trick. In order to perform it, you must first jump. Jumping is very important as it allows you to be in the air. There are other ways to get into the air, but they're pretty glitchy and mostly involve running off ledges. Anyway, once you're in the air, you start to perform a Z-Flip. This can be accomplished by tapping X. So you start to perform the Z-Flip, but then you give up about halfway through. Then, out of fear of landing on your pedals, you right yourself, again with the X button. For some reason this gives you more of a speed boost than a Z-Flip. Maybe it's because jumping sideways is more aerodynamic than jumping upside-down. In honor of International Tabletop Day (April 5th,) this run only uses the Tabletop trick.

	"This bot can be improved. Unlike other TASing bots, it doesn't abuse savestates to complete the game. It will play through the game to completion on all difficulty modes. In fact, with minor adjustments to the script, a human can play against the bot. I haven't seen any other bots like this, personally, though I'm sure at least one other exists out there. It could also be a fun competition to write similar bots for other games and have them compete against each other (a Street Fighter II bot tournament sounds cool, for example.)
