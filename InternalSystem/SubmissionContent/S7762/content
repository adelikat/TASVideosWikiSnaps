	". 36.93 of these seconds came simply from ending input earlier, while 3.15 seconds were lost from the Game Boy Color bootup screen at the start (which the previous movie did not have). Therefore, the time saved through actual gameplay is around 19.86 seconds. The bulk of this time save comes from many dispersed minor optimizations throughout including more efficient movement, dialogue mashing, lag reduction, better RNG, and even minor route changes.

Therefore, it is faster to go through these doorways at the top versus the bottom, wherever possible. Similarly, at the top of the large staircases in the mansion, the hitboxes extends further up at the sides than the middle, hence why I hug the sides when going down.

I know of one instance in the Prologue where Start can skip through an entire set of dialogue while A will not. There is one dialogue bubble in Chapter 3 that you must press A for. Because of a few inconsistencies like these, I thoroughly combed through each individual dialogue bubble to find the fastest way through each, which added up considerably over the run.

This timer will freeze during menuing, dialogue, character selection, pausing, loading, or lag. Therefore, it is imperative to reduce all of these as much as possible. Since this chapter is ultimately on a fixed timer, we should take whatever zany path is requied to avoid all unnecessary object interaction hitboxes possible (ex. 0:58, exiting the library).
