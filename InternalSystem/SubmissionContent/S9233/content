	" mode standing along side 
	[b 
		"Home
	]b
	" as a separate publication due to the differences in room sequence, thinking that these routes were coded to be different.  But after some discussion among staff, it appears that the differences in routing between this run and the 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=published|href=/6123M)
	" 
	[b 
		"Home
	]b
	" mode run result from 2 main factors:
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"1) The 
	[b 
		"Home 
	]b
	"mode has an additional gameplay scene (The Drawbridge),  as well as some extended animations.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"2) RNG - The sequence of rooms being randomized in order to provide replay value to casual players.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"3-ish) As a note: per Spikestuff, there is another difference between the 2 modes.  
	[em 
		"In Home you repeat the section you screwed up, in Arcade you move on (and be forced to come back to it later).
	]em
	"  But this doesn't impact the TAS as rooms aren't done wrong.

[div class=p 
	"So 
	[em 
		"in theory
	]em
	", it could be possible to find an RNG seed that would yield a room sequence for 
	[b 
		"Arcade 
	]b
	"mode that matched the sequence for 
	[b 
		"Home
	]b
	" mode.  This means that the entirety of 
	[b 
		"Arcade
	]b
	" mode is seen in the already published 
	[b 
		"Home
	]b
	" mode.  As such, this submission can't be accepted for publication based on current policies; but it's a good run for Playground.
