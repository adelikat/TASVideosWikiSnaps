Megaman's charge shot and Ring's Ring Boomerang are the last delete atk, protoman's Sonic Boom is random delete atk. These cost more time, and I don't need these effect. The important reason, I can get YoYo3(150atk) from Colourman early after Healing tournament. But I can't beat Roll in Open Hacker's N or other place like other characters. Because roll has the low HP, and can be easy to delete with Gaiasword, so it still hard to say roll is the best.

Dynawave is the max power chip which I can buy except unstable Meteor4. Yo-Yo2 can be used on hole stage. I can get MegaCannon from this shop, but I need to wait too long time, so I give up it.

These chips will be used for classD except 50. CannonBall. I have to face ThunderMan's Remo-kogoro1 in ClassC, so use CannonBall to break it. At this, I think if I can get HiCannon from Ring or NormalNaviV2, I have got one more choice to use manipulate luck, not only use Longsword. I got first HiCannon until beat Guts tournament's Gutsman.

Elecman is not better than Flashman, but it near the end, and no need to change. I choose Plantman not Woodman to use Gaiasword. Because when changes NAVI, change to Plantman is 12 frames slower than Woodman, but when uses sword, Plantman is 17 frames faster than Woodman.

But at the first frames which you use your last chip, you still can pass R or L to slot in. However the random number didn't change, because the system hasn't judge this slot-in success or fail. But system has judge that you have use a slot-in chip, so can reduce the level after battle. Generally speaking, slot-last's only effect is reduce the level and fail to get chip, and then change the random. But it has the very low chance to change the random, because in most case, level S has the same effect as level 10 or level 9, only get the more money.

	": While this may be a very optimal run through a game, I'm not finding a game which is solely about going through menus as fast as possible to be very entertaining. Furthermore, technically, a good TAS depends on more than just optimal speed, or abusing random number generators. Good TASs consist of so much more. This might be a good TAS of the game, for what little it has to offer, but I'm finding it lacking in offering anything to TASing in general, and the game itself is quite boring. Rejecting.
