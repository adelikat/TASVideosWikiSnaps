	"Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to everyone at TASVideos! Ho ho ho! This is the Oddworld TAS you have all been waiting for. This is the 100% TAS of Oddworld Abe's Exoddus, brought to you by Samlaptop (the RTA World Record Holder of Abe's Oddysee single segment speedruns and encoder for this run) and Dooty (The optimiser and the human who is full of crazy ideas!).

	"Since the 100% category is a really long run, there isn't very much say about each level other than Dooty and I have done all we can to optimise it top notch. We will be excited to see the day when PSX will be TAS-able in Bizhawk and then we will be be making Abe movies on that emulator to replace the not so good sound quality PCSX movies. I've already been making some on the daily beta builds and the audio quality is much better than PCSX. Now I'll be off set a new RTA World Record run on all categories of Abe games!

	"Merry Christmas everyone! This is our humble present for all of Abe's fans out there. It is by far the longest and most complex TAS project of "Samlaptop and Dooty's" team. Our progress was hindered a lot of times, either by emulator limitations or mistakes we made. But it was also a fun experience, and we hope you enjoy it.
