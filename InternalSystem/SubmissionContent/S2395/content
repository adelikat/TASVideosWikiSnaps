	"This is an improvement of 2855 frames over Blublu's previously published movie. The main bulk of the improvement comes from using L and R to accelerate and change direction faster. The way works is that whenever you press L or R you immediately accelerate to 1px/frame (this is also how walljumping works, as it can get you one pixel into a wall), which otherwise takes a few frames to reach. It also allows you to instantly change direction without having to de-accelerate first (which is very good, because the de-acceleration in this game is really slow). Besides the obvious time savings from reaching top speed faster, it also saves time at some places by being able to make jumps otherwise impossible, or managing to avoid obstacles and enemies which, if lucky, are in better positions due to reaching the spot faster. Other than that all the saved time comes from greater precision in play, and subpixel optimization probably saved a few frames here and there as well.

	"Oh, and the hitbox detection is pretty awkward at times in this game, so sometimes it looks like I should really be able to pass something a lot quicker, but I really just can't, like for example the exploding walls in the second level (the explosion from the cannonball is lethal for several frames after the wall is destroyed), and perhaps most notably some shrapnel in the underwater stage.

	"Thanks to Blublu, his run had plenty of strategies I had help from, and thanks to Hoe for finding the walljump glitch.

	": Nice improvement to a surprisingly fast game, and an easy acceptance. Note to encoder/publisher: Even with the correct version of the emulator, you will likely experience a desynch after the first boss, roughly 5200 frames into the movie. If you play the run a second time without closing the emulator, it should sync.
