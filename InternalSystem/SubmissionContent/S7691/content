	"After building an instant bomb-tower, when lifting the base bomb is canceled by falling bomb, the base bomb floats off the floor. Then if bomberman puts a bomb soon, it gives new tower, therefore a 3-stairs bomb-tower appears. This takes fewer frames to build, and can be bent at any degree.

[div class=p 
	"When bomberman fall from high-floor with being damaged (for this, being damaged with stunned or bomb-lifting state is needed), then he can kick bomb immediately after being stiffened, and this causes him to become like floating state. With this state he would skip any event caused by reaching specific point. Since this state also cannot use A+B bomb lifting, it is needed to put bomb and pick it up for canceling this state. This is shown in Black Fortress 1, last map.
