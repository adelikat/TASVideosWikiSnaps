	"I expected that someone from judges will watch Aqfaq's test movie and I don't understand why Spikestuff began to calm me (I still had a chance)! I had a great time ReTASing this game, but I wasn't happy when I passed it (3rd time).

	"Fastest time, improves and etc. Whip is the most powerful weapon in the game (excepting dynamite) and almost all enemies die after the second hit. I've been wrong about beating up enemies with foots and baseball bats! Sorry! Manipulating AI is hard and I was afraid I won't beat some moments in my previous run! The most difficult mission is the 3rd because of the largest number of fights and I was a little upset that I couldn't throw enemies while holding the whip. The most difficult moment in the 4th mission was to take the extreme left position to "kill" the final boss and finish the game faster.

	"Special thanks to Aqfaq for a test movie and RAM adresses though I didn't use them!
