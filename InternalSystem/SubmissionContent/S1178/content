	"So when Rockman2 TAS was "paused" i started to beat Krion run. FinalFighter helped me with the glitches (Linking MPG movie files) but now i understand every glitch well :) i guess i should talk something about the game. Mhh it looks like a Mega Man / Rockman games really really similiar just take look when Fransesca walks but this game is a cheap rip off i guess. This game is full of glitches and haves great music but playing can be little bad. But Enjoy ;) in the last playable stage i waited and for flying machine to abuse death to skip boss in the end of the stage.
