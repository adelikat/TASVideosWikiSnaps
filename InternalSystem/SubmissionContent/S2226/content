	"Dragon Egg is a Japanese game about a little girl who has a Dragon egg (go figure).  She uses this egg to bash skeletons in the head to collect power-ups to make the dragon grow.  When it grow up, she can fly around on it.  You know, the typical plot.

	"One of the main aspects to the TAS is power-ups.  It is critical to upgrade the dragon completely as soon as possible since it has flying abilities.  So the first 2 screens, I manipulate as many orbs as possible.  Luck manipulation depends on frames, which accounts for the delays in those screens.

	"The dragon has the ability to hover a bit, and increase height slighty, by rapidply tapping the I button.  This is very quirky and unlikely to be useful in real time.  For a TAS, I use this feature several times to create some nice shortcuts.

	"You may wonder why I shoot at nothing, often.  When you fire, it causes the dragon to drop to the ground, much faster than its normal floating descent.  I use this to land on platforms sooner.  When ascending it is sometimes faster to do this and sometimes not.  This is because once you fire, you can't jump until the dragon attack animation is over.

	"In the first screen I load up on power-ups at the shop.  This upgrades my attack so that it takes fewer hits to defeat enemies (including bosses).
