	": So I read the original patent of Skee-Ball and it turns out the playing body doesn't have to be a ball at all! It says "to be played with a ball or projectile". However, it also says "will give to the player a considerable amount of exercise". We know lifting a rectangle is easier than a circle, so I have to reject this submission on the grounds that not enough exercising was being done.
