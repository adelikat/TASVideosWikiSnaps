[p 
	"Generally considered the worst movie-to-game transition of 1990, this horrendously difficult game makes for a pretty decent TAS! The movie featured Arnold Schwarzenegger as Douglas Quaid, a man who inserts himself into a memory inserting machine to have a happier life...Only now he doesn't know whether he's actually a soldier with his memories erased and the government's deadly attention, or trapped in an exciting dream he made for himself! Fun fact: The script for the 2002 movie, "Minority Report," was originally Total Recall 2! Wow. Arnold to Tom Cruise. Anyway

]h3
[ul 
	[li 
		"The game can only handle rougly half a dozen sprites on screen at the same time. If the queue is full, a new object may not be created. This is especially useful in preventing the creation of enemies and bullets, but it usually comes at the cost of terrible lag. The easiest way to cause this glitch is to attack repeatedly in the air--for every punch, a new fist is created and affixed to Arnold.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"The same lag can give Arnold some extra long jumps when used properly.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Most enemies still take damage even when they're in a rainbowy-kickback state--no invincibility for them in this game. Arnie, though, gets excellent invincibility periods as well as damage boosting.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"A glitch that lets me walk into the wall at the first boss-type fight put me in a better position. If I kept going, I'd fall right down to near the bottom of the screen, stuck.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"At the very last fight with a jetpacker before the very final boss, a glitch (possibly related to the first one listed) prevented me firing as rapidly as possible. I couldn't get around it without losing a lot of time, and it sometimes let me fire anyway. I did the best I could find, but if I could have gotten around that somehow I could've saved a couple dozen frames.
