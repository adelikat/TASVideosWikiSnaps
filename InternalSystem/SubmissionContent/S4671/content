After collecting the bounty for his latest find, he abruptly runs into Friday, a female wood nymph (i.e. fairy) who's in the middle of being chased due to her alleged knowledge of the location of the fabled treasures of King Nole.  After helping evade her pursuers, Nigel becomes immediately interested and tells Friday to lead him to the general location of the treasures, which lie on a peculiar island called Mercator.  After spending his bounty on a flight to Mercator, him and Friday are dropped off near the top of the island outside of a vast, ancient cavern.

Smaller objects, such as chickens, have a height of 1; taller objects, such as Nigel, are more common and have a height of 2; and giant objects such as iron gates are at 3 1/2, and so forth.

Based on the 'Gate Hopping' trick above, this one required considerably more execution and some imagination.  Basically, the first village in the game, Gumi, contains a short dungeon that is normally inaccessible until very late in the game.  There's a set of specially programmed trees blocking access which have an object height of 4 1/2 (and can't be removed until receiving a special ability).  However, with creative NPC manipulation, tool-assisted timing and the help of some farm animals, this intended obstruction can be effectively overcome :)

Even odder, if you have at least 1 Eke Eke available, Friday will interrupt and revive him at some point if there's a lengthy scripted pause in between dialogue boxes.

After Lara and Friday get into it, you regain control of Nigel and can move him toward the teleporter to Kazalt before the other NPCs arrive to continue the cut-scene (although you must perform one extra step if you want the teleport pad to Mercator to activate: I go into more detail on this part in the 'Game Comments' section).  Doing so will leave Friday in a permanent state of hovering over Nigel--at least until you activate another event (such as if Nigel dies) that involves Friday's appearance.

Along with enemy movement manipulation and attack power, this is the basic formula I kept in mind throughout the game to clear such "monster trap" rooms as quickly as possible.

	"King Nole has a rather noteworthy AI behavior in that, when he materializes, Nigel will only be able to strike him anywhere from 1-5 consecutive times before he disappears again.  After a couple of test runs, I experimented with this and luck manipulated his attack pattern to the point where I defeated him in just three cycles of 5x hits.  Afterward, Duke Mercator only appears if Nigel is within a certain threshold near the top of the screen; therefore, I landed the killing shot as close to this threshold as I could (I needed to walk just 6 frames toward it).

	"...This also allowed me to sneak in a first-strike toward Gola as soon as he completes his grand entrance.  Gola has a near-constant timer in between attacks, and usually won't pause to breath fire, provided Nigel remains on the run.  I strove to make this last battle a bit more epic by adding the dramatics in Nigel's movements (they cost no extra time to do).  Anyway, due to Nigel's massively high attack power, the great dragon is felled in just seven strikes, ending this grand adventure and four-month long project!
