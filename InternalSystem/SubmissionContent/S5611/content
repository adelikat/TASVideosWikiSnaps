	"Drill Dozer (or Screw Breaker Gōshin Drillero as it's known in Japan) is a 2D adventure platformer developed by Gamefreak and released for the Gameboy Advance in 2005 and released to the Wii U virtual console in 2015. You play as Jill and her drill dozer. Jill’s dad is the leader of a gang of thieves. He was recently beaten up by a rival gang and had the red diamond Jill’s deceased mother left Jill stolen. With her dad out of commision it’s up to Jill to retrieve the diamond. Drill Dozer is one of 2 GBA games to ever be released with a rumble feature built into the cartridge (the other game being WarioWare Twisted).

[h3 
	"Dash: 
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"A dash is performed by pressing A while crouched. This is the fastest form of movement with a max speed of 6 units per frame. During dash, Jill will not lose any height for the first 14 frames of the dash. Dashes can be cancelled by a pressing any direction other than down after 16 frames. This allows for dashes to be chained together and provides the fastest speed while on the ground. Dash can also be cancelled at any point by drilling. Dashes can also be chained together by drill and then cancelling the drill and performing another dash. If performed on the correct frame this is the same speed as chaining dashes using the previously mentioned method while moving to the right, and travels 1 pixel further while traveling to the left due to how the game rounds partial numbers. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Dash can also be cancelled into a jump at any point in the dash. Cancelling dash with a jump within the first 15 frames of a dash will provide Jill with 50% faster horizontal speed while in the air. Jumping out of dash while in the air will cause Jill to begin to fall with this additional horizontal velocity. It is worth noting that dash can not be cancelled if there is any object directly over Jill (this includes if the dash is in the air).

	"Drilling: 
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Drilling is the main 
	[del 
		"gimmick
	]del
	" mechanic of the game, it is Jill’s main means of dealing damage, interacting with objects, and moving on some levels. Drilling is performed by pressing and holding R or L. Throughout the game, the color red is associated with R and the color blue is associated with L. In each level there exists 2 higher gears Jill can collect. These gears both increase Jill’s damage output and the maximum period of time for which she can drill. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Drilling can be cancelled after 2 frames by crouching. We can “pulse drill” by repeatedly drilling and crouching in quick succession. This is the fastest way of outputting damage to low health blocks and enemies. Since you need to cancel the drilling with crouch, this technique will not work on blocks and enemies that pick Jill’s feet off the ground while being drilled. However, these blocks can be pulse drilled if a block that does not pick Jill up is in between Jill and the block that does pick her up.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Another interesting mechanic associated with drilling in “kick-back”. This occurs when opposite shoulder button is pressed while drilling. This sends Jill flying backwards (or upward when used with specific blocks). The higher the gear, the further and faster kick-back sends Jill.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Jumping:
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The height of Jill’s jump is dependent on how long the A button is held. While jumping Jill is able to drill and maintains her horizontal air speed. Jumping can be cancelled on the first frame by interacting with objects with B (such as doors). The horizontal velocity of jumping is normally 2 units per frame. Bunnyhopping (jumping on the first frame after landing) has a horizontal velocity of either 3 units per frame or Jill’s previous horizontal velocity prior to the bunnyhop depending on which is faster. You can also gain increased horizontal air velocity prior from jumping out of a dash (3 units per frame), performing drill kickback in 2nd (3.2 units per frame) or 3rd (4.333 units per frame) gear, or taking damage from specific enemies such as the giant boulders in Kuru Ruins. 
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Swimming:
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Swimming is performed by drilling the water. Drilling with R moves Jill forwards in the water. Drilling with L moves Jill backwards in the water. The player looking around while swimming backwards can cause visual glitches in the game as seen in the boss fight at the end of area 3-2 of this TAS. Pressing A while swimming will halt Jill’s drill and slow down her momentum faster than just releasing the drill.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Flying:
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Flying is also performed by drilling. Drilling causes Jill to rise up in the air, and holding both drill buttons makes Jill maintain her height in the air. This movement is only used in the Metal City Skyline level of the game.

	"Dealing Damage:

[h3 
	"Screws:
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Screws in this game have a “health”  and either decrease towards 0 or increase towards a max value based on how you drill them. This health changes every frame your drill is colliding with the screw and the value changes by the same amount as the current gear you’re in (1 in 1st gear, 2 in 2nd gear, 3 in 3rd gear).

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This is the most complex triggering event. In memory there is a value ( at 0x11A0 in IWRAM for the US version) associated with how high the current gear is rev’ed. This value ranges from 0 to 0x7F for each gear. Damage will trigger every time this value passes a multiple of 16 (0x10).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Shifting gears can only occur when this value is at 0x3F and resets this value to 0. In 3rd gear after hitting the value 0x3F the drill hits a steady state where it move back and forth between 0x2F and 0x3F until released where it heads toward 0x7F on rev down. The rate of change of this value is dependent on the gear and the action being performed. The following link is a table of the rate of change per frame.

Enemies spawn a set time interval of 12 frames provided there are few enough enemies they can spawn, and which side of the screen they appear on is partially RNG-based and partially dependent of what half to the screen Jillis on. Every room has a set number of enemies that need to be spawned before the player can progress
