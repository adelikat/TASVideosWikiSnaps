	"This run plays Mode A as the currently

	" does. Mode B increases Kong's HP and spawns more lesser enemies, which wouldn't exhibit more interesting stuff while lengthening the run that is merely 2885 frames long, which is 513 frames faster than 
	(__wikiLink|2175M)

	": As it was found out, this game needs a few more levels to be beaten to be considered completed by our rules, because as it is right now, not all the unique content has been shown, and that's required for games that have no ending.

[p 
	"At first I planned to set it to delayed, because appending just a few extra levels is not going to change the feedback of this movie. But recently we made the research requirements for ending-less games stricter, and depending on where unique content stops appearing in this game, the route might change.

[p 
	"Since the queue is overly bloated lately, I decided to reject this movie. When the author is ready to work on a more complete version, we can discuss the ending point accordingly, before a new submission is made, to prevent another possible rejection. I will be helping with research then.
