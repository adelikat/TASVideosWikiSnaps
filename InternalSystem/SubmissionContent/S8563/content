[div class=p 
	"Sonic the Hedgehog (ソニック · · ザ ヘッジ ホッグ, Sonikku za Hejjihoggu?, lit. "Sonic the Hedgehog") abbreviated as Sonic 1, is the first game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series and marked Sonic's first appearance. The game's original programmer was current Sonic Team leader and series creator Naoto Oshima, programmer Yuji Naka, and planner was Hirokazu Yasuhara. The game was faster than any other game before it surprised a lot of people and at launch. This was due to Motorola's 68000 processor Mega Drive, whose base speed and ability to handle 16-bit numbers gave it incredible speed compared to its predecessor, the Sega Master System.
