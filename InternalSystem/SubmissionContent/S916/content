	"I decided to make a movie for this game because it is wildly underrated and people should see how cool this game actually is. I would like to thank Dragondarch for his awesome movie over at the SDA, I learned a ton of stuff from his run of this game. I would also like to thank OmegaFlareX for his wip of this game which showed me a few tricks but mostly showed me how much luck manipulation can occur in this game.

	"Luck Manipulation:
	$LF
	"When watching this movie you will see my character pause for a few frames before entering battles, this is done to decrease the amount of enemies in that particular battle. You will notice delays in the battle itself, which means I am either trying to create a critical hit or change the enemies attack to something less devastating.

	"Items obtained:
	$LF
	"This run showcases how few spells and items can actually be obtained for completing the game. I decided not to pick up any new helmets, armors, or weapons, because they are not needed when you are able to manipulate enemy attacks. Also the only spells I obtain are the exit spell, the white spell, and the cure spell. Exit spell is insanely useful in this run because it allows me to not only exit buildings to eliminate backtracking, but it also lets my instantly remove any one enemy from battle. White spell is my primary offensive spell throughout the entire second half of the game; it is used in almost every boss battle. Finally the cure spell is obtained and is only really needed one time, for the Dark King Battle. I discovered something very interesting, and that is the lower your level is, the more damage the cure spell does to the Dark King.
