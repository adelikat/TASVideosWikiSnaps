However, I went back in, and couldn't figure out how to access player 2 input, so I changed my mind and uncancelled it. Also, this was very tedious the first time, and at the moment, I can't bring myself to do it all over again.

The Mario puzzles start by asking if you want a hint or not, which will solve a single row and column at random.

	": I always thought that a Picross submission wouldn't have been interesting, but this version made me think otherwise. The early levels may have been a breeze for optimizing, but when you get to the larger pictures...backtracking and square revisiting become an issue. Honestly, this TAS appears extremely tight. I wouldn't say that nothing can be found, but the author's statement about routing (point #3 of "Potential Improvements")...would be where I believe cuts can be found mostly. As for the diagonal movement...I did catch a few spots that you missed, but I'm not going to hold that as negative feedback. This is a long and tedious TAS...it's to be expected. Being almost 2 hours faster than the WR, I would say that this demonstrates what we like to see in movies.
