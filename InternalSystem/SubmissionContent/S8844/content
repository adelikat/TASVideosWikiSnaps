	"Postman Pat is your typical DS TV show video game released in 2008 and is unsurprisingly comprised of a series of Postman Pat-ified unoriginal minigames. This TAS aims to complete the story mode of this game by playing through all 10 minigames as fast as possible, even if the majority of the run is just waiting for the timer to run out

	"Julian has left packing his back to the last second so we need to do it with him. The game is simple: there's a list of items he needs to take into school and various items, including these items, will appear on the ABYX circle to the left. You either have to tap of press the right button as the item appears to gain a point and complete part of the list. The goal the game gives us is 8 points, however, it is fastest to try and complete the entire list as fast as possible as this ends the game before the timer gets to 0 so the aim of this game was trying to get the right items to appear as soon as possible.

	"Pat comes home from work and Jess has gone missing. Now we need to find him 12 times (for some reason) around the house hiding behing various objects. Alternatively, if the player finds Bonnie, she gets us 2 points instead which can easily save a bunch of time. I'm going to say this now just in case I get stuff wrong but it has been half a year since I've worked on this TAS seriously so if I forget the specific details while writing this, I apologise. I think, for Bonnie, I found that she doesn't always load in on the first frame the scene is loaded in on, resulting in having to wait for a bit on a couple of scenes.

	"Finally, you'll notice I discover Jess even after getting 12 points. This is because the garden only runs at 30fps which halves the speed at which the in game timer runs which loses so much time. The bedroom runs at the full 60 so as little time is lost.

If they don't have a stamp, they need to be discarded from the belt by blowing into the microphone. This game is fairly simple and there are no apparent ways to speed it up.

It's probably the most jank out of all levels and I can't exactly say it works just how the devs intended. I'd explain what I mean by this but I found it so confusing what works and what doesn't I don't think I can unfortunately.

At the end, I attempted to end input as soon as possible which was after the final boost which still allowed us to win the race.

	"Everything seems fine with considerations to make the timer run out faster when possible. The only possible idea to somehow get some more time saves is if there's a way to RNG manipulate "School Rush" to get the right items faster but that could potentially result in worse booster placement RNG in "Bike Race". That's probably a bit of a big ask considering that those are the first and last minigames, respectively.
