	"The run is performed on the Sinclair ZX Spectrum +2A. BMX Jungle Bike does not attempt to control its framerate, it simply processes the game as quickly as it can at all times. 128K versions of the Spectrum run their Z80 processor at a slightly higher clock rate, and the +2A and +3 also have some improvements in memory access speeds. As a result, the game runs fastest on these models. The +3 is a disk-based system, and BMX Jungle Bike has never been officially released on disk, so the run uses the +2A and loads the game from tape.

	"This would be a fairly normal game, go fast and jump over obstacles. But for some reason, pressing or holding the jump button while in the air makes the game skip all processing except for our character movement. This makes the game run much faster and also makes us invincible. However, we're not immune to large gaps, and we're still vulnerable while touching the ground, so we do have to slow down sometimes. We also have to make sure to let the game process screen transitions, otherwise we're stuck looping the same room over and over again.
