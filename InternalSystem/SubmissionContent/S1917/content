	"There are over a dozen levels in the SMB3 coding not found in the actual game. They can be accessed with a ROM hacking program. Someone at themushroomkingdom.net made an IPS patch that allows access to these "lost levels".

	"At the website, you can also find some level maps of these "lost levels".

	"Level 1: I run to the right at the start to show what's at that part of the level. Then I run back to the beginning and take the pipe to the rest of the stage.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Level 2: Another intereresting level. At the end, there is a pipe attached to a wall. The pipe leads to a boring Coin Heaven. Flying over the big wall leads to the "real" goal. I tried to walljump over it, but I couldn't.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Level 3: I get a Kuribo's Shoe here. There is an interesting glitch involving jumping with the shoe. After falling (not jumping) off a platform, you can jump once again in midair because the game thinks you are on the ground.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Level 4: This is like a harder version of 1-5. This turned out pretty good, I think.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Interesting note: The angle of a "slope jump" exactly equals the angle of the ground that I slope jump at.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Level 5: This level just has a Tanooki Suit block. I get it and take the pipe to exit the level. Using a Walk-thru-walls Game Genie code, it is possible to go through the walls to see more Tanooki Suit rooms.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Level 6: Interesting level. I think this turned out well.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Level 7: World 7-4 redux. Autoscrollers are kind of boring, but I think this turned out pretty good.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"A "lost" enemy appears here: Gold Cheep Cheeps swim faster than normal ones and swim in groups of three.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Level 8: A pretty interesting level. Getting the third of three matching panel cards here causes a graphics glitch: When the big "fireworks" powerup appears during the fanfare, there will be a bunch of scrambled letters in the background.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Level 9: A sky level! Another lost enemy here: Green Parabeetles are faster versions of Red ones.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Level 10: A "lost" Coin Heaven, maybe?
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Level 11: A harder version of 1-6.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Level 12: Much shorter version of 1-6. No exit here, so I die in a pit to exit.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Level 13: Copy of Level 12, except Mario's starting position is lower.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Level 14: No enemies, pits, or exit here. The big jump I make about halfway through is to show some of the black glitchy background. I reset the game to get out.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Level 15: No enemies, pits, or exit here either. Some "lost" cloud platforms are here. The Bullet Bill cannon doesn't fire anything. I reset the game to get out.

	"...and that's it! Hope you liked it!
