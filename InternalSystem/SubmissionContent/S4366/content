	"Real time runs are more and more like TASes these days, and Abe's Exoddus is simply one of the best examples of this. If you inadvertently watch both runs, it will be hard to say which one is the TAS, so, I'll point them out for you;

	"You should start here again after completing the any% run. But in this run, Abe dies on the background of the maximum casualties award screen, returning to the Final Zulag. The SDA, as stated by Samlaptop, just sits on the maximum casualties award screen. To actually beat the game in any mode you must acquire the Shrykull power by rescuing two Mudokons on Zulag 15. Obviously, it’s time consuming and you’ll only see this on the

	"The Greeters, those grinning robots, are really hard to lure, even in a TAS. To pass them unnoticed, you must do so while they’re turning around. Luckily, the last one will do exactly that if you let go of the directional pad for one frame on the previous screen.

	"On Zulag 4 you start to notice one of the reasons why the run of PSX version is slower; a drastic drop of the frame rate. The other reasons are lack of FMVs and faster loading times on the PC version. The biggest differences here aer on Zulag 2, where I used a different strategy to chant just one Glukkon and Zulag 5, where I say sorry to the Mudokons only after dealing with the Slogs, the rest is almost the same as the SDA run.
