	"Flash and Wonder Woman are the ones with stun combos. Super and Green Archer can combo with multiple freeze attacks and everybody can throw on hit-stun (Batman has a lot of fun with this) and block-stun. Everybody has dashes forward(WW, Super, Despero, Darkseid hit for little damage with the dash)and back-dash with initial invincibility.

	"This game has no cancels (except for flight cancel but it's not very useful), you can only link moves. Wonder Woman has a hard time hitting her lasso which doesn't have a lot of priority, so Flash was chosen because not all characters could be manipulated into successive stuns.

[p 
	"EVEN when they are STUNNED,they take random times to recover and some moves activate the AI block so I'm obligated to do a jump attack before the dash attack,it's easy to see if you try do the final combo on flash using only the dash uppercut, he will block instantly even if you cross him up with the teleport.

[p 
	"Characters with uppercuts like Despero and cheetah didn't get the immediate jumping attack for their behavior, others were just optimizing the combo to minimize landing time and testing if the raw uppercut would end the fight. Darkseid and Despero were bigger and therefore, faster to hit.
