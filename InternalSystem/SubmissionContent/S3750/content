	"Note that the actual rerecord count is more than 100.000, but I kept switching between my different versions.

	"The notable improvements are these:
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" minimizing the actions (jump length) to get better subpixel positions and do actions (pressing B) as fast as possible to recover from it's animation and go forward.
		$LF

	[li 
		" running faster as soon as possible rather than going to the right side (it's faster because the camera doesn't moves forward if it's blocked by the 2nd player)

]ul
[p 
	"The combination of these two lead to this movie. This way I could get a faster spawn of the rats which is spawned after every 16th frames. This means, you need to be there in 17 frames earlier, otherwise you won't improve anything just wait for the enemy spawn. This happens in the next rat too.

		" The only thing I tried without luck or even close to the resolution is manipulating the game end without pressing input at the manipulation part (after the lagframes around 3406). The problem is that the complexity of the manipulation. You have to reset pointers, get correct values for different objects. Most of the time when I thought it will works, it suddenly either stopped the manipulation.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" And of course, you can try to reduce the manipulation part, but that's will results in a much longer wait until the end, if it would be possible, but the same happens as earlier mentioned. And this has something to do with the actual framecount (lower framecounts are harder to manipulate)
