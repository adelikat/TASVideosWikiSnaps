	"This game can be played with Batman, Robin or both. The only real difference between them is the weapons you can choose. It's a pretty hard game, especially if you don't know the secret areas where you can find extra lives (you start with 6 and have them for the entire game). There are a lot of controls and special moves, but they're not easy to do. It took me some time to manage them all.

	"At the beginning I had no idea how this run would look like. So I started by testing all the attacks and how much damage they do. I found among other things that the attack with A does 4 damage, C does 8, uppercut and the best other attacks do 12. But I discovered another attack that I never used before that does up to 24 damage. That's the one where you grab the enemy. I used it a lot during all the run except for the last boss. There are 2 versions of this attack, one that does 24 damage and one that does 20 but kills faster.
