		" Gate Neon - Firing the 1st tier-3/4 buster shot into a boss door allows you charge as well as weapon swap while storing the 2nd buster shot.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Neon Kick - Firing the secondary tier-3/4 buster shot and wall jumping off a left wall during the animation will cause X to turn around and jump off an invisible wall to the right instead.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Strike Chain Disjoint - Gravity continues to increment X's y-velocity during the duration of a strike chain without changing his y-position. His y-velocity is normally reset to 0 after the strike chain ends, but spinning around for a frame during it will disjoint the the chain while preserving X's y-velocity. This can be used to fall out of a strike chain at terminal velocity, or jump out of one to clear short ledges while still gaining the x-axis speed increase from the chain.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Strike Chain Elevate - Firing a strike chain at a wall while jumping so that it connects the frame before X lands will cause him to touch the ground for a frame then get pulled back up to the chain's y-position. Since dash jumping has a 2 frame animation, starting the a dash jump on the frame X is on the ground will cause it to finish on the frame X is in the air, giving him a small boost that allows him to clear walls that are barely too tall to clear otherwise.
		$LF
	]li

	[li 
		" Shooting while remaining charged - Buffering a shot during boss load times will cause an uncharged shot to go off on the first frame of the fight without expending your charge.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Charging during projectile travel time - Creating distance between X and a boss before you fire an uncharged shot allows you to gain a head start on your next charge equal to the projectile's travel time. This makes some pattern of alternating between charged and uncharged shots the fastest way to kill the majority of bosses in the SNES X games, although it was only used on 3 bosses in this run.
