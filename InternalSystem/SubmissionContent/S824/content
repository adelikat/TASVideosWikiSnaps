	"Mega Man X2 is an interesting game to TAS, due to the various functions of weapons that do more than just destroy enemies. Making a TAS of this game is not easy, because many actions must be done at the exact frame. All this dashing, jumping, and grappling lead to a fast-paced action TAS that is interesting even for me to watch.

	"The secret weapon known as the shoryuken (rising dragon punch) can only be gotten by first obtaining all other items and upgrades in the game. Although time is spent gathering these items, the shoryuken's one-hit kill capability makes up for all this. Getting the shoryuken may be the fastest possible way to complete the game, although no one has tried a no-items run or a run obtaining only the X-Buster upgrade.
