	": I was told that this was quickly done for AFD so there wasn't any immediate checking for RNG related matters. Of course, I just had to do the due diligence of at least checking the simplest way to potentially manipulate RNG: waiting to lock in the answer. Upon testing this, this didn't seem to affect how many of the 100 got the question wrong so this implies that the RNG is seeded earlier and only adjusted when called. While it's possible changing the initial date or starting the game proper on a different frame could affect that seed, checking after how many questions is probably a bit too much of an ask to seriously check. Even after all that, it likely wouldn't matter if that last person of the mob is specifically coded to not get any questions wrong until a specific number have been answered correctly which would render the RNG moot.
