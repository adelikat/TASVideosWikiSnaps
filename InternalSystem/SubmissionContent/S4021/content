[p 
	"May some people wondered "Why use a 2Player fight in this TAS?"
	$LF
	"Well we already have a playaround the game done here using the same characteristics and choose,but I only added a 2players fight not only for the fun or enterteniment was also for add all characters as i've said for example same using the Glitch "Secret Stage" : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwITognv9fs the game don't support all characters same using this glitch that i used,then that's why I added this match 2vs2 to add the rest of the characters that in the case would: Scorpion,Kitana,Sindel and Kung Lão,were those who were absent and I added them in this match so do not kid yourself before asking this.
	$LF

[p 
	"Another question that maybe the people have "If this is All Characters TAS so where is the Motaro or Shao Kahn?"
	$LF
	"good,for those who never played much this game he has a code that lets you unlock Shao Kahn and Motaro but you can only unlock one of them, or you unlock Shao Kahn or Motaro don't have as unlock the two bosses,only one this is the cause of not adding them.
	$LF

[p 
	"I created this TAS to show how different is this mode using all characters such as little glitches and abuse among other fun style but other than that each character has this is the purpose,show that each of these characters can do without the use of shang tsung turning in their respective morphs :D

	"Well,well as i've said this game have a horrible graphics and sounds,this is a "All Characters" Mode TAS,why is (All Characters?has as?yes has I will speak as:
	$LF
	"when you choose your character you must earn the first and second fight or both makes you need have win so when your character's name appears example: "Liu Kang Wins"
	$LF
	""Flawless victory"
	$LF
	"After that show after defeating the enemy in two rounds you wait a bit and tighten "start" with the second player and select "Mortal Kombat" with the first player so the trick will work and you could choose another character for play the game,I dont't know why this happening (i think that is a bug or glitch that the author forgot to fix).
	$LF
	"Well I take this "failure or know what it" and i decided to create a TAS with all characters to see where this carry to fun and entertainment for you =)
