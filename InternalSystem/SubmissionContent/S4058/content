	"It's Cheetahmen II, one of the worst games of all time, so bad that it was never released. The only reason it can actually be played is that someone found a bunch of cartridges. 6 of the 10 planned levels are on these cartridges, but only 4 of them are accessible without using

	"I picked this horrible game up because it was short and I thought I could probably improve the last two levels. Ironically, I ended up improving only the earlier ones. Also, the whole thing was much harder than expected, TASing games with that much lag and limited controls can be very frustrating. Overall I'm very happy that I managed to squeeze 11 frames out of this mess of a game.
