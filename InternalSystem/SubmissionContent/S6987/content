	"For the player, there is no RNG in dice rolls. Instead, it works as follows: when there is another AI playing on your board, the dice will give you a 1 on the first three frames you can press A to stop the dice, a 2 on the next three frames, a 3 on the next three, and so forth. After 6 runs its course, the cycle repeats. When it becomes your turn again, the dice will start this sequence again.

	"For boards with no other AI, the first turn follows the same rules as before. On subsequent turns, however, the dice continues from where the previous turn left off in the sequence, being preceded by a 1 for one frame in all circumstances. Rolling the 1 on the first frame of any turn will not advance the sequence previously described.

Going clockwise happens to be the faster way because walking up/down a tile is about 16 frames shorter than walking left/right a tile. The puddles subtract the moves you have left by two each time you land on one. By getting 5's on the last three turns, I can get across them in minimal time.

Each emptying generates three lag frames but minimizing that is the lesser consideration. I was able to get amazing RNG until I had about 15 acorns remaining where things went astray with a couple long gaps between acorn spawns in both time and space. I tried all I could to get it better but it would involve ruining the huge stretch of good luck I had earlier in the minigame so this is where it stands.

Now, just rolling 1's all the way around the board for 10 turns won't work because: 1) Tigger will always begin his turn an odd number of spaces away from Pooh (note the "bad" distances of 1,3,5). 2) If we try to stay 7 or 9 spaces away, we will inevitably land on an arrow space which allows us to hide in the background scenery, but that has a very time-costly animation. It's so time-costly, in fact, that rolling a 2 wastes less time. Therefore, rolling a single 2 before Tigger's 8th turn should sync the two to "good" even-numbered distances.
