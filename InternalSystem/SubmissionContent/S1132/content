	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"Some better star usage here. After picking up the secret item and riding the bird, I choose the lower path so I can use star which is faster. I used same kind of tactics in the boss as 
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/Nitsuja

	". I had to be slower though because the boss wasn't asleep anymore :P

[div class=p 
	"Luck  manipulation is very annoying in Gimmick! It took me a lot of rerecords to get the desired fireball from one of the enemies. I used a lot of shortcuts, and some small optimization in the boss.

	" Level 5 
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"I used a lot of Nitsuja's tricks but I was able to make them a lot faster. I killed myself after getting the secret item, it's over 20 frames faster but seems bit boring. Again, boss was a bit faster.

	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"I came up with a little shortcut in the 4th room, I used star to go from the right side. And I was able to enter the secret room a bit faster this way. The last room before the boss was a lot faster than in Nitsuja's run.
	$LF
	"Minibosses were pain to manipulate. I came up with the idea to use the bomb first and it saved some frames. In the second miniboss, there's invisible wall so I can't just enter the pipe :/ Boss was greatly improved.
