	"I had some lack of motivation but I'm finally done with this run!

[p 
	"Here are some notes about the run:
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Level 1
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"I used the star for my advantage in many places. In the boss, I shot the fireball from the pervious room so that I could get the star ready faster.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Level 2
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Some better star usage here. After picking up the secret item and riding the bird, I choose the lower path so I can use star which is faster. I used same kind of tactics in the boss as 
	(__wikiLink|user:Nitsuja)
	". I had to be slower though because the boss wasn't asleep anymore :P
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Level 3 
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"I couldn't use the same death-shortcut as 
	(__wikiLink|user:Nitsuja)
	" because I had to get the secret item. I was a bit faster in the boss.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Level 4
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Luck  manipulation is very annoying in Gimmick! It took me a lot of rerecords to get the desired fireball from one of the enemies. I used a lot of shortcuts, and some small optimization in the boss.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Level 5 
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"I used a lot of Nitsuja's tricks but I was able to make them a lot faster. I killed myself after getting the secret item, it's over 20 frames faster but seems bit boring. Again, boss was a bit faster.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Level 6
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"I came up with a little shortcut in the 4th room, I used star to go from the right side. And I was able to enter the secret room a bit faster this way. The last room before the boss was a lot faster than in Nitsuja's run.
	$LF
	"Minibosses were pain to manipulate. I came up with the idea to use the bomb first and it saved some frames. In the second miniboss, there's invisible wall so I can't just enter the pipe :/ Boss was greatly improved.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Level 7 
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"I mounted the white monster-thingy earlier. Star was used a lot
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"And just to note that almost every room was faster when compared to Nitsuja's run (some were as fast as in Nitsuja's run).
	$LF

[p 
	"Suggested screenshot frame: 29386

	(__wikiLink|user:Randil)
	": They whipped some motivation into my lazy ass to finish my run :P
	$LF
	"And special thanks to Guybrush, he helped me with this submission text.
