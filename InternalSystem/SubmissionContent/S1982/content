	"Madou Monogatari I (1996) is a Japanese dungeon crawler RPG with puzzle-flavored level-design and cute graphics. The main character is a little girl called Arle, who is on a quest to pass a final exam of a magic school. The exam consists of going through a tower, which is filled with riddles, monsters and many tasks to solve. This time Arle does not want to spend too much time solving the riddles and other optional tasks to get a good grade from the shool. Instead, Arle goes through the tower as fast as possible. The fast time is achieved by a good route plan and extensive luck-manipulation. Only 17 battles are fought in the whole game: 4 necessary boss fights and 13 intentional random encounters to collect rare item drops, money and EXP.

	" of TAS movies in existence, so it was a good experiment. I think this movie shows that dungeon crawler RPGs can be at least moderately entertaining and surprisingly fast-paced, even though some repetition is to be expected. Hopefully the movie is not too confusing. Feel free to ask anything and I'll try to clarify things that seem strange. I provided some maps to help understand the route. If you are interested in the details of the battles, use the memory watch to display enemy HP. The fights look easy, but they are actually very hard due to the under-leveled character and the nature of the randomness.

	"The battle system has both turn-based and real-time elements. The spells are cast in real time by using different button combinations, like down-left-up-right. There is also a simple melee attack, but it was never used. All enemies have a set timing when they perform one of their actions randomly. So the battle is not turn-based in the ordinary sense, but the enemies act at constant pace. Bosses are usually faster than other enemies and they also have a wider selection of attacks.

Also, many of the effects have no direct influence, except funny animations, like the yellow game mascot running around. The random spell can be used once in a fight. Luckily, one of the thirty effects, which I call the ELEPHANT STOMP, causes huge damage to the enemy. It seems to be a very rare effect of the spell as the other effects occur more often. Anyway, I managed to get an elephant stomp anytime I wanted and the luck-manipulation is barely visible, but at least you know it when you hear the partial pause sound.

	"A forward step takes 11 frames to perform and any input between the steps affects the randomness, so I used this to avoid all unwanted random encounters without losing any time. No time was lost in item-drop manipulation either. But the battles themselves are harder to manipulate, because every move changes the RNG and there are many possible strategies for using the spells. The enemies have many different attacks, so those need manipulation too. This movie turned out to be much more polished technically than I originally intended. I managed to do all the necessary luck-manipulation in a very short time. I estimate less than 6 seconds luck-manipulation was wasted in total in the battles. But the game is full of different items and strategies, so maybe even minute-scale improvements happen someday.
