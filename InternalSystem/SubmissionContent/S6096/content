	"The king is dying without an heir, so he sends Sir Graham out on a quest to recover three magical items from the realm.  If Sir Graham is able to recover all three items, he will be granted the crown as the next king of Daventry.  Graham must search high and low, using his wits to solve problems and recover the three magical items (A chest of never-ending gold, A mirror that shows the future, and A shield that guarantees safety and victory in battle).

		"Text Entry
	]b
	" The game doesn't display typed text every frame. However, multiple keystrokes can be buffered into emulator memory on a single frame and will all be displayed when the game polls for this input. This rarely hinders progress as text input can usually be accomplished during periods of movement unlike SCI interpreter games like Quest for Glory or Space Quest 3 where the text input box will pause movements.

	[b 
		"Desyncs
	]b
	" JPC-rr is horrible for being able to splice in changes after the fact. Making a change causes many desyncs down the line. Therefore, it is imperative to make sure every screen is fully optimized before moving on to the next.
