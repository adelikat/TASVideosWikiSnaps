		"DESCRIPTION:
	]b
	" This has to be my favorite TAS I've done so far. All of the tricks used are present in RTA speedruns, just executed to a level that puts human play in the dust, with the rest of the timesave coming from micro-optimized jumps, spam-shooting, and movement. This primarily means making all jumps at the most precise height as possible, dashing at every possible opportunity, and using recoil from shooting upwards to fast-fall when convenient. All of the tech used is as follows:
	$LF

[ul 
	[li 
		" After collecting an item, you can take a shortcut back to where you entered the room by quitting and then re-entering the game; mere mortals have to actually react to when the main menu loads and then click back into the game, but a TAS is able to do this instantaneously.
		$LF

	[li 
		" Two death warps are used, one to bypass a shooter that you would normally need to duck under and another to speed past some annoying enemies en-route to collecting an item.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" It is possible to zip through a tunnel going left-to-right by precisely ducking and then unducking at the entrance of a small tunnel; this normally takes multiple attempts by a human, if successful at all, but the TAS is able to ace it every time. This is used in two screens in this run, and saves a ton of time. This doesn't work if there isn't a space one block lower to zip to, however, getting you stuck off-screen for your trouble. This can also be used to warp to another screen if an appropriate screen transition is available, but there isn't an opportunity in this particular route.
		$LF

	[li 
		" If you shoot a door that is a higher level than your current weapon, then any minibosses on-screen will be damaged by the debris at a distance, which makes all but one such miniboss absolutely trivial. The second miniboss would normally have its AI exploited to get it stuck in a favorable position in a human run, but for a TAS it's easier and faster to literally just spam-shoot it. I also deliberately activated the third miniboss early, that way it ends up in a position where it won't bother me when it's time to unleash the cheese by utilizing the door trick.
