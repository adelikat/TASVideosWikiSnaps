	"Galactic Revenge is a homebrew game designed by MikGames and the first place winner of the SMS Power! 2018 Coding Competition. The game is similar to Gremlins 2 on the NES but has its own style to distinguish itself. The player controls Olivia Gun, out to retrieve her stolen Sega Master System from thieving aliens. I originally came across this game for Mystery Tournament challenge research and enjoyed my time playing this casually since it's a short and sweet game.

	"For the most part the game checks for inputs every other frame, or 30 frames per second. However if there is lag then the input check takes longer at every 3 frames, or 20 frames per second, or every 4 frames, or 15 frames per second. BizHawk doesn't detect when player input is ignored so I assume all lag handling is done internally while BizHawk just assumes there's no lag. This was a recurring problem when trying to find the right inputs, mostly for the fact that there can be an odd amount of frames between accepted inputs and I couldn't just check every other frame.

Since jump time is fixed sometimes ground movement has to be stopped in a given direction before making the next jump across platforms to avoid getting hit.

	"For the first room of the game Olivia gets to use the space suit, which allows for shooting across the entire screen and 3 shots on screen at a time. She is forced to downgrade to the shinobi outfit with shurikens which have a limited range and limited to 1 projectile on screen at a time. In this run I get 10 coins to buy the fire suit which shoots 2 fireballs at a time in a V shot pattern and allows for 2 projectiles on screen at most. Another volley of shots can't be used until both fireballs are off screen. The other suits cost too much to get quickly and do not have enough benefits to warrant obtaining them in a timely manner.

	"The game is initially set to Easy mode with 3 starting hearts. The most obvious change in Hard mode is that everything has a lot more health and is harder to take out without stopping. This results in me ignoring enemies past a certain point due to their tankiness, even with the lag they can generate. The starting hearts mostly affect what opportunities I can use a damage boost so setting it to 1 is just a slight limiter.

	"RNG seems hard to manipulate and might be affected by the game difficulty to reduce heart drops. This resulted in getting only 2 extra hearts, and thus only 3 damage boosts that I could utilize throughout the run. Coin drops were probably also affected but the amount I grabbed wasn't a big issue. Larger foes can drop multiple items including hearts but I never managed to get any heart drops from them in this run and worked around that for the latter half of the run.
