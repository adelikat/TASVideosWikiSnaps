	"This run skips 6 levels out of 8 by abusing reset glitch. You can unlock the final stage if you reset in the bonus stage of level 1, but you need to beat Kangaroon before abusing the glitch. After resetting, level 1 will be corrupted and take you to a glitched map. Then, returning to the level select screen from there will show you a broken score results screen and unlock the final stage.
