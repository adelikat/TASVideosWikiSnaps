While normally regional choice isn't usually counted for/against TASes that otherwise have the same content, the way that Rush Search RNG frames are determined are by frame count. Due to the Rush Search cutscene glitches that can help speed up the game, this would be a problem to reasonably ask for a resync mainly due to now having to rework finding the right RNG frames again in a different version of the game that would potentially be minimally different outside of textbox lengths. That is simply too much of an ask for a TASer to require practically redoing an entire TAS just for shorter textboxes, so it's fine that this was done on the US version. I'll leave it up to the author on if they do want to do that in the future but this submission is acceptable as it is.

The only thing that caught my eye when watching was the bit in Freeze Man's stage that could've been sped up by breaking the platform before climbing up the ladder to drop down faster, and that's been noted in potential improvements. Considering that the other potential improvement, using Wild Coil against the boss Gamerizer in Wily 3, didn't pan out due to Rush Search RNG, it's not something that is actually easily improvable due to how often Rush Search is used throughout this 100% TAS. Outside of those, the tighter optimization and proper route changes for boss quick kills to go along with using an incredibly useful time-saving glitch makes this a great improvement to 100% completion of Mega Man 7.
