	"Boong-Ga Boong-Ga (Spank'em!) is a rather unusual 2001 arcade game by a South Korean company named Taff System about performing kancho, a Japanese children's prank that involves surprising someone by pressing both hands together and sticking the two "trigger fingers" into someone's buttocks.

	"The arcade machine faithfully recreates an arcade game of it with a plastic buttocks and a large white hand with an index finger. The game seems to have  7 pressure sensors (or buttons?) inside that determines how hard the user pressed the "controller" into the plastic buttocks.   Remarkably while 200 were intended to be made only 5 machines were actually made into production and delivered.

	"The game starts up with a selection of people that you can select one to perform the kancho on.  After selection there is a bar on top where you are supposed to guess the correct "pressure".  By pressing it in with the right pressure the bar spins around the little dancing turd on the upper right of the screen and the bar fills up. If you are able to apply the right pressure you win. However the game actually cheats sometimes in testing where it is impossible to get the correct spot on the bar, and the closest you can get is the bar right next to the right one.  However doing that will allow you another try where you can get the correct spot on the bar.  The game only requires you to get the correct pressure once to get a "congratulations" and then the game ends with a "Game Over" and restarts.

	"It is fastest to select the first person available, then on the very first available frame to input the button "7" which "wins" the game.

	" without the authentic controller, but still it seems to fit our minimal requirements of a game. Accepting.
