	"First time it was done by Maru, but he didn't want to submit it to TASvideos, because it is, most likely, not enough. So, I'm submitting my version, which is little bit more entertaining in my opinion (in some places it looks slower, but this because of entertianment purposes or unusual routes, which are less common), have fastest possible way of doing 4-2 (inside framerule, it is actually that one method of wrong warp, which is 1 frame behind next framerule, if use left+right). Also I founded all actual timesaves myself, icluding final frame, which makes this TAS my best speedrun so far. Even if it is not gonna be accepted, I think it is better then nothing that it will stay as submission, because it is very intresting.

	"Fastest acceleration without left+right:
	$LF
	"Doing backward jump and another backward jump as soon as you can get full speed, but for some reason, we need to delay 1 frame, between pressing left and right+A at the first jump. I don't know why, but it is faster. However, in some unordinary situations, it is faster to not delay this frame, for example at 1-2 and 8-4 turnarounds.

	"Fastest deceleration without left+right:
	$LF
	"Doing a jump, stopping press B at the air, landing, holding R until landing. This will reset speed to walk immideately. At the first frame on the ground press L. This setup used for 4-2 turnaround at warp zone. It not works in 8-4 turnaround, because there is no much room and we have to slowdown before landing.

	"1-1: not as much room for entertainment as with L+R, so I only did an unusual flagpole glitch, which is slower, but a lot more intresting for me at least.

[div class=p 
	"1-2: another slowdown  after second pipe jump. I think, everybody, including me, knows that it possible to do wihtout slowing down, but it so common, that, I think slowing down is better. No classic double win on goomba at the end, because it have little effect to the pipe clip, so I had to change more then only that and decided to leave them alive. The clip using decelerating speed to walk, as I wrote before. Then I manipulated x-position on screen after clip for perfect turnaround by right releases and late B press inside pipe. 1-2 clip and turnaround can be done faster, which I did here (even faster by 1 frame then in Maru's TAS, but he also knew that it is possible)

	" but I wasn't bothering about it after entertainment, because it is not even visible and main idea is kept.
	$LF
	"The idea is not let Mario pass x-position "124" on the screen, which allows Mario to make a stop on the middle pipe at warp zone, so, I was able to press right for backward jump, while scrolling screen far enough for changelevel to work.

	$LF

[div class=p 
	"4-2: the clip was know for a lot of time, so the special part is no left+right turnaround, which I did barely more optimized for subpixels then Maru. The main idea is deceleration as I wrote earlier to the completed stop at the last subpixel of the brick without falling down. It requiers a very tight subspeed and subpixel optimization, and I couldn't found this myself, so had to copy some inputs from Maru's TAS. After stopping, I pressed right, so Mario will fall down at the edge and accelerate backwards to the left, which is faster then forwards. Then normal backward jump for final acceleration.

	"8-3: it is not possible to kick both shells and still save framerule, Maru kicked 2nd, so I kicked first. It looks very slow (slower then 2nd), but I had anyway wait for "242" on timer to avoid fireworks. 
	$LF
	"Comparing to L+R TAS: it is not possible to get "244" without left+right at start acceleration. Anyway I wouldn't use it, because "242" + flagpole glitch giving a lot more room to entertainment.

]div
[div class=p 
	"8-4: similar to L+R TAS, perfect frame at first room is much less obvious then it looks. It is only 1 frame slower then L+R TAS in 1st room and needs very hard and unordinary combination for fast acceleration. Walljump room is vise versa, much more obvious then it looks. Turnaround room combination looks crazy again, I was shocked when I founded this frame myself. Doing additional bacwakrd jump to pipe is not better for subpixels (because it needs slowdown to avoid bumping to pipe), but still can save this frame. I used it in my youtube video, but in submission I left forward jump, because it is more optimized.
	$LF
	"Backward swimming costs time, but I did backward exit out of water, which didn't cost me a frame, because it was very small.
