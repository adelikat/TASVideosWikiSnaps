	"Skill Level 1 was chosen for a variety of reasons. First and foremost is because the lower-right side button on the controller is the "Force Move" button, which forces the computer to make whatever move it has so far deemed best. The button only works once the computer has found at least one "suitable" move to make; the first "suitable" move is the one which would be selected by the computer on Skill Level 1. Therefore, there is no point in playing on a higher skill level when you could just press the "Force Move" button as soon as it is allowed. On Skill Level 7, the computer will not move at all unless the "Force Move" button is pressed. I could still select Skill Level 7 just for the fun of it but that would lose time to menuing and I did not want that.

	"Secondly, say there's a movie which completes an entire game on Skill Level 6 and does not allow pressing the "Force Move" button. It would be massively boring. The fastest checkmate I've found with Stockfish 12 makes the computer think for 7 hours, 12 minutes, and 54 seconds over the course of 30 painstaking moves. See the 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=discussion|href=/Forum/Topics/22455)
	" for more info on this. In other words, Skill Level 1 is chosen not only because the computer thinks much, MUCH faster but it also makes lousier moves as I'll soon get into.

	"The goal is not necessarily to checkmate in the least number of moves but to deliver the checkmate that makes the computer "think" the least. For instance, the computer thinks for a cumulative 1:10 over eight moves in this TAS. I have also found a six-move checkmate but the computer thinks for 1:22 and is therefore not faster. Shorter "thinking" times are achieved by keeping the position simple. Giving the computer few options and not attacking with a lot of pieces simultaneously is a good way to minimize thinking times.

	$LF
	"A: Responding with literally anything else on move 4 prompts Black to play Knight f6. If Black plays this move, we are not giving checkmate anytime soon. Black's bishop must be captured because it is defending the f7 square, which will later be used for checkmate.
