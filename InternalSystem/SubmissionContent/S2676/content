	"So I designed lots and lots of heuristics by which the attempts

	$LF
	"to save frames (in testing) by reusing cursor positions and choosing
	$LF
	"the velocity values in the order that they become available.
	$LF
	"And I added multiprocessing, which analyzes four different
	$LF
	"ways of shooting simultaneously using the quad-core CPU.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Even this was not enough, so I had to limit the search space

	$LF
	"This reduced number is only 8 % of the original number.
	$LF
