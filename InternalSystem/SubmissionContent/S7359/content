	"NESnake 2 is a homebrew snake game for the NES. This run is an improvement on the existing publication, where a points item is accidentally collected along with the number '9' in level 7, resulting in a longer score countdown. This submission fixes that error and is also console verified.

	"This game is interesting in that it polls input an incredible number of times. In fact the input latch file contains nearly as many inputs as SMB 3 warpless, despite that movie being 40 minutes longer and itself polling input multiple times per frame. It's around 300K polls. Somehow the bot is able to keep up in this case despite having trouble in other games that poll very often/quickly. My guess is that refilling the input buffer just happens to line up with times the game isn't polling in a convenient way.
