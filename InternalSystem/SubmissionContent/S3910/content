	"The first world start slow because the items that can skip most of the fighting only appear later in the game and we're stuck with blue "yoshi" to kick bombs all over the place so i can destroy the lamps fast. Many times,the soft block layout used makes one character useless but i made sure this was actually the fastest way to beat the area.

	"In its second area,i discovered that i cannot put the bomb in the first frame with the second character for some weird reason,hence why i end up putting the bomb in the next block.No time seems to be lost cause the enemy would have blocked the bombkick if it had gotten there sooner.

	"3-2 i get the glove and use the blue "yoshi" as shield so i can detonate the bomb sooner,because the glove is a faster method fo throwing bombs around the screen(yoshi needs to take a few steps aways from the bomb before kickin it).

	"lol the run is not deathless,i wanted to show that you can stand between the robot's legs but it wasn't faster at any moment to put the bomb there cause it triggered attacks that would be very compromising in terms of time to dodge.

	"hope you enjoyed,i will answer more specific question in thread if necessary,and i believe all future improvements will come from better RNG understanding for stage layouts and the 2nd,3rd and final boss behaviors.Movement and strats was very tightly optimized so i'm pretty satisfied with this.The movie was tiring to do because the emulator is still very young(i haven't found a input editor version of it) but it has my full support cause it's very good.

	": Reviewing the run, for the most part, it looks good. A few segments are questionable but aren't too bad. Regarding some levels being slower than "random encodes", it is unjust to pit runs which use passwords, inferior emulators, and are simply video which cannot be tested, against a run made with a proper emulator with a proper starting point and running process which is known to be clean and fair. True, there is what to improve, but for a first run for this game, I find this acceptable.
