	"This movie is slower than hadock's movie because I used password to play at final plane(hardest mode) and play all levels. Additional, I used the bug to go through wall. Therefore, I cleared quickly. By way of parenthesis, there are levels where the maze can be rotated halfway. They are EXPERT 1, SPECIAL 3, MASTER 3 and 7 and 8.
