There's some movement manipulations to despawn enemies that normally would be in the way, which also reduces the lag they would generate. Rush Jet is used to zip right to an out of bounds section of the map while Magnet Beam lets Mega Man zip right straight back in bounds and straight into the final room before the boss doors, albeit with the incorrect graphics. Rush Jet zipping and equipping Bubble Lead for the boss sips the door animation and prevents the door from loading in the boss room.

With timed Spark Shot usage this means the boss never gets a chance to enter phase 2 of the fight where it bounces around the screen.
