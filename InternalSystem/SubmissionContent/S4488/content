	"This is a TAS of Pokémon Platinum on the Game Boy Color... wait... WHAT!? It isn't supposed to be on the DS??? Well, yeah... but this is a bootleg game that came out 4 years (2005) before the actual Platinum (2009). This game is called in chinese as Kou Dai Yao Guai - Bai Jin Ban, but its Pokémon Platinum translated in Chinese. It was made by Sintax, the makers of Pocket Monsters Saphire, Little Taichi: The Adventure of Myth among many others.
	$LF
	"Most Sintax games utilizes a very broken engine with very sloppy controls that can be broken very easily on an emulator.

	"Me with some speedrunners found that the B button was used to run, and then I found out how ridicolously broken running was in this game. When jumping, the falling speed increases insanely and you'll slide while falling, to cancel the slides you'll need no B input 1 frame (with direction) + press again B with A with direction again and you'll keep your speed momentum. You can clip through platforms while running, but not large sections of a level. However, the running button does NOT work on stage 2 for unknown reasons.

	"This glitch requires to turn left and while holding Left+Right in the D-Pad and then jump, you'll jump backwards. The game isn't intended for you to do that, so the programmers didn't thought of making wall detection when the character moves to the opposite direction (you can also move backwards while falling). And NO, you can't do this from the other side, since unlike Zelda II, you actually can manipulate your jumping direction in mid-air. The walls and your jumps have a limited range though, so you can't clip an entire wall.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Here's where the run button was discovered. I abused the slide-cancels here to jump earlier. A also clip through the final platform in the stage just to be faster. The first wall bump was needed to slide through the cliff, otherwise it doesn't work.

[h4 id=Stage2:

[p 
	"THE RUN BUTTON DOES NOT WORK HERE! So I abused from the drop frame trick instead. The wall clipping got opimized as well improving the level by some frames.
