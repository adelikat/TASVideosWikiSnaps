	"The rest of the game is skipped by dying simultaneously with the first boss: The player respawns in the previous room while the boss dies. The level end is then triggered, but due to the focus being in a wrong room, the "final boss is dead" state is summoned instead of the "level 1 boss is dead". I don't know exactly why the game works like that.

	"The sequel is much longer and has multiple characters to play with. The death glitch does not work. Most of the levels are optional sidequests, though, so the fast completion would involve only 3 necessary boss fights. The final boss has more than 49 000 hit points.

	"Zold (who has about 140 points of attack power) should be taken to the party to fight the last two boss fights. Jude should be taken for the first boss fight before Zold is available. Also, a person named Pit should be taken to the party near the beginning, because his bombs can destroy obstacles and it saves time near the end of the game.
