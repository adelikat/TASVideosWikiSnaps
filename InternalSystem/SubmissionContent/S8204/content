	"A major skip was discovered by Payman in Shining Glades Screen 1. During the autoscrolling part below the pole, it is possible to clip inside the wall and do wall-jumps to climb straight to the pole. This skip is doable RTA. It requires to scrawl at the very end of the barrel, then press R within a 3-frame window to stand up as early as possible (Rayman can fall in the water if he goes to far to the right), then jump within another 3-frame window to clip inside the wall. If Rayman jumps too early, the ceiling blocks him. If he jumps too late, he doesn't clip inside the wall.

	"A better optimization of the vertical flights involving the blue lums saved 229 frames in Magmacosm. Rayman wasn't at his maximum vertical speed until now. In order to fly at maximum vertical speed, he has to go downwards for 1 frame before using the blue-lumed helicopter. If he punches during a flight, he will drop the speed and has to go downwards again to recover it. Based on this new knowledge, I saved:

	"Both Jano and Final Boss RNG have changed. I had to manipulate them again. I kept the new best (or less worse) RNG seed. The seed I kept here is slower than the one in my previous Any% TAS. It is slower by 60 frames mainly due to more sets of beams in Final Boss Phase 1.
