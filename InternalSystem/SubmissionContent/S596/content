	"This game looks pretty easy, but it's a lot harder than it looks, at least on Hard mode. Mickey's movement and jumping is really limited, and a surprising amount of mistakes you can make are punished by instant death. Mickey normally walks slowly, and the only way to make him run is to walk down a slope (or get pushed by something you throw, but that only happens in boss fights), so I try to go down slopes wherever possible. Once running, I stay in the air as much as possible because running speed is (oddly) preserved by jumping.

		" The first miniboss (the winged guy) is easily the most annoying enemy in the game, for trying to make a time attack especially (it tries to force the battle to be slow-paced). Anyway, it wasn't so bad once I realized that thrown enemies do a lot more damage than jumping. After the fight, I keep the momentum of the last enemy I threw by jumping, and use that to run to the exit.

		" The main fire boss was the thing I was least able to improve in the run. There's basically only one way to beat it quickly, which is to blast it continuously. I'll just add that this is a LOT harder than it looks; I don't think I would be able to beat this boss when playing normally at this difficulty mode.

		" The bird boss I'm able to hit twice in each round, to kill it in 3 rounds. It seems like it should be possible to kill it in 2 rounds by hitting 6 times in round 2 with stunned birds, but after many tries I gave that up as impossible and settled for 3 rounds.
