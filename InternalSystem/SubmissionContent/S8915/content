	"This is an improvement of 12,999 frames (4:19.57) over the previous TAS. This improvement was made possible thanks to a new discovery where pressing enter without typing a command gets rid of the picture. This does make loading between typing non-directional commands a bit longer, because the game's keeping track of everything you see and own with text, but it doesn't have to load the pictures, saving up to 10 seconds or more per directional command. We press enter just before typing our first directional command (N/E/S/W/U/D/GO/CLIMB) to save a fraction of a second from not having the text load. Input ends on frame 17088 when we input the command "CUT BRAN" (CUT BRANCH).

	": Ok...so I understand why this would irritate you, but remember...I never thought of it either. With all the experiences I have with graphical text adventures, the only thing to turn off the display was a command at a prompt. I would have never thought of just entering a blank command to disable it.

	"So, just for my sanity...I checked the frame intervals for your keystrokes and they are spaced correctly. Yeah, there might be a one frame shorter command from time to time (like I find with Commodore games), but I'm not going to go through the entire game to find those instances. What you have here is fine. In addition to that, the short commands are also good. This was something also that I used a lot in my early play of these games. Because of your new discovery, I was curious as to why the first image showed up. Well, you discovery works after the game starts...where I would have thought a command or menu option would have been the trick.
