	"Metal Storm is a fun little platformer where you can 'flip' gravity to get around.  Though it's been talked about a bit, there has only been one submission as of the time of this one, so I feel this game deserves a bit more attention.

	"I tried to keep the movie as clean and smooth as possible.  I find it more entertaining to dodge than to kill (thus my actions in stage 4).  I also tried to dance a bit in stage 4, which is hard to do as a clunky robot.  Keeping extra shots off of the screen is a major chore in this game, mostly because of the autofire (which because of temperary invincibility, is rather useless anyway).  Nevertheless, I tried my best to keep it to a minimum.  I tried to be as direct as possible, yet get a few fun kills here and there for the heck of it.
