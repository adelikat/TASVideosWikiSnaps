[p 
	"Tintin: Prisoners of the Sun (also known in ROM names as either its French name, "Tintin: Le Temple du Soleil" or "Adventures of Tintin, The - Prisoners of the Sun", and also known as just "Prisoners of the Sun") is the other licensed game based on the Tintin comic series. The game Prisoners of the Sun adapts the two-part story of the comic albums The Seven Crystal Balls and Prisoners of the Sun.

It's also possible to just go down and take damage, but that would hinder further sequence breaks.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				" The people with llamas follow Tintin along the horizontal axis and move faster than him, which means it's not possible to avoid taking damage from them unless you grab a rock and put it in front of them to block their path. Early on this is trivial because the rock is right there, but later on the rocks are far away from them and it takes a lot of time to go out of the way, pick them up, and return them. Fortunately, it's also possible to pass them taking just 1 point of damage.

				" There's a big and really precise jump (the jump has to be frame-perfect with maximum velocity), followed by another big jump, which allows skipping to the end part of the stage with the final llama guy. I just take damage to get past him, and the end of the stage is there.
