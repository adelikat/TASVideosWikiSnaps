	"The game seems to be fluctuating in a way that prevents any minor optimizations: being faster at some point means being slower at some later point. IdeaMagnate saw a potential mistake in this movie and I managed to get rid of 6 frames, but unfortunately they came back later due to differences in lag and falling. Mainly, falling to some ledges in a certain way requires specific timing, because that's the way the Gods engine works. Also, falling damage changes between two values every 2nd frame.

	": Setting this one to accepted although it has received very little (= basically no) attention. It's very well played, and the constant dying is original. It's four minutes faster than the published version, which is a whole lot considering the original was only 11 minutes.
