]div
[div class=p 
	"The reason these skips work is because there is a specific frame during the unpause fade-in where Samus will not have normal constraints applied, such as those related to her energy (allowing her to survive indefinitely at zero by chaining pauses together appropriately, which was performed in a previous TAS) and room transitions.
