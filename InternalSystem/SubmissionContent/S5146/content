	": Hi, welcome to TASVideos. In order for movies to be acceptable, they must surpass existing published movies. This is a nice first attempt at TASing this game, but this is significantly slower than even many of our obsoleted published movies. Please review existing published movies to see what currently qualifies as the fastest run for a given game. Also, please use our forums to discuss with other users techniques for improving a movie and getting initial feedback before submitting a movie you're unsure of.
