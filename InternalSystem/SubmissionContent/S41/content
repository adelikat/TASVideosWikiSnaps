		"Famtasia all patched now... I think, lemme know if my times are still screwy. I hated seeing Snake Rattle and Roll on the requests list because from previous experience, it's an absolutely impossible game to play without savestates or the like. The snakes control like a cow on rollerskates, not to mention about 50% of the time is spent eating the pibbles and not really doing anything interesting, and strip out the first 7 levels via the warp rocket, and all you get are the ice levels where control is even more godawful. Anyway, enjoy.
