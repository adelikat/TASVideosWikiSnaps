	"Art Style: Rotohex is a remake of the GBA game Art Style: Dialhex, and is a tile-matching puzzle game where the objective is to keep the board from filling completely by rotating triangles of matching colors into a hexagon.

	"This is, without a doubt, one of my favorite puzzle games of all time, and this is my second and hopefully much better TAS of the game. I decided to cancel my first attempt after realizing it was pretty rushed and that it wasn't nearly as enthralling as it could be.

	"The goal of the TAS is to beat Rotohex's Solo Mode in as little time as possible *while keeping the least number of tiles possible on the board at all times*. Solo Mode is completed in 14 minutes and 14 seconds, from the moment I selected Solo Mode to my final hexagon match of the game. Casual run-throughs of Solo Mode are usually 30+ minutes (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRGD2zkAeSw, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=131MSBmd6g0), while vanilla speedruns on YouTube do not try to match as many hexagons as possible (https://youtu.be/2lXKLMZIMaY?t=289).

		" By holding down both the 1 and 2 buttons of a Wiimote (A and B if you are using motion controls), the tiles will fall at the fastest speed possible in the game.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" If you continuously move the cursor in a different direction per frame, you can keep it hidden for as long as you want. This gives the illusion of the cursor shifting to different parts of the board instantly and gives the feeling of unpredictability.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Even though cursor has some cooldown after matching a hexagon, you can still move it around and position it to wherever you want.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" The white color-changing powerup is pretty useless here. Use the black tile-clearing powerup whenever it shows up.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" You can grab and move a tile through mid-air by rotating the cursor on top of it.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" In some situations, falling triangles will make a match on their own. Other times, I would grab it and drop it into a hexagon.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Organizing triangles into almost-hexagons when 5 of the same color were on the board.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Allowing or baiting some triangles to slide down a hill of tiles into place.
