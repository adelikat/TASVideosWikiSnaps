		" By holding down both the 1 and 2 buttons of a Wiimote (A and B if you are using motion controls), the tiles will fall at the fastest speed possible in the game.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" If you continuously move the cursor in a different direction per frame, you can keep it hidden for as long as you want. This gives the illusion of the cursor shifting to different parts of the board instantly and gives the feeling of unpredictability.

	[li 
		" Even though cursor has some cooldown after matching a hexagon, you can still move it around and position it to wherever you want.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" The white color-changing powerup is pretty useless here. Use the black tile-clearing powerup whenever it shows up.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" You can grab and move a tile through mid-air by rotating the cursor on top of it.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" In some situations, falling triangles will make a match on their own. Other times, I would grab it and drop it into a hexagon.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Organizing triangles into almost-hexagons when 5 of the same color were on the board.

		" Allowing or baiting some triangles to slide down a hill of tiles into place.

This game can be published at TASVideos if the movie aims for pure speed, is played optimally, and has no artificial limitations regarding its goals.
