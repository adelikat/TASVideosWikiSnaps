	"Many people do "a TAS" but for me this was "THE TAS", and out of the ordinary for me. The amount of work put into this was insane, with just short of 14,000 re-records on this short run but more accurately perhaps 200,000+ presses of the TAS Studio arrow controls and several hundred thousand changes. There was no expense spared and I have roughly at least 20 hours in each level, with Jungle being around 30 or 40.

	"Note: This game has lag, and the lag changes cycle for the rest of the run depending on any input (especially switching weapons), as well as RNG, so any changes in the future will likely require a full restart. This was done from fresh scratch, rather than using in the other run in any form. Switching input anywhere will, 100% of the time, desync the rest of the run, both in terms of movement AND RNG AND lag. And sometimes, just for fun, weirdly long loading times for ending a level on certain frames (first frame seems to be optimal and no "chosen" delays were taken in this regard in this run).
