	"Here's a TAS of a Kaizo hack I enjoyed. Celeste.smc is a Kaizo hack that implements tons of stuff from Celeste into Super Mario World, like Walljumps, Dashes, bubbles, The feather, and even the Badeline fight. Obviously the dash that gives Mario 63 speed is used alot to save time. This TAS of this hack is to get every collectable and beat the game. Hope you enjoy! It is also worth noting that the dash really only gives Mario 63 speed if he's in the air. Otherwise he's stuck at 62. And doing a frame perfect jump after ground dashing requires both jump buttons to be pressed on the other frame (A then B and vice versa) and don't give a dash back, thus why you see some very small horizontal air dashes to start most levels.

	"The easiest level of them all. This level has one section and is pretty short. So just some normal berry collecting and stuff. For those wondering what the random stop after collecting berry 6 is, it's to actually register the collection of the berries and avoid lag. The berries count as sprites when you grab them, meaning a sprite slot is taken. And when enough slots are taken, lag appears. Thus stopping early on saves from that lag.

Also there is a minor time loss with not bringing the throwblock to trigger the on/off sprite. Other than that nothing really interesting. Also by dashing the frame before you grab the Crystal Heart, you can dash out of the cutscene in any direction from any part of the heart, so you're not limited to the opposite direction.

Since this is all berries, no key smuggling is involved, meaning every key is collect and every key door is used. The crystal heart is also in a very tedious and slow to reach spot, nothing I can really do about it. For the throwblock on/off skip you may be wondering about, it's not possible. The ceiling is way too low causing you to bonk at even the lowest point, making you always one tile off. There's also some under the level cheese but not too much since 100%.

The throwblock isn't entirely necessary, I just use it to kill the thwomp so I don't die but I think you can avoid them. The wind section really speeds things up, until you have to go in the opposite direction that the wind is blowing, slowing things down incredibly. The last section has alot of possible under the level skips. The blue koopa after berry 10 can give you a shell with a small bounce low enough from the right, doing a small midair, and then bouncing on the koopa in a way you can regrab the shell. This is used to skip some parts right after.

	"For section 2, berry 7 requires you to hit the on/off and go back up to grab it, taking alot of time. You can't switch the state of the blocks back in section 1 since the pipe to enter section 2 is blocked with on blocks, forcing the state of the blocks to be in the "off" state. Due to this, the very precise skip isn't gonna help much.
	$LF
	"For section 3, the main premise is Theo. He can hit the on/off sprites letting Mario through. He's kind of a pain to carry around, and you can't just drop him and go under the level (if that'd even be possible) since you die if Theo even goes 5 pixels into the void, but at a certain point these problems are solved, as you can throw Theo into a spot that lets him constantly trigger the on/off switch, which helps alot in terms of where the on/off switches are in the first place. The berries and Crystal heart aren't hard to get as much as they are time consuming, going completely separate paths to collect.

	"No berries, just a race to the crystal heart and then the end. The feather is introduced here, and one timesave I didn't realise existed is instead of going directly diagonal, tap the direction adjacent to the held direction to save the speed instead of setting them both to positive or negative 32, and instead the maximum of 48. Making tight circles is key to getting around some walls quickly. A few Kevins are skipped as they're useless. The specific one in section two however is used to clip through the on wall. There's nothing wild about the Crystal Heart collection process to document however. For the Badeline fight, the main objective is to try to get to where she'll be before she does to instantly hit her, or if not possible, get there as fast as you can, since she opens up the pathways to progress in the level. Alot of feathers here are useless, same for most of the Kevins being completely skipped. At the end She isn't even needed past the last wall

	"Time to put everything together in one level and add a second dash. The spring jump is used to get another dash up higher, allowing moving quickly to become faster. Since section 1 is just a harder Forgotten Site, nothing to note. For section 2, however, the dash blocks are back. The shell is for killing the chuck to switch the gate to berry 4 off, which is also what we need the shell for, to do a shell jump between the spiked walls. As for the end of section 2, that setup you see is the best setup I could come up with without losing a whole bunch of time. It is very precise though. For section 3 only one berry, so just like in Celestial Resort, alot of under the level is used. Section 4 is pretty fun to get berry 7 for. You need to go under the level to hit the switch without wasting a ton of time. Berry 8 is easy to get, just go in the way you're meant to leave and exit that same way. It's easier and faster to get. For the end of the section, there's no real way to speed it up. Section 5's berry is the slowest part of the entire section, due to needing both dashes at a point that's too far to get to without using the two dashes. Section 6 is relatively easy and straightforward. For the Crystal Heart, you gain a third dash, however under the level becomes completely impossible, forcing almost the intended way. I say almost because there's only like one skip that hardly saves time. Also at the end after grabbing the Heart you can continue dashing into the pipe. Then for the end you have to grab the 15th berry before grabbing the orb since you can't after. And thus concludes the summit. But don't worry, we still have two levels before the end.

	"Finally back to more -1 starts and max running/sprinting speed. This levels gimmick is you can only regain dashes from dash crystals or a midway, so any dash speed must be conserved at all costs. Some small timesave I found was to keep the bats from despawning to bounce off one of them to grab the first berry, avoiding needing to walljump off the wall that puts you further from the entryway. Grabbing the buzzy shell and doing the intended dash, you can land on the ice ball and then you can use that buzzy shell to do a midair, skipping the wait for the bowser statue. The second buzzy can't be used for cheese however. Also by avoiding the on/off sprite you can get the second berry in one go without needing to backtrack. In the second section, keeping the blue shell can be used to save time and a dash (which also saves time) later in the section. Everything up to the red koopa is normal. At the red koopa, since you have the blue shell, you don't need the koopa at all besides a boost to the other side. Immediately after is a part with a sawblade transporting you to and from an on/off switch to get through a gate. Since we have the second dash, however, we can immediately head out after hitting the switch, skipping having to wait for the sawblade to come back. Berry 3 is faster to get instantly with a shell jump instead of doing a whole lap only to do another whole lap. The third section is where we get more limited to speed options. The layer 2 is running on the on/off Layer 2 scroll setting, meaning going up in the "off" state, and going down in the "on" state. There is a midair that avoids having to grab a useless switchblock sprite that loses time. The purpose of hitting the bottom turnblock at the turnblock gate I don't know. It just wastes time especially if you need it for the 5th Berry. The level ends with the Crystal Heart so that's everything.

However you can't do the up-throw regrab to gain height, so if it is a Propeller block, it's been modified to have a bit less cheese-ability. Then we have the exploding fish. By hitting them from the side it sets Mario's speed to 96 and gives him back his dash, meaning it's essential to have for as long as possible before using the dash making him go 33 SPpF slower. Hitting them from the top doesn't affect his horizontal speed though, so hitting it from the side is optimal for fast movement.

There's also some precise jumps into triangles to save some time. For the disco shells you can't really speed this up. At the end you can do a dash into the dash Crystal and remove just enough speed to only need to jump on the ? blocks once and use both dashes to get onto the triangle to the exit pipe.

Since the music runs when you are paused, you can pause buffer to avoid some walls and/or wait for the ground to appear, therefore skipping having to wait for some intended cycles. And since in some cases this is faster than being unpaused, doing some playaround stalling, and appearing last possible second, there is heavy pause buffering. Same goes from
