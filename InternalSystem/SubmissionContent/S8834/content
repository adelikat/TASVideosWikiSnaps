	" of this game, there are only 5 worlds that are required to complete the main game, but there is one bonus world after beating the main game and I was a bit disappointed there was no way of sneaking in this extra world into the base run. So instead, I've decided to submit this as a single level run that starts off where an any% run would have finished.

	"Starting from a completed file also presented a small but appreciated benefit I really wished was available in the any% run, that being whatever inventory we wanted. Originally I had stocked it with multiple burgers, ice blocks, boomerangs and fire, but in the end it turned out fastest to just have a single burger for the start. For entertainment's sake I'd argue for the allowance of this, as it makes it much more difficult and slower to work with just what the levels give us, plus, this does start after the completion of the base game after all.

	"To start off with, I didn't want to disappoint and ended up cramming two wall clips in the first few frames. The first was pure luck and in no way expected but the second is definitely faster than going under the wall. Halfway through, there is more precise burger movement to get on top of the massive block wall through the downward force, skipping the lengthy process of blowing up the wall to et past. Apart from that, it's just quick burger movement to get straight to the end.

	"Finally! A level we now need to play properly. This level requires 5 orange keys to complete it, with now way to skip this requirement as the exit is well protected with multiple layers of blocks surrounding it. My route for this level was just working from the top down. The uppermost key required an ice block to bypass the slide, the next needed a boomerang to get through the blocks, the third was just at the far end of the level, the fourth blocked behind a large wall of ice, needing a barrage of burgers to destroy it, and the fifth usually needing a cart to ride to it but a well-placed burger and jump can get it and still land on the slide to get out safely. I originally had stacked out my inventory for this level but came to realise everything was so perfectly placed it saved time to just use what was given.
