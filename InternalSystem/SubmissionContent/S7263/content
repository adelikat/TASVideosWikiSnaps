	"A little while ago, I had a curiosity to know how many of the the NES "Black Box" games had published TASes.  I was a bit surprised to see how many didn't and decided that it'd be a worthwhile endeavor to try and work toward having published TASes of this collection of games.  In addition to completing this sub-collection of NES games, it will also progress the TASMania project.   I have begun TASes on a few of the currently un-published games.
