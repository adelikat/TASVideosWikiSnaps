	"This 2021 homebrew remake of the original version of MatWH in which Mona the cat becomes interested in the treats the witch has laid out when her hat falls on Mona's head and everything comes to life. Instead of just putting it back on the shelf, the player must journey across the village to give it back to the witch who for some reason is not in the same building as the one her hat is in, making for a very exciting TAS.

	"But seriously, this game is nothing amazing. It's another one of many 'hold right/left the entire time' games with a not very fun jump. I wasn't able to find anything useful and it's a bit of a shame there's one last input required after the autoscroller so the TAS can't end upon getting to a safe spot
