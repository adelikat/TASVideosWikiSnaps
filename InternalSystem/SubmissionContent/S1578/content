	"Moai-Kun is a fun, fast-paced puzzle-platformer where the goal is to rescue all your pink friends and then reach the door - to continue to the next stage. Appearatly you play as an Easter Island statue, however I do not know the reason for this >_>... The stages are filled with enemies, pits and spikes to make life miserable for you. Also scattered throughout the stages are bombs which can be used to blow up blocks, and rocks which can be pushed and stood on. Every four levels you are given a password which can be used to continue your progress, none which are used here.

		" When I at any time stop movement and there is no reason for it (ie. bombing something), it's because I have to stop breaking blocks for a while, else the character will get a buckled head. This lasts for about 10 seconds, where he cannot break anything, so it is best to just wait a moment.

		" Two blocks cannot move at the same time, so at some times I have to wait for the currently pushed block to stop moving before I hit the next one.

		" A bug for zipping through blocks is used in numerous stages, first one seen in stage 4. When there are two blocks on eachother, and you break the bottom block in mid-air, you'll go inside the now falling above block and zip up it when it lands. This doesn't work on all blocks/all stages, and I don't really know why.

		" Another strange glitch that occours in stage 51 where the character goes right through a block after jumping on the trampoline. He then travels all the way through and ends up on the trampoline to bounce up.

However, the game features an in-game timer, such as the one in Super Mario Bros. By putting all the times in here, you can still refer to a specific stage as long as you know the time for it.
