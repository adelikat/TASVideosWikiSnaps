	"I got an idea to do Gods, because I never managed to finish the last boss on PC. Gods is not a classic game, but I've seen worse. You control a (Greek?) hero who is going to become a god. This hero moves really badly and can't even wobble very well. There are lots of weapons, monsters, items, "puzzles", levers, doors, traps, secrets, treasures and even a wandering shopkeeper to deal with. Many different bonuses are awarded no matter what you do: play well to get "bonus" or play badly to get "help bonus". Bosses are huge, so at least there is something worth seeing.

		"(3:31:14) One problem here is, that the effect of the jump potion is still on, so I can't jump over the snake. If you think some death looks badly used, look again or try doing better yourself. :)

	"The boss fights are hard to optimize because of the many factors included. It is usually the best thing to just cause as much damage as fast as possible. However, there are some problems. For example, sometimes, when you kill the 1st boss, the game gets jammed completely. The 2nd boss can be killed faster, but then you can't collect the one piece of treasure so fast as it will fall through floor or explode to the right. The 3rd boss moves in very long patterns, not updating it's view very often.

	"Honestly, I tried to be perfect, but failed. If I had time, I would improve this immediately by 1 second. The result would not look essentially different because the tiny 2-frame mistakes are evenly distributed to the whole movie. This may also be my imagination, because I've lost some objectivity in the playing process.
