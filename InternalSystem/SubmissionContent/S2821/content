The Simpsons cartoon has now spanned 21 seasons, a world-wide movie, and licensing from here to kindgom come. In this TAS, adelikat and DarkKobold use four of the five Simpson family, to track down the missing 5th member, Maggie.

Additionally, each pair of characters can create a special attack, that is controllable by both players. It is initiated by having two characters stand next to each other without moving for about 40 frames.

	"Homer uses his fists and feet to deal damage. Additionally, he gets more fun animations when throwing a bowling ball. Watch for his wind up throw against the first boss! Also, when pairing with the kids, homer can deal 12 damage per punch. This is a faster attack than the special attack, but doesn't provide a great amount of benefit, so it is not used extensively. When homer pairs with his wife, they go for a lil' roll... not in the hay, but around the screen, causing 4 damage per hit.

This attack does 8 dmg, and can help keep the screen moving forward by hitting enemies at the back of the screen. However, all credit for kills is given to the children, so Marge's score stays low the entire game. All right now, play friendly!

	"One of the two biggest difference between this run and the TMNT run is the inability to scroll enemies off the screen. Thus, we needed to use Marge's heave ability, as it allowed the children to hit the back of the screen, but end the throw at the front. Also, thrown objects do 8 or 12 dmg, and make it easier to hit enemies from the back. The other big difference is synchronized hits cause extra damage. This means that all four simpsons hitting simultaneously causes 48 damage!

	"The intro level brings us by noiseland arcade (featured in many episodes), the firehouse, and the rusty barnacle. Also watch for a cameo by Principal Seymour Skinner and Martin Prince. The boss of this level was taken down in two rounds, due to his extremely-high knockdown value. Each boss has an amount of damage they can take due to knock down. Does anyone know what episode the boss came from?

	"KrustyLand is both part of the Simpsons Universe, and in 2008, our world as well, at Universal Studio, Hollywood. This level features enemy rabbits, based on the character from Matt Groening's initial comic, "Life in Hell." Ironically, the Simpson family was sketched in minutes, due to Matt Groening not wanting to give up ownership of said rabbit. The boss is simply Krusty's face on large balloon. While the knockdown value for this boss is higher than used in the run, it didn't save time to use normal hits over coordinated specials. Also, note that Snowball 2, the cat, and Santa's Little Helper, Bart's dog makes an appearance as weapons in this level. Strangely, Otto the Bus Driver hands out deadly shakes. Must be a summer job.

The graveyard is featured in many Treehouse of Horror movies. Additionally, the twofer boss are not actual mobsters from the series. However, the generic 'skinny' mobster that appears hundreds of times in the run is based off of the sidecharacter "Legs" who works for Fat Tony.
