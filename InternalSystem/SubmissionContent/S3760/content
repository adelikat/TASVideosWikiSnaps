	"Ing's Adventure is a game about pro Zelda speedrunner Ingx24. He really hates The Legendary Kaztalek and all of his stupid clones. So he's going to go kill them all. Except he doesn't. Sure sure, he kills Rocmox, some guys in a drill tank thingy, and Cafde, but screw the rest. Instead, he abuses Cafde and goes into a strange world filled with repeated maps and a bunch of falling. After reaching Keeta Kastle from the roof, he goes all #YOLO and just skips killing Keeta too. Using help from other speedrunners of course. Rap included for bonus swag.

	"Pretty much, Ing's Adventure is a Knytt Stories game. The game is intended to use some glitches to advance, but this run abuses some poor level design and manages to get OoB and skip to the end, getting the real ending instead of the fake ending. The power-ups are picked up in this order: Wall jump, double jump, high jump. Those are my simple names for them, idk if they actually have legit names.
