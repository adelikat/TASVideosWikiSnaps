	"Super Mario Bros. 3 was a big hit worldwide. Its 2004 remake for the GBA was an excellent remake adding extra E-reader Levels and other fun things. This TAS, solely done by me, plays through the game with warps.  This is like

	": This run uses a ROM with a crack intro, when it should have been done on a perfect [!] dump. Aside from that, there are noticeable problems with optimization all throughout. Aside from 
	[em 
		"that
	]em
	", the category of "no left+right" is arbitrary. A run of this game should use the left+right glitch, as it makes the run significantly faster.

	"KnucklesMaster368, I highly recommend following the advice given to you in this thread. From now on, if you know you can do better on a run, don't submit it: Just go straight to doing better. Post WIPs frequently on the forums for other people to judge, and be sure to take constructive criticism well in your endeavor to improve. I'm sure a precisely optimized run of this game (plus the e-reader levels) has a place on the site. Don't give up and keep aiming for it!

	"Audience feedback is poor, and the run has technical flaws. The ROM is incorrect, and the category is arbitrary. Rejecting.
