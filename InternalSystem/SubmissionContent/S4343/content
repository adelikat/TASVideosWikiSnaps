	"Besides being fun to play in real-time, it's also a great game for TASing. It has fast-paced and lag-free gameplay, nice graphics, and simple mechanics. Both moving up and down and rotating the helicopter don't decrease your horizontal speed, which is great for both optimization and entertainment.

	"I started this run a week and a half ago after blindly playing through a few Atari 7800 games for good ones to TAS. My original run contained some now-obvious mistakes, like shooting the bases right before landing and taking the time to destroy tanks guarding bases. I started over when I found out that shooting the bases earlier was faster.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Unfortunately, this game is not at all hex-friendly: performing the same input a few frames earlier will move the chopper differently and cause a desync. For instance, moving a hundred frames of flying low to the ground for entertainment by 20 frames would always cause the helicopter to hit the ground at some point. While this meant I had to redo everything, I'm glad I did because the run looks better now.

		" You can't quickly slow down or change direction when flying at your top speed of 3 pixels per frame. Because of this, it's usually fastest to take off for a specific pixel from a distance that's divisible by 3 and then land by simply crashing into the ground.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This is a bug I discovered that glitches out part of the screen. It seems to happen because you dip below the maximum allowed Y-Position, the game doesn't know where to draw the helicopter graphics and so it freaks out. You can trigger it from the ground through a series of Up,Down+1 and Up,1,(nothing),1. Nothing should happen the first time you try one of these input sequences, but eventually, these sequences will make the helicopter rotate, something it's not supposed to be able to do on the ground.
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" You will know when the glitch is active when part of the screen starts glitching out. From here, you can fly up a little and press 1 again to cancel the glitch (and imprint the glitched graphics on the screen), or fly too far up, left or right to crash the game to a colored screen.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" My favorite part is that just before you activate the glitchy screen, you can resume normal play, just without pressing 1. Whenever you want, press the button and the game will crash instantly to a colored screen. You can make a savestate at this point, change up the input and play around with crashing to screens of all different colors and tones. It's very entertaining, and you might even get some surprises, like recognizable graphics and sound effect patterns.
