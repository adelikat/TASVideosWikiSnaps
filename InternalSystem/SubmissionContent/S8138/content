	"Mole Attack is a video game clone of the mechanical arcade game Whac-A-Mole. It was published by Commodore in 1981 for the VIC-20 and the Commodore Max, by HAL Laboratory.

	"This game, in which moles pop up from nine holes, has a player send them back underground by bopping them on the head with a hammer, which is controlled with the joystick or the keyboard. This is done over a 60 second period, which will get extended once by 30 more seconds, upon reaching 150 points.

	"I originally wanted to do this game on the VIC-20, but tools for TASing on that computer don't exist yet. I tracked down the version on Commodore 64 and was a bit confused. I eventually figured out that it was released on the Commodore Max...which is compatible on the Commodore 64.

		"Striking all mole positions: Yes...in this TAS, we strike all the moles...even on the butt! Why? There is a code issue that ignores a butt side hit when it first appears, and can eliminate a mole from going through the cycle of its animation. This was something that wasn't done on the first pass, and yielded a score of 496 points. By including both sides, I was able to bring that score up to 520. It is also worth noting that hitting the butt side of a mole will subtract up to 5 points, if done on the wrong frame.

	"Yes! More BOTing! In this case, I was able to write my first lua script that actually played a game to completion. With my BOT, the game was able to max the score out at 504. This was a problem though, since I was never able to program every kind of situation that can exist. Mainly trying to perform AI as I would with manual TASing...very complicated.

	"This method did help us to determine one important detail. Neither DrD2k9 or myself was going to re-TAS this game over and over for delays at the start of the game. So, we used this script to determine if frame delays was going to yield better timing patterns for Mole appearances. At the conclusion of this experimentation, we saw that no frame delays was the answer. :(
