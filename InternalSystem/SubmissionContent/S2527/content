	": The input file in this submission is the exact same as the input file in the 
	[a href=/1388M 
		"published movie
	]a
	", with a change in rerecord count. Since the input is exactly the same, the game is obviously completed on the exact same frame. For whatever reason the emulator is made to believe the input file is a frame shorter, but there is still one frame of input after the emulator says the input ends.
