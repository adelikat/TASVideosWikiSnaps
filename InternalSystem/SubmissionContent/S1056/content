	"The Reason I made this run is because I wanted to see one with four players, so ¿why should I wait for someone to make it happen?

	"I admire the precision and accuracy, but I also love to watch an “untouchable heroe” movie, so I decided to create it with that premise (sounded like a challenge).

	"I hope this run has what is needed to entertain and amaze the viewers.

	"I tried to keep the action alive giving each kid his time and place to act, but in some levels you need to regroup and walk as a four-headed Monster.
	$LF
	"Some bosses could be killed faster, but I think is more interesting to use all the dream costumes to make it more dynamic. The real battle speed comes near the last confrontation with freddy, so watch it carefull, You’ll see a huge difference between killing bosses with and without four athletes.
