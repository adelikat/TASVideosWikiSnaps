	"Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee is a 2D side scrolling platform game released in 1997 for the PS1 and PC. This movie beats the previous movie by 1 second thanks to a new strat in the Stockyards, several optimizations in RuputureFarms and some improvements in Zulag 4 using a fargrab trick.

	"By timing this glitch perfectly you can make Abe stop and turn. To set it up, Abe needs to be standing near a ledge (pressing up whilst tunring arround) you will be able to make Abe do a backwards jump. Notice that when you press the opposite direction to where Abe is standing at the incorrect frame, Abe will just jump up and stand. But if you time it perfectly, Abe will jump backwards and possibly jump to another screen. This will allow you to jump backwards to areas and skip Zulags. In a 100% run it will allow you to get to secret areas quicker and it skips a section of StockYards Escape after finishing the secret area. Sligfantry's video can show you how this glitch works:

With advice from Himmdawg, I can run and jump from the top ledge to the bottom platform and he said I had to be aware of RNG with the Slogs as they can be further away from Abe. But I figured out I can overcome this RNG by rolling on the next screen with the other Slog. Also, the slepeing Slog can be RNG too - sometimes he'll wake up quicker whilst the other Slogs are chasing.

All these improvements seem to be pure strategy, coming from a deep knowledge of the game, which isn't something I have. What's left is as optimized as it can be. The game's pretty fickle with its movement: If you're unfamiliar, it controls in much the same way as Prince of Persia, so actual optimization opportunities are fairly limited With Samtastic currently busy on 100%, I think it's safe to accept this as an improvement to

Like the previous publications of this category, it's staying in Moons for now, but that's mostly because I can't really pin down how the audience is reacting. The prior publications have been getting fairly low entertainment ratings, and it's hard to tell whether or not they're "real": i.e, whether it's an actual sign that we need to readjust the tier or if it's just fatigue from how many minor improvements this game receives. I'd like to see some discussion on this, whether in the thread, in the
