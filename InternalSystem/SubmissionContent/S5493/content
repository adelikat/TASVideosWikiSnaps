This shows that there is still a lot of improvement to be made. As such, I'm rejecting this submission for being suboptimal and losing a lot of time compared to already-present WIPs.

	"Better luck with your next attempt! Try to ensure that it at least matches Tompa's WIP in terms of its level of optimization.
