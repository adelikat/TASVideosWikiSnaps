	"By the looks of this submission, you clearly did not read my judgment message from your

		"previous submission
	]a
	". Maybe you disagree that your previous movie was cancelled 
	[em 
		"mere minutes

	" after it was submitted? Or you think you don't need to read any of the rules because they don't contain important information anyways? Or maybe you just didn't realize that this movie makes 
	[b

	" of not beating existing records. But enough of speculations, let us dive into this submission and list everything that's wrong with it.

[p 
	"Most of the advanced users know where to look to quickly estimate the quality of a run or simply the level of optimization. By looking at the rerecord count of 688 in a movie of 18172 frames you can see that it gives a ratio of one rerecord per ~26 frames. This game does not have a lot of cutscenes, and especially this game has a complicated engine to optimize. The amount of rerecords for this kind of framecount is the first indicator showing this movie is slow and unoptimized. But this is not yet a definite point you can use to argue against a run. So the next thing we look at is the time.
	$LF

[p 
	"18172 frames on the NTSC version means a time of

	[b

		[a class=intlink href=/MovieRules 
			"rules
		]a
	]b
	". The emulator acts as if this was a NTSC game and speeds up the game, which is not how it works on a real console. It should be common sense to run the emulator in PAL mode for a PAL game.
	$LF

[p 
	"Fixing the PAL flag in the movie file lets us continue figuring out the
