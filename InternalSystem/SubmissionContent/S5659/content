	"Most of the advanced users know where to look to quickly estimate the quality of a run or simply the level of optimization. By looking at the rerecord count of 688 in a movie of 18172 frames you can see that it gives a ratio of one rerecord per ~26 frames. This game does not have a lot of cutscenes, and especially this game has a complicated engine to optimize. The amount of rerecords for this kind of framecount is the first indicator showing this movie is slow and unoptimized. But this is not yet a definite point you can use to argue against a run. So the next thing we look at is the time.
