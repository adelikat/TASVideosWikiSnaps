	[a href=/diff.exe?page=MovieRules&rev=26&prev=25 
		"2005
	]a
	") rule that excused publishing 1-level movies due to the former precedent. Now such movies are just strongly disliked by the audience, which means they can not be accepted to 
	(__wikiLink|Moons)
	", and are not eligible for 
	(__wikiLink|Vault)
	" either. This submission neither completes the game, nor was liked, nor is vaultable. Rejecting.

[p 
	"Now, to prevent any ambiguity, that rule was removed from 
	(__wikiLink|Movie Rules)
	", because it doesn't make sense anymore. The runs that don't complete games are not acceptable. And no, it was not a post factum measure to justify this particular decision. The decision about this submission was stated independently in the previous paragraph.
