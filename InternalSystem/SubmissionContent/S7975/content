	"This submission is for Mutant League Hockey, a Genesis game in the same vein as Mutant League Football. There are numerous deadly hazards, you can kill opposing players, the ref, goalies, etc. It's a very chaotic and fun game.

	"In my recently developed obsession with extreme early input ending shenanigans, I present to you: Warlor-- er Mutant League Hockey. This game can be won via traditional score based play, or you can murder enough of the other team to make them run out of players and forfeit. The latter choice is obviously the better and more entertaining option.

	"There is some RNG to this that we had to dodge. If two players get into a fight, you have to menu out of it when they're done, which is an input. Which is bad. We also can't let the period end for the same reason, so setting the timer to 8 minutes (which doesn't even cost us frames to do) gives us just enough time to win and that seed avoided fights. Changing to the Skatium was also crucial to the run, and also didn't cost us frames.

	"Beyond that, faceoffs don't need to be won, and we can just stand there if we get the puck. Our AI teammates are surprisingly confident and bloodthirsty and do a great job of slaughtering the other team in our stead. This turned out to be pretty entertaining with some drama at the end.
