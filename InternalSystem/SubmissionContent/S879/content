	"This is my third submission of the Lolo 2 pro levels run. This time, the movie length is 7483 frames, which is about 2 minutes, and 4,7 seconds. This is well over a minute faster than the first submission of this game type, by Randil, which was 3 minutes and 9 seconds long.

	"The main reason this submission actually is here, is because of Hanzou. Hanzou gave showed strategies and tricks for pro A, pro B and Pro D. Thanks alot Hazou!
	$LF

[p 
	"Hanzou showed pro A could be completed with 2 shots left. A strategy in pro B that killed the lag faster. And suggested a different take on pro D. Hanzou found out it was possible to dodge an alma, if it's directly chasing you. This saves a shot, which comes in handy later on.

	"Pro A is 938 frames faster. Nearly all waiting time is over, which saves a whole lot. (note that I don't push the block at the beginning for having better timing on the don medusa)

[p 
	"Pro B is 49 frames faster. I found many ways to be faster than Hanzou's 48-frame-faster version, but the randomness made me lose all those time. At the end, I did find a way to improve Hanzou's version by a frame, by taking a different route at the beginning.
	$LF

[p 
	"Pro D is 255 frames faster. Several small tricks are included to manipulate the alma's movement. This strategy involves much more free alma's moving, which made it alot harder. At the end of the level, I walk straight past a gol, which should have fired normally. Not pushing certain blocks seems to have influence on this.

	"I'd like to thank Hanzou, for finding a better strategy at Pro B. After shooting two enemies in pro B, the lag is virtually killed, and Hanzou's tactic shows that is actually 40 frames faster.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Of course I also knew about the lag, and the fact that it was stopped by shooting two enemies... but the route I had was pretty good, and first shooting 2 enemies would result in having to walk more squares. Also, the first two enemies would regenerate faster, causing trouble later on... these 2 things kept me from actually testing it. Fortunately Hanzou did, and he came to an improvement of 40 frames.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I changed Hanzou's route a little, by shooting the first 2 enemies in a different order, and picking up the hearts faster. I also had to change the route in the upper part of the level a bit to luck manipulate the enemies movement. At the end, my final version of Pro B is 17 frames faster than Hanzou's, so the total improvement is 57 frames. All other levels are played equally fast as before.

	"After Randils Adventures of Lolo 2 run, he made a test movie of the pro levels. Hanzou pointed out a level that could be improved, which gave Randil the motivation to really make a pro levels run. Ever since Randil made his test movie I wanted to make a pro level run sometime, and Randils pro level run made me decide to start it.

I knew a small improvement at the beginning, but after having done that small change, I realized the entire enemy movement and such were different. So basically, Randil's and Hanzou's tactics were very good, but useless to me, since the whole level had to be played different. At the end, I managed to save a whopping 1605 frames on this level alone, making this level about 300 frames faster than the latest version Hanzou posted.
