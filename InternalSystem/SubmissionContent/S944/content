	"The run manipulates luck in some instances by waiting frames before holding down in order to spawn the needed tetromino. The next string of tetrominoes derive from the number of frames during each placement, which I could control exactly. I always cleared tetrises since a lesser clear would require more animation frames. I found the best placement sequence by trial and error, choosing the fastest one and avoiding top-outs.

	"This version of VBA made rerecording very smooth. Because rerecording takes the time element out of the game, Tetris becomes more of a puzzle. Sometimes I would go through 4 placements on the same tetromino before finding one that worked. Although the run looks short, I doubt anyone would want to watch this for 30 minutes. A marathon 9,999,999 game would probably take about that long. And besides, players generally like to compete in this mode-- making it what I think the most appropriate for optimizing. The best players claim the world record in 1:13.
