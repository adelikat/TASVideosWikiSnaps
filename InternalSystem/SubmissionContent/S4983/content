		" Optimization is lacking. You go through the initial menus slowly, and during most minigames you just autofire A with seemingly no regard for optimization. You also set your name in-game, replacing the firmware default name, instead of setting up the firmware file to begin with.

		" The goal choice is arbitrary. You set up a party game with an arbitrary amount of turns, instead of running a mode more suitable for running such as Story Mode. Getting 50 stars is itself an arbitrary goal, which generally does not make for a good category choice.
