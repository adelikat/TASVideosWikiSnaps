	"There are a few minor variations within certain levels, offering more than just one solution which works.  Some even have enough time to start the dominoes toppling before setting every piece in its final place, giving a nice early start to the level.  In terms of constructing each solution, there's often a multitude of paths which commute.  Depending on which order you choose to move blocks in, it may take 3+5 moves, or perhaps 5+3 moves.  Maybe if you swap their destination positions around, it'll instead take 4+4 moves; so often there's no importance to the order in which to move stuff.  Once a level has been completed successfully, our character "G.I. Ant" will try to do a slow victory cheer, negated by moving.  That's why at the end of every level, we're forced to wait just next to the exit instead.  Sadly due to the nature of this game, the vast majority of these solutions are easy to replicate in real time, with only a handful of levels offering a well timed improvement to previous efforts.

	"Dropping something onto a splitter will activate it, but this does NOT count as your initial push.  This means more than one sequence can be set up within the same level; either as required or as part of an alternate solution.  Tumblers can be picked up during motion, plus move slow compared to walk or normal topple speed.  This means it's advisable to minimise distance travelled by these, if alternate solutions can allow it to.
