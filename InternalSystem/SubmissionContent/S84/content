	"A break from the usual side-scrolling fare, I used to play this with my older sister years ago. I was often the archer, not because she was any good (she's probably the worst of the group) but because her rebounding arrows annoyed my sister to no end. Ah, good times.

	"The chain-wielding red(?)head, Erin, is my choice for the run. The reason becomes clear at the first boss. She kills the first boss (and several afterwards) in one "hit," since her chain does damage every frame instead of being a one-hit projectile like everyone else's.

	"In case you were wondering, everyone gets a projectile-blocking shield they can use by holding down the attack button. Since it takes a while to get it going, I use it only twice in the whole run (once towards the end of act 5, once in act 8). I point this out because it doesn't seem obvious when I do it.

	"There are a couple instances of random factors that I just can't seem to get on my side. One is the waterfall; the one I go into happens to be furthest away, but I've tried so many times to get it to change, I just gave up on it. Another is that incredibly annoying dragon that forces a few seconds of wait both ways in act 4. Additionally, there are a few enemies I should have killed but didn't (one in act 2 spits a projectile in my way). I whiff a few swings of the chain, too, though that doesn't cost me any time.
