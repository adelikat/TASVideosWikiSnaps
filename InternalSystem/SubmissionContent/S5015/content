	"After dying, the pink enemy respawn in a certain position. If there is a box in that position, he will spawn somewhere else. As in the previous run, I used 4 boxes to block all the positions he would try to spawn before trying right above the gray enemy, so that it blocks its shot. By setting up the boxes in a better way before going up, it took less time to fix their positions when going back down, so 67 frames were saved.

	". Instead of going left from the 'O' to the 'C', I move the selector up so that it loops to the 'END', and then I moved it down again and it looped to the 'C'. In the actual stage, no frames were saved.
