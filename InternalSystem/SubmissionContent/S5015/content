	"After dying, the pink enemy respawn in a certain position. If there is a box in that position, he will spawn somewhere else. As in the previous run, I used 4 boxes to block all the positions he would try to spawn before trying right above the gray enemy, so that it blocks its shot. By setting up the boxes in a better way before going up, it took less time to fix their positions when going back down, so 67 frames were saved.
