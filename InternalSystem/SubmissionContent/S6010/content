	": This game features a few changes in basic fighting gameplay it introduces at first, like forcing a few fights between AI and removing the rules altogether. But regardless, this game is about manipulating the RNG, and this is done on clearly superhuman level here. This run is also inhumanly boring. Accepting to Vault.
