It's a neat game with it's own varying gameplay, characters, and plot. One of the main things about this game was that it was very hard, at least without tools.

	"Uses the trapezes (trapeces?) to gain momentum over the tightropes (the unicycles are slow). Those trapeze artists have horrible hit collision boxes, as you usually need to be to the lower left to kill them. Also found out you can jump somewhat early in the turnstyles at the beginning. The trapezes also are set on the same schedule no matter when I restarted the level, so I believe anything done before them doesn't really matter as long as it's quick enough to catch the trapeze on the backswing. There's a certain velocity you have to be travelling in order to trigger the running animation when jumping onto tightropes, I'm no good with scripts but I seem to have found it.

Even if you're not very close to a ladder if you drill it seems to think you are and moves you onto the ladder a few frames early.

It is essential in the last part of the level. Also did a cool bounce off one of the bubbles into the ladder.

I guess it is so close to the ground that it immediately sets me back up for another attack!

If you land on the bottom for 1 frame then jump on the ladder, the drill off the top of the ladder doesn't catch the edge of the platform for whatever reason. So I used 2 frames and tada, odd. I made good use of the stars that were inevitably collected on the way. I sincerely wanted to shoot that last clown in the level but alas, I had used all my stars on more useful opponents.

Here's where I first use that trick to jump on the chomping blocks (that's what I call them, who knows what they are). These are supposed to kill you instantly, much like any spikes in the game. However while pressing right when landing on them it gives you 1 frame of running animation before it kills you. That's enough to allow you to jump to safety! I use it to get past that stupid cloud platforming section at the beginning. Also I used the fireman's fire breath to kill me quicker as getting hit by it takes away two A's (the health in this game). This level has a bit of lag in it towards the end (I'm not sure what was causing it) that I couldn't seem to get rid of, so it costs me a frame or two on the ladders.

You're not supposed to be able to jump when coming off of the rapids, but I found that at an angle on it you can make Aero perform the landing animation as if he's on solid ground.

Another thing about this level the cleavers can be on awkward cycles not allowing you to cleanly jump through them. I managed to manipulate them all in my favor. Near the end of the level those stupid fireballs are ALWAYS in the way, so unfortunately I have to slow down.
