[h3 
	"-Infinite flame (trick):
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"You can use this input series to use the infinite flamethrower (1,_,1,_,1,_,1,_,1,_,1,_,1,_,1,_,1,_,...) , this can do create graphical bugs and crashes the game.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"-Climb the ladder quickly (trick) :
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"You can catch the ladders more fast, only if the scrolling is advanced and if it's to use up direction.
	$LF
	"To go down the ladders, it's more fast to jump into them, it's possible to make a precise jump and enter into the ladder at the limit of the out and to can out directly when you fall, else you are obliged to continue to fall inside the ladder. 
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"-You see me, you don’t see me (glitch) :
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"When you use the flamethrower at the extreme right or left and than the flame can reach the limit of screen, Ripley disappear because values of  the hitbox past to 2, like you take damages but don't take really that damage, however the hitbox value  is freeze at 2 on 2 different addresses.
	$LF
	"It's super, you are becoming invincible...

	"The dark side of this glitch :
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"-You can't use elevators
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-Ripley's hitbox  have some problems to rescue prisoners or catching bullets and other objects, it possible to manipulate X position, but Y position as always as the same value than Ripley's potition.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- If you do this glitch at the extreme right (and conversely) of the screen, you can go out only at the extreme left  because you are obliged to reappear  to finish the level and you can only break this glitch, than if you repeating it on the opposite side where it was used. It's possible to change this.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Main qualities:
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"-You can téléport your hitbox's X position (I haven't find this second addresse of X position for the moment!) and rescue some prisoners more quickly, When you use the flamethrower with specific inputs on some frames (ex: 1,_,1,1,_,1,_,1,_,1,_,...(infinite flame)),you can even use it to touch the level ending trigger (must have rescue all prisoners).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-You can go from right to left (and conversely) of the screen, when you move more faster than the scrolling ( a slope can help, or catch an ladder can create a slight shift with the scrolling)
	$LF
	"In this movie, I use the ladder combined with this glitch and visit a secret room (abandoned, and there are plenty of them!).

	": Fantastic movie! This game is way more fun than the NES version, and due to the glitchfest shown in this run, it's even more fun than the Genesis version! I'm considering starring this movie in the future. Audience enjoyed it too, accepting to Moons. And great submission notes!
