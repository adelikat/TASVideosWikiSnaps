Whether the dog comes up in left or right side of the screen depends on RNG, so I had to wait a few frames before starting the fight.

	"In 5-2, the boss fight features the toughest enemy in the game which can be killed by 3 hat attack, and even worse, there're three of them. Luckily, the gun turret on the ceiling works as the stalactite in Caverns level, so I utilized to damage and manipulate the AI. I never considered this section can be this short.

	"In 5-3, normally pressing any button in the boss fight will summon the star, which will then turn you into super fighting robot. But if you press A before the boss fight music start, you can still perform the dance. And if you dance with 8 people at this point, you can skip the entire robot things. This solely saves more than 30 seconds.

	"This game suffers lots of lag which are induced arbitrarily. Depending on some random things like the number of enemy, what the player does, or just its own, it will put lags in the run. Because of this and the fact that the game is basically tedious, dull platformer, I determined to sacrificed some frames to show off and do funny stuffs. Also, I took several frames for better dance position if possible.
