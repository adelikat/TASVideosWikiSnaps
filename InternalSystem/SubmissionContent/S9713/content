	"Oh man...I really remembered this issue. There was a lot of excitement, as I saw each game for this magazine as high value. I eventually got all of them typed in and I enjoyed each one very much. Speaking of this game though...it was shocking to see such a game published in this series, as it gave me an opportunity to compete with a similar game of Asteroids.

	"There is no difficulty selection. The game progresses through levels, until it reaches level 9. I thought that this game would have kept increasing, but it didn't do that at all. Because of this, I had to go for "maximum score". After a discussion with the judges, it seemed to be a good idea to go until the score broke its container. In this case, it will roll over to "000000" and push the container out to the left. This makes it a good stopping point, where I end it at "999990" to get the highest  score possible for display.

Eventually, this got so painful that I stopped manipulating RNG to give me small asteroids only. Stopping this seemed to help, as the asteroids would emerge more frequently and give me faster waves.

While in this state,  you can fire your weapon and it will get a super fast shot that will continuing for a short period of time. If timed well, you can strike asteroids super quickly.

Given that the levels are based on time and not score, I believe a "pacifist" run could be submitted where the player doesn't shoot meterors and simply avoids being hit by asteroids for the 4.5 minutes of gameplay it takes to reach the 30 second point of the 9th level.  I don't believe such a run would be scoreless; it appears that bonus points of some sort are given at the end of a stage (maybe it's for all metors still left on-screen?).
