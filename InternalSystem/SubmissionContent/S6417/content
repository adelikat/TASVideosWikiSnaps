	"I personally really like this goal, though I must say that it's debatable to aim for the highest possible score while avoiding to take advantage of a dynamite trick that would allow to farm points endlessly. Still, using that trick would make this goal so boring that it would lose its charm completely. So maybe we could discuss about allowing to avoid this trick, but this submission is going to be rejected anyway, so I'd like to leave it for another time.
