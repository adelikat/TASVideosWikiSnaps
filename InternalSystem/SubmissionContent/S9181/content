This leads to a desynch of video and audio when spells are cast, as the animations are measured in frames, and the sounds are measured in seconds. Also, certian sounds cannot be skipped, in particular the "learning a new note" sound. First observed at the 5 second mark. These cause a pause of about 3 seconds, and constitute almost half of the entire run.

	"At about 27 seconds into the run we see the first actual difference between the TAS route and the Any%. In Any%, we let two drops fall from the stalactites into the water to infer the correct spell for "reflection". This is not required for the TAS, so all we do is immediately skip the stalactite drops and we see a total of 3 frames of falling drops. This is because of the set seed (but would work without as well), we already know the pattern through the magic of rewinding.
