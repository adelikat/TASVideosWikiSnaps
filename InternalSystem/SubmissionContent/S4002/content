	": Hello inakilbss, and welcome to TASVideos. Unfortunately, your movie is not up to the standards of our site, as it loses several seconds compared to the published movies of this game. While your attempt is okay for a first TAS, it does not merit a publication on the site. Also, "glitchless" categories are only relevant when glitches make a major difference to the way the game is run, and in the case of this game, it is not. For these reasons, I'm rejecting this movie.
