	"A quick explanation, this game is part of a reboot trilogy for Spyro. Essentially, this game acts like Empire Strikes Back in terms of storyline.

	"A trick used before getting the Charge ability. Basically pressing right or left in the opposite direction of where Spyro is facing will have him roll. This is slightly quicker then walking, but it has the disadvantage of a large lag time in-between rolls, which can be prevented by jumping. However, jumping ALSO has a lag time when Spyro lands, so to prevent that you need to attack while in the air.

[p 
	"So it's essentially goes Roll > Jump > Attack, and repeat until a destination is reached.

	"Whenever Spyro approaches an edge, he'll go into a brief climbing animation. It's quite slow, particularly the air roll towards the end of it. Luckily, the end of the air roll can be canceled with either a breath attack, a normal attack, or a jump. This is useful in skipping the tutorial after getting the Glide ability.

	"Double tapping the directional button lets Spyro charge forward, taking out anything in his way. However, every time an object is hit, there is a 7 frame lag period to show that, yes, you just rammed into something. Except for rare situations, this is avoided by restarting the charge after the object is passed.
