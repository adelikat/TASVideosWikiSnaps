	"First, we go to the menu and disable move animations which are both annoying and slow. You can do one of two things per turn. You can move one square (which creates a duplicate disc for you) or you can jump and move 2 squares (any direction, including moving like a knight in chess) which doesn't duplicate a disc. If you put a piece adjacent to your opponents discs, you flip them Othello-style.

	"There was a previous submission of this game from a few years ago. This submission is 2 frames faster than that one was due to optimizing movement tech. If you need to move directly right, holding select actually moves you faster than holding right. Due to this we can land the final piece 2 frames quicker.

	": This may be a primitive game, in that it's very short and there's only so much you have to do to be quick, but I don't think it's trivial to speedrun it optimally. You have to know how it works. For example, moving right+down and then left+down is quicker than moving straight down twice, because you get less lag. Different routing results in getting the bonus or worse AI movement. Also maybe some faster movement tech involving more Select is found in the future (I couldn't). After trying this myself, it's clear that coming up with this result wasn't trivial. Even though triviality is going to be removed as a factor soon, I don't even feel it makes sense to delay this submission until then. Accepting.
