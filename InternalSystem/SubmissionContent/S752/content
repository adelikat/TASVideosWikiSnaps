	"So do i have to describe this game again?? I'm sure most of are familiar with the Megaman Zero series...It's megaman without megaman :) and this is the 4th episode of it and frankly it's not the hardest nor the longest, though i like it...
	$LF

[p 
	"So about the hard point of this TA, the most horrible thing was to MANIPULATE LUCK, as i still do not get how it really works (how to obtain pieces from defeated enemies, make bosses do certain moves...)
	$LF

	"I collect the pieces of the galacta armor (twice damage inflicted but twice received from enemies...), it enables me to use the blaster more often, to kill the bosses in a very short time as well ws some enemies... I won't list the part of the armor here as i'm not fluent with japanese and as it would be too long...

[p 
	"Another weird thing is that buster is stronger when fired while sliding... this is weird but it's true, i don't know why...
	$LF

[ul 
	[li 
		" Being touched before climbing the wall is faster than taking the elevator handle in 2nd mission.
