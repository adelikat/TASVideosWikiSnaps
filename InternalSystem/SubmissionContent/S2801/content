	"This was supposed to be a practice run for me to get better at TASing. I then managed to improve it by 2 frames. I wasn't sure if I wanted to submit this because I was afraid it might have been too small of an improvement to warrant another publication. But some people have encouraged me to submit this, so I might as well.

	"The improvememnt over my previous submission came from a pausing trick that was found by Hotarubi. This allowed me to shorten the waiting lengths of transitions.
