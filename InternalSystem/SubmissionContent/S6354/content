Fuck the mushroom kingdom, Daisy and the cake. Everything is a lie.

	"To put it simply, excluding all the quantum physics math, theorems and laws, I use from the very beginning my frame inputs to manipulate the data which is written on the RAM, no input is wasted. The game normally executes code in the RAM starting at position 0xffb6, this is called everytime by the vblank interrupt routine, here I inject code on that region to jump directly to the function which triggers the end game-
