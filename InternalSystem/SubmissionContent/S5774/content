	"Rolan's Curse II is a somewhat clunky Zelda clone. Compared to its predecessor, it features multiple party members as well as level ups hidden in treasure chests around the world. In this run, the heroes either avoid or recklessly run past enemies. Unless they cause lag; in which case, they are mercilessly slaughtered. Only bosses that are needed to progress to the next area are fought.
