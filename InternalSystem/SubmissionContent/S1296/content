	[a class=extlink href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_vs_Spy rel=nofollow 
		"comic strip
	]a
	" featured in MAD magazine which began in 1961.  To celebrate 45 years of two spies constantly plotting against each other, I present to you this run.  There are 8 levels, which all are completed.  To avoid having to see the long animation at the end of each level, the "9th button" is used.

	"In regards to Time Bombs, it is impossible to make it across the room horizontally, nor going up or down ladders.  You can make it through the room in any other direction.

	"The level is fairly straight forward.  However at the end Black is standing in the room with the exit.  As long as he is there, I cannot leave, which I end up pausing just outside the door until he spring the exit door.  At this point I can walk in and exit the level.

	"Due to Black's movement of himself and an item, I need a weapon to fight him.  The dagger is more powerful than the club and happens to be right in my path.  However, you cannot pick it up while holding the suitcase, which is why I drop it off, grab the dagger, then go back for the suitcase.

	"For some reason, Black did almost exactly as I wanted him to: He didn't pick up the papers or money bag. He did get the club, leading to a few frames to have to maneuver around him at one point, but a lot of time was saved by not having to get the dagger and fight him.

	"First off, the death in this level is unavoidable, without having to do a superlong (and probably impossible) manipulation of Black.  The item I'm carrying when I die gets dropped off in the room, because there is an empty spot for the item to go.  If there was not, it would warp to a different location, much like the item Black was holding when he went back to his starting spot.

Second time was unavoidable laughter though.  Or uncontrollable laughter.  Hey, I thought it was funny too.
