	"Rygar time again! I finally got my thumb out to do something.
	$LF
	"I've been messing around alot with this game lately and I have discovered some really cool stuff.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Most of the text below is copied from my old submission text, with changes of course:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I managed to improve this run again. I don't want to spoil the fun watching it yet but I discovered a new way to use an old glitch. 
	$LF
	"The first 4:30-5 minutes are identical to my old run. You'll see why if you watch it,
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Some things you might wonder about (this is the walking-on-the-grass in the zelda-perspective world, Garloz). 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The first time I perform it I can't enter to the left. I tested this for hours but I simply couldn't. 
	$LF
	"When I want to get out I can't get out to the right nor straight ahead. Thus I have to scroll the screen. It still looks cool IMO and saves a good ~90 frames compared to my old run. 
	$LF
	"The passage to Lapis takes a little bit longer this time because I took the time to manipulate some enemies on the ground to drop 3 stars so I could use power up for the robots. This was totally worth it though and the first robot goes down in half the time. 
	$LF
	"It's actually raining robots!
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This is still one of my favourite childhood games. Since I started time attacking I've learned so much about this game. It's the most glitchfilled game I've ever played, timeattacking or not. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This is an improvement by 17 seconds (if I calculated it right).I still use the European version of the game since the USA version doesn't allow you to jump over the river. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"NEW STUFF: Last time I got the suggestion of doing this run with the USA-version of the game. Yes, it will most probably be faster but I strongly oppose this because of two main reasons:
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" It would be very weird if this one-item run were NTSC and the full run were PAL. I still need to jump over the river in the full run and it's not possible on the NTSC-version.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" The game is MUCH harder in PAL. Yesterday I watched EmptyEye's (I hope I got your name right dude) speedrun of this and it looked impressive. Ligar however went down with ~15 hits or something. Sure, this would cut the time down with a few seconds BUT I'm of the opinion that the harder the game is the better (cooler movie).
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"Sort of quoting from the guidelines: "One should always play on the hardest difficulty".
	$LF
	"Also, I noticed that he had 9 energy balls in his speedrun, where one can only have 8 in the PAL version.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Ok, for the gameplay. The goal in Rygar is basically to obtain several items so that you finally can go and slay the most evil boss ever, Ligar, who has threatened the land. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This version uses a really cool glitch to "warp" to Ligar very early in the game. However, Ligar IS evil, and to be able to slay him pretty fast you must gain some "experience points" first (tone points). These are obtained by slaying enemies and thus I have to run back n forth to be able to kill enough enemies and gain some tone points. The enemies that are slain are robots in Lapis (the snow/mountain world is Lapis), which gives loads of tone points, and it's here that the most improvement comes from. I kill the robots more efficiently this time and this resulted in many seconds of improvements. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In this new version I found a way to get to Ligar without dying! This means I still have my power up for that battle and it helped a lot! Also, it's possible to get to the regular place, but that battle is 4 seconds slower ;P
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Here is a collection of the tricks used: 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Floating through walls: This is performed by jumping towards the edge of a wall and hit (slightly below) the edge. If done correctly you will be in the wall and can manouver through it. 
	$LF
	"Use: The first non-jumpabale wall you come across, where the first rope in the game is. Thanks to Bisqwit who pointed out this from the beginning, I only changed it a bit. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Flying: This allows Rygar to slowly float downwards, to what should a certain death, to any hole. The thing is, when doing this you can fall through the bottom of the screen without dying and end up at the top of the screen. This is performed by rapidly hit the B-button when walking off an edge. You sort of must have a turbo-function to do this. It's pretty easy to perform though. 
	$LF
	"Use: I use it to reach the door to Garloz (The overworld-view) really fast. Thanks to some guy at gamefaqs for this. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Air walk: This is my own-invented glitch. This is used to reach the unreachable places of Lapis in the beginning of the game without the crossbow and that thing that allows you to attach yourself to roapes. Anytime you walk off a cliff/platform you normally should be falling too certain death. If, however, you duck at this moment you reset the gravity of Rygar and you can walk another few pixels before starting to fall. Duck again and repeat. 
	$LF
	"Use: To reach whatever you want, in this version to reach the area of Lapis which is normally not reachable this early in the game. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Well, that was some of the tricks involved in this one-item version. I have also discovered several other glitches like endless rope-climbing, glitch up Garloz and jump through certain doors (results in glitched-up places).
