	"First I want to make clear that this run and the \"best ending\" run weren\'t done all by myself. It\'s mainly a co-operation between me and Hotarubi, a japanese regular speedrunner who showed to have some excellent sense for TAS as well. During the creation of this and the other Gimmick! run we took some breaks in our work, the longest being from the beginning of December up until 3 weeks ago when I took it up again. I tried to contact Hotarubi but he apparently hasn\'t been available to respond, and because he\'s not a member of this site I can\'t add him as co-author - something which I\'d like to be done as soon, or if, he joins some time later.

	"This run beats my cancelled run by 2356 frames (~39 seconds) and the current published run by 3404 frames (~57 seconds). Never in my life I would\'ve thought such an improvement was possible when we started it since I only thought we would implement one new shortcut, instead it ended up in a cavalcade of new strategies. Depending of which new things you count as new strategies and which you just consider to be minor changes I\'d say there\'s about 25-30 new strategies (compared to the cancelled run). If you want to really see the changes themselves I suggest to first watch the cancelled run or current published run before watching this one.

	"Level 6: Better precision, new strat for the warriors at the beginning of the castle, a new strategy in room 5 of the castle, a new interesting strategy for the first mini boss ghost and a new strategy for the second mini boss ghost. The big ghost couldn\'t be as fast in the previous run since its movement is controlled by a timer that starts at the beginning of the level, but not too much time was lost.
