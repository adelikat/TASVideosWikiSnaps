	"Okay, seriously. Given that this is the first Vectrex submission, naturally I was inclined to take a deeper look at the optimization of this run. The main thing that jumped out to me was the fact that delaying entering the goal could actually affect the speed of the victory jingle, however in practice I was unable to get any improvements with this knowledge. The run as a whole looks well-optimized, and I can confirm that the difficulty is maximized via the WCH file, meaning that a submission that plays less levels cannot obsolete this one.
