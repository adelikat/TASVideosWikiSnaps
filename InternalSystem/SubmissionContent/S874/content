	"After Randils Adventures of Lolo 2 run, he made a test movie of the pro levels. Hanzou pointed out a level that could be improved, which gave Randil the motivation to really make a pro levels run. Ever since Randil made his test movie I wanted to make a pro level run sometime, and Randils pro level run made me decide to start it.

I knew a small improvement at the beginning, but after having done that small change, I realized the entire enemy movement and such were different. So basically, Randil's and Hanzou's tactics were very good, but useless to me, since the whole level had to be played different. At the end, I managed to save a whopping 1605 frames on this level alone, making this level about 300 frames faster than the latest version Hanzou posted.
