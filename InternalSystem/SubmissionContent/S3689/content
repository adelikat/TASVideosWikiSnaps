	"Billy Hatcher is an extremely colorful platformer/puzzle game made by the Sonic Team. It had a great and long solo (very long if you wanted to get 100%) and had an awesome multiplayer mode.

	"The gameplay of this game is simple : you can jump, run, and take an egg with which you can roll, bounce, dash... And many other combination. If you feed the egg with the fruits found by beating ennemies/on the ground/by breaking boxes, it will grow and then you will be able to hatch it and give you a special ability. There are 72 kinds of egg in this game.

	"As said before, this is a Sonic Team game, and as all of their game, the level design can be totally broken, which is basically what happens in this video. Most of the shortcuts were found by ion12, mrbuu423 and Sonikkustar (but I actually discovered his shortcuts without watching his videos, but I guess I should credit him anyway :) ). Else, there are no glitch. I think all the tricks are really obvious :)
