In the "Bloodbath" section, I touch the first speed portal I originally skipped (the one where you fly underneath the spike) and skip the fast speed portal that I couldn't grab before. This alters my frame alignment, and I also can't avoid the speed portal after the ball section. This alters my frame alignment yet again, making the ship skip possible. This intentional loss of speed saves five frames. There could potentially be a better way to do this, but this is the best I got for now.
