	"This run was inspired by my 
	[a href=/forum/t/3365 
		"famtasia challenge
	]a
	".  This is one of the few remaining survivors from the dark ages of famtasia.  This isn't from a lack of trying though.  Many a great TASer has attempted to optimize only to be slain by this evil creature.

[p 
	"And why did they fail?  The nasty RNG for the mini-game map screens at the end of each level.  But one lone TASer prevailed where many great TASer before him failed:  Using the mystical powers of Lua, he managed to conquer this evil beast once and for all.  Ok, why am I talking this way?
	$LF

[p 
	"DarkKobold was able to disect the RNG (well, as it turns out there are 2 RNG's which was the source of all the pain) and find the optimal solution for each map.  With this hurdle conquered our team quickly ravaged through this game.

	"There is a big glitch shortcut taken in level 8.  Using the bat + taking damage it is possible to get inside the wall thus passing a good portion of the level.  Thanks to yunshui for this discovery!

	"There is a weapon glitch too.  You can fire rapidly by pressing the opposite direction you are facing the frame after firing.

	"Lag is a real pain in this game.  Did anyone even test this game before they released it?  A lot of TAS strategy in levels was built around finding a way to reduce lag.  In particular, Level 8 where you could easily rack up thousands of lag frames with a bad strategy.
