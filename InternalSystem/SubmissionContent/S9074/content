	"In general, it is not faster, when climbing up, to release a ladder and grab-cancel up. This is because releasing a ladder takes one frame, and although grab-cancel up is slightly faster than climbing, we don't catch enough to make it worth. However, when near the peak of a ladder, pressing forward while releasing the ladder still makes you move up. You can then grab-cancel for two frames, grab the ladder, and repeat the process once more. All of this was performed in the run whenever possible (it is more noticeable by its sound), and it saves exactly one frame each time.
