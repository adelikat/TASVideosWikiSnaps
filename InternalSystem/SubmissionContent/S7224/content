	"This has been an 8 year project with glitch hunting, retasing, and much research. I did submit a TAS of this category last year thinking that would be the end of the any% category, but boy was I wrong. Days after submitting my first movie a speed glitch that was found 12+ years ago resurfaced, along with a new glitch with the club that makes the club the most powerful weapon in the game. For the early stages of the game up until the end of return to the graveyard the fastest form of movement is the speed glitch which caps out at 43 speed, which the normal walking speed is 28. As the run progresses past return to the graveyard the fastest form of movement is the daring dash. 58 seconds of improvement were made possible due to the speed glitch and the knockback dash, and the rest of the time is saved due to the super club glitch, better movement, and rng. Not to mention all the bosses in this game are now food for sir fotesque.

The lag is mostly caused by particle effects from the fire. The faster you get it off the screen the better.

	"This level has 2 new skips. You can skip the door that requires the skull key by using a knock back to jump out of bounds and simply walk over the gate. It's much harder than it looks to actually pull off due to the colliders only having a small hole in them to escape the level. The 2nd skip that was recently discovered allows you to jump over the moat onto the elevated area of the level, skipping the yellow rune area entirely. This trick is beyond precise. You must jump onto a very specific part of a tombstone while building up a boost jump so you will have enough speed and height to clear the moat. I had to use analog to find the correct position while also building speed with analog. The position on the tombstone is extremely precise and getting into that position while building speed is no easy task. Once you have the position and speed built up you must jump at a precise angle over to the ledge just having the right amount of height and speed. This trick within itself took 3 days to reproduce. Now onto the guardians of the graveyard. I abuse the super club glitch to pretty much make the boss a half cycle fight.

By completing the boss battle you would obtain the Dragon Armor, and a rune to raise the platform for the end of the level. Fortunately for us the developers put the exit for this level just barely out of Dan's reach by normal means. There are a few methods to skip over the end level gap, the fastest method I have found involves abusing the speed increase you get from walking on a decline and combining that speed increase with a dash jump. This provides just enough speed to clear the gap, and removes the need to waste time setting up a knock back dash.

	"This is where the run takes a huge left turn. It has been known for more than a decade that you can clip inside of the dragon fire gate, but it has never be known on how to get out. This glitch saves well over 12 minutes, and is this games version of Spyro 2's Gulp Skip. Being able to complete this level without dragon armor means you do not have to visit the entire right side of the map, thus skipping all of those levels, and any key items those levels require. The problem that I encountered while tasing this trick was the enemies. When you use the alternate attack on the club it tends to aim at near by enemies instead of where Dan is facing, so I had to manipulate the enemies to be away from where I do the knock back dash. I do the knock back dash on the right wall instead of the left due to the right wall being closer after the enemy manipulation, it is definitely much hard to do the trick from that spot. After you escape the gate, you grab the yellow rune and finish the level.

Keeping the inventory opened past this point will cause none of your soldiers to spawn in making you automatically lose the battle, so you must hit that key timing when the camera pans back to Dan with the chalice in the middle of the room.

	"This is the tricky part of the trick to understand. Since this tricks discovery back in 2010 nobody has been able to replicate it on an actual console due to a crash that occurs with the cutscene right before you face Kardok.  The trick would work normally up until that point and then just hard lock at the beginning of the cutscene. Understanding why the crash would occur was a community effort. The problem that left us as a community stumped with this trick is the fact that it works without any issues on certain emulators (psxjin,epsxe). One of the runners in the community decided to try the trick out on duckstation and was getting similar results to that of a console(Hard Locking). He tried experimenting with opening the inventory at very precise times and got the trick to progress. I attempted to replicate this trick on bizhawk with his method, and it did not work. After investigating further I discovered by repeatedly opening the inventory (buffering) you have a chance at not crashing the game due to the inventory having a longer delay on opening while buffering. To continue with the trick you must keep the inventory opened until the end of the Kardok cutscene. The root cause of this crash seems to be something to do with the view distance and how that can cause the remainder of Zarok's men to spawn in. They have 2 spawn points, each spawn point spawning in 2 additional soldiers, 4 in total. During the entire soldier battle you must stay away from the north side of the arena or you will risk spawning in the remaining 4 soldiers. After the battle is over, if you at all go to that side of the arena and activate the triggers to spawn in Zarok's soldiers the game will crash. You must leave those 2 trigger inactive for the remainder of the game.

An important thing to note, since the soldier despawn glitch is still active I must kill Kardok without activating the 2 triggers for the soldiers or the game will crash. This makes it so I can not just run up to Kardok and destroy him, I must wait for him to be out of range of the 2 triggers to begin fighting him. Luckily this left enough time to still squeeze out a 1 cycle fight and avoid any sort of shield phase.

	"Just like Kardok Skip, you must perform the same skip on the cutscene right before Zarok to progress with the soldier despawn glitch. This does provide additional issues with the trick itself. Having the inventory opened during the Zarok cutscene makes it so Zarok will be stuck behind his gate at the start of the fight. Making this fight slightly longer than it normally would be. You must manipulate him with your position and camera to free him from the gate without crashing the game. Having him free himself quickly is no easy task. Once he locks on to you he will run at you with the speed of light on his side. The remainder of the fight you must kill Zarok without touching the 2 triggers and you must kill Zarok when he is in a position where the camera will not activate the triggers during the final cutscene, so you will be able to view the credits. Having a bad end position can cause a crash during the final cutscene.

No DGS is pretty much all levels, or NMS?. Classifying a major glitch in this game is very difficult due to the time frame the dragon gate skip was actually discovered. The dragon gate skip allows you to skip both dragon gems, the dragon fight, and the dragon armor entirely, not to mention 6 levels. It is a 12+ minute time save.
