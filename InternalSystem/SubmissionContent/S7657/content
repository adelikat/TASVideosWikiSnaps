First, RTA doesn't collect maps and compasses for dungeons. The map at level 1 is located across the water, so in this TAS you don't have to visit it early unless you first get the ladder. And RTA doesn't purchase the potion.

	"), the branch name might be more appropriate with "full inventory". I don't know much about ALttP, but maximizing inventory upgrades is what both categories have in common, and they both have the same goal. Therefore, I think it is reasonable that this run should also be named "full inventory".

You can obtain the magical key immediately after completing level 2, so we only need to pick up 7 keys in total. Five of them are obtained here. Attacking Gleeok's separated head can manipulate the 10 kill counter. Damaging them with any weapon increases the value by 1 for each frame they take damage.

This means that for purposes of this category where you need to complete the game with keeping the bait, you can save 100 rupees for time saving. However, this strategy has the risk of having to go back through the previous rooms again after resetting the game, but considering the future route, I decided that it would be better to save the bait.
