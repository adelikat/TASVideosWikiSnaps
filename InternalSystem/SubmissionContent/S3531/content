	"As some of you may know, I've played quite a bit of T&E PonF. I've semi-recently posted two runs on SDA for the game. This movie uses an awesome trick to get to the credits while skipping much of the gameplay. This run completes the game in exactly 10 seconds, compared with 55 minutes for my segmented speedrun. This glitch was found by hours upon hours of internet research and testing. I think this is my best run to date.
