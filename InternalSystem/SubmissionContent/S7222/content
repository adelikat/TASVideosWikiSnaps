	"This is a very laggy sidescroller for the Gameboy, the first in a series of 3 Ninja Turtles games. It has big and detailed sprites, but is otherwise short and unremarkable. The primary optimization challenge is lag reduction, which turns out to be very complicated. Different enemies will spawn depending on when you kill the ones on screen, and it's not obvious which choice is the best long term. It basically comes down to guess and check. Fortunately the RTA times are already very good, so provide a good baseline. The present TAS also improves on Memory's WIP, with every area except 1-1 and 1-3 (which are tied) seeing at least a few frames improvement.

	" one part of this run by a little bit, the rest of the run would need to be resynced, which may take a while and may also lose more time than I saved. No interest in doing this was shown by other people, and the author may not do it soon, so I think I can just accept this run for now, because overall it is faster (or equal) than the existing WIP in every section, aside from this Baxter fight.
