	"I made this TAS two years ago so I don't remember so much about it anymore, but I'll try to remember the most important things. About half of the time of this TAS is spent leveling up, so those parts can be pretty boring. I manipulate luck so that I only get 8x "barbarians" because they give a lot of money, which I need to advance in the game. When I don't need any money anymore, I kill "evildeads" because they give most experience points for the shortest amount of time. I need the experience to get the open spell so that I can get into the last dungeons. Once I have all the experience and money, I skip all fights by luck manipulation.

	"I used a macro program to test all the frames in fights so that they would be as fast as possible. The macro was: pause, load state, advance frame, save state and hold A while unpausing. I would just press one button and the macro would do all these things, so I could test all frames fast and see which resulted in the shortest fights. That made it a lot easier.

	"I made use of a HP memory address in the last fight ("darkfalz", which is supposed to mean "dark force" but they couldn't write it because they could only fit 8 letters) to kill off one of the two "parts" of the boss so that it can only attack once. Because my level is pretty low, I need to eat hamburgers to survive the fight.

	"The rerecord count in this video is about 10000 more than it should be because I overwrote a testrun that I made previously that had about 10000 rerecords. Earlier I also made a testrun with the GBA version of the game which is much slower than this, and I remember that just when I came to the last boss, which is kinda like the devil of this game, the frame count was 666666.. just a little bit of trivia there.
