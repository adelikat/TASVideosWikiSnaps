	"Aloha!  Throughout the past year or so, I been watching dozens of TAS'ed games and hand-played speedruns on various consoles while laughing at some of the most ridiculous bugs and glitches ever exploited during gameplay.  I even did some research on several games including this one.  I also learned how to use emulator tools when TAS'ing games.  Then I finally came out of lurking and started my project for this game in New Year's Day of 2023.

As a result, Willow can walk through there, walk around the back of the trees and head one more screen west, leading up to Glitchville - later revealed as the third floor of the West tower!

Now I can go out and defeat any enemy other than Muzh and pick up Muzh's experience -- 2000 a piece so far!  This is the first part of the glitch so far.  But wait, there's more!

Here I would weaken Kael down to almost nothing before I exit again - to make sure I don't have a hard time defeating an enemy when I encounter one.  Now the game thinks I am battling Kael!  This sets up a glitch where I can defeat any enemy other than Kael to get his experience -- now up to 8000 a piece!  All I need at this rate is to defeat 5 enemies I encounter so I can get from level 4 to 13 in a well-reduced time frame.  I'll use the Patras (flying creatures) at the second floor of the East tower to my advantage.

Though Kael gives a reward of 8000 flat after defeat, I found out that the Patra here rewards only 7700 exp. and all other Patras in that same room provide no reward.  This is what led me to the whole setup of the 710 exp. I got from Bogarda's Cave and the 270 exp. from the 3 bubble ghosts I slayed at the West tower.  It was a matter of deciding between wasting frames trying to avoid these enemies and getting them out of my way while taking the exp. from them.  As far as Bogarda's cave goes, I went for the 710 exp. setup so that I won't lose any of that when I do a death warp back to Dew.  If I avoided the Keese and went straight for the 700 exp.
