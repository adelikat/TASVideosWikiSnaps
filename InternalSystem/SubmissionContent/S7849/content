	"The early input here is just insane.  First, you need slick tires and a turbo.  While this does not help on max speed, it does affect resting (non-input speed) by bumping it from 80 to 99.  This is enough speed that cares will not catch up from behind.  Next is to manipulate luck to get a very nice rank early on and get as many cars to crash as possible.  Next is to manipulate the final care before input end to not move over in front of you.  Then a hi gas must be manipulated 2 helicopters later.  At that point there is a magic x position of 96 that somehow avoid all obstacles, causes every car to spawn on obstacles, AND picks up the high gas upgrade to have enough gas to finish the race!

Even the first stage of the second loop resulted exactly the same, despite the ability to select upgrades that aren't available at the beginning of the game. So it just makes sense to raise an exception and consider the first loop sufficient, just like the relative RTA
