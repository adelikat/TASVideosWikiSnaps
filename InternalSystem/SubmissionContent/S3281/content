	"I decided to aim for fastest in-game time first and fastest real time second, since the in-game time is shown at the end of the level. I thought this would add to the entertainment. It also adds a bit more to the strategy, since you have to consider what time bonuses (these subtract from the current in-game time) to pick up: these items are usually a bit out of the way, so it requires some planning to figure out which ones are worth getting.

	"There is no precedent run of this game (at least non that I know of), neither normal console speedrun or TAS, so I didn't have much to compare to. This is my second version of this TAS, and I tested several strategies for all levels in order to find the best one. Although the game is fairly simple, it's not trivial to TAS, and there are many minor tricks you can use to shave off a few frames here and there.
