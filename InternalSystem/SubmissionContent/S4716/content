The award to the worst hitboxes in the game go to this section's miniboss, because projectiles do not count if you fire them while old ones are still on the screen. You can work around this by firing a third set of projectiles after the first ones have disappeared, as this "reactivates" your current set of projectiles.

The first hit is problematic though, because the projectile going straight up will not hit him. To counter this, I had to use my sword once to glitch the game into firing two fireballs forward as opposed to one going upward in the next attack. Lining this up with another attack allows me to hit the Vampire for 5 damage on the next attack. As the game remains active several frames into the fade to black, I had to work in the dark to perform this.

The water drains your health very quickly though, so I can't stay in it for too long. Once again, another miniboss that should be there doesn't appear because I skipped straight to Stage 4 earlier.

However, by using it right before the game fades to black, the game forgets to take it away from me after using it, so I can get to use it a second time later in the fight.

	"And that was Frankenstein for the NES. I really enjoyed making the movie, as I was able to find a lot of clever solutions to problems the game presented. The somewhat high rerecord count of the movie is kinda skewed by having to do the double hits manually, which involves a lot of trial and error. If you feel like improving this movie, I recommend getting a hitbox viewer in Lua and maybe something to automate the more repetitive parts like dialogue sections. Nethertheless, I'm very pleased with the result; It's not Castlevania, but it's practically the same thing.
