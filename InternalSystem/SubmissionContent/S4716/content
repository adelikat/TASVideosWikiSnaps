	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The whip is a ranged attack which does 2 damage, but you have to stand still while using it until it returns to you. It is not very flexible for that reason. However, by using the weapon while crouched, you can stand up the moment it hits an enemy to cancel the animation and avoid the return phase.

	"Unlike my Testrun, Gatekeeper had a horrible pattern in this attempt where he would mostly fly out of reach of my attacks. Therefore, I had to improvise and get the whip. This allows me to hit him early and change his pattern to be more favorable. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Both the hand and the Gatekeeper need to be killed to proceed. The Gatekeeper would almost fly out of range, but thankfully there's a small elevated ledge to the right that allows me to just hit him before he flies out of range.

[p 
	"Yeah, I didn't see that one coming. By using my weapon right before triggering a screen exit, it messes up and sends me right to the next level. This skips a very long and tedious boss fight, as well as yet another cutscene.  This alone saves over a minute over the old run.

[p 
	"Unfortunately, I have to get rid of my whip here because it'll only be cumbersome later. Plus, my sword has been upgraded to do 2 damage now, just like the whip. The Tree Stump guys fire a lot of projectiles and produce an ungodly amount of lag while doing so. I manipulate all their shots to go offscreen quickly to avoid any unneccesary lag frames.
	$LF

[p 
	"Skipping right to Stage 4 also has the side effect of avoiding several minibosses; Usually, at the end of this section, there would be a miniboss to fight.

]h4
[p 
	"This guy has 20 HP, so by combining the damage from my sword and from my kicks, I can finish him off in 6 hits for 3 damage and 1 for 2 damage. His hitboxes are very finnicky, and his invulnerability time is shortest of nearly all bosses in the game (about 40 frames), which made this fight very difficult. He also has a tendency to jump out of reach, which I had to avoid by doing careful manipulation. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I get the three-way fire here, which adds three projectiles to my sword attack. It will come in very handy in the next section.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I also wait for 5 frames before leaving the screen to avoid the color glitch from earlier. It is okay when it's just one really short room. It's less okay when it's an entire section in garish white and pink colors.
	$LF
]p
[h4 id=Stage4-2 
	" Stage 4-2
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"I can't use my three-way fire too much here because doing so would create lag. The award to the worst hitboxes in the game go to this section's miniboss, because projectiles do not count if you fire them while old ones are still on the screen. You can work around this by firing a third set of projectiles after the first ones have disappeared, as this "reactivates" your current set of projectiles.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The Vampire once again has 20 HP. I can line up all three projectiles and my sword to do 5 damage, killing this guy in 4 hits. The first hit is problematic though, because the projectile going straight up will not hit him. To counter this, I had to use my sword once to glitch the game into firing two fireballs forward as opposed to one going upward in the next attack. Lining this up with another attack allows me to hit the Vampire for 5 damage on the next attack. As the game remains active several frames into the fade to black, I had to work in the dark to perform this. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The rest of the fight goes fairly straightforward, but manipulating this guy is a pain, as the outcome of his actions is determined only a few frames before it happens.

	"The vines sometimes go in your favor, more often than not they don't. You can go at full speed in the water by holding the jump button when entering it. The water drains your health very quickly though, so I can't stay in it for too long. Once again, another miniboss that should be there doesn't appear because I skipped straight to Stage 4 earlier. What's more, it is the exact same boss that would've been the Boss of Stage 3, so you never get to see him. What a shame, no?

[p 
	"Frankenstein has 20 HP, and my kick can do up to 3 damage to him. I also have a bomb in my inventory, which does one extra damage. However, by using it right before the game fades to black, the game forgets to take it away from me after using it, so I can get to use it a second time later in the fight. This allows me to do 4 damage twice to him, allowing me to finish the fight in just 6 hits instead of 7.

]h4
[p 
	"This boss is annoying, because it is the only boss where double hits aren't possible, so you get to sit through all 21 hits of it. After killing his body, the head comes off and attacks me. It has 12 HP, but I can do 3 damage per hit again. Manipulating it was kinda tricky, but ultimately I managed. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"After doing the last hit, I make sure to land as far right as possible, to decrease the time it takes for Emily to reach me. Once she does, the last dialogue plays and the game is over.

	"And that was Frankenstein for the NES. I really enjoyed making the movie, as I was able to find a lot of clever solutions to problems the game presented. The somewhat high rerecord count of the movie is kinda skewed by having to do the double hits manually, which involves a lot of trial and error. If you feel like improving this movie, I recommend getting a hitbox viewer in Lua and maybe something to automate the more repetetive parts like dialogue sections. Nethertheless, I'm very pleased with the result; It's not Castlevania, but it's practically the same thing.
