	" introduced me to this game.  It's a gem of a platformer released only in Japan.  The controls have some Prince of Persia in them, but are not as demanding.  The music is great and the graphics are pretty good.  I'm surprised the game was never ported to the US or Europe.

	"Since most will probably not be familiar with this game, here are a couple things worth mentioning.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"There are treasure chests littered throughout each level.  Most of the powerups are not needed in a TAS (such as extra lives, hearts, or heart expansions).  There are two exceptions, however.  One being the winged boots, which allow a mid-air jump, and the sword, which allows for a longer range and increased attack power on the original weapon.  The increased attack power is only shown when life is down to one heart remaining.  A jumping slash will then inflict three hits on bosses if aimed properly.  This is why some levels take damage even when it may not seem obvious as to why.

	"It isn't noticeable when watching, but there is a jumping glitch used throughout.  There's a point where jumping to a platform will change the animation to "standing", but not actually land on the platform.  However, this allows a one-frame window to jump again.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Instead of turning around on the ground, time can be saved if it is done in midair, even if it requires an extra jump.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Bosses have a peculiar way of telling the game when they are allowed to be hit again.  If, after hitting a boss, you do something to cancel the sword-swinging animation, the "I can be hit again" flag will not reset until the sword is swung again.  This is a nasty bug that makes jump-slashing during bosses a pain, but viewing the contents of memory location 061F allowed me to make sure every hit also made the next hit ready.  This is more like...avoiding programming errors, I guess.
