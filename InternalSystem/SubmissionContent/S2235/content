[p 
	"I'll descibe the story again.The whole story happens at about several hundreds years later from now,when the civilization of human is almost destroyed after an atomic warfare.Then many kinds of mechanical variants monsters appear on the earth.The survived people have to use tanks to protect themselves.

[p 
	"Times to create a hero.Some people use their powerful tanks to defeat the terrible monsters and protect the human towns.They become famous and get a lot of money.Some person want to be a famous hunter,like the hero in this game.But most people want to live a normal life,like the hero's father.

[p 
	"The hero of the game is a small child(in the movie I named him "E") who has always been dreaming to be a super hero and to save the world.One day he tell his father that he want to go out to see the whole world and to be a hero again.

[p 
	"Father:"Oh!You fool!How many times I warned you that don't say words like this anymore.People should stay a normal life.Never fancy to become a fucking hero.You really think you can become one?And do you know how dangers their life is.All the monsters want to shoot holes on their body.You want our whole family in danger?"

[p 
	"Then the father take E out of the room."Stay out in the cold wind untill you calm down your fucking brain.Then you can come back home.Understand?"

[p 
	"So,E slept at the front of the house for a whole night.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The next day,E was woke up by a neighbor.He still wanted to be a person like "Red Wolf",so he decided to go into the south cave.People say that there exists a green tank in the cave.But no one in this town dare to search for it.
	$LF

[p 
	"[before going into the cave I moved E to a house to save the game.it's necessary because if I do not get a savestate in the game I can't end it later]
	$LF

[p 
	"E is very very lucky.He did not meet an anemy in the cave.(of course I let him to be that lucky)Going into the -2F,he finally see the tank.But a dog was guarding here.The dog jumped to E.There's no choice.The only thing E can do is to escape as quickly as he can.Then E run to the tank.But to his surprise he saw "Red Wolf" there!That guy want this tank too!
	$LF

[p 
	"Wolf:"You little boy come here alone?You must be crazy!This cave is very dangers,and you even do not have a tank.You are lucky to go to here,but you'd better come back home as soon as possible.Now let me have a look at this tank."

[p 
	"He walked around the tank and checked it carefully.
	$LF

[p 
	"Wolf:"Oh shit,it's a junk,much more weaker than my red tank.Wait,one of the cannon seems to be still good,I'll take it.Hey,boy,now this tank is yours."

[p 
	"He went back to his red tank.

[p 
	"Wolf:"Get into the tank and go home now.You see that dog is still there.You must be careful.Ok,I must go now."Then he went away.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"E quickly opened a door on the wall.Then he walked onto the tank and named it "1".Now he was scared and did not want to be a hero anymore.He went back home quickly and even did not take hia tank.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"[E dose not take the tank.that's because it's faster.if he gets on tank later he has to go a few more steps.E has named the tank,then the game's programe admit that he has already got a tank.in this game there are 8 tanks.if the hero can get one of them then he can go back home to tell his father that he want to go home.Then the game is ended.That's the bad ending and the condition of this ending is that the hero get at least one tank.There's also a good ending.And the condition is that the hero beat the final boss before coming back home.Just like my last movie. http://tasvideos.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=7825]

[p 
	"E went back home,and told his father that he did not want to become superhero anymore,he just want to stay a normal life.His father is very happy.The sister also welcome E's coming back.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Then it's the bad ending.Not like the good ending,the bad one did not show the hero and his tank's state.It just show the staff,and said that"E abandoned his dream.He lived a lonely and misery life."The bad ending did not need added inputs like the good ending.That's it.

	"I hope you can enjoy it through my comments. A very short but meaningfull RPG game.And I don't think it should obsolete the good-ending movie.
