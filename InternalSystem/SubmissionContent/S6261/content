	"At the start of every level you have the for the beyblade franchise typical ripping of your blade,
	$LF
	"in this game the better you time it, the more spin you'll have to transfer through the level, being relevant to the gameplay,
	$LF
	"because you can run out of spin and die, as extra challenge.
	$LF
	"For this TAS opting to find the right spin that is enough to beat the specific level while also being fastest involved
	$LF
	"lots of testing. Shorter levels usually don't use any spin at all and we can skip the ripping mini game to save time,
	$LF
	"while longer levels differ in amount of spin. For certain levels a very specific rip timing is important to setup the moving enemy blades for bounces fpr example.

	"Those strats usually are to most enjoyable to watch, because the bounces you can get from enemies can get you to ridiculous speed and heights.
	$LF
	"Also intersesting is that the levels feature pits everywhere and you can skip along the edges of the path to transfer other those with some room,

	"Improvements that could be made to this TAS are possible new finds of enemy bounce strats, different rip timings for certain levels, could turn out to be faster and since theres alot to momentum in this game, that isn't understood completely, some of the boost movement could be faster by boosting at different times.
