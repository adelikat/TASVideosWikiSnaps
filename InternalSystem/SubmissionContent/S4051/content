	"I saw that a unsubmitted run was done, and this game that I'm liking looked good for trying to do my first TAS. The rerecord counter is low, but I did many text editing at first before doing frame by frame buildings because it's less frustating (Because Sim City sometimes add some waiting frames).
	$LF
	"I used my own pattern that I tested to see if it can reach 600,000 with snes9x before starting the TAS.
	$LF
	"I didn't named the city because I started without reading the rules (I had to restart near the begining because I used debug menu...) and now I'm fear that changing it may dessynch the run. Also it win some frames so why not.

	"If you know money glitch you'll see that I stoped before getting 0 and I didn't go back in tax screen. What I did is simple, I keep enouth money to keep all fundings to 100% then, when the tax screen apear, I press L and keep it until I build something. Then, later I just have to let a single frame without input to make the money in a negative value (which makes it 999,999)

	"You have to wait about 2 min near the start because I need to wait for the money glich and inputs froze the ingame timer so that's why I did nothing.

	"The last input is at frame 24766 and 600,000 people is got at frame ~170000

	"Since it's my 1st TAS, maybe some moving could be inproved ? I'm also not sure if switching R/police/R while building the Residential part could be faster than building all police centers at the end.
