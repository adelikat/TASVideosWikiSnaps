	"This game is not my favourite, because I like the Castlevania series, but I don't like whips. Fortunately, we have Maxim Kischine: ninja best friend of Juste Belmont, armed with his Stellar Sword and his saddistic laugh.

	"In this run I used the "whip launch" glitch to get inside a wall, and then zip my way out of the castle.
	$LF
	"My original intention was to end the run with a Maxim versus Maxim fight, but that's impossible... There's nothing in the final room in Castle A.
	$LF
	"I also found a new glitch, which makes the shuriken hit every frame while the sword is active.

	" Atma, for the hint about where to end the movie;
	$LF
	" JXQ, for including me in his thanks in his Juste run.
