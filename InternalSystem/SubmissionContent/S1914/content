	"Note: I did test to see if 2 players would be faster.  But it turns out they aren't.  2 players means each players weapon does less damage.  Unfortunately fang's D weapon is most affected by this (over a 60% decrease as opposed to 20-30% decreases for all other weapons).  Having another player cannot compensate for the power loss of this weapon.
