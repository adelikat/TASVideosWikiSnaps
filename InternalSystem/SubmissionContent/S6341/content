	"You see, I am only able to manipulate what piece is picked by the RNG by delaying when the piece is picked. In game this is not much of a problem, since I only need to manipulate one piece at a time - the one that goes in the NEXT box. For the start though, I need to manipulate two pieces - The one that's in the NEXT box

	"The general idea is that the RNG seed gives out a 16-bit number, from which we take the lower 3 bits to get a number between 0 and 7.
	$LF
	"If that number is 7 or if it corresponds to the same piece as the one that was dealt before, get a new number from the RNG and get a number between 0 and 6 using modulo.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The article goes in more detail, but the point is that the game keeps track of the previous piece and tries not to have repeats in the sequence of pieces it gives you, Which is the exact opposite of what we want. Luckily though, since the RNG is called at least once per frame, even when the game is paused, we can simply pause and wait for a good seed to come up.

	$LF
	"I also figured starting on level 19 (by holding A while selecting level 9) would also help, since the level acts as a multiplier on the score, and level 19 is the fastest I can start on, with gravity pulling down the piece every 2 frames (this is as fast as softdrop).

From this level onwards, the gravity pulls the blocks down every frame, forcing the game into a speed that is unsustainable for most human players.

	"I then came back to my computer, only to find that my script had been playing for way longer than necessary, to the point where the O piece count in the statistics box showed U29 (3,029 pieces, while the final TAS ends after 1,396).
