	"In this run of a game which I think is a clone of Kamen no ninja - Akakage because most bosses seems to be the same as those that are in Kamen no Ninja, which is one of my favorite games. So I just did a fast TAS for this game with BizHawk for the first time and it's an occasion to use this emulator, but I still like FCEUX more. I would like to note that I used QuickNES as a core for NES
