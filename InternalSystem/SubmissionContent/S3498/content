	"In this run you have two different game play elements, the LoZ style over world and the platformer in level sections. The over world section is trivial to TAS as there is no lag, no random encounters and movement exists on a grid so you can only change course along lines causing optimization to be extremely simple. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The platformer section is a different beast entirely. I am almost guaranteed the reason why this game has not had a submitted run is that without TAS Editor no one would have to will to finish due to lag. In the levels there is a ridiculous amount of lag that is entirely unavoidable and quite random. It appears to be dependent on the frame you enter the level, the frame the enemies (or any item that can move for that matter) enter the screen, the items that you use, whether or not your character is moving, etc. etc. This large amount of random lag causes optimization to become extremely painful as if you change any movement at all the rest of the run will desync. It is also seemingly random as sometimes killing an enemy removes the lag and saves time, but other times the process of firing creates far more lag and then other completely unexplained lag persists so it becomes slower. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"In the platforming sections there are a few possibilities of movement. You can walk which happens at a constant 1 pixel per frame, you can jump which randomly alternates between 1 pixel and 0 pixels per frame, and after you have jumped you can "fly" or glide for a certain length of time which is also at a constant 1 pixel per frame. Early on in the game your jumping ability is quite poor so there has to be trial and error to decide if in certain situations 3 small wall jumps or 1 large jump would be quicker. As the game progresses your jumping and flying abilities increase greatly so the 1 large jump becomes increasingly more effective.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The weapons in the game increase in strength by two for each one you receive but for the most part the enemies follow suit and essentially only take one hit to kill. A problem with the weapons is that while the "claw" that lets you land on spikes and the fire attack at the end are the strongest moves, you have to use the buster move to break the blocks so you have to at times switch out weapons. Another strategy that must be looked into is that debate between the "claw" and the tornado moves in moving vertically in levels. It depends on the height you must traverse, the shape of the walls and the area between the walls to determine if the tornado or the claw are more effective and thus why I alternate which I use. The final factor to take note of is that all of the weapons except for the final fire attack allow for two shots to exist on screen at a time. This leads to a few other lower level attacks potentially being more effective in boss fights where multiple hits are required. The problem is that, like on the boulders that require the buster attack, the final boss only takes damage if the final fire attack is used so while it theoretically would be faster to use a lower tier weapon, in practice they coded him so it does not work.

	"This level was my first major improvement and a total of 656 frames are saved. These frames are saved through far better jumping, lag management and taking damage. My jumps are greatly improved so that I just barely jump above platforms as multiple short jumps turns out to be much faster than a single large jump. Lag management results from not having a direction selected during specific frames and through better choices on when to destroy enemies. In the game if you do not hold a direction on certain frames it can prevent between 1 and 10 extra lag frames from forming. The enemy management is also improved so that lag due to enemies is greatly reduced from the previous run.

[div class=p 
	"Finally I decided that the stylistic choice of not taking damage not only slowed down the run but also greatly decreased the quality. First I hit the one-eyed bat thing whereas in the previous run I waited for him to pass. The next major damage boost is taking a shortcut around a barrier. In the original run I fall down below the barrier and then have to climb back up to continue the level. In the new run I jump onto the spiked wall and while I am invulnerable after the damage I climb up and over the barrier saving a lot of time just barely making it to the next platform.

[div class=p 
	"By far the largest improvement in this run is the damage boosts that are used. A damage boost is used to land on the moving platform at around frame 20100. The character collides with an enemy entering no-clip mode and passing into a platform which then rejects him out on top so I no longer have to wait for the platform to move all the way to the right and then to the left. Then in the slow rising shaft damage is taken like in the Etruria level so as to jump up the spike walls saving a ton of time. Damage is then taken during the top most portion of the level to no longer wait for the flying attack to pass.

In the first run I used the tornado move by jumping to the maximum height and only releasing the tornado at the last possible frame. Under suggestions I tried use the tornado more towards midway of the jump before vertical acceleration began to slow. The other improvement is through damage boosting on the spikes near the end of the level. This portion does not actually speed up the progress of the level, but it severely reduces lag as the enemies no longer jump around. Also I find it much more entertaining to see him getting damaged jumping around on spikes while still moving fast rather than using the given platforms.

In the first run the boss is manipulated so that they both fly down and pause by the platforms. In this run the bosses would swoop down passed the platform and then meet in the middle of the level above the platforms. No matter what position and jumping was taken this movement could not be prevented and as such a non-symmetrical boss attack was taken. A large amount of work was put into reducing this from the initial 25 frames lost down to a minimal 8.

I switch much more frequently between the "claw" move and the tornado to quickly jump up levels where before I relied on walls which wasted a lot of time. Overall this level looks much smoother and quicker than the previous run with the exclusion of busting the final blocks wall. The reason the final wall requires a pause is due how the weapon system works in the game. On "screen" (either in or out of frame) there are allowed to be two tornadoes and two projectiles (including the blue weapon). Due to this you must alternate between the two to save the most time. As a result when you reach the final block wall there is only one projectile left to fire at a time as the other claws have not disappeared yet. Then the buster does not officially disappear until the block and the fire that results dissipates.

Another impressive portion of this level begins at 92200. Even jumping a frame later in any of the situation would result in damage and may be the situation in the run which would be least possible in a real time run. A few frames later I also land and walk on spikes for a few frames.

Flaws with that battle: You can only have one shot on screen at a time. They force you to use a suboptimal weapon (technically it is the strongest but it only allows one on screen so another weapon could finish in about 1/2 to 2/3 of the time).The large circles that he shoots at you destroy your shot so if you hit one it wastes your one shot that is on screen. It has a ton of lag compared to any other level. The only "safe zone on screen" is far to the left so your shots take forever to hit him. Also the "safe zone" doesn't actually work because if you are in the safe zone he is no longer on screen so your shots don't hurt him. His hit zone is minuscule in comparison to his total size, almost all other bosses can be hit anywhere. Finally the lag increases even more so when you move so that moving for 5 frames adds 5 lag frames. Basically the only benefit of this fight is that you can float forever.
