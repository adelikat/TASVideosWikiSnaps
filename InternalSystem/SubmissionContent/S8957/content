	"Given the goal, it is intuitive to simply go for the worst ending where neither Barry nor Chris is saved, and this involves making a "bad" choice at the first possible chance to lock the game into the worse endings in the previous movies and RTAs alike. While this makes perfect sense and would indeed be the fastest route to simply reach an ending under normal circumstances, it is actually just

	" faster (as in by ~1 second) to get on track for a potentially better ending first so that we can kill off Barry earlier in the game instead in order to have shorter cutscenes toward the end of the game

	"Normally, waiting for Barry to replace the rope would result in an extra cutscene. However, this can be avoided by leaving the room when the cutscene is just about to play so that we don't have to sit through the scene while the game still registers the route choice. The cutscene would normally take a bit more than a minute so the route used in this movie gets to be faster than the long established route only thanks to this skip.
