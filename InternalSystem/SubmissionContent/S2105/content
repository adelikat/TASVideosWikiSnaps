	"Ninja Gaiden Shadow (aka. Shadow Warriors) for GB looks like the mixture of Ninja Gaiden series and Shadow of the Ninja for NES. In the USA, AD 1985, an evil messenger of the fear of mankind fell down to the earth, along with destruction and terrible death. Despite of his slow running speed, our hero, Ryu Hayabusa managed to defeat the evil messenger lurking in the skyscraper and saved mankind within only 12 minutes!
