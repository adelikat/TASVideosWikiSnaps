I will describe small springs when they come into play. Big springs are 2 blocks wide and 1 block deep. When Yoshi touches one, he’s launched up into the air. Something important here is that he loses all collision when moving upward from a spring and gains collision once he begins dropping. As a result of this, if he is inside a block, he will get pushed slightly in the direction he is facing. This level also introduces the bird enemies, which are quite simple. They kill Yoshi if he touches one, but dies if clicked on.
