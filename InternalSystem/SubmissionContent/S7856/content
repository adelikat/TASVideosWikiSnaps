		"Tower of Hanoi
	]a
	" is a classical 139-year-old puzzle of moving a whole stack of disks from one place to another. Only one disk may be moved at a time, and no disk may ever be placed on top of a smaller disk.

I chose to have the stack end on the bottom right for 3, 6 and 9 disks, and end on the bottom left for 4, 5, 7 and 8 disks. This is purely a stylistic choice and does not affect the length of the optimal solution.
