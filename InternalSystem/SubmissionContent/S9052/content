While this transition is active, the player is unable to interact with any death hitboxes, which means you're invincible to most things. This isn't really useful normally because you can't really do anything with it, but if it wasn't useful I wouldn't talking about it.

If you are falling fast enough this downwarp can send you to below the point at which the ground tries to push you up, and so the wall collision activates. Because you're moving away from the middle of the block that you are clipping into, you get pushed to the side and so you can skip the entire level.

	"In Act 8, I once again do Fake Transition Glitch, this time while running on a booster block. Because your horizontal movement is ignored, you are free to build up more and more speed on the booster. Boosters do not have a speed limit so you can build up a huge amount of speed. With enough speed, you go through the wall because collisions are ignored off-screen. Doing Fake Transition Glitch also re-centers the camera to the player, so it's used a second time to avoid flying into the abyss.

[div class=p 
	"At the end of Credits, I do a smart little optimization with the keyblock. You see, you could just run back a little and then run right again to get the most amount of momentum before being able to get past the keyblock, but you can actually get in between the keyblock and the sawblade while it's opening to be just a little more to the right when the keyblock hitbox disappears.
