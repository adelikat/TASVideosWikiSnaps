	"The Run
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This run is dedicated to the players who've thrown their controller at their TV out of frustration towards this game; they will greatly appreciate this movie.  Arthur moves through most obstacles with ease, while most bosses perish before they even get to attack.  Even the mighty Sardius couldn't withstand the barrage.
	$LF

[p 
	"Ordinarily, completing the game requires running through it twice to pick up the goddess bracelet.  Because this would be much too repetitive to be entertaining, I use a code that takes me straight to the bosses right before Sardius.

	"A lot of people have been waiting for a good run of this game.  I hope this is good enough for them.

		"I pick up the bracelet in level 2 for a few reasons: 2-2 is an autoscroller, and it works really well against the bosses from that level on.  I was surprised at how effective the bracelet can be.

		"As with the Genesis version, jumping is about 12% faster than walking.  Double jumping is the same speed as walking, so there are a few times where I end up clipping a ledge.

		"Many of the bosses were painful to put together.  A lot of strategies would *almost* work, resulting in a lot of headaches (if only it was a few pixels back...).  Regardless, I'm pretty pleased with how they turned out.  Eat that, Sardius!
