	"While most gamers are familiar with Duck Hunt, what many may not know is that the video game we know and love (or hate) was NOT the first incarnation of Duck Hunt.  In 1976 Nintendo released Kôsenjû Duck Hunt, an electro-mechanical game that follows the same premise as the video game...shoot the flying ducks.  Essentially, Kôsenjû Duck Hunt projected a duck onto a wall and you shot that duck.  The system determined if you hit the duck or not and, if so, the duck fell.

	"While it does technically have an defined ending with the kill screen, Game A is quite trivial to TAS. As mentioned by feos in his 
	[a class=intlink href=/6345S 
		"rejection
	]a
	" of a recent Game A submission, all that is required is to watch a RAM value for where the duck is when it first appears and make sure it's shot.  Further, each duck's appearance is determined by a timer that counts down after the dog jumps or hides back down behind the grass.  The timer always starts at 47 after the dog is gone.  Therefore the timing is consistent and the position of the duck is always known, making the TAS trivial.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The addition of a second duck makes all the difference from a TASing perspective.  In 2-Duck mode, the 47 frame timer before the first duck appears remains, so this portion of the timing is consistent.  HOWEVER, once the first duck appears the timer is then reset based on RNG; it's set to any number between 0-64.  This delay for the second duck happens to be manipulable via input.  Therefore, TASing is no longer trivial due to RNG manipulation.

	$LF
	"At first it may seem that a delay of 0 frames would be ideal to get both ducks out at the same time.  Unfortunately, firing the gun takes two consecutive frames of holding the trigger, and then a few frames pass while the system processes that shot.  During these frames the second duck would be able to fly around.  In doing so it would gain altitude, thus requiring more frames to fall down after it was subsequently shot adding unnecessary frames to the run.  So determining the timing to shoot both ducks as soon as possible and at the lowest possible altitude was in order.  The timer for the second duck's release is paused during the processing of the first shot.  All this combined together makes the ideal timer countdown for the second duck to be set to 3.

[div class=p 
	"It unfortunately was not possible to always force a 3 in the delay timer.  When this was the case, a 4 was usually possible.  While 2 was also possible and would allow for shooting the 2nd duck one frame earlier than a 4, it would again require a wait for the duck to fall down after being shot, so 4 ended up being better in my testing.

For these ducks, I tried to manipulate the delay for the 2nd duck to be less than 3 (ideally 0).
