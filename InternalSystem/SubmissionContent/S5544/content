	"Dragon Crystal is an early Roguelike RPG in the vein of Fatal Labyrinth and Azure Dreams, thus it's naturally vulnerable to the same type of luck manipulation in its random level generation to allow the protagonist to miraculously find stairs up in the opening area of each floor and complete the game in record time.

	"In this game, this pause has 2 functions: During a gameplay, pausing makes the game to run slowly (like 30 fps), but, pressing pause during the loading times, you can manipulate every floor to a different floor, depending of each frame.

[p 
	"This game is very, extremely hard to manipulate even with pauses, because some of the floors, i didn't get better closer exits. Yes, almost all of the floors, I got better closer exits, saving a lot of time. And on the last floor, thanks of a manipulation during the previous floor, the crystal ball appears on me!

	"Other thing: This game isn't very well programmed, because of 3 flaws that I noted:

]p
[p 
	"1 - You can stuck on some of the maps.

[p 
	"2 - Sometimes, this game will can crash, or restart when you picks the crystal ball (Also, that's why I didn't used the pause before of the last floor).

[p 
	"3 - The credits has some graphical glitches. In this run, is minor glitched than the published run.

[p 
	"1 - It's a short game to TAS.

[p 
	"2 - Despite I'm not familiar with this game, I decided to test the 'pause' button, to find improvements for a new run of this game. Because of this improvements, I'm impressed how much time I improved, reaching to sub-50 seconds!
