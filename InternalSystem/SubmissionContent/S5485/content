	"Anyhow, this submission was nicely executed with some interesting points throughout. However, there is one major sticking point that I feel needs to be addressed.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In the Genesis version of Batman Return, there are two possible endings which can occur after beating Penguin. These endings are obtainable during the playable final credits when facing off against Catwoman. The bad ending happens if you let Catwoman beat up Batman enough, he falls off the roof and gets picked up by his Batmobile. The good ending happens if Batman beats up Catwoman, eventually falling off the roof and getting eaten(?) by cats. This submission aims for the bad endings, thus ending the inputs after defeating Penguin. However, 
	[a class=extlink href=https://youtu.be/nnUWAs8JHcg rel=nofollow 
		"the current RTA World Record
	]a
	" obtains the good ending, spending the extra 10 seconds or so to defeat Catwoman. This puts the submission in a weird position.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If we ignore the ending, the run is possibly entertaining enough to be considered for Moons. However, with the ending considered, it's clear that the goal of the run is to complete the game as fast as possible, without taking into consideration the entertainment value. Because of the lack of inputs after defeating Penguin, it makes the run feel rather incomplete and unfinished despite being the opposite. This also removes a lot of the entertainment factor from the overall submission. The run does reach the credits and the final ending screen (with the credits fight being, well, extra credit), so the run itself can't be rejected for not completing the game. We also have a lot of precedent concerning bad endings in TASes, but the vast majority of those games which do reach the bad ending are sitting in the Vault tier (with maybe one or two exceptions). Considering this along with everything else above, I don't find the run to be an exception to the trend.
