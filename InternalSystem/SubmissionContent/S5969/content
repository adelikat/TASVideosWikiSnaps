	"Wendy: Every Witch Way is a cute little game for Game Boy Color and Super Game Boy. It follows the quest of 
	[em 
		"Wendy the Good Little Witch
	]em
	", which accidentally released the Chaos Emeralds and has to take them back 
	[del 
		"before Knuckles does

	]em
	", and 
	[em

	[em 
		"Normal

[p 
	"This run beats the three

	"Tricks
	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"Avoid jump lag:
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"When you start a jump, horizontal movement stops for a frame, except if you're jumping in the same moment you land. Sometimes it's necessary to start bunny hopping much before in order to avoid jumping from ground. However, sometimes the jumps cause lag, making it worthless.
	$LF

[p 
	"Prevent enemy from spawning:
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"An enemy that should have appeared around frame 14900 didn't. No idea why, I only know that it depends from the timing of the gravity flips done before that point. Discovered by EZGames69.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Canceling the gravity animation:
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Whenever you change gravity, Wendy will have a little animation of her turning around, during that animation you can move until it's finished.  You can sometimes before you change gravity take damage from an enemy, and that cancels it out and replaces it with the damage animation.  the damage animation is significantly faster than the gravity animation, so it's better to abuse this damage as much as possible.  other times it's avoided due to increased lag.

	": This game is extremely adorable, I love the animation of the character especially. Unfortunately, this is TASVideos and not AdorableVideos so we need to consider the actual gameplay. 
	$LF

[p 
	"Play was fairly clean overall however, the movement is fairly slow and unfortunately the flipping mechanic doesn't seem particularly fluid. While the harder levels did make it more enjoyable than the main game, it still didn't look that tough either. I checked a video of a playthrough and there were some occasional deaths but nothing to make this TAS seem extremely impressive. This TAS does take some creative routes through the stages but nothing particularly mindblowing either.

	"While the few posts on the TAS were fairly positive, they didn't go into that much detail and the votes weren't explicitly positive with 3 yes's but also 1 no and 1 meh.
