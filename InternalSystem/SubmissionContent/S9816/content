	"This run has improved by over 1 minute compared to my previous one, mainly by optimizing the route strategy, reducing input lag and frame drops. Additionally, in the Scissor Man stage, I chose to grab the high-jump item to achieve a speedrun. I also optimized the boss fight speed in certain stages and revamped the entire route since I grabbed the high-jump earlier, changing up the previous strategy.
