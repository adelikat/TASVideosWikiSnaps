	"PLOT:  This run starts off with Willow telling Vohnkar to go blow himself, and run straight through the forest to the Village of Dew.  Immediately, he leaves Dew and travels through the North section to get a Gold Statue.  After that, he kills himself and goes back to Dew, however, he maintained the Gold Statue.  He then proceeds to Bogarda's Cave.  Entering this cave unarmed, he went straight to a room that has a Battle Sword and decides to equip that weapon for majority of the game.  Then he goes on to confront Bogarda, use TAS techniques against that boss, and get 700 ex added on.  After the confrontation, he travels through the forest, through Dew, through the Southwest section, and on through the long bridge to Forest of Death.

He proceeded through wicked trees in some places where they shoot fire.  Too bad "Smokey the Bear" wasn't around.  He had to stop by a dugout "unannounced" to get details about a flying creature named Po.  Then he continued proceeding through the FoD with more trees trying to burn the poor guy.  Finally, he went on through rocky terrain to Matanda's Cave.

	"PLOT:  Entering Matanda's Cave, he heads over to a room where Po seemed to be trapped.  Willow gets the Ocarina spell (so he can start using warps) and then heads southward to get the Theives' Bracelet from Matanda the fat dragon.  On his way back to the entrance, he needed some protection so he picked up a Gold Shield.  Finally, an opening was revealed and that took Willow into Lake Cheef.

Willow continues his journey up north where he later found a prisoner known as Madmartigan in chains.  Willow then traveled West-Southwest to get a key and then take that to Madmartigan.  That prisoner gets freed and Willow then heads a few more screens north to a bar known as 'Tavern of the Traveler'.  Willow was already in safe condition (HP/MP) so he immediately started getting information about the Under-Island cave up North and even having to cross the lake to get there.  Willow leaves the Tavern and heads South to find Kchii of the Nail Clan to obtain a Wakka Seed which was said to "breathe in water".  Willow used TAS techniques to switch over to the Ocarina spell and have Po warp him back to the Tavern just to save walking distance.  From the Tavern, he goes north along the shoreline, under water, past Fin Raziel's dugout, and into the Under-Island Cave.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"MY COMMENT:  I sharpened up the route just a little bit but I wouldn't bother going back to see how many frames I might've saved.  I did manage to score a nice damage-boost from a fire statue after I got the key but that was the only thing I was able to find.  The other screens I would get to were likely skeletons, and they can easily push Willow back.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"PLOT:  Entering this cave, Willow travelled the screens until he got up to a screen where two ghosts appeared.  As soon as the two ghosts lit up the screen, Willow immediately paused himself on a specific frame to change into the Devil Eye sword.  He only fought two screens worth of ghosts and came out with 1980 ex.  A few screens later, a small bat perfectly placed Willow where he needed to be, with 2000 ex.  He had to go see a blue ghost named Zhena and get her Cross Flute; which seemed to be mandatory in the event to defeat Muzh.  After getting the Flute, it was time for Willow to head back into the cave and make way to a room where Muzh was waiting for him.

]div
[div class=p 
	"PLOT:  Entering Muzh's room, the door behind him was closed, the exit toward the Twin Towers were blocked off, and the battle was underway.  Even at that rate, the outcome of the battle was Willow doing more than just defeating Muzh, he actually torn that muthaphukka out the frame!  After victory, Muzh drifted off with Zhena and left Willow a magic spell known as Bombard.  Willow then proceeded through the exit toward the Twin Towers.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"MY COMMENT:  This is a slight repeat of the 2nd draft, but improvement within this area still remains.  Willow was on a level that was too weak to face his 2nd duel boss, Muzh.  I noticed that he was stronger on level 5 than he was in the level he was already on (3).  You may not get much improvement on level 4 or lower, especially with very limited HP.  Willow has to be on at least level 5 with the battle sword for a decent Muzh battle.  The catch is that getting the experience to meet LV 5 should not take too long.  For the Muzh battle, I pinned him against the left wall instead of the top, pulling hits much quicker and saving about 30 to 50 frames altogether.

Willow then climbed about 5 stories to talk to an old blue human and get a Blue Crystal.  Perhaps the old guy stole that from Simon Belmont back at Transylvania?!!!  After obtaining the Blue Crystal, Willow immediately used the magic of Fleet to warp back to the entrance of the East tower and make way through the West tower.  There, he climbed 5 more stories - this time with random enemy encounters in his way.  Damn.  Some were well-manipulated but others were hard to bear with.  Reaching the top of the West tower, an old red human awaited.  The old guy gave Willow a Red Crystal, which perhaps that too was also stolen from Simon Belmont?!!!  Geeze, give Willow a retractable Morning Star so he at least won't have to worry about Dracula for Christs' sake!  Upon obtaining a Red Crystal, Willow warped out of the West tower and went to see Elora Danan.  There, Danan hooked Willow up with a "Crest of the Spirits".  So Willow took that, left her place, and had Po warp him back to the Tavern of the Traveler.

[div class=p 
	"MY COMMENT:  I conserved a ton of HP as I was making my way through both towers.  There were aspects of this part of the draft where some of the ghosts in the West tower could not be well-manipulated and would block me off.  I would not consider wasting HP + frames and even be pushed back for that reason.  I stood back for a few frames and manage to get through the ghosts as they were duplicating.  Though I gave up 10 MP every time I had to do that, I'd rather give up MP than to say "Game Over."

	"PLOT:  Using the same route that would lead to the Under-Island caves, Willow went past that to go into rocky terrain and walk through the long and winding Thunder Mountain.  First, he went through route to a treasure chest that contained Scepter.  The game first called it "Monster's Bone".  Austin Powers himself may have one, but Willow will be using this one differently!  It seemed mandatory to obtain the Scepter spell because the guard at the front door of Nockmaar Castle is afraid of monsters!  And so, Willow's next destination was a house on the trails of Thunder Mtn. where an old man teaches the Thunder spell.  Of course, he got there safely.  When Willow got up to the house, he switched magic spells just to shake off the effects of the Scepter.  He did this before entering and then everything was cool from there.  He got the Thunder spell and proceeded through the mountain.  Along the way, he conserved more HP/MP.  Then once he entered and progressed through a trail where there were multiple holes in the ground, Willow used Scepter to easily roll through that.  Then Willow appeared just in time to enter a red cave.

]div
[div class=p 
	"PLOT:  Willow took path through the red cave and then led a long walk through more Thunder Mtn. trails.  Willow was running short of MP, so he did all he could to manipulate random encounters along the way, especially annoying skeletons.  After more trailing, he enters a purple cave.  He spoke with Adik of the Eagle Clan alleging that his brother, Abang, is held at Nockmaar Castle.  Then Willow had to get information alleging that it is impossible to cross the long bridge because it is cursed.  Willow then used Fleet to warp out of the cave, backtrack to the Red cave which sucked, and talk to another old man that gave Willow a pair of Witches' Shoes.  So Willow used Fleet again, went all the way back to the entrance of the Purple cave, and passed that entrance to finally cross the bridge.  A few more screens later, he reached Tir Asleen!

Along the way, he took damage from two pink vipers but had to battle through 3 or 4 gray monsters because his HP was short.  Then after he heard the old woman's gibberish, he warped back to Tir Asleen and headed straight for the castle - and ignoring yet another lodging opportunity.

Though my sword is a little weak, it is best known to the world as a 'Tool-Assisted Sword' (TAS)!!  And of course, this is lot better than yours.  Hey, I gotta get going, thanks anyway!"

Willow again used TAS techniques by rapidly attacking Eborsisk, and this time without taking a single hit, making this another short one which is a good thing. ^_^  After Willow's victory, he stepped into a trap behind bars where General Kael appeared and grabbed the Crest of the Spirits from Willow.  He was imprisoned along with Madmartigan.  Madmartigan told Willow what he knew, and then Willow stepped on the Southeast section of his prison cell to reveal an opening.  Then miniatures known as Franjean and Rool came in to save both Willow and Madmartigan.  Willow then escaped with the Fleet spell and went around the corner to a secret cave.

	"MY COMMENT:  As I said before, talking with known characters in the game (like Airk) would force me to obtain new stuff.  Now in this 3rd draft, I finally realized that I was able to not be so dependent on stronger weapons very often which was another strategy.  I wanted to carry fewer weapons and that's exactly what I did.  Vohnkar and Airk was the reason I threw away a lot of frames last time!  Idiots...

Along the way, he manipulated into taking more damage boosts from vipers and such gray monsters now that he had enough HP to do that.  After he came out of the secret cave, this time with 6 HP available, he ended up one screen North of the Thunder house!  But what did he do?  It was another lodging opportunity, right then and there, that he ignored!  He chose to continue his attempt with 6 HP to his name!

	"MY COMMENT:  Coming out of the first long stairway, that is when I pulled out the Devil Eye sword and equip the Thunder spell.  I had to level-grind quite a bit here, but I am deeply sure that this is also improved without a shadow of a doubt!  Each ghost on this pathway was worth 100 ex. a piece which was more valuable than the ghosts at the Under-Island cave.  As much as I had available MP, I was able to not only manipulate ghosts' appearance, but I was also able to use the Thunder spell to kill off red ghosts quicker!  To me, using the Thunder spell was slightly much faster than having to wait several frames to see these red ghosts dupe themselves.  If I wanted more MP to continue using the Thunder spell, that was when I had to wait for ghosts to dupe.  However, this "wait for ghosts to dupe" procedure was not as frequent as it was in the 2nd draft.  The Thunder spell was more frequent, though, and I found it useful!

So when he walked up to the door, he masked himself with the Specter one frame before he met with Bavmorda's guard.  Then that guard ran away in this predicament and Willow proceeded inside.  He went straight to a room where Abang was at.  Abang placed all his strength into Adik's sword and told him to go speak to Tir Asleen's elderly woman, the exact same one that was sitting north of Tir Asleen Castle.  Willow then Fleet'ed out of Nockmaar and had Po warp him back to Tir Asleen.  Willow then went to speak with the elderly woman about a key for Nockmaar Castle, which Willow later obtained.

If a large amount of MP is in queue which I am sure that's exactly how their system works, then it does take a certain amount of time to count them all up.  Now, if the game is still counting a large amount of MP and not being aware of Willow using any magic spell during that point, then it is strict that this is a nicely known glitch.

But for majority of the game, the rest of the screens can be manipulated.  Let's say Willow is standing in point A and an enemy encounter was prepared by the game at point B.  If Willow can manipulate luck in point A before going into point B, it's likely that no encounters will be in his way under that circumstance.  Manipulation for this situation is done in 4 ways:  (1) unscheduled sword swing, (2) unscheduled sword poke, (3) repositioning, and sometimes (4) stopping for a couple frames, then proceeding.  Using the Scepter spell takes the guesswork out of manipulation, but it will hog up 50 MP.

From that point, the goal was to kill them all with the Devil Eye sword BUT making sure Willow does NOT touch MP balls during the course of killing them all.  Once all red ghosts are killed and there are several MP balls piled up, it's easy for Willow to get several or all of them in one shot, put the MP in queue, and immediately use the nearest side of the screen to manipulate red ghosts' appearance nearby.

	"It is mandatory for Willow to be on a minimum level of 13 (39,340 ex) to change Fin Raziel back to human and to get the ability to use the Magic cane effectively against Bavmorda.  Most of the screens usually have one ghost.  These ghosts take away MP by dup'ing themselves.  Once 6 to 8 ghosts appear, they will head straight for Willow at a quicker pace.  I found out that there were screens of two ghosts along the path to Nockmaar.  One hit will weaken them as they dupe so it's much easier for Willow to defeat them all (upon the split-up into 8) and start acquiring exp. in the masses.  Manipulating this encounter over and over again when leaving and re-entering the same screen was important because you want to try to get close to level 13 as quick as possible but without over-doing it.  Bear in mind that as you adjust Willow's exp during any part of the game, you still have three bosses to go through from there: Muzh with 2000 exp, Eborsisk with 5000 exp, and Gen. Kael with 8000 exp.

	"If you want to defeat all the bosses at a short time, you must understand Willow's sword control as well as positioning.  My technique involved using Willow's sword to pin each boss (except Eborsisk) against the left wall, and then torturing them by rapidly poking them which seemed to be quicker going into Muzh.  For Queen Bavmorda, she chose to pin herself against the upper-left hand corner, but even at that rate, Willow had the techniques to defeat her quickly.  In the beginning, Willow still had to get used to swords, but swinging one slowly allowed him to gain 2 to 3 hits pretty quick.  For a TAS, our judges may ask for battles to be kept as short as possible.  And that would call for critical thinking.

	"This 3rd draft has been a huge ride.  And after three drafts, the only word that best describes this is simply "endurance".  And the reason is that as I look back, this has been worked on for at least a year.  So there is no telling if another long-term RPG run will ever come around.  If you want RPG and you want improvements, I give you the honor to take advantage of both on this one.
