	"It's near the end of the year and I can at least squeeze in a quick one before 2022 meets its end. Time for a game that you'd think would have at least one submission to this site. Yet somehow despite being pretty simple nobody ever threw one at the site. Maybe it was the old rules being a bit too strict, but not even for an April Fools joke. Wild. Anyways while this isn't the first TAS to finish Snail Maze at this time, this is the first to get submitted.

	"Oh yeah, some background to this game. In early US/Euro Sega Master Systems there was a hidden built in game if the system was turned on without a game plugged into the console. Pressing Up + Button 1 + Button 2 will access this hidden, simple game to at least give someone without any games something to do with their console. This game was removed in later SMS revisions that instead had different built in games like Hang-On.

	"Yes there are a couple of things worth mentioning. The game is tile based where each movement takes 8 frames to complete. the exception is the start of all rounds after the first one. The first input of those rounds can be done much earlier than normal, saving 8 frames each round start.
