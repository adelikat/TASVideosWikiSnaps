	"This is one of the hardest NES games to timeattack perfectly. Mainly this is because jumping is so slow. Every jump in the game has to be perfectly minimized. This is especially difficult in the vertical shafts.

	"True story: Just as I was starting out on this version, Red Scarlet appeared to me in a dream and said that a perfect time would be 13:32, or 42 seconds faster. This became my goal. I compared times between this version and the last one at almost every door. I only moved on if the new one was faster; sometimes I still redid it even if it was faster. These few frames quickly added up to whole seconds.

	"Mother Brain was frustrating. I tried 4 different tactics to find the best way to kill her. The way in the video seems to be the fastest. The problems were that 1) Mother Brain's lower half is invincible; 2) From super close range, missiles can be fired faster than Mother Brain takes damage from them (every other one is ineffective); 3) The last green laser is annoying.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Back to the dream.... I thought it was going to be right on, because when I defeated Mother Brain my time was 41.97 seconds faster than before. However, I completed the last vertical shaft 1.33 seconds faster than before, so this version ended up being 13:31 / 48666 frames / 43.30 seconds faster.
