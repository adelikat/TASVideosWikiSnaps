The 5 frames at the beginning of that level are to manipulate the Mecha Sonic pattern; without it, more than 20 frames would be lost at the boss fight. The other 16 frames these are intended to put the Death Egg 1 mini-boss in a more favorable pattern.

[div class=p 
	"Likewise, if one were to replay the Death Egg 1 boss, up to 16 frames in real time (but none in in-game time) might be saved by removing the pauses at the end of Sky Sanctuary. However, most of the boss attack patterns in that range are highly unfavorable and probably slower to kill; in all likelihood, at most about 6 frames of pauses might be gained by replaying the fight. Again, this would only be a gain in real time; in in-game time, no frames can be gained from this.

	"With the same input and the same position (right down to the same subpixel position), the death at the start of Hydrocity 2 can be 1 frame faster -- Sonic even dies at the same frame, but the timer stops 1 frame earlier. Likewise, the post-Launch Base 2 cutscene can be 15 frames faster by standing in the same exact position. I don't know what causes these differences, but it is probably related to cumulative differences in execution, as they usually occur when the preceding levels have changed in length (up or down). If one were to gain "enough" frames in the preceding levels (again, 
	[b
