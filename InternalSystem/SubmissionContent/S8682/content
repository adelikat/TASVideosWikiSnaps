	"Clockwork Cat has very simple platforming which doesn't require much explanation. I spend as little time as possible winding up the clock, and do a small glitch on each of the cranks to save time. When you reach a crank, you can teleport to the opposite side of it by quickly facing the other direction. This tech is used in RTA runs, but I do a slightly faster version of it with the inputs right+x, right, left, right+x, which causes the clock to wind up slightly more than if you do the trick normally.

	"I'm not sure what framerate the game runs at. The highest framerate I can put without ruffle freezing is 59fps, and I don't think the game runs at 60fps because RTA runs sometimes get milliseconds that aren't possible at that framerate. There isn't a video of this TAS because I can't get it to encode properly.

	"I found a new strategy shortly after submitting this TAS that ended up being around .1 seconds slower. When you die, the clock automatically gets fully winded up when you respawn, and since you don't actually need a full 10 seconds to do any of the sections in the game, I was able to run all the way to the end from the spot I died without stopping. Unfortunately, dying due to running out of time plays a long cutscene before you respawn, so the only way to do this strat fast is to fall into the death plane, which is so far down I had to stop and wind the clock just so that I could reach it. This strategy has potential in other places, and it might be what is needed to go down to sub 1 minute.
