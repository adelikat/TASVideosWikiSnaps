[p 
	"The kingdom of Zebulos, ruled by talking possums, is once again attacked, this time by the neighboring Gedol Empire, who decides to kidnap Princess Cherry, who is as blonde as possums can get.  The reason for this is unknown.  The other times the princess was kidnapped, it was for a practical reason, seeing how her necklace had on it the Key to Destroying Everything.  Not this time.  Maybe King Gedol looked up to his cousin Bowser and decided that he can a big ol' jerk like the best of them.  "See, I can kidnap princesses too!" he could then brag at family reunions.  If only he survived long enough to see the next one.  Poser.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Moving along, Cherry's sister Sherry begs our hero Sparkster, rocket knight errant, to go and rescue her.  He thinks that espionage is boring, so instead of infiltrating the Gedol empire with stealth, he goes in sword swinging and jetpack blazing, cutting down swaths of whatever poor lizardmen decide to get in his way.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In this game are seven different, hidden swords.  Grabbing all seven causes Sparkster to go Super Saiyin for the final battle.  Collecting them is optional, but this run goes for them anyway, mainly for the sake of completeness.  Even though it does speed up the last boss a great deal, I doubt it saves any time simply because the first one takes about a minute to get.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Sadly, there's about a 9 minute block of autoscrolling, with a brief boss fight in the middle.  That probably hurt this run more than anything else.  Add on top of that the autoscrolling portion in the first level, and nearly half the run is auto.  Gah!  You have my permission to fast forward past these parts.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"One of the nicer things about this game is that the jetpack charges automatically.  This means I can attack to my heart's content while I'm holding onto a charge and not release it early.  There were only a few times this got in the way because I only wanted a half charge instead of a full charge, but those were easily taken care of with a rolling attack.

	"I think this is the most fun I had making a run in a while.  It's fast paced, but easier to control when tool-assisted.  Compare to Metroid II, which was tedious to make because I had to get myself into proper position nearly every single frame, whereas here I could just let the game take over for a little bit.  Certainly it's improvable, but it's a step in the right direction.

The platforming was wild and bouncy, and you did a commendable job with keeping the autoscrolling sections as entertaining as possible. And a very impressive submission text, to say the least. I hereby grant this run acceptance.
