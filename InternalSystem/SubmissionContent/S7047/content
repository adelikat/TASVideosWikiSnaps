	"Finally, a glitch that was present, though apparently unnoticed, in the first run is exploited in several levels. Normally when you defeat an enemy, you have to wait for them to despawn before changing characters. However, if more then one enemy is defeated, or an enemy is defeated and a block collapse is triggered, you have 1 frame when any of these events ends to change characters. You do not need to wait for all of them to complete.
