	"I'd been looking for a decent game to TAS, when I "re-stumbled" upon a test run of this game in the Genesis wish list thread (Very big thanks to Molotov for that .gmv, it was very helpful). After playing around with it for a little while, I realized that it actually had a pretty complicated set of moves and quirks, and produced a nice and quick movie.

	[a class=extlink href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine_Adamantium_Rage rel=nofollow 
		"Wikipedia

	": "Wolverine is shown holding a photograph of someone from his past, and expresses his desire for revenge. He then recounts the procedure that he underwent which bonded Adamantium to his bones. It's at this point where the same laboratory level begins without much explanation as to why, or how Wolverine got there."

	"... SUCK. Seriously, try playing this game. It's horrible. Reaction to input is sluggish, attacks are difficult to control, and turning around takes much longer than it should.

	"The Tricks...

	"... are surprisingly numerous. Most obvious is the repeated slide maneuver that allows me to keep top speed when on flat ground and unobstructed. Wolverine can slide with an initial speed of 4, but if he pops up into a kneeling pose, 10 frames later he will be able to slide again, which increases his speed to 7 (8 for the first couple frames). Another trick is to press the jump button 4 frames before landing from a fall. This prevents Wolverine from landing in a crouched position, and having all movement input being halted for ~20 frames. I'm able to get right back into a sliding rhythm using this technique. The uppercut and the downward stab are the most powerful attacks, but some enemies (Sabretooth, in particular) have very quick invulnerability periods, so I'm forced to use the "Look ma, I'm THIS BIG" attack. There are some other small things, but they're mostly not important, but if they come up in discussion I'll be happy to answer then.

	"... don't really make an appearance. At least not helpful ones. Some collision boxes are abused, but the most noticeable glitch is graphical in nature, and occurs halfway through the mansion level where the background graphics palette gets waaaay goofed up.

	"The Improvements...

]h3
[p 
	"... probably amount to 10-20 seconds, mostly due to small frame savers here and there. I redid the first half of the movie a couple times, so I believe that it is pretty tight, however I'm sure there are some small time-savers still around.
