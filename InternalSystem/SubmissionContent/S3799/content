	"It is similar to Bubble Bobble, in a stage you have to kill all enemies and you will go to the next stage. Total 50 stages in this game, every 10 stages is a boss stage. In order to clear a stage, first killing all enemies, and then taking all items if there are. When there is nothing on the screen you will soon go to the next stage.

	"There are two ways to kill enemies, one is to turn it into a snowball and then kick it, another is to let a snow ball roll through it. Enemy that is killed by the latter way will drop an item, which is usually slower than the form way to clear a stage. Besides, if you only kick a snowball to kill all enemies, there will be some score bonus item fall from the top of the screen, to avoid this you have to kick at least two snowballs. There are also two ways to vanish snowballs: let the snowball roll to the bottom of the screen or bounce 15 times. Few cases there is some snowballs originally should vanish by the latter way, I will change it to the former way to vanish faster.

After beating the boss I will do some action to handle the slot machine as soon as possible.
