	"I take some damage in parts to save time in levels, or to 
	$LF
	"get into a better posistion/get some extra hits in on boss's 
	$LF

	"There is small improvements to be made with this movie (I 
	$LF
	"noticed a brief 1/10th second pause with the act 2 boss 
	$LF
	"before boost attack) and I will make a new run later to 
	$LF
	"improve it.

	"Oh in case your wondering why I am standing still at the 
	$LF
	"beginning of the desert level before I boost is because you 
	$LF
	"can only do about 6 flips within 15 seconds or your guy 
	$LF
	"stutters and gets dizzy, and the fastest way to get over 
	$LF
	"there WITHOUT stuttering or getting hit by the wolf is to 
	$LF
	"boost up right directly from the starting spot.

	"This is version 2, I did a quick re-do of the last boss
