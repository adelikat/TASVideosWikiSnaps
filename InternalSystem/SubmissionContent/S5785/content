	"Turok: Evolution is a fast-paced and rather hectic shooter/platformer for the GBA. Due to some rather odd behaviour with the grappling hook-type weapon, which I've taken to calling the Chain (after the very similar Chain Rod in Mega Man Zero 2), the main character Djunn flies by many areas at absurd speeds.

		" The Chain stuns enemies, allowing Djunn to run through them.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" When grappling onto the ceiling and holding down the intended direction (left or right), Djunn starts to swing left and right. While swinging, pressing A or B on (usually) the second frame it is allowed lets him cover a significant amount of horizontal distance. Jumping immediately after that often maximises this distance. (At normal walking speed, jumping does not make him travel faster)
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" This technique has limited effectiveness with low ceilings. With high ceilings, it can still be used; Djunn just has to spend extra jumps to reach the ceiling.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" This technique is not very good for vertical scaling, but in urgent situations, it can be used to swing up to a platform above. This requires building momentum and releasing it on the third swing.
		$LF

	[li 
		" Using the technique while standing right next to a door allows you to clip through it.

	"The author has also chosen to leave the default difficulty, which is the easiest available. This was also a good choice since the harder difficulty does only increment the enemy health, which would have the only effect to make the boss fights uselessly longer.
