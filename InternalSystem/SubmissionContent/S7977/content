	" for this game, all gems had been on my to do list and I finally made it after deciding to take a break from 
	[a href=https://tasvideos.org/UserFiles/Info/638093185722150570 rel=noopener external nofollow 
		"LEGO Batman
	]a
	" for... obvious reasons. This TAS aims to collect all 9 gems scattered across the game by further utilising wall clips. (the rerecord count is (almost) a total coincidence. it was at 1848 when I finished)

	"The route is pretty self-explanatory, all the gems conveniently line up in a way that we can walk in almost a straight line to the leaves at the end where we clip into the screen below where the game-ending gem is hidden. There are only two gems that are out of the way, those being near the start in the caves off to the right. Death is used to warp back to the top and continue in that straight line.

	"One thing I tried experimenting with was what appeared to be a way to clip OoB with a pin. After collecting gem 6, one pin placement I tried a) didn't work but b) appeared to push Nalle into the wall, though she didn't get very far because of the spikes. I wasn't able to recreate in any other spots but I'm unsure about whether or not it'd actually work since it wasn't very far off the ground and Nalle might clip back out of the wall before she can be stuck in it.

[div class=p 
	"From here, I'd quite like to make a Floor is Lava TAS at some point (which is an optional game mode) since it would involve a lot more entertaining pin jumps and a slightly different route to the game-ending gem which requires more parkour based movement because clipping into the ceiling would force Nalle onto a floor and that would kill her.
