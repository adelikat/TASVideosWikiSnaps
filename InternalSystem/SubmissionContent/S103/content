	"Ok, I was about to redo my Felix the cat time attack. Mostly cus I thought I could improve it. I also checked my last fmv and noticed that I did some unnecesarry mistakes. These are fixed and now everything is much smother. Also I figured about the fact that Felix is upgradable. He can transform to loads of stuffs. However, I couldn´t do this in the "running stages" because if I were to take the cat heads (coins really) I couldn´t pick the upgrade symbol without delay Felix for 0.5 second or something. So I choosed not to upgrade him here. In the flying stages it´s possible to upgrade Felix without losing speed, so I do this and I also found out that the airplane is faster then the balloon and the umbrella. However, and this is a concern of mine atm, I don´t pick every cat head right away (every 10 cat head gives me the upgrade symbol) and this is because I can´t pick them without losing speed. For example if I take some of them I will bang my head in the wall losing speed or end up on a different route which cost me more time. So I optimized my collecting in that point of view. However I don´t know if it´s faster to lose some time first and regain it with the plane. I think I did the right thing though. It looks shabby to me to play clumsy, even with purpose, when I can avoid it for pretty much the same reason.

	"Also, this time I use more "pipes". I have no idea how I could miss these in my first attempt but I did ;) This saved me MUCH time.

	"I also takes damage to save time, this is when I have transformed into something. At the end of each stage those hearts will count down and take some time before the timer will start to count down. So I have optimized that too. I don´t know if it is some frames faster to let the hearts count down but it didn´t feel right. Now it feels like the movie goes on without interuptions.
