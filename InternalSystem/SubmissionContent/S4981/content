	"This game is a fairly simple platformer with warps and bugs that can be used for a swift completion time. Most of the savings come from improved glitching and tighter play, and better luck manipulation (getting enemies to fire projectiles to break the clouds you can ride). The most visible improvements are in 5-2 where the glitch is used to skip having to wait for the lava to fall down at the start of the level and in 5-3 where flapping is used at around the 6650 frame mark instead of using a cloud to ascend quicker.
