		"Dexter's Laboratory: Chess Challenge

		" If you press left while the cursor is on the leftmost column, it will appear on the rightmost column and up one row. The opposite happens from right to left. This is useful in some scenarios where you need to quickly move the pieces across the left and right edges of the board. Unfortunately, this feature only works horizontally, not vertically, meaning that I have to travel across the board instead of wrapping to the other side.

		" Upon reaching the Hard stages (21-30), you switch from solving "mate in one" puzzles to "mate in two" puzzles. After your first move, the CPU takes a turn. It is impossible to shorten the time it takes for the CPU to think. I tried ending my turn at different times, only to find out that it takes the exact same time for the CPU to finish their turn.
