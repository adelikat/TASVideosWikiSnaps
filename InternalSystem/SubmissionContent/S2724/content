	"I managed to improve my current any% published run by 533 frames (9.21 seconds). This is due to better planning with the characters HP (for instance in the last stage unlike my current published run, I killed that giant head enemy to preserve HP for the final boss), various minor optimizations and new strategy against the final boss. The first two stages are from my 100% run, but the rest of the run is new. I am 
	[b 
		"very
	]b
	" satisfied with this run as the final boss was kind with luck manipulation. Nothing much to say other than enjoy watching this.
