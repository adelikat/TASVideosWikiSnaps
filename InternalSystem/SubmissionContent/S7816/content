	"This run mostly follows the RTA route, which saves a great deal of time by using keys better and death abuse. Death abuse is accomplished using the button combination Up+Select+A+B, which the game manual mentions as a fail safe in case you cannot progress, a fail safe against soft locks, as some areas are only accessible by certain characters but those characters might die after you get there and then you can't get back.

	"The main routing difference between this run and the RTA run is in Goemon's stage where I gamble at dice to be able to bring back characters instead of bringing them all back at the slot machine. This saves back tracking to the warp after rescuing Goemon. unfortunately you need all characters alive to be able to enter the space ships to travel to the last level, so I have to bring everyone back, even though they aren't necessary. Still this saves ~10 seconds overall.

From the year the site opened submissions and set the almost 2 decade old record for most submissions in a year to now, where this run helped break that record. Bookends like that are fun. Four minute improvements are even more fun! Accepting as an improvement to the
