	"Iron Tank: The Invasion of Normandy is an action game released by SNK in 1988.  It continued SNK's trend of military-themed action games such as Ikari Warriors and Guerrilla War.  I was not a big fan of these earlier titles, but SNK took the best part of these games--driving a tank--and developed an entire game based on the idea.  Now that's more like it!

[div class=p 
	"While Iron Tank is moving, its tank tracks cycle through 4 different statuses in sequence.  When this "Track Status" is ideal (basically every 4th Frame of animation), Iron Tank can change direction much more quickly.  Iron Tank can make a 45 degree direction change with just 1 Frame of delay, compared to as many as 4 Frames of delay un-optimized.  Thus, Iron Tank can make a 45 degree direction change and begin moving in the new direction in just 3 Frames, compared to as many as 6 Frames un-optimized.  This is exploited throughout the TAS, saving over 100 Frames in total.  Track Status is also one of the biggest difficulties in making a TAS of this game.  Iron Tank's Track Status changes each time a joystick direction is pressed, regardless of whether or not Iron Tank actually moves (changes X/Y position).  In attempting to correct an earlier mistake in the TAS, even 1 Frame of extraneous input will alter the Track Status and cause the next direction change to be out of sync, ruining the TAS.

Iron Tank's X position may also cause an electrical field barrier to shift before the counter has expired; in such an event, the barrier will simply shift again normally when the timer expires.  If Iron Tank touches the electrical field barrier, or the electrical field barrier is hit with any weapon, the counter will be reset.  In this TAS, the Main Cannon is fired at several of these electrical field barriers to manipulate their timers and thus make faster progress.

	"There are many power-up items (referred to in the game as Bullets) scattered throughout the game which provide various enhancements to Iron Tank's Main Cannon projectiles.  It is critical to the overall speed of the TAS that Iron Tank has every type of these Bullets enabled when destroying the many Boss enemies in the game.  Unfortunately, these Bullets must be enabled via the Sub-Screen (the game's Sub-Screen), which consumes a considerable amount of time (well over 100 Frames).  Furthermore, if the supply of any of these Bullets reaches 0, that Bullet type will be disabled, and even if more Bullets of that type are collected, it would still have to be re-enabled in the Sub-Screen.  To make matters worse yet, the supply of these items is rather limited, and even more limited along a direct path.  To deal with these issues, the Sub-Screen is only accessed 3 times in this TAS: 1st before the Area 1 Boss, 2nd at the beginning of Area 2 (necessary to prevent completely running out of B Bullets), and 3rd toward the end of Area 3 (both to re-enable B Bullets, and also to enable the R Item, which allows Iron Tank to survive running over a mine in order to take a major shortcut).  Also, only a bare minimum of Items is collected, and those which are collected off the most direct path have been carefully chosen for minimal deviation from the direct path.  Of course, this also means minimizing the number of Bullets fired, and every effort has been made to do so.  Because the default Main Cannon projectile has an infinite supply of ammunition, and no Bullets are enabled until just prior to the boss, Area 1 is one of the most entertaining segments in the game as every possible target is destroyed.

The core has a very small collision box (much smaller than the tank itself), and is normally not a threat, unless Iron Tank is ramming directly into and through the enemy tank.  In this case, Iron Tank may take the additional 9 damage (e.g. Becks Haus 8 Hit Points + 9 "core" damage = 17 damage!), unless Iron Tank rams the target with a glancing blow (e.g. the very outside edge of the enemy tank), or if Iron Tank is moving directly away from the enemy tank at the time of collision.  Unfortunately, this "core" will usually prevent Iron Tank's Main Cannon projectiles from penetrating through stronger tanks (e.g. Waltar and Becks Haus), unless the projectile hits with a glancing blow, because the projectile strikes the enemy's solid core after the enemy has been destroyed.  Not even with all the special weapons enabled can a Main Cannon projectile do enough damage to penetrate both the tank and its solid core with a single shot; it would have to do at least 18 damage!  However, the chance of a glancing blow can be improved somewhat by first damaging an enemy tank with the Machine Gun (just 1 hit is enough), and then firing the Main Cannon for the kill.  Using this technique extends the area on an enemy tank that may be hit for a glancing blow by 1 pixel, greatly increasing the likelihood of a glancing blow.  The Frame on which  the Main Cannon is fired may also determine whether or not a hit is a glancing blow.  Entering any input while a Main Cannon projectile is in flight may also determine whether or not a hit is a glancing blow.
