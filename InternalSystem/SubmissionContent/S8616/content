	"Taz-Mania on Gameboy is a platform game released in 1994 on Game Boy and drawn from the frankly colorful universe of Looney Tunes. In this opus, Taz is looking for a giant egg, hidden in a lost valley. According to legend, this egg would be big enough to feed a family for a year... The game recreates, among other things, Taz's famous tornado attack to defend himself.

I deliberately chose to put Taz's spins at 9 in order to be faster during almost all levels. Once Taz has finished spinning, it is possible to restart his spin by pressing and holding the “B” button.

By standing on the left edge of the second cart, when it comes close to the wall, I activate Taz's spin in order to project myself into the wall and the end of the level is activated.

	"Boss : The boss's moves are RNG based. After the boss throws all his fireballs, the boss navigates from left to right (or the opposite) while remaining in the air. Which makes it impossible to jump him. Either he navigates by diving to the ground which finally allows him to jump on him. I haven't found a way to manipulate it so that it dives to the ground every time. There could be potential improvement at this level in my opinion.

	"I thought it was impossible to complete the level without collecting clocks along the way to increase our timer. My first attempt was a failure since the timer ended a few frames before arriving at the end zone... But with perseverance and a few frames saved here and there, the level could be completed without extra time !
