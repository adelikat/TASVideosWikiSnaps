	"The goal is not necessarily to checkmate in the least number of moves but to deliver the checkmate that makes the computer "think" the least. For instance, the computer thinks for a cumulative 0:59 over eight moves in this TAS. I have also found a six-move checkmate but the computer thinks for 1:11 and is therefore not faster. Shorter "thinking" times are achieved by keeping the position simple. Giving the computer few options and not attacking with a lot of pieces simultaneously is a good way to minimize thinking times.

	$LF
	"A: Responding with literally anything else on move 4 prompts Black to play Knight f6. If Black plays this move, we are not giving checkmate anytime soon. Black's bishop must be captured because it is defending the f7 square, which will later be used for checkmate.
