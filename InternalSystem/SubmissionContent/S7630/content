[div class=p 
	"Panzer Bandit is a side-scrolling beat 'em up game that uses the same engine used in Mad Stalker: Full Metal Forth, also for the PlayStation. There is a total of 12 characters, including the four story characters and the eight unlockable bosses. The game is controlled with two attack buttons (strong and weak) and the directional pad for moving left, right, crouching, and jumping. Shoulder buttons can also be used to change between foreground and background and can be used to activate the character's special attack. An unusual aspect of the game is that if the player stands still during an attack, it is considered a guard. Other features include a combo counter and a guided elemental attack which launches an enemy.

	"Menu optimization aside (not really a dealbreaker in my book), this is a playaround and the main goal here is to be entertaining. In that department, I think it misses the mark. I just don't think this game lends itself well to playarounds. To keep playarounds as engaging as possible, there should be a good variety of gameplay showcased through the entire run. Most fights are structured the same way, with you starting off with slapping/throwing until you use the super attack to finish them off. If you could switch characters or showcase some glitches, this would be more interesting, but as it is, the movie is really repetitive. If you want to make a TAS of this game, a speed-oriented run like any% would be far more entertaining.
