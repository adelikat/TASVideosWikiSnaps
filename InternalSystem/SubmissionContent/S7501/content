	"This TAS is not the fastest possible, which would be with the Auricom ships. But Qirex is by far the hardest to handle, hence this TAS which is the funniest to do and to watch. Firstar is not included as I wanted to play only the "original" Rapier tracks, but as long as there is no WipeOut TAS to this date there is no official category. It is definitely not an Any% but a "Qirex" and "Rapier original tracks" maybe.

	"There is a heavy luck manipulation, although it is not very apparent in the first two tracks where the boost is not a key factor in the overall speed.
	$LF
	"The 3 laps never have the same time as luck manipulation is not always the same, hence the trajectories are different. Each lap is then almost like 3 different tracks.

	"Venom and Rapier tracks have the same maps, the latter just has higher speed, so we can call it hardest difficulty rather than a set of unique tracks, and that difficulty is unlocked using an in-game input code. So I removed it from the branch. Qirex didn't need the
