	"This is a TAS of the Sega 32X game Spider-man - Web of Fire, completed in 7 minutes and 10 seconds. I decided to make a TAS of this game for two reasons:

	" About the Game
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"What makes a game hard? Sometimes it's long levels, without saves points. Sometimes it's a multitude of enemies. Sometimes it's tough bosses. Sometimes it's complex game mechanics.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"And sometimes, the game has shit-for-controls. This is one of those games. It has absolutely horrible controls. Spider-man can punch three times in a row, but only the first punch deals damage, and the whole sequence lasts over 3 seconds. The jumping is extremely finicky. The web-swinging is mediocre at best. All in all, this is  just a horrible game, and one of the reasons that no one actually bought a 32X.
	$LF

[p 
	"I recorded this with Gens v. 10a, so that version has the best chance of syncing. As for getting it to play, you will need three 32X bios files (google 32X bios, and you shouldn't have much problem). They go in the following spots, under the Options>Bios/Misc files:
	$LF

[ul 
	[li 
		"M68000 = 32X_G_BIOS.BIN
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Master SH2 = 32X_M_BIOS.BIN

	]li
	[li 
		"Slave SH2 = 32X_S_BIOS.BIN

	"If you end up with some funky looking graphics, go to Graphics>Render>EPX. If you have any other problems, please post them and I will try to help you through.

	"Just to give you an idea of how bad this game was coded, I was able to glitch the title screen (!) into only displaying half of the intended graphics.

[h3 
	" The run
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"I'll get this out of the way first: This run may look somewhat less polished than my other two Spider-man runs. There are two reasons for this. One is the horrible controls. Trying to get Spider-man to land as high up on the wall as possible is ridiculous, because of the strange collision detection the game engine uses. The other reason is that I was not able to find a RAM address for speed when web-swinging. Just to prove I'm not fully incompetent, I easily found addresses for land velocity, X location, and many, many boss HPs. So if it looks somewhat improvable to you, I agree. I did do two test runs prior to making this, so I did have some things to compare to, and I do believe that it is a high enough quality to be published.
	$LF

	"The game revolves around a group of rejects from the "Cool Boss Name" company, who decide to start a gang known as Hydra. They then cover the city in a neon web. Spider-man then goes to kick their asses. That's about it for the plot. I'm guessing that the developers only had enough cash on had to use the Spider-man license, but not the names of any of the well know villains from the comics or movies, so they had to improvise with bosses like "Dragonman", "The Eel", and "Thermite". There's also a few unnamed ones in the last two levels, but they look just the same as the previous bosses, so you can use your imagination. Actually, imagining better names for bosses is a hell of a lot more fun than actually playing this game.
	$LF

[p 
	"I don't know what else to say about this run, other than I hope it is somewhat entertaining, and that it saves some poor souls from having to actually play the game. If you'd like to see what real play looks like, take a look at this
