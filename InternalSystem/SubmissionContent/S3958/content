	"The purpose of this run is to celebrate the third anniversary of my first submission to this site. It’s just 378 frames faster than my published run, nothing really new was found, but I’m sure you’ll notice the differences between them. As always, I hope you enjoy watching the run as much as I enjoyed making it.

	"Assuming you are going to the right; while running, release the directional pad for one frame, hold right+R for one frame then release. Repeat it as long as you want to delay some item, enemy or a few other animations in the game, useful to avoid enemy fire or to gain that extra distance from an enemy to avoid getting hurt.

In some walls you’ll just get stuck, in some you’ll fall to your death, but if you are lucky to find an untested wall, you’ll skip some segment.

	"I called it “invincibility” in the old run but it’s not what this trick gives you. You must sacrifice a life (Start+X+Y) a few frames before the “Stage Complete” message appears after defeating a boss, but you must be shot by a droid in the next stage. Alternatively, you can lose all your health, die and take damage. This is a lot faster than the suicide trick, but the only place it is possible is where I already used in the old run.

	"It’s the green fish-faced creature, also known as mid-boss. Manipulate it is quite easy and only depends on the X position of the Hulk. When hit, it slides backwards and will be vulnerable again after 23 frames. While jumping, it is always vulnerable to Hulk’s attacks.

	"The manipulation of the boss of stage 5 is done on the mid-boss of stage 4! This coordinate is from my old run; X 489. When hit, it will follow a predefined path and is always vulnerable, but since Hulk also is, better avoid making it go to the left, and that coordinate makes just that.

	"The first stage of my first submission and here I am, trying to find mistakes and things I should have done faster. Here’s what I’ve found; on the first manhole, avoid the damage animation is faster, I did the same mistake two times in this stage. Another thing I should have tested is jumping out of the elevator as soon as possible; it’s a lot faster than wait and run out of it.

	"The second stage is not much different in terms of mistakes, but since saving time is not so important as before, I tried to smooth things up a bit, but it ended being faster in a way or another. Again, I’m avoiding the damage animation as much as possible, but my old strategy seems to be already pretty solid in this stage.

	"I’ve found out that it is possible to enter walls while riding elevators on the old run, but I thought it was useless at that time. Now, combined with the new strategy to jump out of the elevator it saved quite some time. Since I have to wait until it reaches a certain height to jump out, I decided to play around a little more on the elevators too.

	"Lots of small improvements here, like popping those bubbles without jumping. It may look slower, but believe me, it is faster. Oh, I almost forgot; I’m now using a Lua script to find not only the best spot to jump, but also the height of my jumps. Sometimes, jumping one frame later makes me land one frame sooner or a pixel further or both.

	"Let’s go back to Leader’s Fortress, but this time, to face the Leader himself. The biggest difference you might notice here is where I made Hulk have infinite health, not really my intention, but his energy was a little low to continue to the spot I did it on the old run. This stage also has a lot of elevators, and as expected, jumping out of them saved quite some time.
