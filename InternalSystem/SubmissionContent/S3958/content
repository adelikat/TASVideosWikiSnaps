It’s just 378 frames faster than my published run, nothing really new was found, but I’m sure you’ll notice the differences between them. As always, I hope you enjoy watching the run as much as I enjoyed making it.

You must sacrifice a life (Start+X+Y) a few frames before the “Stage Complete” message appears after defeating a boss, but you must be shot by a droid in the next stage. Alternatively, you can lose all your health, die and take damage. This is a lot faster than the suicide trick, but the only place it is possible is where I already used in the old run.

Another thing I should have tested is jumping out of the elevator as soon as possible; it’s a lot faster than wait and run out of it.

This stage also has a lot of elevators, and as expected, jumping out of them saved quite some time.
