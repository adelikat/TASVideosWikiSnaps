	" is an NES homebrew game made for the 2019 NESmaker Byte-Off Competition. It has a simple setting of two guys finding a cave that leads to an underground maze full of gems and monsters. They must then collect as many gems as they can under a time limit, avoid (or kill with a special item) any monsters along the way, and go back the way they came.

	"While looking at the both the current publication and this submisison in TAStudio, I noted a movement mechanic that I thought might be improvable.  My testing panned out, and now I have

	"Basically, I discovered that starting the first jump of the stage on the frame before the chunk of lag frames prior to entering the first stage (at frame 965) allowed for landing on the middle platform earlier and thus allowing an earlier jump over the square block to initiate the floor clip.  Unfortunately, when I initially added the 
	[b 
		"A
	]b
	" press on the pre-lag frame, RNG was altered in such a way that the enemy on the middle platform started moving left instead of right as in the current publication.  Thankfully this was mitigated by removing the second jump on the stage intro screen as well as one frame of 
	[b 
		"Right
	]b
	" press.  Some minor changes were also made in the duration of jump button presses to optimize the movement.
