	"Making this movie was very fun and challenging. When I first started I thought it wouldn't be very interesting because it was already so optimal and all I would be doing was copying it but adding in a few improvements discovered by VIPer7 while working on his 96 exit video, namely the fast flying and the Bowser fight. Luckily the game has many quirks and turned out to have lots of places where minor details could be exploited to save many frames where not expected.

	"I would like to thank VIPer7 for his work on this project and his 96 exit video with many improvements. Also for his strictness in style as well as frames. Truncated, even though in the end he did not directly work on this video, he did choose for it to be the game done, and provided good feedback and advice. Mazzic for his good 11 exit run that he never finished, this provided a very fast reference to compete with in the earlier levels. BoltR for providing useful new tricks and general screwing around with stuff. And all of the previous authors of Super Mario World videos. And all the people who provided encouragement and feedback from the forum and IRC.
