	"In 8-6, 1 frame was lost to manipulate luck, for the red block could've taken the longer route to lose frames. The route in 8-6 saved 1 frame and could've gotten a 373, but the lost frames wouldn't back it up. In 8-6, I decided to sync with the music a little. Dosen't do much. In many levels like 8-T2, Super seizures were performed, it looks like Mario's freaking out about death, so he looks scared.

		"Glitches/Tricks -On spring boards, you can keep your speed if you don't hold and direction buttons -The cliffs on 8-7... you can keep jumping w/o losing speed by not pressing any direction buttons and jump w/o landing for more than 1 frame. -By alternating left and right, you can freeze your animation or face the front which looks very silly when you freeze Mario's head in the ground after doing a triple jump. When progressing on a hill, try running down to the last point where you can slide, and do so. Running down a hill is faster than sliding down, but when you're at the bottom of the hill, try sliding,gives a boost to the speeding. When you slide off of a hill, hold on the down button longer to speed a little. In 8-5, the chain platforms will help you gain speed for a little when running up.
