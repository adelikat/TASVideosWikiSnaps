	"First off, in order to actually use the ship you just got, you have to go to the hangar and prepare it. As this is the first time it's prepared, some people are removed from your world and sent in, along with a full tank of fuel. If you don't have enough fuel, the refueling is aborted and the ship can't go anywhere, as the game refuses to give partial fueling.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Now, each ship has its own capacity for fuel. The weaker Attack Cruiser B, with low capacity for offenses, also does not have enough fuel to go from planet 1 to 32. So I'm forced into picking Attack Cruiser A. With 1600 fuel, this is barely enough to make the trip spending 50 fuel to pass each planet. It also takes one game day to travel past a planet plus one more to actually make the stop at the target planet, so that explains the long wait.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"As for what we do once we're actually there, we need a weapon of some sort for the Attack Cruiser. We have exactly three to choose from: A missile, another missile, and a tank. Since the tank is the only one we have direct control over, as well as able to do damage more than once, it is used with TAS precision to destroy the enemy defenses.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"You start with enough money to buy Attack Cruiser A and the Hover Tank immediately. You also start with enough fuel to fill said cruiser, which has enough capacity to reach the enemy homeworld without first claiming a closer planet. A single tank is enough to defeat any defenses with enough skill. Therefore, the fastest strategy to win is extremely straightforward.

Ordering the Attack Cruiser a day earlier might speed things up, if you can even do so. Screen transitions delays the day timer, and as much as I want to change planets from the hangar screen, doing so there invokes screen transitions, as opposed to the main screen. You can't change planets in the ship screen, that indicator there is merely the destination for ships, not the actual selection.

Out of a 4 minute movie, only about 10 seconds have any TAS-like precision to them, and a bit of practice could probably mimic those 10 seconds in an RTA environment. In a way, it reminds me a lot of
