]p
[p 
	"However, Anoobis is pretty sure that there are undiscovered glitches in most of the games that the speedrunning popes might be able to find quite easily, allowing them a faster game completion time than the current TAS record.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"That can not be tolerated! Go and seek them glitches! Look for the impossible! Make a tool that checks all the untested 255 button combinations for the previous frame and compares the "ghost character" positions to find the maximum character movement while TASing! Then, when the CPU power increases, check every combination for the previous two-frames in real-time to find even more tricks while TASing. It is tedious to TAS by hand. Why not generate huge amounts of input automatically, showing just a list of resulting RAM values and let the user choose from those? It is done already to some extent, but the method can be developed further for non-RPGs and pretty much any genre. Manual rerecords will be obsoleted with the multi-ghost machine!
