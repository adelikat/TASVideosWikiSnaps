	"Sliding down inclines is normally impossible, but at certain slopes you can force Richter to repeatedly do the beginning of a slide to get down them, which is faster than waiting for him to get up if you're already sliding when you come to such an incline. This only works at certain points at the slope, so it's generally optimal to have as much speed as possible when hitting the slope, a trick that saved frames here over the old TAS.

	"Richter lacks most of Alucard's prowess in moving the RNG, though he fortunately has less use for it. His only actions that push it are the whip, which is very slow, and headbonking the ceiling during an uppercut, which is even worse. Besides that, your only option is really to just try timing things differently, opening the map to allow RNG to pass if need be. This mostly just concerns getting criticals on bosses.

	"Time was saved here by not doing the uppercut straight up in the room after the staircase, as this allows me to slide instead of blade dash through the entire next room. I simply get all the hearts I need later in the run. I avoid an uppercut in the large vertical shaft past that room, and some the uppercuts in there following that are slightly faster. The old TAS did a strat through the second tower that involved sliding around the right side of the bell and uppercutting up from there, but I save almost half a second by just uppercutting up the left side instead. Hippogryph is a couple frames slower due to RNG, and perhaps a difference in lag.
