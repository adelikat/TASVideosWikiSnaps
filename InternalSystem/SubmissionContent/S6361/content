	"After 3 years since the last attempt, I decided to do a new TAS of 'Knuckles Advance'. At first, I was simply only doing this to test something that was done in RTA that I spoke to KirbyMastah about. He wasn't sure if it was worth doing for a TAS, time-wise. I became increasingly curious about it and so here we are!

	"Aside from tiny optimizations, I was able to clip through the curve off-screen with enough velocity by using a punch right before it. This allowed me to zip to the booster on the other side earlier than the previous run. Also after getting the double boost from the last booster, I did the 1-2-Uppercut. Due to the weird properties between the 'tube' and the uppercut, Knuckles is able to accel past the normal speeds and goes as fast as close to the ultraspindash.

	"Alright, this was the stage that inspired this new TAS. Aside from optimizing the small bit before the loop, a new strat was used. By crouching at the edge of the loop and spindashing at the earliest point after the screen scrolls down fully, the solidarity of the level is broken. Unlike RTA, I am able to jump up to the platform and glide all the way until near the end of the level.

	"Most of the route is similar to the previous run but more optimized with the exception of a few things. Upon doing the punches at the curve, Knuckles was able to avoid the spikes and gain additional velocity on the conveyer rope. I also utilized the same glitch as the previous act, but took it the whole way to the last lamp post before dying. This also restores the solidarity in the level to normal.

	"I had to delay to let the background objects move around in more favorable places. From here, I take a different path to the twin bumpers and spindash to the next area instead of taking the contraption and waiting. Once I get to the flicker, I then use the other side to clip into the section with another one and clip through that one to finish.
