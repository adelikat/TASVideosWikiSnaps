	"Nothing too special to see here. Two interesting notes are the game determines the word on the frame you hit reset to start the game, so there are a few frames I wait to reset to get the word "away". It stores these words alphabetically, so it's pretty easy to guess words depending on when you hit reset. There is a large delay between selecting a letter and moving to another, so if we could figure out how to reduce this, the movie could maybe go below 2 seconds.
