[h4 
	" Impossible Pogo Trick
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Tapping ALT and CTRL near-simultaneously while holding Left or Right allows Keen to perform a higher-than-normal pogo jump.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Continuous Vertical Pogo
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"When approaching a static soft platform from below under certain conditions, Keen can land on it without having to wait for gravity to deplete her vertical momentum.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Cornerboosting
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Landing on corners and hitting them in midair can slightly boost Keen forward.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Slope mechanics
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Keen moves forward 7/6 times faster when traversing a downward slope. When traversing a sharply downward slope, she moves forward 1/3 times faster. Conversely, she moves forward 5/6 times slower when traversing an upward slope and 2/3 times slower when traversing a sharply upward slope.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Death flag glitch
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Saving and reloading a game causes the "you are dying" flag to be reset while still leaving Keen in the dying animation, allowing her to clip through walls. This is beneficial when done near the vertical edge of a level, as touching one will complete the level. Oracles and swimming gear cannot be touched with this glitch.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Midair Pogo
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Pogo activation and deactivation in midair allows for greater control over jump height. Keen's pogo hitbox is shorter than her jumping one, which can enable her to jump farther and higher in constrained spaces.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Warp glitch
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Being pushed under certain conditions, including while hanging onto a pole, causes the end of the level to warp you to the game's secret level, Korath III. This is useful as the exit from Korath III takes you to the segment of the overworld just prior to the second last level of the game (as the exit to the secret level is in that level), meaning, if it's done early enough, you can skip a considerable number of levels. This glitch only works in v1.4 of the game.

	"Adjusting the initial RTC time is the only way to luck manipulate Shockshunds and the Shikadi Master. It is set to a value that results in excellent positioning for both at the cost of worse enemy positioning on the first level.

	"Wall turrets, moving platforms, Bouncing Pointy Things, Spinning Fiery Poles and Beam Hazards can't be manipulated. As such, the rest of the run is bound by them. Luck is manipulated in order to destroy the QED faster.
