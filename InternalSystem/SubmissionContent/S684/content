He also doesn't hit a single wall in the vehicle stages, because he's a safe driver. (if you've ever played this game, you'd know how stupidly hard the vehicles are to control, even in slowdown)

	"I actually take damage, but this is an unavoidable bug in the game...after the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th vehicle stages, I start the next levels with slightly-less-than-full health. This is because when the timer reaches 0:00, your health starts depleting rapidly, and at the end of each level, time converts to points. I don't know why it doesn't do so for the 1st vehicle level.
