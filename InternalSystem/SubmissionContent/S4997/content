	"Tony Hawk's Underground (THUG), has four difficulty levels: Too Easy (which has nearly no bailing), Beginner, Normal, and Sick. Sick is, of course, the hardest difficulty, since it requires more points, bigger combos, better balancing, and superb knowledge of the game.

	"Unlike Pro Skater 1, 2, or 3, you make your own skater and go on your own adventure with them, attaining new tricks, skills, and stats along the way as you become a pro. All of this, and more, I will be going over in detail, since there is a lot of tech in this game that makes it as fast as it is!
	$LF

[p 
	"One final note is that this currently beats the current Any% Sick record (at this time being 48:34), but not by much. Console version of THUG (and subsequently, emulators) are inferior to the PC version due to long load times, freezes at several points, and loading between chapters. Fog found out that if you just remove load times, it would be a 43:25. And, that is without the random stutters that GCN has! So, yeah, this run is pretty insane overall!

	$LF

[p 
	"As soon as I load in, I pause and edit in two tricks: The Indy 900 and a special manual, Casper Handstand. On a fresh file, you are only allowed three custom moves (attaining more as you learn new tricks from pros), but one of them, the McTwist, is required for story purposes. The Indy 900 gives the most points out of every trick in the game, and the Casper Handstand gives a good amount of points as well as being a special manual to string combos together.

	"Once I gain control again, there is a small trick I called called Quick Nollie. If you hit the Pressure/Nollie button (usually the left trigger), you skip animations faster and start riding faster. This is used mostly in New Jersey, but you can see it in several areas later on. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Right after this, I do a trick found by yib123 called Porch Skip. Originally, you would grab the top of the garage and pull yourself up, but, with a good angle and jump, you can jump on the porch and jump on the garage. Once I do this, I fall off the garage intentionally, time my jump, and hold down ollie again so I can double-jump onto the top of the house across from me. The rest of the mission is pretty self explanatory.

	"The next goal, Walk Charles, is an auto-scroller. I QN to get to Charles faster, and I have to "walk" him with skitching (which was introduced in THPS4). Before a second ticks down, and if I can, I let go of Charles and skitch back onto him without losing time. This one was found by Fog a while back, but it has no real effect on the goal and is just something interesting I wanted to show.

	"The Street Warriors car goal is dumb, even in TASing. The idea is to, of course, keep as much speed as possible, even going past tight corners. There are several times that I run into the environment to manipulate my angle a little bit. One of the cooler things I do is take a super-tight turn that stays close to the playground, and it is actually something that is faster overall. On this, I was able to attain a 0:46, where a :45 is considered a super-good time for an RTA run.

[p 
	"The next couple of missions are self explanatory, as they serve as a tutorial on stuff like spine transfers and call-out tricks. The third goal requires me to get 100,000 points, so I do a quick combo to get special into a special manual and then I perform a buttslap and do a bunch of extra tricks to finish the combo.
	$LF

[p 
	"Buttslapping is a glitch introduced in THUG1, that is available as late as Proving Ground, where you go over a ledge and fall a bit, jump, do a trick, and mash ollie at the beginning of the animation. The timing is weird, especially for TASing, but is used a lot in runs. Normally, humans can do 3 or 4 (with a super-rare 5), but TASing can go as far as around 9 or even 10!
	$LF

[p 
	"The chapter 2 finale involves a cool little trick that was found by Coombs sometime back; I go to the Street Warriors car, pause, and restart the last goal. The game will give me back my skateboard (normally, of course, you shouldn't have it), and allow me to get to the stolen board pretty fast. This is slightly faster then the old strategy of jumping on the top of the building roofs.

	"The second part of the first goal is one of the more difficult tricks for beginners, Bridge Skip. Usually, you would skitch the car, keep your speed by shuffling, and then jump across the bridge with a buttslap but,to tell since I did a lot more shuffles, I had enough speed to clear it without a buttslap.

	"Save Eric has the reset point I was talking about. Usually, you would go through New Jersey to try and save Eric from the drug dealers. However, thanks to a trick discovered by Pyatters called Eric Skip, you can skip the second part of the goal by hitting the ollie button at one of two specific frames. 
	$LF

[p 
	"Now, the reason for this is still up to speculation, but the best way to describe the trick is like a cutscene skip. I get the cutscene skip, but the game has no trigger to go on (since the it was skipped), so it progressed to the next possible trigger, that being going to Manhattan.

	"Hold-Grind Combo is self explanatory, and then I get to helping the student. There is a lot of small tricks here and there that worked really well together. The first big thing is that I boneless to the top of an awning at the bank and takes a leap of faith towards the hovering purse item and continue the grind. It is very unforgiving and is never attempted, since the jump and angle need to be very precise.

	"Now I need to deliver nuts to the security guards, but I also take advantage of extremely good carng. In THUG1, there are cars driving around the level in set intervals and set speeds from set locations.

	"The final part of the chapter involves jumping over a car and doing tricks, but it introduces a neat speedrun mechanic as well! As long as you hit a gap once in your combo (it can be anywhere) and keep your combo, you can do all of your tricks without having to repeatedly hitting the gap. So, of course, I abuse the heck out of this and do a couple of buttslaps to keep the number of cycles low.

I am able to actually skate on top of the wooden board that is against the fence and buttslap off of it to the next donut, I grind, acid drop, go up the other side of the ramp, and then boneless across. Compared to the RTA route, it is a lot faster and a lot more technical and fun to look at.

However, the last thing I do is a cutscene skip that we call Skeevo Skip or "Nighttime San Diego" (which I will show why it is called that later). For this trick, you need to hold a combo of tricks and wait around a second or two after the last trick is shown on the right-side. If you jump out of the combo and hit ollie on the right frame, it will skip the cutscene, save a pause, some loading, and have you next to the first chapter 12 goal!

[p 
	"There is a bit more sick tech in this run that I take advantage of, with the first being Skeevo Setup. The acid drop goal can be a huge choke point for beginners, since you need to fall off of the tower with a very good angle, acid drop, keep your speed, keep your angle, and get at least one buttslap to get to the second. Bonelessing does work, but it can backfire easily and cause you to jump the top of the ramp instead.

Originally, you would hit the very first poster in front of you, go to the top of the level for that poster, and come back to get the rest.

		" You should get the poster at the top of the level first. The reason for this is, from SilentLaws' discovery, you can actually wallplant the poster, wait for the poster to visually show up, and restart the goal. If you do this right, it will reward you the post anyways! Why? Because the goal has two triggers: Where the post shows up, visually, and the game rewarding the point. Restarting the goal carries this over!

So, after testing, it was found that a 720 (with a buttslap), a 540 (with a buttslap), and three 360s (without buttslaps) will give you 17 360 spins. Why? How? The hell I know. If you add in an extra 360, it goes down to six. And, for some reason, sometimes it will give you 14 instead of 17. So, yeah, this glitch is dumb.

	"One thing I forgot to mention is that there is a sort of RNG manipulation in this game involving called-out tricks. Every ten frames or so, the game changes what tricks come up. The frustrating part is that tricks also change mid-goal, so I cannot map out what tricks I do extremely easily. Seeds are dumb.

	"To finish up the chapter, I need to do one big combo. So, I jump into playground, do a ~9x buttslap, do a few special tricks, go down street, and finish up the combo relatively quickly.

	"The first goal we do is the infamous THPS Challenge, the final gatekeeper. Unluckily for me, I did not have a verification file beforehand to alter the pro tricks, so I had to stick with stock tricks. While Tony Hawk was second on the list, I went to him because he has the Indy 900. I got a couple of really nice combos to complete this easily and, with the assistance of Switch to get even more points, I made this look easy. The big buttslap double Indy 900 at the end, however, is nearly suicide in an RTA attempt.

	"Next up is the Hawaii Spine Transfer challenge. This one is easy. I do get off my board at the very end so I can reset my speed, otherwise, if I do the spine transfer at the end, I can bail easily and also have INSANE height (which wastes a lot of time).
	$LF

[p 
	"Next, we have the Vancouver Spine Transfer challenge. I switch to Bam for this one because, out of the remaining skaters, he has the best moveset. The transfers were easy enough, but I also go to show-off an incredibly awesome combo that we all talked about ages ago. A HUGE buttslap into an acid drop into another HUGE buttslap with a bunch of big tricks is cool to see. I got this quickly, too, which was surprising.

	"Then, to end it off, the New Jersey goal. There is a lot of waiting around in this one, so I mess around a lot, but this goal (or any fifth pro goal) has the option to do the HARDEST trick in the entire franchise, Video Skip.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Video Skip... How do I explain this? Normally, you would have to finish the goal and watch a ~20 second long cutscene showing your team pro video. However, TkMala found out that you can skip all of this by hitting ollie on a certain frame. So, it's a frame-perfect trick right? Well, yes and no. It seems like there is some sort of sub-frame involved with the trick as well. More research needs to be done on this trick but, regardless, it is still the hardest trick in the game.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I was able to find out that there is a pause buffer method to Video Skip, however. There is also a single frame where you could hit pause after the goal is finished, and you can warp that way. However, it is still unlikely because, by the time you realize you hit pause on the right frame, you already unpaused. :/

	"The reason we do New Jerey's goal last is because I am going to warp to the final goal against Eric, which is in New Jersey. This saves an additional load screen.

	"This was my first TAS, and I feel like I did pretty well with it. Of course, there are a few mistakes that I made (mainly in New Jersey) but I feel like I did really well. Fog showed me the basics of TASing, answered my questions along the way, and even gave suggestions for the run. So, of course, big shoutouts to him!
