	"Note: The previous 100% TAS did not abuse the left+right momentum glitch for movement. The abuse of this glitch allowed savings of up to 3,909 frames over the course of the run. The previous TAS also takes no damage throughout the entire run. In this updated run, damage is taken to lose the shield which costs no time, but no loss of HP was incurred over the course of the run. The amount of time lost to avoiding damage from the previous TAS is negligible over the course of the run.

	"Special thanks to TAS legend Tremane for introducing TASing to me, and the awesome people who kept me company while I muddled through this in my Twitch chat. Extra special thanks to the anonymous creator of the original TAS, “mlight” on nicovideo or “Tarou Yamada” on YouTube. While the final product of this submission used little of the previous author’s run, this optimized TAS wouldn’t have been half as successful in saving time without the work that was already put in for reference. Thank you!

[div class=p 
	"While simple in nature, Twinbee: Rainbow Bell Adventure has a surprisingly complex momentum system, as well as a jet propulsion mechanism that forces the player to commit to the direction he or she is going for a minimum of 64 frames at a time. Within those 64 or more frames, the character will ricochet around the room depending on the geometry of the environment, much like the jet propulsion of Rocket Knight Adventures or Sparkster. While there is no way to break out of a jet blast, it does achieve (almost) the highest velocity a character can move, so it is often significantly faster to utilize this blast in lieu of traditional running and jumping, even if the character ricochets off walls a number of times. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Maps are sprawling and often go in all directions, making this game an explorer’s delight. It is highly recommended for viewers to try this game briefly before watching the TAS video, as words do not give the challenge of the game justice. Be that as it may, the exploration aspect of the stages, albeit labyrinthine, allow for fantastic replayability. This paired with a happy, upbeat Konami soundtrack makes it an absolute must-play in the Super Nintendo (Famicom) library. Sadly, the European version removed much of the free-exploration aspect of the game, and it was never released in North America. Those fortunate enough to have a NTSC-J copy of the game will agree: it is one of the best action platformers on the system.

	"Stage Hazards
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Rainbow Stars: These stars are placed in sinister portions of stages that require jet blasts to reach. They refresh TwinBee's jet blast in-flight cool-down timer and need to be avoided at all costs, because they usually send you careening into a wall or far past your target destination, causing you to lose massive amounts of time. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"(Note: This causes the most time loss in S30 V1 after the long vertical jumping section, requiring a long left run to pick up a fairy on the right side of a hidden path (The stars refresh Winbee's jet blast, and she will just go all the way back to the left otherwise, so running is the only way to collect this fairy). Stars are avoided in many of the cave levels, which is why more obvious and seemingly faster jet paths not used.)
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Enemies: Most enemies die in one hit and can be knocked to the background with a super punch to avoid Bell Power drops. Grey/Turquoise enemies take many hits to defeat unless knocked into the background with a super punch.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Small Spikes: These spikes can be used for damage boosts. They will cause TwinBee to lose one heart or the shield.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Large Spikes: These spikes are insta-kills. TwinBee can move through them or over them during invulnerability frames after taking damage, or with invincibility. This can be most plainly seen in S30V1 where damage is taken to run through spikes guarding a fairy, and invincibility is collected from an enemy to run through spikes to collect the green key.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Thwamp Blocks: These blocks move up and down to crush TwinBee in the cave zones. These drop upon being triggered by the camera, so no amount of re-routing allowed for faster transit to the secret area below the thwamp in stage 9.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Ice: Ice causes special physics, including physics that void the left+right movement glitch. In order to utilize this l+r speed boost, TwinBee must jump or be airborne.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Water: Blasting into a body of water from outside causes TwinBee to come out of the blast in a swim animation. However, jumping into the water allows TwinBee to retain non-water physics until the B button is pressed, even after a blast! This is used constantly throughout the water stages to optimize trajectory and fall faster when necessary.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Quicksand: In some parts of the jungle area, TwinBee must sink in the quicksand to reach secret areas. This quicksand resets all momentum to 0 and nullifies any frames remaining on a jet blast. Conversely, it is not possible to jet out of the quicksand, so TwinBee must first jump out before a blast.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Springs: It takes one frame for the spring to register, so TwinBee can jump off a spring without being blasted up to retain normal jump height. This is used frequently in rooms with springs. Usually they should be avoided at all costs.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Stage Goals: Frames can be saved by altering the time TwinBee passes through the stage goals, likely due to the falling or ricochet animation before TwinBee reaches the ground. The fastest Goal entry is from a blast that is executed from flat ground that is on the same plane as the goal. The Ricochets are used to enter the goal only if TwinBee is falling from above, otherwise it is always faster to do a jet blast from the same plane as the ground of the goal.

	"Lag Mitigation
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Boss fights or screens with many enemies can generate a lot of lag. Sometimes making no movement at all after a boss fight, doing a slide at a frame perfect timing, or changing direction can reduce or completely eliminate lag during the explosion. This is one reason for a “minimalist” approach to many boss fights.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"For screens with many enemies, it sometimes reduces/eliminates lag if you take out enemies with the gun. The whip almost always causes lag on a busy screen. Furthermore, if you collect a bell that is dropped by an enemy, lag is almost always generated as a result. There is only one instance where a power up must have been collected (a shield) in order to lose it to the next boss in the stage route. Taking actual damage aside from being a brutally long animation of swirls, also generates a lot of lag. While damage is taken to lose the shield a number of times, actual damage to the TwinBee is never taken because it is never slower to dodge an enemy.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Finally, Winbee was used for her extremely fast jet boost charge time, and the charge shot is used sparingly enough so that it would not even come close to saving time taking a death and switching characters at any point in the run.
