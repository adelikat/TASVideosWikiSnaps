	"This magazine is very memorable. it is one a few games where the emulation of 16 sprites occurs. If I remember, I quickly tried typing this game in so that I can see what the deal was with seeing the impossible, as the C64 was only capable to showing 8 sprites at a time.

	": Something I wanted to check was to see if it was possible to swap over to the left most gator on the bottom player's side as it's the first entity to touch the middle line. Unfortunately, the combination of inputs not being polled fast enough and the bottom player's position being too far away on a fast game to reach the left gator before it bounces away makes that strategy unavailable at high game speeds. It's also worth noting that the top player controlling the eagles only needs to move their position once to get the ideal first eagle needed to get a win without further inputs by either side even on the fastest game speed. So as far as I can tell the other options are simply slower in this case in terms of game completion and input times. Nice work!
