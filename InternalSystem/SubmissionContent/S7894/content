	"Space Invaders is a 1978 arcade game from Taito that has received many ports over the decades. This US and European Game Boy port from 1994 is interesting since it has an entire SNES port of the game on the cart, available through plugging in this game into a Super Game Boy. Jeremy Parish has a

	"For the most part this plays like Space Invaders. Unlike the 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Atari 2600 version|href=/1378G)
	" only one bullet can be fired at a time, which is more accurate to the original arcade version. The plan was to basically keep making shots as soon as possible and to keep at least one alien on the far sides alive to keep the entire fleet moving down as often as possible. The ship has a limited horizontal range that the aliens are allowed to move past so while it seems like I could go out farther to shoot the side groups the game won't allow for that.

	"I stuck with the goal of competing a loop of 9 waves of invaders. This is different from publications of the 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Atari 2600 port|href=/4734M)
	" and 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Pepsi Invaders|href=/4757M)
	" TASes since those clear only one wave. At WRAM address 
	[code 
		"0x010306
	]code
	" there's 3 bits that determine what the next wave difficulty will spawn after clearing the current one. It starts at 0 and rolls over at 7. Upon completing loop 9, the next wave difficulty to call is at value 0, so the 2nd wave difficulty spawns next. Stopping at the last input of wave 9 is what I would consider exhausting all unique content since the game will continue indefinitely going through waves 2 though 9.
