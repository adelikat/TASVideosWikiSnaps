	"PrsB:  This is a damage boost trick found by prslol.  As long as Mowgli is grounded, if you press b at the same time as he is damaged, you can get significant height depending on the object/monster used.  All of the damage boosts only have a 1 frame window except for the first one in the 2nd stage that is only while using the mask (2 frames).
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Banana Doppler:  You can cancel Mowgli's attack animation by pressing a direction after firing.  This allows you to attack at a much faster rate and allows for quicker boss fights.  Max of 4 bananas on screen (lasts until it scrolls off screen or its hit disappears).

]div
[div class=p 
	"Fast Blocks:  It is quicker to move blocks by mashing a direction rather than holding it.

	"Rope Jumps:  The fastest method of climbing ropes is by jumping up them.  This is done by pressing up, then releasing up and pressing jump. 
	$LF

	"Baloo Triggers:  Not really a trick, but there are certain item patterns where if you collect them all, Baloo will come out and throw a mask to you.  Masks give invulnerability for a set time.

	"Louie 2: Also discovered by prslol "Reverse CLC".  At the end of the autoscrolling stage, by holding left, you can cause the game to continue on scrolling.  If you were to press right before triggering Louie, you end up scrolling right back to the beginning of the autoscroller.
