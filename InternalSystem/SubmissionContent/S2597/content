	"Hi! Here is a casual TAS of Survival Kids, which was recorded a while ago. Thanks to KaitouKid and LSK for the idea.

	"The game is about a dude who gets trapped on an island and tries to survive/escape. There are multiple endings in the game. This TAS aims for the fastest ending.
	$LF

	"The gameplay resembles some Zelda title with less fighting. Actually, no fighting happens at all, because enemies were avoided here. The only interesting trick is skipping a cutscene by restarting the game just before stepping onto a cutscene triggering tile. When the game restarts, the player is already standing on the tile, so the cutscene won't be activated and the player can continue walking to the next tile. This trick is used twice on the same spot, but on the third time it was actually faster to let the cutscene happen.
