		"The underwater levels in this game are seriously dumb, because you can't hit the cieling or you stall for a few frames, and you can't attack downwards so you have to go out of your way to get a good angle to kill them. I had to redo this level multiple times just to get it looking decent. The only other water level is too easy to optimize, mostly because it's a bonus stage. :P
