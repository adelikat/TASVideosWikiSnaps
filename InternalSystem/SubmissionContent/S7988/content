	"This run was aimed to complete the game as fast as possible while also getting all 6 Chaos Emeralds for the 100% Ending. We used inputs from the current world record run by Aglar. You may ask, "why 100% of Sonic the Hedgehog?" This game never had a 100% TAS. So, we organised a collab where I am, Zekann, DarkShamilKhan and Rodonic01 are completing to 100%.
