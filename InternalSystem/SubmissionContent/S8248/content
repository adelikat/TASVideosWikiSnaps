My first attempt to TAS this game was in 2004 using famtasia (and was laughably a failure, famtasia was not up to the task of doing anything reasonable with this game).  It's been almost 20 years since then, and my TAS techniques have matured, as well as my understanding of the game.

	"The programmers were clever on this one.  And to my knowledge, this is a unique situation, at least with this generation of consoles. The RNG is checked/advanced often.  And I mean often.  Thousands of times per frame.  So often that the number of CPU executions in the frame start to come into play as to what the RNG will be by the end of the frame.  Because of this, the RNG can not be predicted.  This means the only choice is brute force.  Honestly, I think this fact was not lost on the programmers. Inspired by their essential "real" RNG, so many things are random in this game.  Random screen transitions, random "criticals" during level ups, including very negative ones.  Day/night is random (because that's clearly how physics works).  The combination is insane for the TAS.  It is truly unique in how many unlikely events

	"What I found is, better programming equals better results.  This is true for many reasons.  With more precise scripting, I can hone in on outcomes with fewer attempts, and less trial and error.  Cleaner code allows accurate scripts with fewer mistakes.  Making increasingly higher level abstractions allows more of the TAS to be scripted instead of "TASed" in the human-sense.  Almost all of this TAS was done by script.  It became clear that I'll save frames by scripting the entire thing in a series of scripts.  This way I can optimize every screen transition better, but also redo big sections to try to get more favorable seeds to shave more frames.  I need to script everything, I need to write my code clean, and I need to get creative with abstractions.  All of this lead to the ability to write some reasonably short scripts that do lots of high level actions while maximizing the amount of RNG manipulation that happens during it.

Even with both, it's only 65536 , which starts to sound low when we are talking so many unlikely outcomes chained together.  In reality though it is never 65536 as the 2nd byte only can change to so many values, and usually only the "starting seed", by scripting the lead up to the battle/whatever needs manipulation.

I manipulated the min healing from the medical herb but unfortunately it left me with 3 unnecessary HP.  I could maybe manipulate less HP in level ups, but by getting high HP rolls I was able to trigger the stat-balancer several times and skip HP in many levels (each time, this saves about 80 frames).  Even 1 less HP might not be possible and still get as many skips.

Criticals are 1/64, but most are max-damage/high damage, making them even more unlikely.  But these odds are trivial compared to these moments.

If you can find a magic seed, that will last you through a level up or 2.

The battle order and enemy actions are particularly unlikely. While I shaved a lot of frames, the actual outcome as the same as the previous TAS.  But like the previous TAS, a huge amount of time was spent on this fight.  To get the Round 1 battle order/initiative, for instance, will get a positive outcome once every 8-16 hours (at a script speed of about 1000fps).  I actually had to manipulate several of these, to get better seeds to get fewer delay frames.  And it doesn't get much easier for round 2 either.

	"Another motivator for this improvement.  Too late into the TAS, I realized the Skeleton encounter could be done in 2 rounds instead of 3.

A max offer requires a "critical" of 1/64 with the max value of one of 16 values, and it has to be done 3 times.  Delay frames are possible.  Because we are in a town, the 2nd RNG byte is manipulatable here too but only periodically as NPC's decide there next direction.  This is one of the most unlikely outcomes in the TAS.

This would be visually hilarious but the odds would be 1/256 * 1/2 * 1/256 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2, and that is for each level.  3 level ups are chained after the boss fight, and 7 more at the king.

So, about half of the steps from the Bazaar to Endor, plus a lot of steps in chapter 3 would have to be manipulated to skip the day/night counter advance.  Given the number of "dice rolls" that are possible on each step, the best "skip rate" I could reasonably achieve seemed to be about 75%, well above what is needed.  But with enough crazy botting, and patience, or a new technique for getting more RNG seeds "dice rolls", this might be feasible and save about 10 seconds.
