	"The only glitch still used in the run, text storage is what makes it all possible. The game does many transitions and events (teleporting, saving crew members, going back to the menu etcetera) by setting the game state to a given number. However, the game state is set (to, say, 10), a transition is started and some time later, the game state is read, used and set back to 0.

]div
[div class=p 
	"And during this transition is when the magic happens. If you exit to the menu while in a dialog, this "dialog state" (which you can discern by the "Press ACTION to advance text" message at the top of the screen) doesn't go away. This allows us to alter the game state during transitions.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The first transition occurs together with getting storage. As soon as the game enters the dialog state, we suicide and exit to the menu. During this transition, the game state becomes 80. Normally this just continues into the menu, but we increment it to 94, which is used to start the Space Station 2 time trial. As such, we're warped to the start of Space Station 2.

	"From here, we go to the two closest teleporters and get text storage from the terminal. We then teleport, which uses a variety of game states between 4000 and 4058. Which we then manipulate up to 4080, which triggers the ending sequence. Game completed.

Breaking the game even further was great fun though, and we discovered quite a few amazing, broken and hilarious things that you, unfortunately, don't see in the TAS.

	"Hello! When I first saw that new VVVVVV submission which was under 1 minute I couldn't really believe it. But I soon realized that games can get veery confused when multiple things are happening at the same time. Scepheo and I played around with the game even more and he found faster and faster routes. I had a lot of fun working with you Scepheo and thanks for the submission text I didn't want to write xD.
