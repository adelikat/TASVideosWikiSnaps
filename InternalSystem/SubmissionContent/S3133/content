	"I want to put this section first to give recognition to someone really wonderful. laranja and I originally were coauthoring this run. I had more time to work on the run, and after several weeks of a busy schedule, Marco graciously bowed out. You will be hard pressed to find someone as friendly as Marco. He was the first to discover the quick way to the first exit, and how to beat the last level without damage boosting. Some of his input remains in level 1-2. He also was the one to notice you can beat the 2 red balls with just 1 swing, saving 10 frames over the first submission.
