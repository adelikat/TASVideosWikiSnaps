	"For a reference, if you gift something to an NPC and have a daily conversation will them, you may get 5-10 points per day, as affection gains are only possible to be gotten once per day.

	"However, due to a flag that doesn't get set, Karen, the girl we're trying to marry, gets 1 affection point every time you show her the dog, and it can be repeated for as long as you want, saving about 40 minutes over an intended route.
	$LF
	"A major time loss comes from the fact that on emulators, the vineyard has a permanent lag that makes the game run at half its normal framerate, as a result of that, I had to do a slightly slower route which did the Karen affection on the screen with the carpenter house would lose ~10 seconds on console, but saved nearly 2 minutes on BizHawk. I also had to stand in a weird spot during the affection spam and manipulate other NPCs to not spawn to reduce lag.

	": This run seems to be running into the same problem as 
	(__wikiLink|href=/5825S|implicitdisplaytext=5825S)
	", in that it's a non-standard category (marriage doesn't trigger credits, unlike 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=GBC "Girl mode"|href=/4213M)
	") that's lacking in positive audience response (68% at the time of judgement). All three responses in the thread, even the two Yes votes, mention that copious amounts of fast forwarding are needed for the beginning sleepfest to be watchable. The fact that only three responses were made is also telling in and of itself of a lack of reaction to the run. That's not to say this category will never be standard on the site, though: Given the nature of the Harvest Moon series, "marriage%" is probably the most major goal apart from getting the best evaluation possible when the game naturally ends (which would be 100% for us). Fastest marriage requires multiple criteria to be met, and needs proper routing, so I could potentially see it being an acceptable standard category for Harvest Moon games in the future. However, with the site in its current state of flux we're unlikely to discuss it anytime soon.
