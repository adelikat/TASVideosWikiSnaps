	" describes how the difficulty increases with each loop, but it's not so explicit on how difficulty increases after loop 8. However, it's evident to me from making this TAS that the fish on stage 2 definitely snap with increasing frequency up until the 10th loop.

	"In stage 1, you can jump into the cliff right before the bridge and get a big bounce off of it. If done correctly, you'll bounce back over the previous ledge and land on thin air. At this point, the game still thinks you can climb up the ledge beneath. Once you do so, you'll enter a glitched state where you can simply jump twice to the right, which will land you on top of the cliff past the waterfall.

	": I love taking on your submission, as they bring back lots of memories of that era.  In regards to the run, optimization looks really good. I checked a few places and you appear to have squeezed out everything. Some places look like they can be done faster, but there is the issue of waiting for the right moment. As for completion, you have rightly completed a full run...where level 10 ("!") repeats over and over...giving us a solid place of measurement. Another great work!
