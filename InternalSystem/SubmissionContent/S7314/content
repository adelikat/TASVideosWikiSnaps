	"The special reward fruit for clearing levels in the original game has been changed to the only one "♪".  "♪" appears where the first piece of gold is collected.
	$LF
	"The condition for "♪" to appear is not to kill the robot until the last gold is collected, that is, no robot rebirth.  
	$LF
	"The time limit for the existence of special rewards has been lifted, but the "♪" will disappear immediately if the robot is killed before it is collected. Of course, killing them after getting "♪" won't have this problem. 
	$LF
	"Because "♪" is a bonus element, which is different from the properties of gold, the conditions for collection are not as harsh as gold. Gold needs to be completely overlapped by the Runner to be collected.
