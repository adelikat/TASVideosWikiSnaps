]h2
[ul 
	[li 
		"There are 2 weapons: Machine Gun and Rocket Launcher. You can do melee attacks too.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"The Rocket Launcher is mainly used in this run because I can kill more than 1 enemy with 1 rocket.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Every corner, I try to be stuck for 1 or 2 frames against the wall while walking. This teleports me forward a few pixels, saving a lot of time.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"You can clip into a wall in your right by pressing Right Left and Up at the same time: But When you are on, you get stuck on exept if the wall is very thin.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"The camera follows you but you are a bit displaced compared to the camera when you do the corner strat or when you press R L and U at the same time, and it stacks each time you do it.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"The game sometimes lags: In 1 or 2 levels, this is due to the emulator (= The console) which drops a ton of frames, but on some other levels, this is because the game is very badly optimized.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"2 Players mode makes the game very laggy and slow ! That's not an emulation problem
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"When you plant a bomb, You are invincible for a while and you automaticly kill enemies when you approach them.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"The big bomb item kills all the enemies on screen and gives you a bit of invincibility, but this is very slow.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"On a few places, I've chosen to kill "useless" enemies. Sometimes there are not even in my way.
	$LF
	"I've killed them for various reasons. Mainly because they will move in a very problematic place and if I don't kill them at this moment, I will need to lose a ton of frames later to kill them.

	"-About Boss Fight:
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"On the path to kill the boss, there are invisible walls. To destroy them, you need 5 shots. 
	$LF
	"I had a lot of problems with the trigger which spawn the little robot at the end, I need them because if I can't kill them, I can't open the door to the end:
	$LF
	"I can go throught every door and go to the end but the enemies will not be here so I will be stuck so I need to open some of them to activate the trigger.
	$LF
	"I can kill the mad scientist when I want but same: Enemies will not spawn.
	$LF
	"Normally, In casual and 1 player I should use the big bomb to kill the enemies at the end but here, shooting on them is faster.

	": There's no solidarity on how this should be treated, so I'll apply my own vision. This run plays like a version of the 1P one, just slowed down and having one more screen to follow at once. I found it very hard to enjoy it, I even watched them room by room, side by side, and I see how much easier the 1P is to watch, follow and enjoy: it's faster paced, it doesn't demand spreading your eyes, and you can see all the glitches used clearly.

	"So if this run was slower, I'd reject it, but it's faster, so it can be vaulted, while the other one remains in Moons. There were people who liked it, but the votes don't quite agree, and I assume it's because of what I described above. So by entertainment level this run can't obsolete the other, because it doesn't have better content, and it can't be rejected, because it's faster, so I'm accepting it to Vault.
