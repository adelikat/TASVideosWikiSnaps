	"The glitch in the final level is interesting. Scrolling the screen in a peculiar way moves the elevators away from their places. I do this to access an elevator behind a wall. After that, I start floating 
	[em 
		"upwards
	]em
	" (this is the part with the long wait) to access another elevator that is located 
	[em 
		"below
	]em
	" (and also behind a wall). There is also some jumping inside the walls and other little details, which make this route possible. (You might get a better idea of what is happening, if you turn the graphics layer 3 off. 
	"[Make a savestate at 4:20:00, so you can watch that part again.]
	") I understand the glitch completely and know exactly what's happening at every moment. I could draw my route on a map easily (if someone provides a map), but it is hard to explain here. I suppose this glitch fits my style. :)
