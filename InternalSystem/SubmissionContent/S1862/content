[p 
	"About half of the improvement comes from better precision and faster boss fight strategies, the other half is due to a glitch in the last level.

	"Landing after a jump stops the screen scrolling for 1 frame, so usually jumping should be avoided. However, shooting/charging the weapon and moving forwards simultaneously is possible only in the air.
	$LF

[p 
	"If I shoot seemingly for nothing, it is for changing the character's hit box dimensions for more precise jumps.
	$LF

[p 
	"Most of the boss fights are not about killing the boss fast. Usually, it is more important to be in a good position after the fight. Also, the earliest frame you start charging the second shot is often more important than the frame the first shot hits the boss.

	"The glitch in the final level is interesting. Scrolling the screen in a peculiar way moves the elevators away from their places. I do this to access an elevator behind a wall. After that, I start floating 
	[em 
		"upwards
	]em
	" (this is the part with the long wait) to access another elevator that is located 
	[em 
		"below
	]em
	" (and also behind a wall). There is also some jumping inside the walls and other little details, which make this route possible. (You might get a better idea of what is happening, if you turn the graphics layer 3 off. 
	"[Make a savestate at 4:20:00, so you can watch that part again.]
	") I understand the glitch completely and know exactly what's happening at every moment. I could draw my route on a map easily (if someone provides a map), but it is hard to explain here. I suppose this glitch fits my style. :)

	"There are many ways to end the input. I finish the final boss with the dragon spell. This prolongs the actual ending a few seconds, but allows ending input early and is stylistically more interesting, because it shows the dragon spell.
