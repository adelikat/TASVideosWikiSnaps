	"Skooter is an ordinary kid. He enjoys things like basketball, skateboarding and hanging out with his best friends. Nothing too exciting. Until one day, when he found a strange, old coin on the ground. This coin was small but heavy, with strange markings in another language on it. Obviously he could not read the markings, but he really wanted to know what they meant. He put the coin under his pillow for safe-keeping. Every day after school, he would visit the library and read book after book looking for any information about the strange old coin he had discovered. But nothing. All this time, Skooter had also been having some psychadelic dreams. In them, he would see himself traveling through strange and colorful worlds by himself. But in every dream, bizarre creatures would try to prevent him from progressing further in his quests. Skooter realized quite soon that these dreams had to have something to do with the coin under his pillow. It took him weeks, but Skooter found the book he was looking for. It was titled "The Legend of the Treasure Master". The book was the story of a man named Ocsiban, who spoke of a magnificent treasure that could be

That night, the dreams were no longer an illusion. He had begun an adventure which would take him to the most fantastic places in his imagination. He had begun the quest to become a Treasure Master.
