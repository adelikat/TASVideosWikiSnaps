	"Thanks goes out to Matt Turk (MTPO console performance GOD) for a discovery to improve the Mr. Sandman fight.  He discovered that a well timed dodge before his "sleeper" pattern will cause him to not delay but rather begin the punches immediately as he flashes.  This is done both times he does this pattern.  As a result, the clock time for this fight is lowered to 2:18.00 (instead of 2:19.00) and saves 32 frames in real time.
	$LF

[p 
	"Like my previous runs this does not use the "cs glitch" and aims for the lowest in-game clock time as the #1 priority. As a secondary goal, it aims for the fastest real time when it does not conflict with goal #1.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"(Note: the game clock pauses when ever you deliver an uppercut or a stunned punch, therefore a lowest clock-time strategy not only strives for fastest punches but also tries to maximize the amount of time the clock is stopped, therefore the fastest strategy isn't always the fastest in real time).
