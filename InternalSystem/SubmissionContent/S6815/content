	"The published run has been known to be improvable for years now, considering it was beaten significantly by real-time runs not long after it was made. In late 2015, I stupidly submitted my own improvement to the published run, oblivious to the real-time Dash Galaxy community. Even though I saved 10 seconds, it wasn't good enough because I missed all the new strategies, so I canned it. No one else seems interested in this game, so the current run just sat there improvable. Not like anyone really cared, because this game is an abomination.

	"With my first TAS, I essentially optimized the route CtrlAltDestroy took in his run, but I missed that new routes had been found near the end of the game. I also missed a glitch that allows you to perform a buggy warp into levels if you hold left while entering certain rooms, which is a big timesaver in the game's last few levels. Also, I thought I was a genius for finding out that pressing select when entering elevators depletes your oxygen before the score countdown. Turns out this was already known, and I didn't know it could be used to save time when entering levels. Whoops.

	"A few days ago, I looked at my old run and thought "Huh. You know, outside of all the shit I missed, this really isn't bad." So I sat down and started surgically attaching improvements to it. And now we finally have an up-to-date TAS of Dash Galaxy to display "proudly" on the site. There was no rejoicing. More like Trash Galaxy.
