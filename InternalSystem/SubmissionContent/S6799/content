[div class=p 
	"Both are major glitches I found in august 2018. TheRedHotBr has it all figured out in IT terms recently. (I know very little about informatics outside of ram addresses and a few of lua scripting).
	$LF
	"Basically, NMZ, is a zone that isn’t covered in “mask grabs”, when the game detects you’re in a zone too advanced to drive on. In every track, if you were to fly (with some ram address poke testing), you can drop down behind the goal, but the lap wont count if you’re too close to it (for the progression value that is just like if you drove backwards). 
	$LF
	"However, just behind this “pre-goal-zone” I just introduced, on Papu’s Pyramid there’s another one that isn’t a mask grab polygon nor a pre goal zone. As a result, if you drive at least after the first checkpoint of the track, you are allowed to land there, and end the lap. This polygon on Papu’s pyramid is VERY hard to reach: you need to use ceRTAin techs to perform it RTA. It’s only used in the time trials community, only a few of us managed to get it (not with the tech I’m using in this TAS, which is to impossible for a human: I will explain this soon when introducing OOB terrain.)
	$LF
	"There are a grand total of 5 NMZs in the game, 2 of which are debatable(Cove and Arena):

[div class=p 
	"To explain why, I need to introduce the Startline glitch.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The startline glitch is basically the game progression value that overflows. This lets you drop down a bit after the goal and start the lap later, normally.
	$LF
	"The game keeps track of the kart movements in 2 ways: checkpoint and progression value.
	$LF
	"The checkpoint value is just an address that decreases his number the more of the track you drive, towards the end.
	$LF
	"The progression value relies on the checkpoint one; when you go out of bounds (there are oob sections that you can drive on) the checkpoint value wont update. The tech consists in leaving the track when being close to the last checkpoint of the lap, so that the progression value overflows when crossing the goal while being out of bounds, (otherwise if you go oob too early the progression value will stop decreasing before you even reach the goal), then you can drop down back on the track where mask grabs are allowed (first checkpoint of the track for example), and so, you can start the lap a few seconds later.
	$LF
	"What happened in Oxide Station and Tiny Arena is a result of an extended (or reversed?) version of the startline glitch. I did it on tiny arena without knowing what actually caused it 6 months ago, when I discovered it. Basically the concept is the same, but we’re dropping a bit before the end of the track, STILL overflowing the progression value, and since there aren’t mask grabs there as well, you’re allowed to land. This is pretty much track breaking, but it doesn’t work anywhere. So far I managed to replicate it only on Oxide Station, Tiny Arena and Hot Air Skyway(HAS). On HAS it’s impossible outside of ram testing, due to the lack of OOB’s to make it real. 
	$LF
	"Which leads me to the last point: Crash Cove. This track completely changes the progression value wherever you cross the goal, even when you’re really far from it (eg: on the wooden bridge). This is the logic that prevents a lot of glitches anywhere (so you don’t just drive backwards and end the lap), however, what happens here is that I’m dropping down the track AFTER crossing the goal in the correct driving sense, (just before falling). So the game updated the progression value, BUT, then it has to respawn me on my last known checkpoint, which is? Just before the goal. So the progression value updates again, because for the game, I did not drive backwards the goal. The game just respawned me there. This works in every track, but usually there are mask grabs to prevent this from happening, thanks to the checkpoint system. Unfortunately for crash cove, there is a very, very tiny section of a polygon not covered in this, and we fall on it after the drop, without being infinitely respawned by the mask (the game realized you’re first and you should spawn there, but you don’t have the checkpoints). I'll explain more on crash cove later.

I can keep temporary speed with bunny hop (aka Froggy). We have many theories about why corner SG's are a thing, but no one really knows why they exist. It might be due to the Z falling speed being interrupted by a corner and transforming it into XZ speed, or something else. I’ve read some comments from Amaraticando on old topics that some pixels on the corners, zoomed in, might indeed be interpreted as big downhills, giving speed as the game physics usually does. The bad news, is that this is FPS-dependent (in PAL this is much easier and the SG's last a lot more time), and also relies on LAG. This is not a consistent bug AT ALL, not even in TAS. There are so many variables no one knows about, that makes it close to impossible to manipulate perfectly. Even when having the exact angle on the same XYZ, you might not be able to trigger a speed boost during another lap or race on the same tracks. Having Tiny as a character and using NTSC-U (30fps), made this an absolute hell.

	"So far there are quite a few. For starters, we found just recently, by poking the value that affects frames intervals, (static and drawn) that increasing fps does indeed make some techs harder by a lot. Sg's are weaker, way harder to get aswell. We don't have an answer, my only guess is that PAL having 25 fps has a less accurate elaboration of data in those short intervals of inputs. FPS difference affects jump height aswell, playing a pretty big difference in froggy effectiveness. Wall climbs shortcuts, corner sg's, sewer speedway wall sg's, are WAY easier and stronger in PAL.

It’s not used in this run cause that’s useless, takes too much time to build up and the only pro of it, is having infinite fire for the race, as long as you don’t hit square.

That glitch alone could allow to beat the game in a matter of less than 10% of the duration of this movie, overshadowing all the other tricks and glitches, and result much less entertaining. So it should be considered as a different branch, as fastest completion. Instead, beating this game without using the wrong warp glitch, as in this submission, counts as the most common goal for this game, which we also call the "trunk", from which all the other "branch" goals are derived.
