	"On a quest to stop Nosferatu and his reign of terror, Kyle races to save his fair maiden Erin. Many obstacles lay ahead, but Kyle has no remorse for those in his path.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Improvements are usually easier to do than TASing something from scratch, so, I'd like to thank Zurreco and FODA for their runs, even with all the new tricks a lot of their strategies and routes can still be seen in this run.

	" Power Punch

[p 
	"Initiate any combo, after the second hit press down for one frame, wait nine frames then press forward+Y.
	$LF

[h4 
	" Run Delay
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Just tap the control pad twice, wait for Kyle to build up some speed then hold the desired direction, this is the base of the other tricks used in this run.  
	$LF

[h4 
	" Fall Through Floor
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Do the above trick near a ledge and then jump, you can keep jumping as needed, but you can't turn around, bump or take damage, also the platforms must be at the same level.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Invisible Platforms
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Sometimes Kyle will grab on an invisible platform while falling through the floor, when this happens, if you can hoist him he can do the following tricks;
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Teleport
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Pressing the Y button while Kyle is on an invisible platform will teleport him to the nearest platform in front of him, pressing forward will teleport him to the nearest platform behind him.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Blind Play
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The camera will not follow Kyle if the nearest platform is off screen, the good thing is that some enemies or traps will not hurt him, also rotten platforms and doors work as they should.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Enter Walls
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"If there's a wall instead of a platform near Kyle, he will be put inside that wall, press the Y button to enter further onto the wall then jump to be ejected on the other side.

	"The strategy to avoid those red crystals made a big difference in this stage, the run delay trick and some small optimizations also did.

[h4 
	" Boss - Werewolf
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Normally Kyle would have to collect 9 red crystals to finish a combo with a power punch, but not on this TAS.

	"I was testing the run delay trick here when I found the fall through floor glitch, sadly it couldn't save time in this stage.
	$LF

[h4 
	" Boss - Twin Orangutans
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Almost the same strategy was used to defeat the orangutans, the power punch sped up the process a little bit.

	" Mansion
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The fall through floor glitch saved quite some time here, it was even possible to choose a shorter path using the glitch.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Boss - Zombie Vampire
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The first phase of the fight is pretty straight forward, but the zombie's head is kinda hard to manipulate.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Dungeon 2
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The blind play trick didn't save any time here, but the axe at the end of the stage can't hurt Kyle while the giltch is active.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Boss - Phantom
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Take damage on a boss battle is something that I particularly don't like to watch, but it saved a pretty good amount of time, so.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"I did  a test run of this stage using the fall through floor glitch to access the alternative door, but it is slower.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Boss - Rock Titan
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"His big foot animation is kinda long, so manipulating the boss to not transform more than once made this battle a lot faster.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Final Stage
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"A lot of small, hardly noticeable optimizations to save time here, but the fall through floor glitch proved to be a big time saver.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Boss - Nosferatu
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This boss is kinda simple to manipulate in the first phase of the fight, but things get ugly when he transforms into a bat.
