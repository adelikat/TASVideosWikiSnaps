	"Ninja Gaiden for Game Gear is quite unlike that of the NES version or even its cousin on the Master System.  It has a similar (but simpler) feel as the Master System version, but has the wall climbing element of the NES game.  I chose this game because I wanted to TAS a Game Gear game, and ninjas are always cool.  I thought it was a decent game for TASing though not as spectacular as the ones for SMS/NES.
