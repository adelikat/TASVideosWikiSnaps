	"Ninja Gaiden for Game Gear is quite unlike that of the NES version or even its cousin on the Master System.  It has a similar (but simpler) feel as the Master System version, but has the wall climbing element of the NES game.  I chose this game because I wanted to TAS a Game Gear game, and ninjas are always cool.  I thought it was a decent game for TASing though not as spectacular as the ones for SMS/NES.

	"I used Dega 1.16 with the Mame Core to make this movie.  After figuring out that is requires python 2.4/2.5 and not 3.1 (shakes fist) in order to run python scripting I used its built in Ram Monitoring feature to find and monitor these addresses:

	"There weren't any noteworthy tricks/glitches to mention here.  Special weapon maintenance is the key to this TAS.  Bosses receive 2hp of damage instead of 1 with special weapons, so managing which weapons I have and conserving force are critical to optimizing.

[p 
	"The final boss has 3 forms.  The first 2 forms can be exploited to conserve special weapon power.  If you do a regular attack, there's a small frame window where you can do a special attack that causes the regular attack to do 2 damage AND hit the boss for 2 more.

	"SonikKustar for suggesting this game.  I assumed it was the same as the SMS one that I already TASed but it was an entirely new game.  I would have never tried it if he hadn't mentioned it!
