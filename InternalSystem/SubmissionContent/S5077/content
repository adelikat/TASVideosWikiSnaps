	"This is a 79 frame improvement over my previous TAS (
	(__wikiLink|/3847S|3847S)
	") resulting from changing the damage boosts, better lag management and RNG management, fixing an oversight of 16 frames that all previous TASes had, and a new route that rescues the building 1 rooftop prisoner instead of the one in floor 1 of building 2.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The reason I started this was that I noticed that I could save a lag frame early in the TAS, so I set out to reduce lag in the run since it could be done quickly with hex editing.  Then I found a damage boost change, which meant that I had to change parts of the TAS because of different timing, then I realized that because the timing changed there could be additional improvements, so this ended up taking a very long time from testing many things.  I was originally hoping that I could get a time under 22:27, and that goal was obtained just over halfway through the TAS.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The new way of reducing lag is by delaying frames that are recovered by having less delay at the door's frame rule, making no frames lost by the delay.  But if the delay changes the amount fadeout lag, then it saves frames, usually 1.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I found a new way to manipulate the spawn timer by a small amount.  Using a camera alert to reset the spawn timer was already known, as was the fact that when an enemy spawns, it sets the timer to a small value, so avoiding a new spawn affects the timer by about that amount.  The new discovery is that there are some rooms where the spawn timer does not count down, usually boss rooms.  The one used here is Arnold's room because the left side is not a door, which allows for many possible y positions on entry, and thus it can allow the timer to run down less or more depending on the need without losing frames.  Also delaying on a screen that counts down, and then reducing the delay on the door's frame rule in a room that does not count down the spawn timer makes the counter count down extra by the delay without losing time.  This is only useful to manipulate a couple of spawn timer values.
	$LF

[p 
	"I also found a new glitch that I call the weapon vector glitch.  This is done by going into a menu when a weapon has been shot and is still active (not doing the explosion animation).  This keeps the velocity vector of the previous shot from being overwritten, so the next shot can be shot at an angle or a different direction depending on the weapon used before the menu (switching weapons can be done as well for different effects).  I doubt this glitch will end up being useful in a 100%, but it is funny.  I demonstrate this glitch one time in the TAS.

				"Slightly different path to keep the lag the same.  I could not improve the lag in this screen, but at least it wasn't worse.  Apparently the lag in the screen transition from the 4 guard screen to the screen to the right is dependent on the universal timer when entering the 4 guard screen.  It is on a repeating pattern of (8)/2/(2)/2/(2)/8/(2)/2/(2)/2, where the numbers in parenthensis have 3 extra lag frames.  This route does not have extra lag, but there was another route that switches weapons in the room where the equipment is recovered, and saves 4 frames there, but it had 3 lag here that could not be removed, so it ended up being the same as this route.  But there were other timing reasons why I used the route I did.

There was an extra damage in the NW room by manipulating the guard at the top of the screen to run downwards, which could have been used to take quick damage (cooperative universal timer), but it was slower than the one later on.  In the room before Twin Shot, the quick damage was done, but for less damage than the previous one.  Then some damage was taken on Twin Shot, but the amount of damage had to be balanced with the quick damage on the previous screen.  Although the actual route on the rooftop is longer (and with more lag frames) by 2 frames, it ends being 2 frames faster overall, plus more later because there will be an extra HP and grenade later on by not rescuing the other prisoner, and 2 frames because skipping the prisoner had a better door frame rule.  Any future improvements will need to see if this route is still faster, which it will likely be.

This causes extra lag frames on the menu (the least is when entering the tank screen), making it take longer, but if done at the right time, it will reduce the massive lag when changing screens, in this case saving 6 frames total over the previous TAS.  Like the previous TAS, only 1 damage is taken, which is fortunate.  Taking an unwanted damage costs 3 frames.  There is a 3 frame window every 16 frames where 1 damage is possible (the ones that delay the first bullet for the longest time).  Fortunately there 4 x positions that can be used to enter the screen increasing the chance of entering within the window, and switching equipment will also affect this.

				"Hell room is the end point of all the branches to see if I could get the proper timing for my new idea.  Luckily one of them worked out, and stayed working even after all the revisions changing things earlier in the TAS.  The new idea is using a grenade to kill a guard and a spawn right after the spawn timer resets to 255 so that I have a little more than 4 seconds where lag is not a big concern because of 2 guards on the screen.  It was a very tight fit for the timing, but worked (even after revisions).  I had to delay 1 frame to get the setup, which will be recovered at the door to Arnold, but the end result is no lag frames at all in hell room finally, which is an improvement of 6 lag frames!

Even though some time is lost before the second shot on Coward Duck from not being in position as soon as possible, it was made up by being able to die sooner because of less walking to the pit, and the extra height means that the prisoner can be shot quicker because the rocket doesn't have to travel as far.

There is also a way to beat Big Boss 8 frames earlier by being further to the left before shooting the second to last shot, but it requires an extra hit point.  I tried testing all the paths in the basement to get an extra hit point, but none of them could get the 1 frame starting timing.
