First, to be able to get to its room, you must destroy the shuttles infront of it, and they can only be destroyed with combo Plasma + Wave + Ice Beam, therefore you have to get all 3 Unknown Items and Gravity Suit. Second, you have to do X-Ray climb up, Crystal Flash and carefully space jump (or bomb jump) above 1-way brige!
