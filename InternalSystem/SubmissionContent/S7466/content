	"Tower of Doom was originally set to be the third AD&D title on the Intellivision with the working title "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Tower of Mystery". The game was only half complete when Mattel Electronics folded in 1984. INTV Corp resumed work on the game in 1986. Not wanting to pay for a renewed D&D license, the game was released under the new name, "Tower of Doom".

	"Hand-to-hand combat in this game is slow so we opt for long-range attacks only with whatever we happen to find along the way. The weapon used ended up being the 3rd most resilient (orange) bow and arrow. The amount of damage an enemy takes from a weapon hit such as this is randomly-determined by the frame. Attacks are therefore meticulously timed to max out their damage.

	"Now, weapons can also be used to manipulate luck. Generally, firing two weapon shots will advance RNG by one pattern. The weapon can be fired at a wall, at an enemy, really anywhere. This strat reduces the amount of frames we had to waste waiting for exit stairs to spawn in a convenient location.

	"It is fastest to equip an item from the second slot in your pack, so why did I take the extra time to equip the orange bow instead of the green spear on level 3? A green item is only allowed to downgrade once, while an orange one can downgrade five times before disappearing. If you look at Levels 11, 17, and 31 you will notice these are levels where I intentionally downgraded the color of the bow. This was because it was absolutely necessary I fire the weapon on one of these "bad downgrade" frames in order to get a really good luck pattern that would save a considerable number of frames each. Choosing the higher weapon level therefore proved to be faster than selecting the closer weapon in the inventory.
