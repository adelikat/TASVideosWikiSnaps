	"Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is a side-scrolling beat 'em up with charming sprites and beautiful animations released in 2005 for the GBA and the NDS. Since this was one of the games I loved playing in my childhood and it had a huge potential due to a huge skip I decided to make a TAS for this game, and a few RTA viable skips and tricks have been found along the way.

In these cases, it is important in what order we kill them. The droid that gets replaced more often mostly has the highest priority to get eliminated. Also, one can see that strong attacks can destroy multiple droids at once. The setup for that is a bit special. If one hits both of them at the same time, only one gets destroyed. For both, there has to be some time between the hits, e.g., one gets hit at the beginning of the motion, one at the end of it.

Holding r while taking damage results in more damage than normal. After taking damage one enters a small invincibility state. Therefore, the character gets damaged in waves. The hit on the first screen allows dying in one wave less. Moving with the bars in the invincibility state speeds up taking damage a bit by optimally positioning Obi-Wan.

Somehow, the game thinks the progress made with Obi-Wan should be applied to Anakin as well. And because we unlocked a level with Obi-Wan, which is unobtainable for Anakin, the game thinks that every level has been unlocked, thus we can just proceed to the final boss fight. Sadly, this trick only works with Obi-Wan. If we do the trick reversed by starting with Anakin and selecting Obi-Wan after dying in the fifth level, we can only enter the fifth Anakin level with Obi-Wan and we get soft locked.

The dodging is only for showing off but it saves no time. Doing an intentionally blocked hit as seen in the Darth Tyranus fight is slower. The combination of two L+B, one U+B, and two L+B again is the fastest method to chain five strong hits consecutively. The good thing is that these strong moves do not bring Obi-Wan to fall which would make him invincible until his next attack. One can not hit Obi-Wan more than five times. Somehow the animation from Obi-Wan's last attack gets canceled if Anakin does a small left-tab.

It is in fact hard to define when the game ends, thus we rely on a convention. Early speedruns ended after the final hit has been delivered, later runs have used the white flash after the fight as it is a nice visual indicator. This is the current convention. Technically, this is not the point of loss-of-control. This point is hard to define as well. For example, the scenic images after Palpatine's appearance disappear faster by pressing A but will disappear on their own. The ending is also hard to define since it could be the congratulation screen, when successfully saved, or when the credits appear.
