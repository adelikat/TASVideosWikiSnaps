At the very end I am able to start a J-bomb stomp above ground and finish over water. If you can catch the boat at the highest possible point while it's bobbing up and down you can actually destroy it with the J-bomb. I go right into another great trick where I can exit the vehicle straight into water.

Second, you no longer have to move boats, blocks, or trains to cover gaps in the carrier's path. You only need to destroy the buildings. And lastly, you don't have to make it to the semi-truck in order to end the level. The instant the last building is destroyed the level ends.
