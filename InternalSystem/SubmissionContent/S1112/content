	"This Japanese action RPG Kamen no Ninja - Akakage (Masked Ninja - Red Shadow) is fairly easy to play, but for the first timer it is very confusing. Some of the bosses are really stubborn. It took me quite an ordeal to kill them fast enough, specially the condors, they are really a pain.

	"The point of the game is to gather the three pieces of map to open up the secret way to the Devil Island. I get to have five uses of the female (blue ninja) because she can walk fast.
