	"At first, I was merely testing VBA-rr, but for some reason I happened to become improving my old attempt on this game. I was satisfied with the quality of the result, and decided to submit it here to fill up the submission queue. That's how this submission arrived here.

	"Weather, enemy spawns, way-blocking-tussock respawns and a few texts are random in the game, and they were all manipulated in the movie. Lags couldn't a big problem as long as I were moving, because the movement wouldn't be interrupted with lags. However, movements are a bit weird in this game. If you are neither making the screen to scroll, nor walking in a certain diagonal direction at any corner of the map, you'll have one extra frame of pause during the movement. That's why I walked in many zigzag paths in the movie.

	"There are two interesting tricks used in this movie. The first one is that you can skip a scripted event or map exit by restarting the game right before stepping onto the triggering tile. When the game restarts, you are already standing on the tile, so that you can continue walking to the next tile. It is worth mentioning that most of the time, you can't get out of bounds because there are many glitched obstacles (they are actually the very obstacles on your screen area, offset by 256 pixels or so) right along the map boundaries. And even if you can, you need get back inside the bounds via an exit to do anything useful, which usually costs you longer to walk around the glitched obstacles.

	"This restart trick was used twice in the movie, to skip a cutscene in front of the cabin and to get out of bounds of the map for a shortcut, which was supposed to be unlocked with the Axe equipement that would be available on the other end of this shortcut. The shortcut allowed me to skip the first cave, but I could not return to the beach through it because it wasn't unlocked, and there is no way to glitch onto it from that end.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The other interesting trick is to abuse the S.O.S.-sign-setting event to skip a bounder that was intended to be moved from the other side. This trick enabled a shortcut connecting the cabin and the beach, which I took for 3 times.
