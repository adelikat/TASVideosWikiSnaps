I actually jump off the spawn platform 2 frames earlier than I have to, because when you do a jump during your coyote frames, you actually get less height. I can use this to my advantage later in the TAS, but here I want to avoid doing that so I can jump farther.

You can avoid this by either jumping off the spawn platform or interrupting your fall on any of the platforms between the top and bottom ones. Both of these methods lose a lot of time, so I instead spawn an orange boxman the frame before I die. Because the orange boxmen run slower than the blue one, this strategy only saves one frame if done perfectly.

This makes it so that I have a very tight window to throw the second boxman, because it has to be aligned on a specific pixel in order to make the jump across. It's possible to do a cornerboost on the platform with the face on it, but in order to do it you have to jump later, so it saves no time.

	"This level has some fun tricks in it. I start by placing a sitting boxman while my momentum carries me off the platform. The boxman ends up falling off, while I turn around and clip back up onto the platform. I then press jump, crouch, and shift at the same time. This allows me to spawn a sitting boxman in midair, when you can normally only spawn running boxmen when in the air. You can't place more boxmen when you're overlapping with one, so the jump skips waiting for the first boxman to fall all the way down. I then start holding left and spawn a running boxman, which will run around and under the platform and eventually hit all the levers on the right side of the level. From there, I have an extremely limited time to make it past the walls of spikes before the boxman hits the levers, blocking off the path. In order to make it in time, I do a zip. In certain circumstances, it's possible to clip into the ground like in level 5 if there's a low ceiling. Fortunately, the layout of level 10 allows me to clip, pushing me to the right so I can turn around instantly. From there, I do frame perfect jumps over all the ledges, and do a wiggle on the fourth ledge to get a faster turnaround. This level was hard to optimize, but also very fun :)

	"This was the single hardest level to optimize in the entire game, and for a while I didn't even know how to approach it. I start by doing a midair jump. You need to throw five boxmen over the edge in order to get the generator running long enough to move the platform high enough. When you spawn into a stage, you have coyote frames and can jump in midair. I do a late midair jump to get a low jump height, which allows me to land back on the ground sooner than buffering a jump. I can only throw one boxman during this time, so I do two more jumps, throwing two boxmen per jump in order to get to five. I throw the last boxman from as far away as possible, with rightward momentum to make the turnaround quicker and get to the goal sooner. I use my sixth boxman to jump into the goal, since the low ceiling makes it impossible to reach the goal otherwise.

	"Use Boxmen has an autoscroller! There are three parts where you can save time here. First, I run and spawn the boxman as far right as possible before turning around and standing on the button to prevent it from dying. Second, I do some jumps to manipulate the cycle the boxman is on. The jumps have to be timed frame perfectly. A frame earlier, and it has no effect on the boxman. A frame later, and the boxman stops activating the generator briefly, which loses a LOT of time. Stepping off the generator for even a frame causes it to accelerate much slower, meaning you have to spend even longer on it. The third place I save time is running off the final button and turning around to get to the goal quickly.

		" I believe that a more skilled TASer than me could save up to 5 frames in level 11. You can save three frames by doing a last frame coyote jump to re-land on the ground sooner. I tried to do this, but no matter how much stuff I tested I couldn't get two boxmen to survive without waiting for the first boxman to move out of the way. If you did get this strat to work, it would also save an additional frame by causing the platform to rise higher, allowing you to jump into the goal without needing the sixth boxman. I also think the turnaround can be improved.
