	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"This run is 531 frames (about 8.8 seconds) faster than the first (oh, and that was no WIP run). The difference is
	$LF
	"mainly due to some new tricks and better application of known tricks. Also lag optimization shaved some frames.
	$LF
]p
[h2 
	" Tricks
	$LF
]h2
[h3 
	" Speed physics:
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The game keeps internal speed, which is related to visible speed by a lookup table having 160 entries.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"How high the game allows the speed to rise depends on conditions (downhill, flat ground without boots, flat ground with
	$LF
	"boots, uphill).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If maximum speed is exceeded, Speedy just won't accelerate more, the speed does not decrease.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Overshoot into hill
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Sometimes it is better to overshoot a turn in order to land further on slope, giving higher final speed.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Undershoot into hill
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Sometimes it is better to undershoot trampoline jumps so you land on start of hill, giving greater final speed.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Speed locking
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The table values in speed table are not monotonous. Some higher internal speeds are really slower than lower ones.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If you don't have speed boots and are in downslope, by hitting jump or attack two frames before visible speed flashes
	$LF
	"to higher value, it is possible to keep that value.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This is only useful if it allows you to keep higher speed than what fully running the hill down would.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Speed table overflow
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The code that increases speed in downslope is special. It just checks if the speed is 150, incrementing the speed by 1
	$LF
	"if not. However, if Speedy already has 151 speed, the speed increments without bound (by 2 every frame).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"However, when speed reaches 161, the code attempts to read outside the speed table, reading garbage. It loads 15 from
	$LF
	"there, causing speed to increase to 15px per frame, which is over twice what is normally possible.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"But the speed will still increase. However, next up it increases to 163. Now the loaded value is 75, giving speed of
	$LF
	"75px/frame. The speed is so great that Speedy is forcibly ripped off the slope and shoots forwards at great speed.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Briefly tapping the opposite direction drops speedy off this hyperspeed.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Currently the only known way to get 151 speed is via pneumatic pipes in Galatical Galaxies. Those things spit you at
	$LF
	"that speed.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Running on moving platforms
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The speed of Speedy is relative to surface, so if surface is moving (moving platforms/conveyors, the speed of surface
	$LF
	"is added/subtracted.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"For this reason, if platforms moves the wrong way, it should be jumped off as soon as possible, but if it is moving the
	$LF
	"right way, it should be run on as long as possible.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Lag elimination via attack
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"One may be able to remove lag frames by attacking (just make sure the attack won't hit anything!) at suitable times.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Attack as jump
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Attack also can double as very short jump. This is useful in some close quaters (again, don't hit anything).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Also, attack is often less laggy than jump.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Modifying hitbox via attack
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Also, attack can subtly modify Speedy's hitbox. This is usually useless, but if there is very narrow margin between
	$LF
	"success and failure, it might just make the difference between success and failure.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Vertical zipping
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Certain types of edges zip you upwards if you hit slightly below the top. This also has effect of resetting or at least
	$LF
	"greatly reducing Speedy's vertical speed (which is useful).
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Horizontal zipping
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"If you can get inside a wall, autofiring left+right causes you to zip at 5px per frame. There is only one place where
	$LF
	"this is known possible (Galatical Galaxies Part 1, where the magnet picks the platform) and there are better ways
	$LF
	"to do that part anyway.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Taking damage
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"There is no damage knockback, so taking damage has no pretty much no speed penalty (except finding best spots to take
	$LF
	"damage).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"However, there is attack knockback if enemy doesn't die (and lesser one even if it dies).
	$LF
]p

	" HP mechanics
	$LF
]h3
[ul

]ul
[h3 
	" Speed reset via wall
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Slamming into a wall resets your horizontal momentum but not vertical momentum. This is useful if you need to turn
	$LF
	"quickly after jump to ledge.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This is also useful if you need to turn and there is wall just behind.
