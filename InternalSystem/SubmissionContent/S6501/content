Per the intro of a map "Eliminate as many Ganados as you can before your evac chopper arrives!  Successive kills will result in earning you more points!"  Initially only Leon is selectable.  There are four other characters playable when unlocked after scoring 30000+ points in one of the four (unofficially named) maps:

It is the fastest and weakest gun, quick to draw and lower.  It's effective for getting critical headshots against Ganados, and stunning Ganados for melee attacks or follow-up shots (Not used in this run due to time constraints). It cannot shoot through any enemies.
