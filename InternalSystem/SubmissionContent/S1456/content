	"In this movie we watch Spiderman act more like Superman, dodging bullets, not losing any health, and flying (well, swinging anyway) through the air, not to mention turning many infamous villains into whimpering children. This movie obsoletes the previous movie by Neofix by slightly over 1 minute.

	"I used Gens version 9Z Build Version 20070209, with Allow U/D+L/R, although I didn’t find any ways to abuse this. No warps or passwords. I first and foremost aimed for maximum speed, with taking no damage as a secondary goal.

	"This is actually version 2 of this run; I completed the first version in around 4000 rerecords, but I found an improvement on the first level. Hex-editing for this game is a total nightmare due to dead frames causing desynchs, but even though it cost me another 1500 rerecords, I managed to save another 10 seconds spread throughout the levels, so it was worth it. Improvements are many and varied. A lot of time saved came from beating the bosses faster due to Spiderman’s kick being more powerful than his webbing, which was used extensively in the previous run. More optimal web swinging, improved tactics, and lag reduction at the end of levels also played a part. Here’s a breakdown of my level split times compared to Neofix:

	"The most frustrating part about this game was it’s ungodly like ability to desynch during hex-editing. It always chose the most inopportune times to add in a dead frame, especially during the Lizard and Venom fight. I can imagine another run of this game maybe taking off 5 or 6 more seconds due to velocity control (ie through a RAM viewer), but it better be done right the first time around. Anyway, I hope you like this as a much needed improvement to one of the oldest (and least optimized) runs on the site. Happy viewing!
