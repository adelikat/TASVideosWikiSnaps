	"+ the making of the movie wasn't too hard. the game is played at the default normal difficulty, and being that i know this game like the back of my hand anyway; it only makes the run easier to do. there are a few instances in game where i take a hit for speed or to boost me to a platform. in order to properly beat loki, you must play the game twice, which would make for a very long movie.
