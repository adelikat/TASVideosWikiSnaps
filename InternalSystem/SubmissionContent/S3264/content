	"The route in this run is the same as the obsolete movies (it must be the best route).
	$LF
	"One glitch was abused in this run. When reach the goal of a stage, it will delay for a long time. If there is a frog at the goal, there will be a shorter delay. In fact, the glitch has happened for twice in Baxter's run (maybe by accident). We also saved some time in other ways, such as to manipulate luck to make the boss in Level-2 stop hiding as soon as possoble.
