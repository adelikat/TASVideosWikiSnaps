	"The Lawnmower Man was a game based on the 1992 movie of the same name. It features impressive graphics and effects for the time, to mimic the virtual reality scenes from the movie. Although the game was released on multiple consoles including the SNES, the Genesis / Megadrive version is vastly different and should be considered a completely different speedgame.
	$LF
	"This TAS completes the game on the hard difficulty. The hard difficulty gives you less health and makes the enemies take more hits. While a frustrating difficulty to play normally, the hard difficulty was used as that is generally the standard for TASes and also because it leads to more interesting boss strategies due to the fights lasting longer. A possible 100% category would complete all of the terminal puzzles to get 100% on the end screen, but this TAS does not complete any terminals, so falls under an “any%” category.
	$LF
	"The game is split up into half virtual reality sections and half platforming sections. At first glance, it looks like a bad speedgame because the virtual reality sections are autoscrollers. However, the platforming sections have extremely interesting tech that makes up for it. Furthermore, some of the virtual reality sections have bits where you need to stop and kill enemies before moving on, making it possible to save or lose time, and not completely be an autoscroller.

	"The line shaped dotty shot is hilariously bad if you’re playing casually or doing an RTA speedrun. This is because it does a tiny 2 damage per shot and it doesn’t shoot in a straight line forward (it flies up eventually). But it has the unique feature, that it will deal 10 damage rather than 2 if your gun hitbox is inside the enemy you are attacking. Furthermore, if your gun hitbox is inside 2 enemies, it deals 10 damage to each. This is useful, for example in the cube boss where you can attack two at a time, dealing 20 total damage every 11 frames, vs the next best gun (circle) which deals 9 damage every 17 frames. The big downside of the dotty shot is that it’s hard to kill normal enemies, due to the sporadic firing direction. 
	$LF
	"Generally, RTA will use the big circle shot. This is realistically the best one for RTA, as it is unlikely that they can consistently get their gun inside bosses. But for TAS, it makes sense to get the dotty shot ASAP, purely based on DPS.

There is another quick gun upgrade before the bike in level 2, but it only upgrades your gun to 3 bullets, unlike the 4 bullet upgrade in level 1. Because of this, the TAS completes level 1 normally.

I keep to the left so that I can fire earlier, as firing the car up close means I have to wait until it’s on screen to fire. It’s important to have the correct distance from the car when firing the charge shot since it will do different damage amounts depending how many frames the charge shot beam makes contact with the car. It’s also important to duck when shooting the car.

	"One main goal of the level is to get the cyber suit. This is achieved by getting enough disc collectables and filling up the red bit of the bar on the top left of the screen. The cybersuit allows you to jump slightly higher, skipping a small section after the car by jumping straight onto the library. Getting enough discs is difficult, since they aren’t collectible until a short wait after they spawn. This means I had to stay and collect some from the car before moving on.

	"The pumps have 3 phases: the hoses, the bases and the fire man. The hoses are the hardest and I try to line them up together to hit both of them with a charge shot as much as possible.

Fighting one base at a time wastes valuable charge shots, since it could potentially hit both bases if they’re both active.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Suprisingly, you don’t need to duck to hit the bases with your shots, even though they appear to be quite low. When fighting them normally, the front base gets destroyed much sooner than the back. This is because, even though the charge shot hits both, the 4 bullet shot will hit the front base with all 4 bullets if you’re not jumping. To avoid this, I time small jumps so that 2 bullets hit the front base and 2 hit the back at a time. This keeps their health roughly in sync, allowing them to both be beaten at the same time. Again, the reason why it’s bad to kill just one first is because it wastes the charge shot, which could potentially hit both of them at full power for just the one shot.

It’s possible to have the flame man hang out just to the right of the screen and be able to hit him without him moving, but once he is down to half health he usually jumps further right, stopping you from hitting him until you slowly wait for him to come back. To avoid this, I manipulate him to to a big jump to the left at the start onto the screen and manipulate him to stand in the one spot. Having him on screen also allows your charge shot to connect for more frames and hence deal more damage per shot. Conveniently, I kill the flame man just before another charge shot is charged, allowing me to use it on the access denied portal.

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"These long falls are incredibly difficult to optimise for two reasons: height of the jump and x-position. With the jump height, you need to line your height up so that the player hits the desired ground when you loop back around. Because the y-velocity is so high after looping, it’s very possible that when you clip through the last bit of out of bounds geometry, you will clip through the platform you’re actually trying to land on. To avoid this, I hold jump for a particular amount of time that gives me a frame where the character is slightly above the desired platform.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The other factor is x-position. The portal is slightly to the right of where the level starts, and naturally I want to jump and start falling as soon as possible. You can move to the right while falling and upping your y-coordinate but you need to ensure you don’t hit any oob geometry or any death areas. It turns out that oob geometry is so common that you almost always need to be pressing lrlr to clip (and hence not moving to the right). As I was falling, I checked on every frame whether I needed to alternate directions to keep clipping down, or whether I could hold right to get some more x-position. Sometimes I could hold right for just two frames, but that doesn’t actually give you any more x-position, so I used these opportunities to offset my alternation pattern, so that the next batch of right presses may have one more frame held.

When doing this, the helicopter flies very fast to the left, at a similar speed to the charge shot. This allows the charge shot to connect the entire time and deal significant damage.

I kill the rocket man, leaving the ! in the arena but unfortunately, it is inside the left stack of cubes. To get around this, I clip the floor to take a death, putting me back to the x-position I jumped from (inside the cubes).

The other major adventage of dying is the i-frames allowing me to sit in the cubes for a while longer. While in the left cubes, I fire a charge shot to the right.

Similarly, when I move to the right, I enter the right stack with my i-frames and fire a charge shot to the left to hit both stacks. The general strategy for the fight is to kill the left stack with the explosion and charge shots and the right stack with close range dotty shots.

	"Each of your shots to Jobe’s face will deal between 0 and 3 damage. The damage depends on the distance he is from you. You can have 4 bullets on screen at once, so fighting Jobe is a delicate balance of getting your bullets out quickly, but sometimes delaying them if doing so would deal extra damage. He gradually gets more health in each phase.

	"Fighting the access granted portals is surprisingly technical. You have to deal 100 damage to each one and each shot deals 4 damage, unless you’re shooting on the edge of the portal, where a shot can deal between 0 and 4 damage. The technical aspect comes from the possibility of shooting two portals with one bullet. Usually when you do this, the 4 damage is divided between the two portals, but sometimes you can get over 4 in total with one bullet, using precise positioning. The game kicks you back to Jobe once it either times out this section, or you turn a portal from granted to denied. Unfortunately, even if you hit two portals with the same bullet, and both have one health left, only one will turn to denied. This eliminates any hope of a “cycle skip”. However, hitting two portals with one bullet was useful in slightly speeding up the fight. Since you need to deal 100 damage and you shoot bullets for 4 damage 4 at a time, you deal 16 damage for every group of shots you do. This means that you’ll reach 96 damage then have to wait for your next group of shots to deal your last 4 damage. To deal with this issue, I used overlap shots, to deal at least 4 damage to most portals before specifically targeting them the next round. This allows me to kill them in 8 groups of 4 shots rather then 8 groups + waiting for one loose shot.

The floor clips were an obvious highlight, they're almost in that sort of cyberpunk style of "Well, I could take the long route, or I could just hack my way to the end", except instead of hacking, it's jumping through floors, and instead of the end... Okay, it's still the end. That doesn't change. I also really appreciate the planning put into each fight, particularly the ones near the end with the

This, combined with some nice varied playarounds in the autoscrollers and overall great execution, made the run that much more of a joy to watch, both from an entertainment perspective and a technical perspective.
