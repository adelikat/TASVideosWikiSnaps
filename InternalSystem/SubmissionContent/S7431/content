	": So this had me a bit... conflicted. There is already a Super Mario 74 movie published on the site... and then there's this one of Extreme Edition...  Both runs aim to collect every Star in the game and both being of difficulty hacks by design. The level designs are also similar to each other with the latter being altered to be even more difficult than the former. On those grounds, I was inclined to obsolete the SM74 movie with this one.

	"...however, there is merit to having both together side by side. True, Extreme Edition does bolster more to collect and has techniques for the newly imposing challenges that haven't been used in the other one. It's different enough that it would be fine to have two in tandem with one another. The audience response to this one was also overall positive.
