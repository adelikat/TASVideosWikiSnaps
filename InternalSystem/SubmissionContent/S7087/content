	"Astute viewers may notice that Mario is being launched while in the air. The game attempts to prevent this by determining if Mario is on the ground, but it erroneously believes that Mario is on the ground for a frame or two at the peak of his launch. This allows us to remain in the air which is generally much faster, as landing on the ground causes lots of speed loss (usually).

	"Level transitions can be skipped by pressing space which I definitely knew when I started this and didn't have to go back and remove my funny end of level cutscenes where I managed to get Mario to roll off the screen entirely which nobody will ever see because I overwrote the file.

[div class=p 
	"Input ends with the launch before the weird maze of invisible blocks at the end of 1-4, which requires a frame perfect launch to get the perfect trajectory to allow Mario to roll into Toad. There are lots of invisible blocks and they have collision from all sides meaning it was very hard to find a trajectory that could get through the invisible blocks, much less cross the gap and then go high enough at the end to land on the axe's platform and then roll down to reach Toad. The only other hard launch was the one into the pipe in 1-2 which used a cool strat to slide off the floating platforms originally but it desynced when fixing the level cutscenes which made me sad :( please donate all your money to me so I feel better
