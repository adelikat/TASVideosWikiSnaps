	"For some reason, and despite being extremely well done, the previous movie did not care much for optimizing the boss or limiting the last movie input. But who knows how the rules regarding movie length were handled back then. I also do not understand why the authors did not notice the 2 easy frames to be obtained by pressing START two frames early. The early death and faster round 4 frames are the most valuable, as they took some heavy optimizing.
