	""The game's protagonist is Ashley Mizuki Robbins, a 13 year old girl who has been raised by her aunt, Jessica, because her parents vanished when she was three years old. She believed that they were dead, but two days before her fourteenth birthday, she received a package. Inside, was a letter from her father and a small machine. The letter said that he would be waiting on Blood Edward Island, an island located off the coast of Washington in the United States. The next day, the day before her birthday, Jessica and Ashley ride over to Blood Edward Island on a boat, but Ashley's father isn't there to greet them. Jessica goes to look for him, but when she doesn't return, Ashley ventures out to search for both of them. While exploring the island, Ashley also befriends "D", a ghost who has lost his memories. Together they enter the Edward Mansion, each looking for answers to their own questions."

	]a
	", while accepted, are not preferred for submissions. Please try in the future to be aware of what game versions are available, so that you can choose the best one with regards to our site policies. In general, aim to run on the USA versions of games whenever available.

[p 
	"On to the game choice itself: this is a fairly borderline game with regard to 
	(__wikiLink|/Vault|Vault)
	" rules on visual novel/point-and-click adventure story games. While a large part of the movie is just skipping through dialogue or other plot downtime going on, the game has enough bits of actual gameplay that can be optimized, so I'll say it is a publishable game in that way too. (It definitely won't have any chance at going any further than the Vault, though).
	$LF

[p 
	"Onto the gameplay of the game - this is actually the bigger problem I have with this run. Especially the first ~1/3rd part of the run is problematic; it appears that half the time, you neglect to use touch input to move and use the arrow keys instead, which leads to visibly suboptimal paths. Upon testing, I found out within minutes that it's possible to save 20 frames within the first 5-6 seconds of gameplay, for instance, which makes further parts with arrow movement look terribly sloppy. It seems you realized this and use mostly touch movement after about a third of the run through, but it's still something that appears too sloppy in the beginning - especially for this type of game, where gameplay is as sparse as it is already. This makes me think this run needs a second pass to be acceptable for site standards. As such, I'm rejecting this run.
