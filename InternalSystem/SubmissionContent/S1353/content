That being said, there is still new stuff to be found in this run - some by everyone, and some by those who look a little closer.

As long Mario hits the peak of his jump when this counter is above zero, flight begins.  This counter does not decrement between doors or pipes, which allows for running up to flight speed in one room and starting flight in the next.  This is the basis of several tricks seen before, such as keeping flight through a pipe, or stomping the ground and flying again immediately after.
