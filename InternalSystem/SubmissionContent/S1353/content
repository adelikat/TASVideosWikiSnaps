[p 
	"There have been quite a few Super Mario World runs, and each time it gets more difficult to think of ways to make the run look new - sometimes it's just not possible, especially given that fadeout lag sometimes dictates which scores to get.  That being said, there is still new stuff to be found in this run - some by everyone, and some by those who look a little closer.

	"This run is 195 frames faster than the previous version.  The majority of the improvement comes from the final level, but

	"most other levels were improved by varying amounts as well.  Although this run was recorded by Fabian & JXQ, there were many more people involved with this latest improvement.

Normally this would be slower, but the shell bounce in this level causes a few frames of lag that could be avoided.  It looked like it might be a frame faster, but positioning ended up being bad for entering the pipe optimally.

	"Here's the bulk of the improvement.  When Mario starts flying, a counter starts at 80 and counts down to zero.  As long Mario hits the peak of his jump when this counter is above zero, flight begins.  This counter does not decrement between doors or pipes, which allows for running up to flight speed in one room and starting flight in the next.  This is the basis of several tricks seen before, such as keeping flight through a pipe, or stomping the ground and flying again immediately after.
