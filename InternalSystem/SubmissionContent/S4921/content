	"Spiderman: Shattered Dimensions is a metroidvania Spiderman game. So in other words, it's not crap. It's similar in vein to the DS version of Web of Shadows, and coincidentally Daniel X, as they all run on the same engine. It also got a sequel, but that's a piece of crap so I'm not talking about it.

	"- The A Button while jumping is used for 'fast' web zips, which is incredibly useful in tight corridors. Whenever there's no walls, however, a down-left or down-right zip across the floor is used. Down-right/left zips can also be used in combat as an attack.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- Whenever Spidey falls a long distance, he will enter a 'roll' state that can be jumped out of. This can be used to retain speed from web zips.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- The B button is for jumping, but also for 'slow' web swinging. I say slow because in open spaces with high ceilings it's usually faster. Can also be used as an attack in combat.

	"-The Launching Uppercut upgrade is the only upgrade I ever get aside from damage boosts and boss abilities.

	"-Keeping a boss off the ground prevents them from recovering, so you can just keep juggling them forever.

	"-The first Mysterio fight ends when he raises the tablet to defend himself, which happens when he's low on HP.

	"-Noir (1920's spiderman) has the ability to detect hidden switches which is used a whole once.

	"-Normally Boomerang dodges everything unless you hit him with his own boomerang, but he doesn't block the second attack of a combo. Sucks for him.

	"-2099 (future spidey) doesn't get web swinging until after Vulture.

	"-I have to wait before going to the power...squares in the Tinkerer fight because he'll actually avoid activating them if you get too close.

	"-I used web swinging momentum to reach Calypso without getting the glide ability. Saves a few seconds considering the setup time.

	"-Silvermane is the only boss that can't be stunned. Neat.
	$LF

[p 
	"-Right before Electro my Momentum meter is nearly full. When it reaches capacity it gives Spiderman faster attack speed. I couldn't use it beforehand because it requires pretty much grinding enemies to get it full. It's incredibly helpful for the final levels.
