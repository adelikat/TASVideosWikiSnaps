	"Spiderman: Shattered Dimensions is a metroidvania Spiderman game. So in other words, it's not crap. It's similar in vein to the DS version of Web of Shadows, and coincidentally Daniel X, as they all run on the same engine. It also got a sequel, but that's a piece of crap so I'm not talking about it.

	"- The A Button while jumping is used for 'fast' web zips, which is incredibly useful in tight corridors. Whenever there's no walls, however, a down-left or down-right zip across the floor is used. Down-right/left zips can also be used in combat as an attack.
