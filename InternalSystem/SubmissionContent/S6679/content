[div class=p 
	"to get to hard mode however, it does require a bit of a code, but all it is is pressing B then start to access special options, this includes starting lives, stage select, and of course, difficulty settings.  I can assure that the only thing accessed on this menu was the difficulty.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Hard mode simply adds more spawning enemies and gives more health to bosses.  The more enemies that are on screen, the slower the screen will move.  It's important to kill enemies as soon as possible to maximize screen movement.  Although some cases it may be slower due to some characters not having the powerups to kill right away.

	"near the end of the stage, I didnt kill the blue wolf as fast as I could since I needed him to get into place to do the TF skip, if both players collect power ups at the same time, only one cutscene will play.  and TF's need to happen because it 1) makes your attacks more powerful and 2) the boss will run away unless both players have the TF upgrades.  If that happens, the stage plays for another loop.
