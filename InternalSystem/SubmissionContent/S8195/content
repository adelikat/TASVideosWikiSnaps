	"This will be applicable to most levels, but anyway, we do a ton of proxies off fodder, barrels, enemies, CANNONS EVEN. After we proxy and enter sheila early, if you pause on the first frame you can and then charge and unpause, you can control spyro instead of being pulled into the text/cutscene. If we die after doing this, the game spawns us in as spyro instead of sheila which is pretty wacky. I get a couple proxies and leave.

	"A few months back I found a way to get the weights to teleport. Thanks to HWD405 checking the code, this is caused by: "performing some sort of check a couple times (they seem to be ray traces, but I don't know what for yet) and if one of the checks returns a nonzero result (which I think means a check failed?) then it moves the weight to a location stored in some specific variable, which seemingly holds the position that Sgt. Byrd is currently targeting (which usually matches Sgt. Byrd's current position, the wall in front of him, or a Moby). Why it does this isn't entirely clear but it seems to be a failsafe of sorts. And indeed, forcing one of these checks to always return zero does result in the behaviour seen in the glitch. If I had to guess, I think when the two weights are inside eachother, one of the rays from one of the weights is perhaps colliding with the other weight and causing those checks to fail. Needless to say, there doesn't seem to be very much potential in using this glitch, since it only ever moves the weight around and never writes an- WOAH SHUT UP HWD!!!!!

For this reason, we now have changed the relative
