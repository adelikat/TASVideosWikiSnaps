	": Simply blasting one's way through a shmup level may attain the fastest time, but I do not consider it acceptable content for a tool-assisted speedrun. Given the nature of shmups this is merely 
	[em 
		"playing
	]em
	" the game and we do not merely 
	[em 
		"play
	]em
	" the games here. In autoscrollers of any genre the tools must be applied to a different purpose. Where time is less of a factor the expectations of entertainment are greater. In a shmup I would expect to see a tightly crafted work that consistently flirted with death and destruction (see 
	[a class=intlink href=/711M 
		"Gradius
	]a
	") or one that dealt out tightly executed death and destruction (see 
	[a class=intlink href=/1116M 
		"Gradius 3
	]a
	"). This run provides neither of the above; the gameplay is psychotic and, furthermore, it is messy. As an aside, the volume of lag that this style generates also throws the level of optimisation into question. All of the above is reflected in the overwhelmingly negative criticism in the thread. Rejecting for failing to entertain despite sufficient opportunities to do so.
