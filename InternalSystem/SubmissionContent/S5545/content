[p 
	"You are a safari hunter out to exact revenge on Bongo the gorilla.  Why?  One story I read suggests Bongo set your hut on fire.  Another suggest that Bongo is just an annoyance to the hunter.  Either way, revenge is the name of the game.

]h3
[p 
	"Congo Bongo is played in an isometric world (Q-bert) in which the goal is to reach a gorilla (Donkey Kong) and sometimes requires jumping over a river on top of various animals/objects (Frogger).

	"There are only 2 screens per stage.  Once both are cleared, the stage number increases and you repeat both screens indefinitely.

		"Screen 1 - Climb the cliffs to reach Bongo while avoiding his coconuts and monkey minions.
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				"The coconuts thrown by Bongo will kill you instantly.  Monkeys will jump on your back to slow you down and throw you off the cliff in later levels.
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				"The intended route for climbing the cliff is to climb straight up the 1st step, then climb right the next 3 steps.  Down across the bridge to slide down  the slide.  Jump across the gap.  Climb up to the platform with the monkeys. Jump across the river. And lastly climb up to Bongo's level.

	" I feel this may still be a valid submission due to the use of the out-of-bounds glitch in the first of the two screens.

		"As the out-of-bounds glitch allows the player to completely avoid the monkeys outright, the difficulty increase for the first screen is rendered moot regardless of how many stages are played.

		"The difficulty increase regarding the snapping fish in the second screen does not affect route planning or timing (even when carried out through 5 stages) and is thus also rendered moot.

	"If whomever judges this run believes that the difficulty changes (even though rendered moot) qualify as new content and thus require multiple stages to be completed, I have completed a 5-stage run of the game as well (available

	"Normally, we require the game to play until the difficulty no longer increases. However, this submission essentially renders the difficulty changes moot because the same route can be used across all five stages. With relatively no new content across stage loops, a single stage loop is sufficient for completion.
