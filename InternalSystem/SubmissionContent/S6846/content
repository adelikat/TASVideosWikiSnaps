	"So this game has some glitch that makes it so you can skip to the end by pausing the game, pressing up, then unpausing. Wait, there's already a published TAS of this. You might think that optimizing this further is impossible, but nope. The previous movie actually missed the first input boundary, so they just lost 4 frames from that (the game runs at a pseudo 15 FPS). That's the only real improvement in this movie; the other difference is simply using CGB/GBA mode, which has a fake improvement of a shorter BIOS. Nonetheless, there is 4 frames of actual improvement, so this movie should be able to obsolete the previous movie, and should be able to be console verified!
