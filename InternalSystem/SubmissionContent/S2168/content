I searched on TASvideos, SDA, and Youtube, and I was surprised to find out that nobody submitted a serious attempt at this. Since I thought it can be interesting, I decided to give it a try.

	"In this Speedrun I beat the 5 competition levels in Sonic 3 & Knuckles as fast as possible, while trying to retain a decent level of variety. The usual Sonic tricks are used, as 8-rev spindashes in 8 frames, jumps inside loops, and so on. I play in Grand Prix mode with No Items, alone. This allows me to do everything I want in all the 5 levels. While Tails and Knuckles can be faster than Sonic in some levels, I chose to do a "Sonic Only" speedrun. If feedback is good I might consider another run with Tails or Knuckles.

If your tool-assisted movie is slower than the non-tool-assisted world record of the game you play, your movie will almost certainly be rejected." As is mentioned in the thread, this movie fails to beat several of the records documented elsewhere. Thus, rejecting.
