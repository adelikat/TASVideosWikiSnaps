	(__wikiLink|displaytext=DarkKobold's comment|href=/Forum/Posts/250282)
	" that a run based on a compromise between both movies would probably be the best goal for our purposes, there doesn't seem to be an obvious solution to this. This movie is a good example of what should be expected from a newgame+ run. The incredibly fast character and the extra track make this worth watching independently of the existing publication.
