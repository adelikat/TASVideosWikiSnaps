	"This movie is an improvement of 88 frames (1.47 seconds) over the previous movie. The improvements had been considered, but for some reason didn't properly work. After FieryBlizzard (FieryVolcano on YouTube) pointed out that he (sort of) managed them in the RTA version of the run, I tried going a bit slower and this magically worked.
