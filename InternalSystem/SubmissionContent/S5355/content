	""Mega Man IV" in 34:55.45 also known as Rockman World 4 (ロックマンワールド4 in Japan) is the fourth installment in the handheld version of the Mega Man series. The game continues the quest of the protagonist, Mega Man, in a never-ending struggle with his long-time nemesis, Dr. Wily. Mega Man IV features the ability to purchase items with drops found throughout each stage. The Mega-Buster received an upgrade after Mega Man III, and Mega Man now gets knocked back by recoil when firing a fully charged shot. As with previous Game Boy releases, the game incorporates gameplay elements and bosses from two sequential Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) games: Mega Man 4 and Mega Man 5.

		" Pressing UP on the D-Pad immediately ends a slide ( it also removes a Lagframe sometimes,often used in spots Megaman has to wait and Lag appears, e.g. Bossfights, or Midbosses ).
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" shooting e.g. to the right locks megaman to the direction for several frames, which means you can´t slide to the left or turn around, to avoid this you have to jump. If you´re wondering why you want to turn around after you were shooting it´s really simple, normally Megaman has a 9 Frame cooldown after he has done a shot but turning around on the first frame possible and going back to the other side enables him to shoot earlier ( see the Big Metcannon fights on Wily Space Ship for an example - Megaman looks like he´s firing a machine gun :^D ).

		" In boss battles where I use the Buster, I alternate charged and non-charged shots, on Game Boy the boss invulnerability time is so short (30 frames) and the charge-up time is so long (90 frames) that it actually saves time to fire a small shot after every large shot!
		$LF

		" It is worth mentioning that after each Boss fight, the player has to stand in the middle! Boss bubbles don't have to leave the screen to activate the Get Weapon animation earlier.
