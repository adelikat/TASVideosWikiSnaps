	"This is the first time for me to make a movie on GBA console. I saw a any% TAS on youtube (but not submitted to TASVideos) long long ago. When I know the LR bug, I think it's excellent because, you can get a faster speed and go through a solid much more easily . But it's unwise to do a TAS (such as any%, warpless, which is same as NES's) only using LR bug, in my opinion. But E-reader levels are native ones for this game. So I did this movie and submitted on this site today. Please sit back and enjoy. :)

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"第一次做GBA平台的录像，很早以前就看过这个游戏的any%TAS视频在youtube（但作者没投到TASVideos），知道LR的bug后觉得既可以很轻松地获得比P还快的速度，省去了为了达到P而做的尝试，又可以在NES不能入墙的地方做到这个效果。但一直没有做，因为个人觉得仅仅靠LR比NES快也并不是很有特色。但100%的投稿出现后，通过评论使我了解这游戏还有原创关卡，看了原来有人投过的e-reader录像后，觉得这个记录做出来很有意义。所以就尝试做了。
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"这是我第4次做关于SMB3的录像，很怀念。（第1次是SMB3 warpless，但做到world 6放弃了。第2次是Mario Adventure，做完后虽然还有提升点，但尚且没有精力去突破。第3次是smb3.mix，但只是开了个头就弃坑了。本次是第4次，没有尝试去做e-reader的100%，也没有做整个游戏的100%...）

	" 关卡特点：
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"e-reader关卡因为是原创关卡而非复刻，关卡中打破了一些3代的模式，比如向左移动的强制卷轴。出现了超级马里奥世界的道具、超级马里奥兄弟2（USA）的怪物和玩法。
