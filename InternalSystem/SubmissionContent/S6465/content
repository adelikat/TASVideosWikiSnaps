	"You submitted this with the intention of obsoleting an old Luigi only TAS from 2004. However, a branch of this game that only uses Luigi does not offer any significant differences compared to the published warps TAS. There is a princess only branch of this game, which is unique because the princess character is the only one that is not used in the published

	(__wikiLink|displaytext=warpless|href=/1746M)

	$LF
	"I as well as some users in the submission thread noticed a handful of optimization issues. This TAS did not beat the published warps TAS in levels that did use Luigi. In addition, it did not incorporate known faster strategies, especially in level 1-1. For the record, this TAS is about 30 seconds slower than the fastest princess only run for this game, and the princess is inferior to Luigi in this game mostly due to slower item grabbing. Many places, such as the character selection screen, boss fights, movement around obstacles, and sand digging sections can be polished.
