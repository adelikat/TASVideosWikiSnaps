	"Regarding the jackhammer in stage 3 (75M): it is indeed possible to manipulate their spawns, specifically the starting horizontal position when the jackhammer enters the screen.  This run has the jackhammer start in the ideal horizontal location (whether intentional or not), so changing this won't aid the delay in game progress.  I was unable to find a way to alter the timing of when the jackhammers are released; it appears to be on a consistent timer, but I was unable to find the timer in RAM to confirm.
