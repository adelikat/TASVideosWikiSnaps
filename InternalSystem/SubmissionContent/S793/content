	"Preface: This movie is NOT a "time-attack" where re-records are used.  I simply started recording at the beginning and played normally with a controller.  If you're looking for perfection, this isnt the movie for you.  I play this as one would on a sunday afternoon on their console.  One record.

	"What kind of programming errors do you abuse in the game? I take advantage of, not sure if it's a bug or error but, when the QB is knocked down during a flea-flicker play, the RB still pitches the ball back, causing a fumble.

	"Do you take hits? Well I do let them score on me once, but I do this to show the dominance of my defense.  Also, they rack up some rushing yards cause the computer kept picking a play that gave them yards..... one I wasnt picking.  Maybe next time?

	"Aims: My main aim is to see how many points my defense and/or special teams can make.  When I get the ball, I always punt it away.

	"Description:
	$LF
	"We've all played this game and if you havent, shame on you! Go and get it now!  Anyway, this is an awesome game and have loved it since I got it(still own AND play this on my NES).  I was always intrigued by the mechanics of this game and after watching ARC's video with the Colts and the Pats, I was instantly inspired.

	"Before making this movie, I tried this out on my NES. I did it once just out of personal curiosity.  I asked myself "What if I just punted everytime I got the ball? Could my defense hold them back or would I be stuck in a 0-0 tie?"  As luck would have it, I got about 14-20-something points and the computer had 0!  I was so amazed that I showed my brother and a friend on a seperate day.  They were just laughing and entertained by the whole thing cause it's just the way NOT to play football as a coach if you wanna keep your job lol.
	$LF
	"As it turned out, I actually got LESS points on the console than on the emulator.  Go figure.  I guess the luck/randomness in the fumble locations and play choices were just in my favor more than on the console.

	"This movie is all about entertainment.  I try to play as if you were sitting there watching me play.  No save-states, no menu manipulation to squeeze out frames, or re-records; Just all-around good fun.  I do admit, after watching it over after playing that the first half isnt too interesting.  The pace picks up at the 2nd half and the most points scored happens in the 4th, also with a nice suprise at the end to finish off the game.  
	$LF
	"For those who watch this, feel free to create a "time-attack" with this challenge (punt only) to get 99-0 (you might get more but that's just what the score counter would read).  I've always loved this game and there should be more movies for this game.

	"Optional description/caption for this movie:
	$LF
	"How good was the '91 New York Giants' defense?  Was it good, great or insanely unstoppable?  Could they win a game with only special teams and defense?  Could the offense take the day off?  One man proves that you don't need a good QB, much less an offensive playbook to destroy a team.
