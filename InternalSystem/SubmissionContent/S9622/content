	": I get why a lot of GBA games added a DDR minigame somewhere in their game but a lot of them never understood how to really make them good. At least this one is better than No Rules Get Phat by having the music a bit more synced up. Anyways, the inputs seem fine and the parts that's not the rhythm game seems optimally done. It seems reasonable to have this as its own branch since it's mostly decoupled from the main game outside of one optional reward compared to the DKC GBA dance game.

	"A note to publishers: I managed to find a RAM address that I believe determines the color to flash on screen. RAM address 
	[code 
		"0x4778
	]code
	" in IWRAM seems to determine what color to overlay the rest of the screen with, where 0 is no color at all. Freezing this address when the dancing game starts (I tested at frame 401) will stop the red flashing from intentionally wrong inputs and the input file synced without any further adjustments. I have uploaded 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=my RAM watch file here|href=/UserFiles/Info/638815527686108600)
	" so anyone else doesn't need to. Also, after the final input there's two text boxes (results of the final round and a message about the unlock) that need inputs after the final input file input before returning to the Crash Party USA title screen. I'll leave that up to the publisher to decide if that's necessary for the encode or not.
