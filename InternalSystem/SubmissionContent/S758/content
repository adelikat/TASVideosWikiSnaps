	"The goal was completed in 3:56 or in 14185 frames. It consists of 41 tetrises that platform off the 10th row and lastly the 10th row cleared to simultaneously minimize tetriminoes used and distance dropped. Effort was made to only permute a new string of tetriminoes by pausing when either doing so would save frames in the long run or would alter otherwise unpreventable topouts. By saving the right hand middle column for tetrises, the structure allowed for higher and speedier placement.

	"The run improves the last published recording for this game by starting faster, using less pieces to establish the platform, pausing less, and finishing more optimally. It was a pleasure making, and I hope the viewer enjoys.
