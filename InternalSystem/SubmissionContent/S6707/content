I'm didn't really figure out how the game decides if you're jumping or just between steps, but it seems very inconsistent which is probably part of why this game was so frustrating. At high speeds jumping seems to get confused or something, when you land you basically come to a standstill, presumably the game is confused about what speed you should be going?

I did spend a bunch of time trying to optimize the handling of hurdles with lua scripting. The best method I found was to look at 0x58 which seems to be the state variable. When running full speed the states rotate through the sequence 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7.
