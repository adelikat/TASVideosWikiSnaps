	"like other castlevania game, it's possible to cancel crouch by attacking at a proper frame before land from a high fall.

[div class=p 
	"use subweapon while walking: jump, whip, and throw something when just land on.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"keep forward when walk off platform: whip when walk off. I almost didn't use this but I still write it here.

	"invincible man glitch: when hero is near death, try going into a door with enemy's attack, if you succeed you go through with empty hp and it dies. Then he is invincible.

	"stage 3: Invincible glitch was uesd, all enemies and barriers were ignored. 
	$LF
	"Later I got meat to restore for the shortcut by damage taking on enemy.

[div class=p 
	"stage 4: The second part of here like a maze, you need 2 keys to unlock a nearer way, my route should be the fastest. Later the glitch came again. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"stage 5: This stage is a bit troublesome, enemies are strong that you can't jump over and hero only can take damage 3 times. I can use glitch early but I'll miss a timesaver later, after some tests I kept full health until a long stair and took damage there. I walked a bit to get cross for boss in last part, even if you directly walk to pendulum you still miss its first turn, so I didn't waste time.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"stage 6: Dracula battle. About weapon and damage: Subweapon is weaker than whip. You can't cause multiple hits on enemy, for example, an axe and whip hit enemy at same frame, it's only gotten one hurt of them. Then end.
