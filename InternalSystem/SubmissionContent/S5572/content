[p 
	"like other castlevania game, it's possible to cancel crouch by attacking at a proper frame before land from a high fall.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"use subweapon while walking: jump, whip, and throw something when just land on.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"keep forward when walk off platform: whip when walk off. I almost didn't use this but I still write it here.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"invincible man glitch: when hero is near death, try going into a door with enemy's attack, if you succeed you go through with empty hp and it dies. Then he is invincible.

[p 
	"stage 1: I got a key to unlock a door which is a nearer way to the end. 
	$LF
	"Mid boss fight, I killed the big bat when it attack to avoid it disperse once.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"stage 2: There are 3 ways to the end, my choice is the shortest. 
	$LF
	"I played and danced with those skeletons in auto scrolling part to make it looks more interesting.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"stage 3: Invincible glitch was uesd, all enemies and barriers were ignored. 
	$LF
	"Later I got meat to restore for the shortcut by damage taking on enemy.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"stage 4: The second part of here like a maze, you need 2 keys to unlock a nearer way, my route should be the fastest. Later the glitch came again. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"stage 5: This stage is a bit troublesome, enemies are strong that you can't jump over and hero only can take damage 3 times. I can use glitch early but I'll miss a timesaver later, after some tests I kept full health until a long stair and took damage there. I walked a bit to get cross for boss in last part, even if you directly walk to pendulum you still miss its first turn, so I didn't waste time.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"stage 6: Dracula battle. About weapon and damage: Subweapon is weaker than whip. You can't cause multiple hits on enemy, for example, an axe and whip hit enemy at same frame, it's only gotten one hurt of them. Then end.

	": The jump management and use of enemy damage boost at times looks suboptimal. However, overall this was a good run and got good feedback. Accepting as first run for this game.
