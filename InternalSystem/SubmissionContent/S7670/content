	"There's not a whole lot to explain with this game, it's mostly just the same kind of TASing movement that many TASers are well versed in at this point.  The only major thing to mention is the floor clips, as they work if you're able to get close enough to an edge to shift on the other side.  The game then tries to push you downward until you get to an area you can move around in.  I was able to crash the game by clipping out of bounds in the run stage near the end which was kinda funny.

	"Also this movie contains a Speed/Entertainment tradeoff as pressing "SHIFT" near the beginning too early causes the game to look all faded, so I delayed it by half a second just so it'd be more viewable.
