	"Wow, it has been 10 years and 5 months since that publication.  That was one of my first TASes, using FCEU .12.  I didn't have bots, or lua, or even ram watching to aid me. I've learned and grown so much as a TASer since then, and emulator tools have made amazing leaps.  This new run achieves results that were unthinkable to me back then.  When I first TASed this game, my motivation was the nostalgia power of this game from my childhood.  This time around, I had nostalgia power on TASing the game!  I can't believe I've been doing this for so long, eek.

Unfortunately, most frames are lag frames, so there's often not a lot input based manipulation, so frame delays are necessary.  The RNG is actually affected by the number of CPU cycles in a frame, making it an RNG that is completely unpredictable.  Therefore, brute-force bots are the only viable option.

Now, a large delay is more like 10 frames, and most 3 or less (many are 0).

This time around..it was still very painful, but at least I had bots!  I saved a lot of time in the first boss fight, by having the luxury of manipulating two VERY unlikely battle orders/actions.  On average it took about 16k bot attempts to recreate just the appropriate battle order of each round, much less the actual critical hits and misses that ensued.  Note that there is some strange looking decision in that fight.  But it is because the game turns off the ability to deliver critical hits after someone dies, for some reason.  Also a big factor is the glitch that if the middle character is dead, enemies won't target the last character.  This glitch is extensively exploited in RTA, but is actually an annoyance here, I had to work around it by making sure Brey died before Cristo.  As before, only Alena survives this fight as the others aren't useful and I don't want to spend the time to level them up.

		" This is where the TAS differs radically from the previous TAS and where most of the time was saved.  The key detail I missed last time is that if a character builds power, the 2x bonus from that also applies to critical hits!  This detail allows Taloon to be a wrecking ball in this game.  The basic strategy is to build power in the first round, then summon reinforcements and deliver 3 critical hits, all at 2x damage.  With this strategy, the other characters become pointless and only cost time having to level them up.  Instead, the idea is to give Taloon the best weapons you can, and let him deliver insane amounts of damage.  Nearly ever boss can be defeated in a single reinforcement summoning.  By the end of the game, Taloon is doing over 400 damage on each hit!  So I kill off everyone but the Hero and Taloon (and eventually the hero too).  The hero is only useful for outside/return spells and because it is required that he be alive to enter Zenithian castle.  Every boss fight is very short this time around and this is the basis of why.  Also a lot of route changes result from this.

		" Since I knew I would not need Alena and Ragnar, their stats were manipulated to have low HP in early chapters.  This way they could be killed off in 1 hit.  This time around, I kill off Alena, Cristo and Brey right after they join the party.  I put them as the only 3 in a party and get into a random encounter and have them all die quickly.  This is a nice time saver because the remaining living party members (Taloon and the hero) jump out of the wagon after ward, so I don't have to re-adjust my party members.

		" I actually get into a metal babble fight for the purpose of level ups right after getting Taloon.  This was a difficult decision to make.  In general, I don't need the levels, and this takes time.  However, this allows the hero to get the outside spell sooner.  The magic key cave, I was able to save a minute of backtracking and avoid a death shortcut when getting the seeds from the cave.  However this isn't enough to make up the time.  However, the extra levels even out by the end of the TAS, resulting in only 1 extra level for the hero and Taloon.  The extra levels end up saving time from less usage of inns, and result in just enough strength increase to beat some bosses in fewer rounds.  Overall, the metal babble route saves some time but not a lot, probably about 20 seconds.

		" Another marginal improvement but very awesome to watch, is getting the sword of decimation.  This is a cursed weapon and a bad idea in regular play.  However, the downside to this weapon is that while it has insane attack power, it leaves you with 0 defense.  In a TAS, I dont' need defense, since I don't get hit unless I want to.  The extra damage it gives me saves some time over the course of all those boss fights, more than the cost of obtaining it.  It probably saves about 10 seconds overall.  But I think it also improves the entertainment value.  It is pretty cool to see the use of a cursed item as a means of saving time.

		" There's a clever death shortcut after the Keeleon fight.  I kill off the hero in the Rhinoking fight, and then take on Keeleon alone with Taloon.  Then I kill off Taloon after getting the gas canister to save having to backtrack out of the castle (the castle blocks your outside/return spells).  Normally once you have a party, you don't want to do death shortcuts since only the hero is revived.  But in this case, I can revive taloon in the World tree, since searching on any leaf square gives you a leaf of world tree.

		" In the 4 guardian fights, I do Radimvice first because the hero is useful for his expel spell.  Once he's done that he is killed off and Taloon goes solo from there.  Interestingly this strat is only viable because of forced medical herb drops in the Chapter 2 tournament.  One of the guardian shrines and the final castle have barriers.  Since Taloon can't heal himself, the only way I can do this without the hero is by using 2 of those medical herbs.  Note that the max HP you can get from a medical herb is 40.  I manipulated max healing with both herbs in order to avoid the need for a 3rd.

		" Chapter 2 - Get one more str stat increase in the level ups after the first boss fight, and manipulate the skeleton to have minimum HP (42).  With one more strength stat, Alena's max damage is 21, and so it would only take 2 rounds to kill the skeleton instead of 3.  At the time of the level ups, I got one less than max strength because getting one more str was going to be a huge delay.  Much later in the TAS I realized the Skeletons min HP was just enough for this to be worth it.  This would improve the TAS by about 100 frames minus the frames it would take to manipulate the extra strength (would have been 40 or so frames I think).

I could save a few frames on a lot of the screen transitions in the early chapters which would add up to a second or two probably.  While this is the smallest known improvmeent it is the one that bugs me the most because I realized embarrassingly late that this was random, and it took that long simply from my own sloppiness of not investigating random frame in non-battle parts of this TAS (I guess I was too focused on those since they are the majority of the effort).

In theory, all these events could be done without frame delays, but in reality that's impossible.  All my bot scripts are designed to try to find the minimum frames possible for an action, but there's always more that can be done.  For instance, one could get a different RNG seed before a boss, and maybe the total delay frames is better if done so.  So this TAS (imo) does a great job keeping delays very small, but one could always bot more and redo more and squeeze more frames.  At this point it would be digging through granite though.
