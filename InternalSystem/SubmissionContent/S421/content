	"The NES version of the popular book series, but with Waldo's position randomly generated to increase replay value. Most reviews are critical of this game, but it's actually a lot harder than you might think (especially The Subway). The concept of an infinitely replayable Where's Waldo book was a good one, though it would benefit from using more colours, or adding movement to some of the tilemaps. Level music also would have been a nice touch.

	"Waldo's position is random, but since most levels are beaten in roughly a second, using up a second to produce a different position wouldn't make much sense.

	"The Subway is a very challenging level and, although the route doesn't seem very direct, I tried almost every reasonable way of changing the tracks (there are hundreds of ways to rearrange the maze) and this proved the shortest. Because the maze can be generated in a nearly infinite number of ways, this is the only stage that may be improvable by more than a few milliseconds. Replaying the previous level a number of different ways didn't produce a different maze, so a completely new time attack may be necessary to produce a different maze, but finding the optimal route would, again, be very time consuming, and there's no guarantee that it would be any faster.
