	"Choujin Sentai definitely is one of the best side-scrollers for NES, and I'm amazed there still are people who haven't played it.

	"The concept is simple and pretty addictive - choose ranger, lightly rush through a stage while listening to catchy music, then assemble into large shining mecha and knock out another big robot with your iron fists and plasma shots. Eh, it feels like good quintessence of 80's cartoons about transformers and heroes with superpowers. And the whole game follows this concept in every bit - from plot to graphics/sounds/gameplay. Also, Choujin Sentai features decent visuals in animation sequences, but this FCM movie doesn't show the whole grace of the game (because of time-saving), so... just play it youself if you've missed this masterpiece before. Playing won't take more than 20-25 minutes of your time, and it's worth experiencing it. As for me, no other game can evoke such strong sense of nostalgia as this one.

	"The game itself is pretty easy, but it's much harder to run it with no damage taken, especially during boss fights. To add some fun I've used button sequence (A+B+Start on title screen) to select "VERY HARD" mode.

	"This movie aims for fastest time and I doubt it can be improved by more than couple of frames. Unfortunately, there's no way to manupulate luck, because every enemy's patterns are predefined and they don't significally depend on player's actions. In boss fights there are moments that can be misjudged as luck manipulations, but actually they are not. Instead, there are ways to stop boss' intentions on early steps (it's like ComboBreak).

	"As for scrolling part of the game, I decided to choose only those rangers who can shoot projectiles, which help exterminate obstacles that need more than one hit. Also, such common feature as walking through enemies while they blink (after being hit) is used very frequently.

	"So, here is the result. Again, I strongly recommend to master the game before watching this movie.
