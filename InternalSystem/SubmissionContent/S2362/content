	"This is an improvement to my previous 
	(__wikiLink|1080M|SMB1 warp run)
	". It is 22 frames faster, due to much better luck manipulation combined with a new acceleration trick in 8-2, which helped bust the 21-frame rule, and 1 frame saved in the very first section in 8-4, using the same trick used in 
	(__wikiLink|2361S|this movie)
	".
