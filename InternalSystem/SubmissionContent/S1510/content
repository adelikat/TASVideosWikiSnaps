It goes like this: If Samus is about to bounce as a Morphball due to falling from a 2 or more block height, triggering the Spider Ball during the bounce gives her speed. A lot of speed. This however is mostly just useful when Samus must move vertically during the span of the Spider Throw. If the Spider Throw is triggered during a Spring Ball Jump, Samus gains a lot of speed, and this is very useful when crossing pits.
