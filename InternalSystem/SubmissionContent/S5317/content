	"Optimizing the pausing power was everything I had to make this TAS. When used, the enemies, the time limit, the player speed and acceleration will keep still until you press again the key. Also, spikes will become unharmful. This game is all about timing. Pausing in the wrong instant may result in getting stuck into the spikes or an enemy, and thus, dying.

This actually forces you to spend more real time, because you don't have enough time to gain maximum speed after every turning. I touched the first two walls in order to decelerate istantly, even if this forced me to walk longer. I arrived just in time to the hourglass, which adds 20 seconds.

]p
[p 
	"We've already had a 
	[a class=intlink href=/3193S 
		"Windows game submission
	]a
	" rejected only because Hourglass can't dump any audio for it. After it was judged, 
	[a class=intlink href=/Forum/P/281726#281726 
		"FractalFusion posted
	]a
	", that if a stable method to provide an encode with no av desync is found, such runs might have an exception in our policy,

		"Play Games That Are Emulated Well
	]a
	".
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"And indeed, both Warp and Pause Ahead are the games whose movies are short and can be dumped so that their audio syncs with their video. But when it comes to an exception in the policies, it becomes really hard to sort out.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"We have a few ways to resolve this situation, where only the lack of 
	[b 
		"easy
	]b
	" encoding method is what leads to rejection. 
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" Ignore and keep rejecting such runs. This is not the most pleasant option, but it feels stable and has no technical downsides. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Accept runs that require some work to get their audio dumped. This leads to further issues: 
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" If we keep accepting them all, we can end up in a situation when a long run is submitted, and no encoder can dump its audio fully without av desyncs, or without too much extra work to make it sync. 
				$LF
			]li
			[li 
				" If we only accept them on a case-by-vase basis, we end up in a situation where a run such as described above can not be encoded by those of the publishers/encoders/users who are available at the moment, but then after it's rejected, a user who can encode it shows up. And we kinda have to unreject it again.
				$LF
			]li

	]li
]ul
[p 
	"So it all still ends up totally dependent on volunteers, and we can not guarantee we have those every time.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Moreover, even if we have the volunteers, once you rely on a method that involves live recording of the audio stream as the movie is being replayed in the emulator, 
	[b 
		"you have no control over how well it goes
	]b
	". The game, the emulator, the OS can randomly have minor lags during the process. This leads to those lags present in the final audio stream. If it's just a progressing av desync, it can be fought, but if it's a floating av desync, you won't wish on your enemy to deal with it! Because there's literally no way to really make sure it's matching the intended audio output perfectly, at any point in time. For the record, .kkapture would dump it properly, but doesn't work with Hourglass, because Hourglass doesn't actually output any media content, it forces the games to do that.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This problem could be avoided if a run is short enough, but again, there's no stable and easy to handle way to work around this, especially for a longer run. So we had a staff discussion about this problem, and the absolute majority thinks we should 
	[b 
		"not
	]b
	" start accepting such runs without the perfectly stable ways to dump AVI of them.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"So the policy remains unbent, and this run is rejected. Thanks for your attention.
