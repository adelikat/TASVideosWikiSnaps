	"Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is a port of NES Super Mario Bros. onto the GBC, with a few minimal changes such as jump height and hitboxes, and modes such as "Challenge Mode" or "You vs. Boo". Walljumps still work, however, wall clipping doesn't.

		"This run does not seem to offer any worthwhile content over the NES version of this game. Therefore it just looks like a worse version of an existing publication. Further, there seems to be little cohesion in the decisions between jumping for some coins or bricks and not others. Movement appears to be more random than well planned and trying to show off as a TAS should. Rejecting.

	"Apparently the vault allows for unworthwhile content as in this case. Also, the less than stellar cohesion in play, while does factor a bit into the "TASness" of a run, it is mostly entertainment, which is also not a factor for the vault. Therefore accepting for the vault.
