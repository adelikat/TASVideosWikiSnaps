	"Both the final time and the time I spent on this were longer than I expected. The quick time events are trivial to TAS, but there are long animations and more missions/stages than I would have thought. The EVA portions are more interesting from a TAS perspective, but also took plenty of time.

	": This run would be pretty trivial if not for the EVA sections, which present a real optimization challenge due to the physics involved. I wasn't able to further optimize any of these sections, so they seem good. Nice use of death abuse as well. The other sections are as optimized as they can be.

	"I found the run entertaining for the first couple cycles and the presentation is impressive for an NES game. However, the lengthy QTE sections get old really quick. The limited audience consensus is that this should be in the Vault, and I agree with that. Accepting to Vault.
