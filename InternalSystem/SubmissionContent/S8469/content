	"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 is the third game of the Tony Hawk series. This game introduced the revert and double tap tricks, which allowed for much longer and higher scoring combos. There are 8 main levels in the game, five of which are with goals scattered across the level, and three competitions. Once the main career is finished, a secret level (Cruise Ship) unlocks which also has it's own goals.

In the thps2 engine, you don't really need to hold ollie much at all to keep max speed, but in 6th gen games you need to hold it a good bit more. This means that I can't get a million one frame ollies like 5th gen thps3, but I will move faster overall and we make up for the extra ollie button holding with stat changes.

SKATE letters will be in different positions and the "trick on x gap" goal will be different. Even after all these years it's still not worth it to switch from Street to Vert, so our options are Jamie Thomas, Bam Margera, and Andrew Reynolds (along with Officer Dick but he's an unlockable skater). Jamie is the fastest to select, and he also gets a really easy to adjust trickset.

	"I really wanted two 57 heats for Tokyo, but after fully finishing it I don’t think that’s ever going to be feasible without using unlockable skaters and tricks like the IL does. If not because of the RNG, then definitely from missing the first trick due to 7 Ollie stat. Still happy with a 56 since that’s an improvement over RTA and the previous TAS.

	"(Future me here) Since I finished this whole segment I rerouted the combo a little bit. It’s currently useless because the rng is way too bad (and can’t be manipulated to be good enough), but this could save around 10 frames per heat if it was possible (

	"The route for this level remains remarkably unchanged in the many years since the previous TAS was created. It starts off similarly by turning around and jumping down a deck. One big optimization over every other run of this level is how I utilize slight angle adjustments to save a large amount of time. I land entirely sideways from the deck drop, then do a short hop while slightly rotating left to instantly end up next to the wires to destroy the museum. A time save over Fog's TAS is that I skip the cutscene way sooner. To be honest I think that's mostly just because I can just manually insert one frame at a time while holding frame advance to find the spot where it skips. Couldn't imagine doing half of this run on actual Dolphin.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"One solid optimization is instead of grinding around the outside of the room after skipping the cutscene, I ollie, get a slope boost, then grind hop off of the inside rail. It makes the exit angle a lot better and I carry more speed by landing on flat than on a slope. When leaving the museum I do a trick to impress a Neversoft girl, then do two tight jumps from the pool to slide and from the slide to the flags.

[div class=p 
	"After I go up the flags and grab the tape, we get to the big "oh dear lord I need points" segment. After grabbing the S I do a seemingly awkward turn to jump down towards the next Neversoft girl. The reason for the turn is that if I went sharper left I would float on the underside of the ramp and lose a bunch of time. the route is pretty standard through the Nosebluntslide and then we get to the biggest change in the level.

[div class=p 
	"After the Nosebluntslide, instead of going for the E, we go right to lowering the boat. This is because the E is an almost 3 second detour that we could partially avoid by rearranging goal order. After lowering the boat the route looks similar to Fog, but instead of ending at the T we grind the rail and head back to get the E.

	"I did not expect this run to be so fast. I knew there were a decent amount of improvements over the years, but the time saves just kept rolling in. This run (provided I did the math correctly) would be a 5:52 with the normal RTA timing convention and PC loads. (Minor note: I forgot that PC players remove the movies so they don't get the cutscenes after completing Tokyo. I'm not sure exactly how much time keeping them loses but it could very well be a few extra seconds.)
