	"This is my first attempt at tasing 2 players, well, all i can say its hard
	$LF

	"This could be called a well optimized test run, it doesnt lack efforts, but the improvements are going to be hard to obtain and likely not very significiant to the final time

	"If this get the public attention, me and adelikat are considering doing a more refined work toward it, as a team submision
	$LF

	"On the quality matter i want to mention that adelikat didnt finded a way to beat my stage1, can arguably say he didnt tryed to deploy all his tasing powers against it, but pretty much to say this is yet good quality and not just shitty test run
	$LF

	"While doing this i learned that a 2 players TAS need a lot of attention, overall i think its not bad run, it is improvable tought, maybe

	"This is the famous NES games revisited on PC Engine system. A lots of change, yet it will feel very familliar too.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"First the graphics engine was totaly changed, it seem to be the precedent of Super Double Dragon on SNES, having fairly similar bigger sprites.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"The music are like all PCE CD games a complete instrumental soundtrack, the game also feature manga in between stages (skipped in this TAS)
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"For the rest, the control of bimmy and jimmy are intact, noticable change would be that the flying knee doesnt anymore toss you over the whole screen (and doesnt do anymore that wicked sfx sadly), double flying knee doesnt work either
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"I founded only 1 handy glitch (pretty crazy one tought), in stage4, i do pickup a grenade apparently at the exact moment the game doesnt like, as a result, the next ennemy spawn at the grenade location, bimmy is then litteraly having a ennemy in his hand, the idea is that trought this i can kill him faster than if he would have spawn in his original location, by killing bimmy... since in that case they both die in the process (that was messy to explain!)

	"A hacky LUA is available 
	[a class=extlink href=http://arukado.free.fr/TAS/DD2-PCE/DD2.lua rel=nofollow 
		"here
	]a
	", it does a bunch of stuff, this revision does count all kills up to stage5, so it can be used to watch until that point, yet, the hitbox are bad and not always working, i have more refined version for hitbox but it only work in stage1, i will try to fix it as much as i can but due to the hacky conception of this script, i might fail at it
