	": I enjoyed this run, and found it entertaining enough for its length, however, not as much as I enjoyed the 2 player runs. Some watching this run enjoyed it too, but a good chunk of the audience did not think this run was entertaining enough to warrant placing it in Moons. As much as I would like to see this published, this run is not eligible for the vault, and didn't gather enough support for anything higher, rejecting.
