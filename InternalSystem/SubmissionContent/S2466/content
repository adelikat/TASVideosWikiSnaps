	"Super Gussun Oyoyo is a puzzle game like a mixture of Lemmings and Tetris. Gussun and Oyoyo are the names of two treasure hunters. They explore a dungeon to find treasures. Unluckily, an earthquake breaks out while they are in the dungeon, and it makes the dungeon start to sink. The player controls blocks like peaces of Tetris, leading Gussun to the exit of the dungeon. The player has to clear the stages of the dungeon before submerging. If there are two players, the other character, Oyoyo appears and the players compete with each other for the score. The game was also released in European arcades under the name of "Risky Challenge".

	"This run starts from the stage 21 to get to the credits as fast as possible. Gussun starts to run if a peace drops with a thud nearby him or hits hard his head on the bottom of its corner. He never falls himself, even if he losts his floor, until he starts to walk. The run abuses two glitches. On the stage 30, the sound of the game gets glitched until the end of the stage 32 so the run can show you something unexpected. I don't know how the glitch occurs. Probably it is caused by when an specific peace rotates at an exact pixel. Also the other glitch is abused on the stage 37. If some peace pushes Gussun diagonally, exactly, he will be in the peace and it will be able to carry him quickly.
