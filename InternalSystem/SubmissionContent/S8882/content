	"Note that this run keeps the music on, while the RTA record turns it off. The sound slows down the game quite a bit, which is noticeable even on the first level which only requires you to go in a straight line yet the RTA run saves 0.1 seconds. So, some levels are a little slower than the RTA record. Still I think sound on is better (and it also provides a better test of the emulator.)

	"The author chooses to enable music, even at the expense of a few miliseconds per level. This is a sound decision (pun intended), as the music adds to the experience and the delay is barely noticeable, if at all. I would argue that any future submission that beats this one only on the basis of disabling the music should not be sufficient to obsolete this one (unless this allowed the execution of some type of skip or glitch).
