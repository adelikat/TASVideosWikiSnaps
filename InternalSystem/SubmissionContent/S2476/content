	" by 23 seconds. Most of the frames gained are due to the reduced  lag of the latest version of DeSmuME. However, around 5 seconds were due to the use of a vehicle known as "Dukes" that's faster than the police patrol used in Greenalink's run and the Comet, which is faster than the cabbie.

	"Being the only stage/mission you have to beat in order to see the credits, I used a glitch discovered by Greenalink to start the game with the last mission unlocked. The boat chase might seem to be flawed, but it's not. Since the minigun appears to cause 1 frame of lag per shot (discovered by Greenalink), I tried to make it so that the enemies dies as fast as possible. The hardest part of the chase was to shoot 2 barrels to get rid of Kenny's men.

	"This time, during the chase, I failed to cause the Police vehicles to crash. The use of cheats to raise my wanted level for some reason caused the game to freeze for 50+ frames. Maybe it's because of the huge amount of vehicles in the screen, but yeah, I didn't increase my wanted level.

	"The fight with Kenny is the hardest part of the run. Not only do I not have a weapon, but he also has a sword, which can kill me in one hit. I had to move around for several frames in order to prevent him from slashing me. I also mainipulated Kenny so that he will back up to the fountain. If he doesn't, my roundhouse kick would just knock him down instead.
