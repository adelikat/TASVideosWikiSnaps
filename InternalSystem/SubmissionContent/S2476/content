	"Being the only stage/mission you have to beat in order to see the credits, I used a glitch discovered by Greenalink to start the game with the last mission unlocked. The boat chase might seem to be flawed, but it's not. Since the minigun appears to cause 1 frame of lag per shot (discovered by Greenalink), I tried to make it so that the enemies dies as fast as possible. The hardest part of the chase was to shoot 2 barrels to get rid of Kenny's men.

I had to move around for several frames in order to prevent him from slashing me. I also mainipulated Kenny so that he will back up to the fountain. If he doesn't, my roundhouse kick would just knock him down instead.
