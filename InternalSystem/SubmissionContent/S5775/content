	"Keitai Denjuu Telefang is an odd imitation of Pokemon. Up to three Denjuus can participate in battles, and type effectiveness is based on a six-way equivalent of rock-paper-scissors. Critical hits and misses were obtained by waiting frames. Random encounters could not be avoided. Most "trainer" battles were avoided. Only Denjuus with maximum or near-maximum base attack, maximum attack growth and decent type effectiveness against bosses were recruited. Due to the avoidance of battles, it was simply easier to recruit Denjuus from new areas to increase attack (as opposed to leveling up).

	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		" Passwords can be used to obtain very strong Denjuu, but are not used in this run.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Encounters are triggered when the encounter timer reaches 800 (3*256 + 32). Timer is reset upon entering a battle, and upon entering a big tree. Timer stops upon receiving a non-story phone call, but I haven't found a way to intentionally trigger phone calls. That would be the best way to stop encounters.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" When you do receive a phone call but don't want to answer it (usually when you need to talk to an NPC), it is faster to open the map to cancel the call.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Certain "battle start" animations are faster than others, but only marginally (~3 frames). The circle animation, tied with certain others, is fastest.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Holding B and running through tall grass increases the timer extremely quickly, so I tend to press B once every few frames to slow it down. (I only realise this halfway into the run)
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Certain walking trainers can be bypassed by save-resetting; player position is preserved, but trainer positions are reset.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Trainers walking paths can also be blocked by your Denjuu (battles are only triggered when the main character is seen), forcing them to turn around. See 1:14:10 for an example.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" General battle strategy is to critical and KO enemies before they take their first turn, if possible. If an enemy gets a turn, they should use their charging attack, if they have it. The text is very fast, and they can often be defeated before the attack is fully charged. Charging attacks appear more often later into the game. Otherwise, enemies should use harmless stat (de)buffs such as Attack-up or Defense-down to avoid damage. Failing that, just manipulate for a miss. It is best for enemies to target (and miss) the Denjuu who will have the next turn, as this speeds up the switch transition.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Denjuus will forcibly join after many trainer battles, but most of them have bad stats and there is no real way to reject them.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Generally, I can't believe this game doesn't have a legitimate equivalent to Pokemon's Fly. A good portion of this game is spent traveling previously visited routes.
