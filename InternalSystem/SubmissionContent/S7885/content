	", the submission text is lackluster and thus the goal is unclear. If it's "fastest 1P time with Yoshi" then this is definitely suboptimal as damage is unnecessarily taken several times. If it's "playaround beating 1P with Yoshi" then it's simply not more entertaining than the existing publication, and not much entertaining in general because it misses several tricks both RTA runners and TASers use.

	"Regardless, this demonstrates a lack of research and effort put in to the run. As Noxxa said, you should take the time to research as much as you can about a game before making a run. Especially for Smash 64, which is now 20 years old and undoubtedly has many tricks and discoveries found over the years. The beauty of a TAS is that you have all the time in the world to make it as perfect as it can be, so you should make the most of it before submitting.
