	$LF
]p
[p 
	"1-1: The jump after the elevator is almost impossible to perform, you need exactly the right speed for that.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"1-2: The platform at the very top must be hit to let it start moving and at the same time, you need to land on it.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"1-3: I need to wait for the elevator in that stage, so it would be useless to be faster in the beginning part.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Boss 1: There are "missed shots", and it's possible to do the last hit about 60 frames faster, but they would all go lost due to a frame rule.
	$LF
	"I tested what happens if you die while the boss is killed - the battle just starts all over again.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Boss 2: If you find a way to avoid one more damage, this one could be sped up.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"3-1: Absolutely straight forward, jumping through a cactus.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"3-3: The goal line must be passed as slow as possible, so i use "instant stop".
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Boss 3: Exactly as fast as in a non-assisted run because of frame rules and boss design. I hope it was at least a little interesting.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"4-3: I found that shortcut when I was just playing around a little. You need to be in invulnerable mode while performing it, otherwise you just fall down.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Boss 4: As far as I know, all events at this boss are timer-based.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"5-2: I could use a rather large shortcut here.
	$LF
	"I'm picking up the bird seed because i do have to wait there for manipulating an enemy, and without collecting it, i would lose several seconds later on.

	"Final boss: Taking damage is way faster than avoiding it because you can also be hit by the explosions.

	": The game behaves different on different sound settings. I saved 6 or 7 frames of random lag and 9 or 10 frames for a jump which is  impossible to do on the other movie for unknown reasons. I previously had to cut out two jumps as they suddenly became impossible too. I consider the difference as purely emulator-specific. And as no one seems to be able to encode the faster version, I think it should be reverted to the older file. In case of publication, it might be easiest to write it somewhere as a sidenote like this: "There is a slightly faster version available, see submission text for details."
