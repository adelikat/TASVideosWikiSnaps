	": The game behaves different on different sound settings. I saved 6 or 7 frames of random lag and 9 or 10 frames for a jump which is  impossible to do on the other movie for unknown reasons. I previously had to cut out two jumps as they suddenly became impossible too. I consider the difference as purely emulator-specific. And as no one seems to be able to encode the faster version, I think it should be reverted to the older file. In case of publication, it might be easiest to write it somewhere as a sidenote like this: "There is a slightly faster version available, see submission text for details."
