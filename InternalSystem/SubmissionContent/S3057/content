	"The run aims to beat all levels as fast as possible without using surrender. I used new warp glitch that allows skipping a lot of rooms. While an enemy pushes a black ball that Muddy is carrying, hitting by another enemy takes Muddy to a square where he can’t go to. This trick only works upper side and left side of the screen. Also it only works in level 2, level 3, level 4, and level 6.
