	"Mole Mania, known as Moguranya (モグラ～ニャ) in Japan, is an action puzzle game. The main character is a mole named Muddy Mole, whose wife and children have been kidnapped by the farmer, Jinbe. Muddy has to go to Jinbe Land and save his family. In the game, the player will solve puzzles by moving a black ball to a gate. However, there are many obstacles and enemies in the way. Therefore the player will dig into ground to find ways around them.

	"The run aims to beat all levels as fast as possible without using surrender. I used new warp glitch that allows skipping a lot of rooms. While an enemy pushes a black ball that Muddy is carrying, hitting by another enemy takes Muddy to a square where he can’t go to. This trick only works upper side and left side of the screen. Also it only works in level 2, level 3, level 4, and level 6.
