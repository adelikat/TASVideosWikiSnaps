	"This submission aims to 100% the game, collecting all 19 Berries. Since the game does not have a percentage display, I believe "all berries" is an appropriate branch name. The movie was made using the publicly available official Linux Build, available for pay-what-you-want on itch.io:

	"The game now features 30 levels (hah, just like Celeste Classic!) and also doesn't have a boss level anymore. The game also doesn't use separate buttons for jumping and for boosting as the original does. However, being on similar engines, all the tricks from my submission for the original are still in use, most notably pole jumping.

	"This game also features THREE autoscrollers, which sadly loses us a LOT of time.

	"Finally, the most notable trick is the level 14 clip. After collecting the berry, we can straight up walk into the wall to the left and skip getting the key altogether. This saves a lot of time as we otherwise have to wait for a full platform cycle.
