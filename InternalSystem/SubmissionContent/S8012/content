	"Jet Set Willy is the sequel to Manic Miner and the second game in the Miner Willy series. It's also the first "modern" game - it's open world, it has DRM, and the original release had many game-breaking bugs rendering the game impossible to complete. Willy wakes up in a bathtub with the tap still running after a party he's too hungover to remember, and has to tidy up the entire house in order for his housekeeper Maria to let him go to bed.

Jet Set Willy does not attempt to control its framerate, it simply processes the game as quickly as it can at all times. 128K versions of the Spectrum run their Z80 processor at a slightly higher clock rate, and the +2A and +3 also have some improvements in memory access speeds. As a result, the game runs fastest on these models. The +3 is a disk-based system, and Jet Set Willy has never been officially released on disk, so the run uses the +2A and loads the game from tape.

		" address 59901 from 213 to 82, which fixes a misplaced arrow in The Attic, preventing it from flying off the screen and through the game code, corrupting everything and making many rooms kill you instantly on entering them. Amazingly enough, this bug doesn't prevent the game from being completed, as you can save the attic run until your last few items and there is a safe path back to Master Bedroom - but it does prevent it from being completed twice, as restarting the game doesn't fix the corrupted rooms.

	"As mentioned previously, Jet Set Willy does not attempt to control its framerate. When there is more to process, the game runs slower. As a result, the first action of the run proper is to turn off the in-game music, as this provides a considerable speed boost to the game. (In RTA runs, runners often turn off the music prior to starting their run, but this is slower under TAS timing.)
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The game also runs slower when there are more lives available. Death abuse in general save more time than can be gained from this, but items are collected in an order which puts these deaths as early as possible, to maximise the benefit from both the death abuse and the increase in game speed. This change in speed is not as dramatic as that from turning off the music, but is still significant:

	"In addition, the run attempts to minimise jumping, as the game slows down a little while in the air. In best conditions, the game runs at approximately one in-game frame every 0.07 seconds. For the rest of this section, "frame" refers to in-game frame.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Each frame, inputs are read twice: once for movement (checking left, right, and jump keys) and once for other actions (pausing, turning music on/off, and quitting). While in the air, the movement checks are skipped as Willy cannot be controlled while airborne.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Willy moves horizontally at two pixels per frame, whether on the ground or in the air. This means he travels across a cell in four frames. If this movement would cause him to enter a cell which contains a wall, it will be skipped and he will not move horizontally. Willy can turn around at any time while on the ground, but will not move that frame (and a jump performed that frame will result in a stationary jump).
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Willy's jump carries him in a fixed arc, unless interrupted by a wall or floor. A jump lasts 18 frames, reaching a peak of 20 pixels above his starting position, allowing him to collect any item up to five cells above the ground he's standing on. This jump can be performed while stationary or while walking, the latter landing him 36 pixels away on flat ground. If he hits a ceiling during the jump, the jump will be cancelled and all movement, both vertical and horizontal, will stop, leaving him to start falling the next frame at 4 pixels/frame. If his horizontal movement is impeded during the jump, the jump will continue as normal without the horizontal movement until either the wall is no longer in the way or the jump ends. If Willy lands on solid ground before the jump is fully completed, the jump will be cancelled and he can continue walking without stopping. If he lands on completing the jump, there is a single frame in which he cannot move. If he is still in the air on completing the jump, he starts falling at 4 pixels/frame.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Internally, staircases are cells which teleport Willy up or down a cell when you walk into/off them in the correct direction. His visual position is then lowered depending on his horizontal position to create the appearance of a smooth ascent/descent. Collision detection with guardians is done using his visual position, but everything else uses his internal position, most notably jumps (which can cause him to instantly shoot upwards six pixels before even starting the jump). If jumping onto a staircase means he lands on a cell having already moved partway into the next cell, he won't be warped upwards but instead will be able to walk through the staircase (this is an intended mechanic). It's also possible to jump through a staircase without landing on any of the cells that make up the staircase, in which case Willy will just continue his jump as normal; the run usually does this as it is faster than landing on it and falling.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Ropes swing in rooms in a fixed pattern; if Willy touches a rope he will grab onto it. Moving in the direction the rope is currently swinging climbs down the rope, and moving in the opposite direction climbs up it. Some ropes allow him to climb to the top of the screen and enter the screen above, and others... shouldn't, but a well-timed jump can make that happen anyway, which usually results in re-entering the screen at the bottom of the room and resetting the room cycle as a result.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"When Willy is standing on a conveyor, the game will internally press the movement key corresponding to the conveyor direction. In most cases this will force him in the direction of the conveyor. However, if both left and right inputs are pressed together, he will continue moving in whatever direction he is currently moving. This means if he walks onto a conveyor, or jumps onto it from below, he can walk against the direction the conveyor is moving. However, if he falls onto it from above, he can only stall movement before being forced in the direction of the conveyor. Many conveyors are disguised as normal platforms, and even some staircases are conveyors.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Willy can safely walk off a floor and land up to four cells (32 pixels) below; when jumping he can land up to two cells (16 pixels) below the starting point of the jump. Falling any further will cause him to die on landing. He will also die on entering a cell which contains a nasty (static enemy), or if his sprite touches that of a guardian (moving enemy) or arrow.

	"All rooms start in a fixed state, and none of the enemies are affected by Willy's actions. As such, there is no RNG and no enemy manipulation in the run. On death, the entire room resets back to its state on entering the room, including Willy himself. The exception to this rule is items, which remain collected even after death; this allows for death abuse by collecting items earlier than they should be able to by dropping onto them from far above, or by dying after collecting the item to warp back to the room entrance.

The staircase here is a conveyor, but even if it wasn't it would still be faster to jump through the staircase to collect the item. The monk always faces away from the altar for some reason.

This pair of rooms is similar to the Amoebatron caverns in Manic Miner; a long winding upward path with lots of vertical enemies. The conveyor tiles in West of Kitchen are corrupted, something that will become a common theme throughout the game. We reach the top and collect the item in The Banyan Tree, before heading right into The Nightmare Room where we turn into a flying pig and dodge flying Marias and a foot in order to collect a beer mug. The staircase and conveyor tiles are corrupted due to some misaligned data, but this doesn't affect gameplay. We then die to pink Maria #2 to instantly warp back to where we entered the room.

After some more corrupted graphics in A bit of tree we reach Under the Roof, where another bug prevents you from going back down as you collide with the plane at the top of the room, instantly killing you. We head left into Conservatory Roof where more graphics corruption hides the fact that there's a conveyor in the room, and collect the four items in there (it's impossible to collect the left-most item without dying).

	"We drop down into Orangery and collect the three items in there before jumping down into Swimming Pool. There's an item in the Swimming Pool, but it can't be seen in normal gameplay. In order to determine whether an item should be collected, the game checks to see if anything white is touching it - in this room, the rope is white, and technically fills the whole room, so the item is collected as soon as you enter the room. We use the rope to save us from fall damage and head to the West Wing.

[div class=p 
	"Cold Store is the first "interesting" room of the game when it comes to the TAS; there are a lot of different ways to approach it due to the items that can only be collected by jumping between the rope and the platforms, all of which have enemies on with their own cycles. The strategy used to involve entering from the top (saving time in Back Stairway) and collecting all items in three rope cycles by jumping over the pink ice cream a couple of times, but then it was discovered that it could be reduced down to two by entering on the lower platform, using the first rope swing to collect the third item from the top on the way to the rope and the second item from the top on the way back; we then drop down to the floor collecting the lowest item, and then quickly make our way to the rope, climb up it, and jump when we're just high enough to make the upper platform, collecting the top item on the way out.

[div class=p 
	"We leave via Back Door, the emptiest room in the game, and temporarily ignore items in The Tool Shed and The Beach as it's faster to collect them on the way back, instead opting to head straight to The Yacht/The Bow, another duo of rooms that form their own unit, and the leftmost point of Willy's mansion. The floor of the yacht in The Bow is another disguised conveyor, but fortunately we weren't planning on stopping anyway.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"We try to collect the item in The Yacht, but are delayed a little. Remember how the Swimming Pool item was auto-collected because the rope was white? The same principle applies here but in reverse - due to the Spectrum only being able to display two colours in the same cell, when Willy and a guardian share a cell, Willy will have the guardian's colour in that cell, meaning he's no longer white and not able to collect the item until the guardian moves away. After that we collect the item in The Bow as normal.

]div
[div class=p 
	"Coming back to The Beach, we execute our first wrongwarp - by jumping on the rope at the right time, we can get higher than we're supposed to be able to, which allows us to jump and exit the room from the top of the screen. The room that's above The Beach is... The Beach, so we reappear at the bottom of the screen but with the rope cycle reset. This allows us to jump over to the item (or items - the sandwich is actually two items, presumably each slice of bread counts separately?) and jump onto the rope sooner than we otherwise could have done.

	"Another room driven by enemy cycles, we time our jump onto the conveyor so we can follow behind the upper green monk as closely as possible. The intention is that you jump onto the wall that sticks out to collect the item, and then drop down back onto the conveyor and then the ground; by timing the jump exactly right you can clip into the wall  (by jumping into the corner perfectly, the frame prior to collision Willy is both above and to the right of the wall, so neither the horizontal nor vertical checks detect the solid block), allowing us to collect the item and fall straight downwards. Normally this distance would be too far to fall, but when we finish our jump arc and the game realises we're inside the block it pushes us down by a cell, keeping us safe.

The main feature of these rooms is the conveyor they share; we can hold our position on it when we first land on it which is wholly unnecessary but looks a little surprising, and we have to wait for the razor cycle to let us through anyway. After entering Under the Drive we have a required frame-perfect jump with little warning (and there's no way of avoiding it!).

We go Under the MegaTree and over The Bridge (which seems to be missing its titular feature) into The Off Licence, the rightmost room in the game. Because of its dead-end nature it's very suitable for a deathwarp, and some experimentation lead us to the route shown in the run, which allows us to catch the green alarm while it's still heading right, after collecting all twelve items in the room.

The guardian in Halfway up the East Wall is quite restrictive in when we can pass it, and the slope there is another sneaky conveyor; failure to jump off it immediately results in being sent off the edge of the wall and into an infinite death loop.
