	"-The previous author described the game just fine - the objective of the game is to collect all of Freddy's bones in the game, defeat him in the final stage, Elm Street High, and toss his bones into the furnace. There are several mini-bosses throughout the game, all of which you need to fight again in the final stage before taking on Freddy.

	"-There is nothing hard about this game. This movie is 3:06 faster than the currently published movie for one simple reason - the boss battles are way faster. Obviously, he wasn't aware that the "Dream Warriors" can be accessed at the end of every stage once the music changes and the boss appears. This also eliminates the necessity to wait for that extensive period of time to slip into the dream sequence, which he clearly thought was the only way to use the Dream Warriors during the final battles. Overall, the dream sequence in the stage only saves one reverse jump, hardly worth the wait. Other than this large oversight, there were only about 10-12 errors in the original movie.

	"Ironically, the first two bosses are the most difficult to defeat fast. The rest fall easy. I had an unlucky spawn with the third boss, but I used all three warriors rather than the simple "Acrobat" to make up for the time I would have lost.
