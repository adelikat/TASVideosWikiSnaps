	"Ok fellas. I finaly made, what I think, is a decent run of this great game for Genesis. It was extreamly hard at some times. Took alot of patience to put this together.

	"I do by purpose miss some shots. This is to charge the weapon up so that I can fire a more powerful shoot.

	"Some times you might notice that I jump around alot, and just looking silly. This is because you can't charge the weapon as you walk. How ever it does charge as you jump. So I do save time even though it looks stupid. Jumping around all the time though won't be good for time. Only at some points as I see it.

	"I don't use the other powerups I'm getting. Only those small red balls. This is to charge the weapons even faster. This help cutting time down alot. Those lightningbolt icons is a special attack, but it seems as powerful as the normal weapon loaded to max so. It's not saving any time because he pulls of a long annoying animation.
