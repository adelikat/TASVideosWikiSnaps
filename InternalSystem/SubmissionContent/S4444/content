	"I meant to run this a long time ago, but it wasn't possible to accurately run because of an emulator bug in Gens where Lakitu would spawn infinite spinys. An emulator without the bug has been out for a short while, and after seeing a WIP of this game on the forum I felt like I finally had to finish it. The game is very straightforward as expected of a Chinese pirate. It is also programmed pretty poorly as expected of a Chinese pirate.
