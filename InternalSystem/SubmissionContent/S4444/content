	"I meant to run this a long time ago, but it wasn't possible to accurately run because of an emulator bug in Gens where Lakitu would spawn infinite spinys. An emulator without the bug has been out for a short while, and after seeing a WIP of this game on the forum I felt like I finally had to finish it. The game is very straightforward as expected of a Chinese pirate. It is also programmed pretty poorly as expected of a Chinese pirate.

	"Only the 2-3-4 warp in 1-2 and the world 5 warp in 4-2 are implemented (the one in 1-2 being backwards from NES SMB). No vines are implemented. Springs are implemented but none are seen in this run.

	"It is faster to lose the mushroom in 1-2 and get another one for 5-4 than to get on the ceiling of 1-2 by a few frames.

	"In castle 6-4, there is an unavoidable fire bar that will damage you as you run past. There are edited ROMs that fix this, but the original pirate cart has this bug. As there are no mushrooms in this level, if you die or otherwise are not Blue Sonic when reaching this fire bar, there is no way past it.
