	"For a 'choose-your-own-adventure', there's a lot of 'choose' and 'adventure' but not much 'you-own'. There is, of course, some flexibility with your choices and not every incorrect option will result in a game over, though one wrong option while playing a game can lead you to a dead end. The TAS thankfully doesn't struggle with finding correct answers and it also means we don't have to deal with results being changed after a game over which is designed to make the game more challenging. Despite the limited freedom, there are numerous different routes and I believe I've managed to find this by going over all possible ones.
