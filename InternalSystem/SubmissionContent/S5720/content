	"Donkey Kong arguably has the least ambiguous ending point out of all G&W games (except other Donkey Kong related games). In fact, its ending point is probably not any more ambiguous than that of Donkey Kong on NES. Therefore, I recorded this movie, which finishes 8 loops(the speed of barrels seems to stop increasing after this point) in Mode B of Donkey Kong on Game & Watch Collection.
