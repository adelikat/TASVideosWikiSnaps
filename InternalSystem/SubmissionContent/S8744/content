	" is an unlicensed game made for the NES and Sega Genesis, featuring - you guessed it - 52 different video games. The NES version was published in 1991, whereas the Genesis version was published in 1993. Both versions were published by Active Enterprises.

	"Star Evil is game 33/52 in the Sega Genesis version of Action 52. The concept is pretty much the same as Sunday Drive, Slalom and Magic Bean among others. 9 levels of autoscrolling where you have to dodge the objects and end input as early as you can. Except this time, you're navigating a spaceship avoiding other spaceships on the same planet, as the scrolling gets faster and faster over time.

	"The game keeps scrolling for a few seconds after dying, which can be used to end input earlier than expected. On Levels 5 and 6, we lose a life on the same frame as completing the level. Luckily, this doesn't crash the game and instead we advance to the next level at the cost of 1 life.
