	"After having gone through a number of B.A.S.I.C. written games, I have discovered a number of strategies to help force the RNG to my liking. Even though this technique helps out tremendously, the placement of the items are still cannot be controlled to produce exact locations of items. So, since this game is very short, I have ran multiple scenarios and ran across a situation that allowed for me to get the bombs without searching for keys, jumping over pits, or having to fight the blind guardians...all within the shortest route that I found. So in essence, this is a "seeded RNG" run that was applied after the loading of the game to minimize the longevity of the "Load" command....where it was buffered to be faster. It does not alter the game code at all.
