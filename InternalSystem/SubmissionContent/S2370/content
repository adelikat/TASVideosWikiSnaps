	"Sonic 1 Return to the Origin is a great hack of Sonic 1 by carretero. In this hack, you play through every level of sonic 1 from the end to the beginning (excepting final zone, which is played regularly). Naturally, this is a great change of pace for a sonic speedrunner, and a level system worthy of speedrunning. With that frame of mind, I set off to do my first ever tool assisted speedrun on this game. It is a work in progress, so expect better later.

	"A tool assisted speedrun is a speedrun which attempts to show a game pushed entirely to its limits. The game is played on a an emulator, with lowdown and savestates, until a perfect input is devised, beating the entire game as quickly as possible. This is my first ever tas, and is extremely unoptimized. As such, I plan on re-tasing the game at a later date, in the hopes of getting under 14 minutes. However, for a first tas, this is (in my opinion), fairly well done.
