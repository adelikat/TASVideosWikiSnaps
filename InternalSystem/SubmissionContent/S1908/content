	"Happy April Fool's day! A while back, I made a submission of river city ransom (
	(__wikiLink|1662S)
	") that became controversial because it stops input about 3 minutes before the game is actually won, by hiding until the final boss kills himself. This run, however, plays half a game of soccer (outside of North America: Football) and wins, despite having no input besides choosing a team, setting the strategy, and the kickoff. The teammates do all the work, and the captain just stands around.
