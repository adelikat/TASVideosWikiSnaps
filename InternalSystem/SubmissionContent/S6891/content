	"This appears to be a 781 frame improvement to the original, but since we are dealing with longer loading times and the inclusion of a longer bios, the time save is likely much more than that.  I wasn't able to make a comparison encode due to PCSX having quite terrible encoding support, so to compare both runs, I went by IGT.  It's not 100% accurate due to the timer lagging any time the game loads, but it's all I have to work with.

For the boss in that stage, we dont want him to do his spinning disk move because we do less damage to him when doing the spin attack.

	"To wrap this submission up, I just wanted to say the reasons why I did this game was because the original movie seemed unoptimized (not only due to out of date TASing techniques but even some emulation bugs that caused it to be slightly slower), not only that but since the original TAS was made on PCSX, which I would consider one of the worst emulators used on the site.  I figured it would be awesome to update the run to current emulation standards.

However I discovered that there’s a secret stage you can unlock if you have sram stored in the memory card of the first Strider game completed.  So that will have to be something I’ll look into when the time comes.

	"So, this movie. It's very good! It's very good. The glaring emulation bug in the current published run was something I always wanted to see fixed in general, but to see it done in a run that also cuts out a huge chunk of time as well is a really lovely sight. Excellent work on optimization and finding new techniques and strategies to handily overcome the huge "time loss" from the BIOS. We've already discussed the loading screen shortening issue, but to sum it up here: It won't affect the judgement due to it being a fairly obtuse improvement (clearing the screens ASAP does in fact cause longer loads), being found so late in the run's development, and being impossible to implement without requiring the entire run to be redone from scratch. Plus, having a new movie will be much more beneficial for future improvements and comparisons... And I'm super glad that emulation bug is finally obsoleted.
