	""This game is ...weird. I watched the longplay to actual figure out what this game is about. I mean, I think that both of us know that their is a ColVision version of this game, which has quite a few more screens on the normal difficulty. When you asked me to help, I thought I was in for a treat. I played the ColVision version as a kid, and so I tried this version. Way different, and infact there are longjumps which I found interesting. That's all I have to say. :P -Echo"
