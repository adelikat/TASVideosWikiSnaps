	"Playing at arcade have to press A rapidly for a short moment. Unlike in Adelikat's Gradius run, Gradius 3 doesn't use many speed upgrade. You can choose your Type of weapons, or your custom weapon. I don't use missile in this run, it causes lag. I don't use reduce in this run, it makes the game too easy. I used standard options to create the pattern like in Adelikat's Gradius run to turn this game into art form, and fast boss fight with E-Laser. There are 10 stages in this game. I used E-Laser to quickly take out the boss than other lasers. I skipped the bonus stage, its boring. If I have 3 or more options, option eater will appear in Stage 2, 4, 5, and 6. If the option eater touches your options, it get taken away, so avoid it at all cost. If I have 2 or less options, option eater will not appear.
