	"+ making the movie was a lot of luck manipulating enemy hits; going for the same hit 20 times means only 1 out of 20 will connect. i beat the game very quick, upgrading strength to the limit first; thus doing more damage on my super attack. after that i upgrade life, so that i can use the super more later on. (it takes a block of life to use)
