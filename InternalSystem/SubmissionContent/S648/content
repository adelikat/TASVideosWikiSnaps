	"+ making the movie was a lot of luck manipulating enemy hits; going for the same hit 20 times means only 1 out of 20 will connect. i beat the game very quick, upgrading strength to the limit first; thus doing more damage on my super attack. after that i upgrade life, so that i can use the super more later on. (it takes a block of life to use)

	": Wouldn't have been a terrible choice for a game if it had some glitch to knock everyone out with insane combos, but unfortunately the player only has around 4 attacks, and uses them in the same pattern over and over. Also, the playing quality isn't very high. Rejecting.
