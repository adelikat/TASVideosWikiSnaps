	"This NES Rambo TAS is almost 2 minutes shorter than the previous version mostly due to a previously unknown wall clipping glitch.  The glitch allows Rambo to scale vertical walls on the right side of the screen, which allows for some substantial shortcuts and route changes in certain parts of the game.

	"A few individual rooms were improved from the previous run, but some rooms are a few frames slower.  I had very bad luck with enemy placement in certain rooms that was unavoidable without using even more time to get a new pattern.  Notably, the rocky cliff jumping room requires two short waits compared to none in the previous version.

	"In the floating eye boss room, the fence can be clipped/climbed.  I was able to do this and get a frame-perfect knife hit on the boss to prevent him damaging me, but while this method was more entertaining, it was about 70 frames slower.

Once was a bubble, and the other was a bullet in the final POW camp area.  That's why you see what looks like extra movement - it was necessary to avoid damage.

	": I've seen a lot of people suggesting Vault for this run, which makes the "avoids damage" a sort of flaw. I looked into it further and found a way to cancel damage, allowing for a ton of time saved over the course of the run. However, this alone might not be enough to cause a rejection, but I also just found tons of other simple optimizations to save time over the course of the TAS. I'm working on an improvement and have a WIP linked through
