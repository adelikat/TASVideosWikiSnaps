	": The point of showcasing a hack is to actually play it, not just skip the entire thing through Pokemon's increasingly broken library of glitches. A glitchless TAS that shows the game off may be publishable under the new hack rules, but something like this I feel can go no further than Playground. Neat demonstration, but ultimately pointless in terms of properly showcasing the changes made in the hack.
