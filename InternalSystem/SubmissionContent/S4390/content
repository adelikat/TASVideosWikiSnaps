		"Note from Grincevent: I mostly worked alone for this new version of the run, because it was not a very big project, only two levels and two bosses have been redone. But GoddessMaria still helped, for example by suggesting using death to save time. It all started when Thevlackdemonn2294 came up with a new interesting, glitchy and really fast strategy for Angel Island 1. Then I had some kind of revenge to take against Egg Rocket. The two bosses were redone simply because they had to, due to a different RNG and hex editing. So, here you have a "little" update to the run since most of it was not changed; that's why I'm keeping the previous submission text and I'll just add notes in italics where new things happen.

The main cause is her lack of typical Sonic-type moves, but she has her own unique moveset (very hammer-centric) along with related useful tricks. First, Amy Rose can't turn into a ball at the player's will, unlike Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and Samus. Her jumps by themselves are not attacks either, again unlike Sonic, Luigi, Knuckles and...No, not Samus, she needs the screw attack and that doesn't count. The answer to "how do I attack, then?" is obviously to use Amy's piko piko hammer, but let's just see in detail what she can do.

Don't laugh, this is an attack move! The only problem is the recovery time...
	[br

	"-speaking of (real) attack moves, B is the hammer. On the ground it kills Amy's movement and has a big recovery time too; pressing B again starts another hit after the first one that makes Amy move forward a little and have a better reach. Hey, that is a combo! Particularly useful to know since all normal enemies die in one hit. In the air, the hammer is a nice attack in an arc in front of the player, it can be used to bounce once on an enemy or a breakable object, too.

Its basic function is to attack and to be able to bounce on things, like with a regular jump from the other characters, but there is more. The most interesting point is one specific property of that move: when performed, it immediately stops all horizontal movement (it puts the X speed back to zero), and Amy can start accelerating by going left or right instantly too. It is like having a portable wall that can be pulled out of thin air at will. The simplest application is to change direction sharply or adjust speed more precisely. Here is an example of a more advanced use of it: when taking a diagonal bumper, by doing that whirlwind attack right after the collision, Amy literally transforms that bumper into a normal, vertical one.

At this point, it's possible to start the action whenever we want by pressing any button, or we can just wait a little for it to start by itself. First thing: when it starts (pressing a button or waiting too long), the timer starts too, so there is only a real time malus if we delay it, the ingame time is safe. Second thing: As soon as the screen appears (act name, etc...), all the moving objects that happen to be present in that level start their routine. That includes moving platforms, moving bumpers, retracting spikes... Everything that is not an enemy, it seems. So here is the conclusion, it's possible to pick the state in which all those moving things will be by delaying the beginning of an act.

Since I discovered some new tricks when working on it (and all the other acts after that), I think I didn't have the full "toolbox" of techniques that are used in the whole run in my mind at all times, especially in the beginning of the level. And when hex editing made me lose some frames after having redone Angel Island (there is some randomness to the transitions when the scenery explodes in Egg Rocket), that was the perfect opportunity to go back and grab some bonus frames.

I tried to use this one in the previous movie, but only to be stuck in the floor then sent back up, I just didn't play enough with the X position and subpixels at the time...

The aforementioned pain coming from the run itself along with other issues, including from my last submission... but that is for another story! I was starting this alone on behalf of those that were looking to see a TAS with Amy as well as a '100%', when it was revealed that my attempt was not good enough after seeing VanillaCoke's early WIP... I then asked to work on it with him and while he didn't do much else aside from Neo Green Hill Zone, he has taught a few things as well. Eventually, Grincevent and I began working on this run together as VanillaCoke's NGHZ work was also being improved on. We both learned a great amount of things as work was being done (with me learning more than anything). At the same time, the sting from the previous submission lingered in my mind and heart so I had stopped focusing on the run and lost motivation momentarily. When my focus returned to the run, I looked back and at my solo attempts and wondered what did I need to do to truly appeal to the masses while producing results...

	"My main task was being an "optimizer", so I didn't do a lot of route planning, except when I've suspected a possible better path by looking closely at the maps of the levels or when applying some new knowledge to create a shortcut. To use a metaphor, the drawing was already done (thanks to GoddessMaria and VanillaCoke), then I launched Gimp (Photoshop is not free and I'm poor) to apply some smoothing and change a couple of details. It means that the game was TASed at least twice to end up like it is now. But some acts have been redone more than that due to the discovery of new useful tricks, for example. Discovering little by little all the possibilities that the whirlwind attack offered was really fun, even if it caused me to redo Egg Rocket entirely for one new shortcut, ouch... It sounds like I was working alone after the others, but there was a lot of cooperation all the way to the end: I in fact started to search for improvements on earlier acts while GoddessMaria was doing the middle to end game, then sometimes we worked on the same boss at the same time to find solutions (boss manipulation and some strategy testing), or I remember asking her to (re)do a trick in the optimized version that I couldn't replicate despite all my efforts ^^. I didn't meet VanillaCoke at all on this project, I was too late to the party, but I'm sure I would have learned some tricks from him. Did I mention I enjoyed being part of this project? Have a good time watching it :)
