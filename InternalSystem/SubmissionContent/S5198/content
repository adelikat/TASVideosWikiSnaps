	"), which itself was known in development as Mega Man 8.5. Therefore, you can think of this game as Mega Man 8.75. It was released in 1999 exclusively for the Bandai WonderSwan, and therefore only hit the stores in Japan.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The game was developed by Layup Co., Ltd and published by Bandai, instead of by Capcom itself. Because of this, the game has several oddball quirks - the set of Robot Masters is more obscure than ever ("What's a Komuso?"), Dr. Wily plays no in-game role at all, the stage enemies more closely resemble Mechaniloids from the X series, shots can pass through screen transitions, weapons do not get refilled between stages at all, bosses have differing amounts of hit points, there are no boss refights, boss patterns are almost all completely fixed and they tend to get temporarily invincible a lot, boss weaknesses are not a thing as each weapon does set damage, there are only six or seven Robot Masters (depending on how you count the Clock Men), only four of which can be fought in a varying order, and Compas Man does not give any weapon at all.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Like the last time Capcom outsourced development for a handheld Mega Man game, the game involves time travel and one of the chief villains is a version of Mega Man from the future (called Rockman Shadow, or R-Shadow in short, this time around). This time around, R-Shadow and his band of misfit robots (calling themselves the "Dimensions") come from the future to ransack a city until Mega Man or Bass kill the lot. (No really, that's literally why R-Shadow went back in time according to the plot).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Before Mega Man or Bass go after R-Shadow, they need to face off against his six-and-a-half Dimensions first. Their names are Aircon Man, Konro Man, Dangan Man, Komuso Man, Clock Men (sic) and Compas Man (sic). After an intro stage, featuring the Grey Devil (which is just the Green Devil from Mega Man & Bass, but now in a greyscale handheld system), the first four of these bosses can be fought in any order. Following them, the Clock Men await, then Compas Man after that, then R-Shadow himself after that. That is just eight stages in total, fairly short for a Mega Man game.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"As with Mega Man & Bass, the player can pick between Mega Man or Bass at the start of the game. And as with that game, Mega Man's advantages include having a slide to reach low areas and a charged shot to defeat tough enemies better, while Bass has a dash, a double jump to reach high areas and a weaker multi-directional shot to defeat annoyingly placed enemies better. The weapons that they get from defeating bosses are also different, but only half the time.

	" About the run
	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"This run starts at the character choice. In this game, Mega Man is by far the better character for speedrun-related tasks. The main reason for this is that Bass' buster does half the damage Mega Man's does, and cannot charge up. This makes him 
	[em 
		"extremely
	]em
	" slow against boss battles, especially when considering that the bosses in this game have a lot of hit points, and that they, as mentioned before, tend to get invincible a lot. Because of this, Bass loses around a literal full minute in the intro stage alone. So, Mega Man it is.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Regarding routing, the first Dimension is an easy choice - Aircon Man. His Barrier Wind deals 10 points of damage to every boss and miniboss, can do two hits on stationary targets, and even more hits on enemies moving parallel to it and enemies next to walls. This makes it the weapon of choice against every boss other than Compas Man, and against most minibosses. In fact, I do not even use other weapons than Barrier Wind and the default Mega Buster until Compas Man's stage (the seventh stage in out of eight!).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Since Barrier Wind is the only relevant weapon at the routing stage, the rest of the route ends up barely mattering. Konro Man is done next, Dangan Man next (allowing a nice opportunity to refill Barrier Wind ammo from the ammo-costly Konro Man stage), and Komuso Man after that (another Barrier Wind-heavy stage). Clock Men, Compas Man and R-Shadow follow suit as per the game's predetermined order.

		"completely

	" unmanipulatable. This means that whenever I need a positive drop (such as a large weapon refill), I basically need to hope that I can kill an enemy on a certain frame where they will drop said refill. I usually have enough chances at drops or enough wiggle room that this works out, but in some tight cases I need to give up a few frames.
	$LF

[p 
	"There is relatively little randomness in this game. The RNG only comes into play for item drops, and for a small few boss actions (for example, the spread of the bones of the R-Shadow miniboss).

[p 
	"There is an odd trick involving climbing ladders, where if Mega Man stays at the top of a ladder (as high as possible without going up it) and waits for a certain amount of frames, pressing up will lift Mega Man up immediately, skipping the usual ladder-climb animation. This saves 5-10 frames on each ladder, depending on the delay required. The delay can be between 1 and 8 frames, depending on how many frames Mega Man has climbed the ladder for. For many ladders it was an interesting challenge to find the right number of frames to spend on the ladder, so that I could go up the ladder with only 1 frame of delay, or otherwise get up the ladder as soon as possible overall.

	"Entering a ladder from the top from a certain state at the right positioning will cause Mega Man to immediately drop downwards by ~32 pixels. This can be done either by ending a slide or dash on top of the ladder (which requires very convenient timing), or more commonly by jumping on top of the ladder. This is used anywhere Mega Man needs to drop down a ladder.

[h4 id=Screentransitionshooting
 
	" Screen transition shooting
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Unlike practically every other Mega Man game, enemies and projectiles are persistent and keep on moving whenever Mega Man goes through a screen transition. This means it is sometimes possible to kill enemies before Mega Man is even in the room yet, and it allows Mega Man to fire a few opening shots at a boss or mini-boss before the battle actually starts.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Note that when a boss is hit before his life bar is initialized, its hit points are already set, so it's not possible to quick-kill a boss like Mega Man 7. However, it will decrease the boss' hit points. If more than 8 points of damage are dealt, it will in fact reduce the maximum length of the lifebar when it is generated (and does so for every 8 points of damage). This gives the illusion that a charged shot does no damage, but it actually still does.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"It should be noted that this does not work for every boss, as some bosses such as Grey Devil, Konro Man or Komuso Man, start out invincible during the boss introduction.

This is useful to get more hits in with weapons such as Barrier Wind, which sometimes may spend a lot of time floating around or stuck in a wall without hitting anything, so you can call another one faster. This is used extensively in RTAs of this game, but in a TAS setting, it is usually slower than just letting the projectile dissipate as soon as possible normally.

	"I'm currently not planning to make a Bass ("Forte") run. He is not that distinct from Mega Man, other than a few double jump shortcuts in some stages, and that the intro stage - especially the boss battle - will be 
	[em 
		"much
	]em
	" slower. I have thought up a strategy of fixing his boss battle problems by getting the Bass Super Buster upgrade (which doubles Bass's buster damage, bringing it equal to Mega Man's, although still without a charge shot) in the shop after the intro stage. This, however, requires getting 20 big Bolt drops in the intro stage, from the 19 enemies in the stage, and with a none-too-friendly RNG system. Even though this will take quite some time, it still would save dozens of seconds in Aircon Man's stage. But with the RNG annoyances the game has, I don't feel that it is worth the frustration. After Aircon Man's stage, the run would also be mostly identical to the Mega Man run. The Forte Cyclone from Aircon Man functions the same as Mega Man's version, so bosses are practically all beaten the same way anyway. The only difference is that Bass' double jump would allow for minor time-savers throughout the stage, and he wouldn't have charged shots for some of the minibosses.
