	"First of all, I would like to thank the previous authors, who have found a lot of skills and made a lot of contributions to the game. Through this improvement, I found that the quality of their films is so high that I can't find much room for improvement....They have done well

	"4-4（It should be noted here that the faster landing on the ground after killing the boss can end the picture earlier. At first, I lost more than 20 frames in the boss battle. At first, I thought that the boss had some frame rules that caused me to lose frames. I tried for a long time to find the reason and solution, and finally I found that the reason for the lost frame number was that I didn't land quickly after killing the boss）=11
