	"Keitai Denjū Telefang (携帯電獣テレファング) is a series of video games produced by Smilesoft and published by Natsume. The games are monster-battling games, where the player contacts various creatures using a cell phone-like device called a D-Shot in order to get them to battle the foes he or she will encounter. The name of the series derives from Keitai, which is Japanese for "cell phone," since phoning creatures is an integral part of the game, and "fang," to symbolise the various beasts involved.

	"A 1890 frame improvement. Most of it comes from a slightly different route taken, such as swapping denjuu during the 5 minute wait and only recruiting 1 dragon. Also, because the last run's graphical glitches were distracting, I didn't trigger them this time. Once again, MisterChess did not do any actual TASing, but his knowledge in how the glitches work was so valuable, that without it, this run would've never existed. It is for this reason he deserves to be a coauthor.
