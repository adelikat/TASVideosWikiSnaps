	"Hammerin' Harry is a pretty simple platformer. Armed with a big hammer, you make your way through 5 levels, and the first 3 levels have bonus levels as well. At the end of each level there is a boss, and in some levels, there are also mini-bosses. In short, this game is a "normal" platformer, you won't have a hard time figuring out what's going on.

	"The goals need to be commented on: Getting points in the bonus levels actually wastes time - for example, in the first bonus level you are to kill enemies that jump down on you. For each kill, a counter will increase by 1. By the end of the bonus level, the counter will count down to 0, with a speed of 1 per frames.

	"In short, If I kill 48 enemies, the counter will have the value 48 when the bonus level is finished, and therefor I have to wait 48 frames for it to count down to 0. All in all, getting a high score in the bonus levels wasted about 100 frames or so, and they would probably be pretty boring if I were just to stand there and wait them out.

		"I've only found one glitch in this game, and that is the "walk on air" glitch. By moving to the right (or left) and attacking each 6th frame, the game will think that you stand on solid ground all the time. This allows you to walk on air! I haven't found any practical use of this trick, but I show off a little with it on level 3. Because the game thinks you stand on solid ground, you can also perform a jump while in air, if you jump on the exact right frame.
