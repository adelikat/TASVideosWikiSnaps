[p 
	"The story goes as following: On the night before Porky Pig's vacation starts, he goes to bed. Asleep, he starts having nightmares where he meets different scary characters. In order to wake up, he must travel through all of the levels in the game.

	"Notable graphical effects include parallax scrolling and a weather effect which means that every time the game is played the weather can be different. For example: sometimes it may be snowing and sometimes it may be raining.
