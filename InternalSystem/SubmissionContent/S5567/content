	"Quartet is a straightforawrd platformer/shooter for the SMS. Here I improve Sonikkustar's original run by 104 frames (not counting BIOS load time) due to small optimizations throughout the run.

	"With BizHawk 2.0 only a day old, here is an update to one of the last published runs remaining made in BizHawk 1.0! The current movie even uses the obsolete .tas extension, so I figured this was a good time to bring it up to currency. The run itself is a minor improvement with better RNG manipulation and slightly better gameplay especially in the ice world.

	"Frames were saved in most levels except level 1 and 6. Level 1 was already quite optimized, and level 6 desynced pretty badly with shot timings that for some reason were not even close to the original run, costing about 20 frames (the last boss fight is still a couple frames faster though.)
