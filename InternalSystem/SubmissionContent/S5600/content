	[em 
		"Karate Champ: Player Vs Player
	]em
	" is an arcade game developed by Technōs Japan and published by Data East in 1984.  This is the groundbreaking sequel to 
	[em 
		"Karate Champ
	]em
	".  As 
	[em 
		"Karate Champ
	]em
	" was the defining game of the one-on-one fighting genre, 
	[em 
		"Karate Champ: Player Vs Player
	]em
	" was surely the defining game of the one-on-one player vs. player fighting genre, which would become the preeminent genre for competitive video gaming in the early to mid-1990s.  Even now, players continue to compete in older games of this genre, and new games continue to be developed.  
	[em 
		"Karate Champ: Player Vs Player
	]em
	" was released less than two months after the release of 
	[em 
		"Karate Champ
	]em
	", but gameplay aside, the game received a fairly thorough overhaul.  The game features a new story, new and varied backgrounds, new and enhanced Bonus Intervals, much improved sound samples and opponent AI, and even an ending!

]div
[div class=p 
	"Press Up on the Right Joystick for 1 Frame.  Delay for 2 Frames.  Repeat as needed.  This technique begins and then immediately cancels a Round Kick, which causes the Hero to move to the right much more quickly than walking or jumping.  Round Kick is the only move that does not immediately set the Posture Delay Timer, which allows it to be immediately cancelled.  Using this technique, the Hero can move to the right at a rate of 6 pixels per each 3 Frames, or 2 pixels per Frame.  Additionally, the Hero will be ready to attack within 2 Frames after making such a move.

]div
[div class=p 
	"By delaying for as little as just 1 Frame, the Opponent can be manipulated to take a different action.  A delay Frame must be used on a Frame when Hero Status is Ready and the Posture Delay Timer is not active.  Delay Frames can be used at the start of a Match or between Frames of movement (walking or Rapid Advance).  Delay Frames can not be used while an attack Technique is being used without interrupting the Technique.  Note that this affords only a very limited degree of manipulation.

	"The Opponent can also be manipulated to respond in a particular manner by beginning a Technique, but not fully executing it.

	"Manipulate Time:
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The Hero begins 160 pixels distant from the Opponent.  This is a far greater starting distance than in 
	[em 
		"Karate Champ
	]em
	" (128 pixels in a Dojo Match, 96 pixels in a National Championship Match).  Because this distance is so great, even if the Opponent is defeated as quickly as possible, it is only a few Frames before an additional second of Time expires.  At the end of a Match, each second of Time remaining when an Opponent is defeated requires 6 Frames to be added to the Player's score.  As such, it is often faster to allow an additional second of Time to expire (to save time on the next transition) than to defeat the Opponent as quickly as possible.   Time stops decrementing when the Opponent is hit.  As such, the priority is not simply to hit the Opponent as quickly as possible with the Technique that requires the fewest Frames overall to complete, but to hit the Opponent as quickly as possible with the Technique that requires the fewest Frames to complete after the Opponent has been hit.  Although Back Round Kick requires more Frames overall to complete than Round Kick (51 Frames compared to 44), both of these Techniques require the same number of Frames (26 Frames) to complete after the Opponent has been hit.  As such, for a situation where it is faster to allow an additional second of Time to expire, Round Kick and Back Round Kick can be used interchangeably.  Note that Back Round Kick can not be used for this purpose until Girl 10: Match 2 and beyond.  Back Round Kick is preferred, as it scores more points (and is just plain cooler), though Round Kick is used on occasion to manipulate Lag or the RNG for a subsequent Round.
