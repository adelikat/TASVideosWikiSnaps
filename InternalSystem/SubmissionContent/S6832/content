	"Mercenaries is unlocked by completing the main game.  It is a timed minigame with the objective of scoring the most points before time runs out.  Per the intro of a map "Eliminate as many Ganados as you can before your evac chopper arrives!  Successive kills will result in earning you more points!"  Initially only Leon is selectable.  There are four other characters playable when unlocked after scoring 30000+ points in one of the four (unofficially named) maps:

It cannot shoot through any enemies.
