For other uses it was necessary to determine how many stages existed between opportunities to collect sausages.  Then when multiple stages existed between these opportunities, it was necessary to determine how long it took to complete each of those stages normally.  The longest of these stages was then selected to be the stage the sausages were used in.

This includes real media, not just emulation; while there were differences in the NTSC/PAL hardware, media from one region could be used on a system from the other region.  The only times games tend to have issues being run on an out-of-region system is if the game is specially coded to deal with a particular region's frame rate.

As NTSC runs at a bit higher framerate than PAL, the game can be completed faster in NTSC mode.  Other than gameplay speed, the only other notable difference is the pitch of various sound effects being slightly higher pitch in NTSC mode.
