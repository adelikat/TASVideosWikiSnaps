	"You are Police Constable Bobby trying to rescue Judy from her notoriously violent/abusive husband Punch, who (in this game) has locked Judy in a box.  You are tasked with guiding PC Bobby across 16 stages (from both the theatrical and video game definition) to reach Judy's box.  Along the way, you must rock the baby's cradle at the end of each stage to keep it asleep.

	"The biggest challenge in TASing this game was to determine on which stages to utilize the sausages.  The first few uses were easy, as stages with sausages available alternated.  For other uses it was necessary to determine how many stages existed between opportunities to collect sausages.  Then when multiple stages existed between these opportunities, it was necessary to determine how long it took to complete each of those stages normally.  The longest of these stages was then selected to be the stage the sausages were used in.

[p 
	"For what it's worth, many C64 games released in one region work perfectly well in the other region with no glitches or impact to gameplay.  This includes real media, not just emulation; while there were differences in the NTSC/PAL hardware, media from one region could be used on a system from the other region.  The only times games tend to have issues being run on an out-of-region system is if the game is specially coded to deal with a particular region's frame rate.
	$LF

[p 
	"Punchy runs equally well using either PAL or NTSC sync settings with no obvious glitches resulting from being played in one setting over the other.  As NTSC runs at a bit higher framerate than PAL, the game can be completed faster in NTSC mode.  Other than gameplay speed, the only other notable difference is the pitch of various sound effects being slightly higher pitch in NTSC mode.

	" to a North American release of this game, I have (as yet) been unable to confirm this elsewhere; therefore the submitted file uses PAL sync settings.  If the judge/staff feel this one reference is enough to warrant the game being run in NTSC mode for publication purposes, I have also created a .bk2 using NTSC sync settings which is available in
