	"A second version of this TAS was made from the monster fight in the submission process and I found new glitches such as: using NPC talking and movement to get OOB faster, pause cancel and SQ fights as soon as they're finished and using SQ to skip the MONSTER fight, as suggested by AKHEON .

	"Most of the time combos are not effective, but they're used for a little bit as they are more entertaining and i wasn't being able to hit with the fastest string. Usually if i spam some moves, they're the fastest way to kill the enemy. Some notable fights in which i would be able to improve if the enemy cooperated would be against Tanya, Scoprion and Ashrah training end. That would also make the fights less entertaining so there's a risk to it.

	"SJ realized pause cancel allows to skip the fanfare in training, allows for handcuff glitches like in street fighter guile, but the litch is very unstable and only used to keep  enemy closer in training section, the fanfare skip is finnicky cause you NEED TO LET ENEMY RETURN TO A NEUTRAL STATE FOR AT LEAST 1 FRAME, OR ELSE YOU WIL EXTEND HITSTUN AND GET A FANFARE EVEN LATER THAN NORMALLY, KNOCKDOWNS SKIP FANFRE AS WELL but are usually slow unless they're the training end

	"i realized the pause cancel gives better positioning in training and matches. Training match only allows for pause cancel to start with a string, but in actual matches, pause cancel makes round 2 start as soon as we want to. This is all absurdly faster when compared to RTA.

	"Hard to tell if the world deletion glitch (also known as the door glitch) used here would clearly count as a major skip glitch given TAS precision in a potential new run that avoids it, but KusogeMan said it would still be about twice longer, so I think that works. I'm calling the branch "door glitch" because it's shorter (and somewhat more clear) than "world deletion glitch".
