	"One thing to keep in mind with this game is it's tile based, meaning there are certiant areas that Lester can stand up on.  walking makes him move one tile at a time, while running makes him run 3 tiles at a time.  if Lester is in between two tiles, the game will move him forward to be directly on a tile, this is useful when jumping because I can make Lester land in a way where he saves a tile of movement every time, this is also helpful for setting Lester up for certain faster movements.
