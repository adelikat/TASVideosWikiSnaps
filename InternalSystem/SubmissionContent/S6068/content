Now accuracy is very important to this site, and I was excited when the final release came out as I was eager to make improvements on this game with GBHawk.  However I noticed that GBHawk seems to emulate screen transitions too fast, here's a comparison between Gambette (left) and GBHawk (right): [dead link removed]
