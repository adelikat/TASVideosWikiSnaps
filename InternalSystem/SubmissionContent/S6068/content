(also apologies for the mouse on screen, I thought I had disabled mouse capture.  guess you'll have to watch 2 different mice on screen ;) )

	"Before I get into the actual game, let me talk about GBHawk.  Now accuracy is very important to this site, and I was excited when the final release came out as I was eager to make improvements on this game with GBHawk.  However I noticed that GBHawk seems to emulate screen transitions too fast, here's a comparison between Gambette (left) and GBHawk (right): https://gfycat.com/gifs/detail/foolhardyhomelyalligatorgar

[p 
	"the difference is GBHawk reaches the first level nearly 31 frames faster than on Gambette, so most of the time saved in this game is probably exaggerated due to this.  however I can still say that there were real improvements to this game.
