The titular Sweet Home belongs to some sort of witch, so if you ever visit there, say hi to her for me as most of my ex-girlfriends have in fact turned out to be witches so the probability of her being one of them is very very high. Also, don't say hi to her for me, you'll probably be pushed into an oven or something at the mere mention of my name. In Sweet Home, Hansel b/w Gretel visit a sweet home in the middle of the forest, probably inhabited by gummy worms, sugar babies, and just some straight-up bisected zombies. This is a

Hansel alongside Gretel are very nearly eaten by the witch after very nearly eating all of her sweet home, before Hansel with a side of Gretel burn her to death in an oven .The moral of the story is clearly that you can always eat strange houses as long as you can push a cannibal into an oven.

	"In reality, Sweet Home is a seminal film and video game combo, as long as you think "combo" means "they released almost a year apart". The story revolves around a five person film crew who visit the abandoned mansion of artist Ichirou Mamiya with the intent of restoring his frescos and producing a documentary about his life and his work. They're immediately met by various spooks, scares, and frights, things that you wouldn't normally find in a sweet home. Why would they name it that, then? Are they stupid?

Whether or not that's accurate is up for you to watch, and not me, because I'm a huge coward and I don't like horror movies. Why would I TAS a horror game, then? Am I stupid? The documentary's producer, Akiko Hayakawa, described as being the strongest personality of the crew and the main heroine of the movie, also comes along because Man Needs Love Interest. Man also Needs Daughter, so Emi Hoshino is there as well. A film is nothing without a cameraman, so Ryou Taguchi appears in the film to deliver lines. Finally, Asuka, who does not get a last name so I'm going to assume she is in fact

	"In the film, the mansion is possessed by the mournful ghost of Lady Mamiya, Ichirou's wife, who tends to welcome visitors by killing them, constantly enraged by the loss of her young son in an accident involving the mansion's incinerator, which had also left her permanently disfigured. I don't know if I can talk directly about one particular detail of said incineration without ending up on some sort of watchlist, so just take the phrase "prior to her death, she would seek out playmates for her son c:" as closely related as possible to the previous sentence and pretend I said the quiet part out loud. Lady Mamiya is a ghost because of this, after being caught seeking out playmates for her son, she decided to also become a playmate for her son, throwing herself into the incinerator. Oops, I said the quiet part out loud. A memorial binds her to the mansion, though prevents her from reuniting with her son despite the close proximity to his grave. Since the crew of five are indeed visitors to the mansion, Lady Mamiya promptly tries to kill them, succeeding in causing the demises of Taguchi and Asuka. Kazuo, Emi and Akiko give Lady Mamiya peace by reuniting her with her son, freeing the sweet home of the terrifying ghost. Akiko pretends to be Emi's mom at one point and probably becomes her actual stepmom afterward.

	"The game departs from the movie in a few ways, which is great because it'd be really hard to TAS this route if Taguchi and Asuka died. While the game still has the same cast of five and the same general plot of Go Into Mansion, Examine Frescos, Contend With A Pissed Off Mom and Free Her Spirit, a few creative liberties were taken with the game, resulting in the creation of the survival horror genre. No, like... Literally. This is the game that did it. It's a Capcom game directed by Tokuro Fujiwara, who later went on to produce the first Resident Evil game, having originally intended it to be a remake of this game, and now that I've learned that, I'm genuinely a little sad we don't live in the universe where Sweet Home got remade in 3D. In the game, the story is uncovered through Ichirou's frescos and various notes scattered throughout the mansion, eventually culminating in a final RPG battle against Lady Mamiya.

After being rescued twice, she enters a state of superposition, existing twice in the same reality, moving effortlessly through the mansion through her lightning fast speed and her new psychic link to Taguchi. She carries the permanent ghosts of herself, her dad, and her future stepmom with her at all times. After the six of them (herself, her dad, her future stepmom, and their permanently carried ghosts) kill a zombie, they happen to find a diary, an amulet, and a set of keys on the body. Kazuo promptly ghostifies. They kill some bats just by looking at them, scaring the mansion itself into opening a critical door for them. Emi efficiently runs through the mansion she's never been in before and yet knows perfectly, grabbing some candles, a photograph of people she doesn't recognize, and a small coffin. She brings these items and her Ghost Family to a spooky purple area and throws them at a much larger ghost, causing the ghost to fly away. The four of them: Emi, Akiko, Taguchi, and Kazuo who has unghostified, all leave the mansion before it collapses. Asuka joins them on the way out, having decided not to appear in the ending cutscene.

	(__wikiLink|displaytext=K's published run|href=/2352M)
	", which skips a majority of the first floor by using the game's Call command to bypass a trigger that normally kicks you out of a dark area. This is pretty tricky to pull off in the first place, and makes the rest of the run significantly harder as a result, leading to the category split. Board Glitch is the final category and the most broken one, using the eponymous board glitch and its memory corrupting properties to bypass a majority of the entire game.

[div class=p 
	"For RTA, this three category system works really well. You have the accessible glitchless category, you have the harder and much less consistent (but faster) dynamo skip, and you have the "oh no what's going on" board glitch. For TASVideos, it's a bit harder to divorce dynamo skip and board glitch, as they're ultimately both major skip glitches in my opinion. In the original board glitch RTA route, the board glitch (or, more accurately, a side effect of it) is even used as a much faster method to perform the dynamo skip, so for a while they were actually directly intertwined. In that sense, it would be fair to consider this an improvement to K's published run, and eventually publish a glitchless run if that ever gets made and submitted, but I don't quite think I'm fully on board with that idea. Barring the fact that we could also just have all three categories published at the same time, which I wouldn't be opposed to, if we were only able to have glitched and glitchless categories then I think it would be more fair to keep K's mostly glitchless run published as the predecessor to an actually glitchless run, instead of obsoleting it with this run that's roughly 80% glitched by volume.

	"Anyway, let's jump straight into game mechanics. Sweet Home takes an RPG-like step counter approach to random encounters. After every battle, it rolls a number between 11 and 75, represented in the address as 10 to 74 since it usually has to drop below 0 for a fight to trigger. It's usually better to manipulate the step counter high in order to avoid as many battles as possible, however manipulating very specific values is required for maximum efficiency in a few places. The step counter initializes to 30 when a new game is started, otherwise it is kept through saving and loading.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Manipulating the few bits of RNG in the game, such as the step counter, the enemy you fight in an encounter, the attacks performed by said enemy, and how much damage your characters do, is simply waiting frames. Save for the step counter, everything cycles in the same way: The damage you do to an enemy will increase by a set amount, usually 1 for normal attacks and 3-4 for prayers, every frame until it hits a maximum value, then it rolls back down to a minimum value and repeats. Enemy encounters will cycle through a pattern set by the encounter table, which is usually just a handful of frames for each enemy. Their attacks should be the same way, though there's precisely one time in the entire run where enemy attack manipulation is actually needed so I'll admit I didn't look into it that much. I'll talk about that one time when we get there.

	"The step counter doesn't seem to have a set pattern, at least not one that I know of. You're usually not too far from a 70+ value, though it may take upwards of a full second or so to max it out. If you're not aiming for a specific value, it's usually best to just take the first 70+ you see unless you can get something higher within a few frames.

[div class=p 
	"To start with a small bit of tech: This game heavily revolves around items, and this TAS, like most TASes, heavily revolves around saving time. Loading the item menu with a full party takes more time than loading the item menu with only one or two characters. You don't have to be in a party to load other characters' items, you just have to be standing next to them, and it will only load you and the other character into the item menu. This means that whenever we have to do item management between characters, we want to do it while disbanded from a party whenever possible, as it saves a handful of frames. This is done here by disbanding Emi before placing down the board, as her disbanding is already required to help set up the board glitch.

Akiko has had enough of these calling shenanigans and promptly moves one space to the south, breaking the board and sending Emi into a pit. She stays out of the battle. Emi is now both in the battle and in the pit, which is a state the game never expected you to get into. After Emi runs away, the encounter ends. Kazuo "rescues" Emi from the pit, putting her "back on land". She's still in the pit state, but is now in Kazuo's party and follows him as he moves, even though that means she travels through the ground. Kazuo then joins up with Akiko as if nothing is wrong and starts moving down toward the entrance, with his daughter land sharking behind him. We then switch to Taguchi, who actually rescues Emi from the "pit", putting her back on land for real and adding her to his party.

The game uses a caterpillar system for field movement, where your full party is on the map following behind the leader. It's cute, yes, but it means those characters are always there, ready to be banded with and disbanded from as you please. Normally, and I have to say "normally" for one very specific reason that I'm sure I'll forget to talk about when it becomes relevant, characters are incorporeal when they're in follower mode, allowing the leader to walk through them for efficient movement. This system, innocent as it may seem, is what truly makes the board glitch shine as a speedrun tool.

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Remember two paragraphs ago when I randomly explained the caterpillar system? This is where it becomes relevant to speedrunning. Since Emi is in Taguchi's party, whenever we control him, she will follow his movements as if she was following directly behind him. In other words, whenever Taguchi moves, Emi will always mimic his previous move, and this happens no matter where she is on the map. Whether they're in the same room or on opposite ends of the mansion, Emi is bound by the caterpillar system to follow Taguchi's movement. I will be referring to this phenomenon as the "move glitch" from here on.

]div
[div class=p 
	"I bring up the same room/different room thing because there is actually a very notable difference between them being in the same room and them being in different rooms: Because follower characters are considered incorporeal, this means she can also be moved into walls, putting her out of bounds. When the two are in the same room, Emi will follow Taguchi's movements in real time, which means if she happens to move into any fully non-walkable tile, she will fall into it as if it was a pit. The game treats most non-walkable tiles as pits, some exceptions being those with removable obstacles (such as doors and gates) as they can be walked on when the obstruction is removed.

[div class=p 
	"When the two are in different rooms, however, Emi's position doesn't update immediately. It is still tracked by the game relative to the room she's in, but her actual onscreen position will only update when switching back to her. This means she can be move glitched as far out of bounds as she wants by Taguchi while she's offscreen, as long as she makes it back inbounds before being switched to. In some cases, Emi can move from an out of bounds tile to an inbounds tile if she moves on the first possible frame, but this doesn't always work for some reason.

They will try to follow as best as they can, but they're comparing to a teenage girl moving at quite literally twice their max speed. In the same way that Taguchi and Emi in the same room can make Emi move out of bounds, Emi's doubled speed can easily make it so Kazuo and Akiko get moved out of bounds just by trying to keep up. More often, however, they will get desynced from the movement grid, which prevents you from opening the menu and often leads to a softlock because of it.

You need 82 prayer points for the final puzzle to get into the final area, and level 16 gives you 85 to work with.

Fortunately though, through yet another side effect of the board glitch, you can: Depending on your attack order, it is possible to write an enemy's EXP value to the second byte instead of the first, which is a 256x boost. Very useful, if a bit finicky to pull off because of how you need to set things up.

It only needed those three easily accessible items in the starting area, after all. That's how I ended up with branch 112 on my original TASPROJ. It has the Twin Keys on Akiko, the Amulet on Emi... But it doesn't have the Coffin or the Diary. The Diary was a huge blow since it had normally been guaranteed up until that point, and the detour to get it might not have even been possible as it requires the northern door in that second floor room to be unlocked with Emi's Key, which gets deleted through this iteration of the glitch. The Coffin did sting a bit as well at the time, though I had always seen it as less significant to glitch in than the other items since it's so close to where we need to be after the collection anyway.

I don't have any branch saved where I have the Photo, Coffin, or a Blue Candle, so I must have just meant I had the values and needed items lining up, but "confirmed" implies I went through and tested everything, and the existence of branch 112 backs up that I had done that, so did I just not save those branches or did I not actually test those things?

This would remove the need to go to the ice room, meaning we could Rope cancel off of the rat room candle and warp straight back to the entrance. However, the only way I had theorized to get a Blue Candle was to use a Log on Taguchi's first item slot. The Log itself is easily available, it's in the same sideroom that we take the Rope from to "rescue" Akiko, but Taguchi's items are almost always overwritten instead of being added to, so a different method for obtaining a Blue Candle would need to be found from items that are close enough to not lose time to obtain.

	" where the fireplace was just opened directly, though this seems to also disable the possibility of the door glitch to the Inner Sanctuary. Either way, opening the fireplace with those items means all you'd need to do is loop through the Dungeon once for the Coffin after getting the other two Blue Candles, and you'd be at endgame. The dream route is, of course, glitching in the Coffin as well, reducing the run to just running into the Inner Sanctuary, picking up a couple candles, and proceeding to beat the game from there. Again, though, I don't think any of this is possible with current knowledge, but I can't exactly say I think it's fully impossible either.
