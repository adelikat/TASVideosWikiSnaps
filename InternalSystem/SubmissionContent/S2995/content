	"In the previous run, Link had to take a detour to Ganon's Castle to make use of the stairs to go OoB. Now, Link skips that and completes his quest to

		"save Zelda
	]del
	" obtain Four Swords. This run takes on a different route to the Palace of Four Swords and ends up 3382 + 52 frames faster. Also, the ending has been changed to fix some desync issues that sometimes occurred in the previous run.
