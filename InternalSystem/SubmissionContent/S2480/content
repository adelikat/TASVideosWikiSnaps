	"This game has some interesting glitches. Since I found out them, I decided to submit it here. The game has no credit. So the goal of the run is to beat the final boss and stop inputting keys as fast as possible. I hope you will enjoy it!

	"Ponta to Hinako no Chindouchuu is a platformer. Ponta is a raccoon dog and Hinako is a bird. Ponta takes Hinako on their quest to her mother. Ponta never dies, but when Hinako runs out of her life and falls to the ground, the game is over. The game has five stages and each stage has a boss. Some bosses have an item that changes the way of Ponta’s attack.

	"MidAir Jumping saves frames at some places. Also an enemy moving right helps Ponta move more quickly to right when Ponta is on it. Ponta does a special performance by Mid-Air Jumping while he fights the boss of the stage. The boss never dies unless Ponta gets an item from the boss. But if Ponta beats it very quickly, it drops the item inside blocks and the item goes out of the screen.

	"Just before encountering the boss of the stage, Ponta goes into a small pond and gets to the boss by way of under the ground. After attacking the boss, it is invincible until it jumps and lands on the ground. Therefore, leading the boss to the highest ground is the best way to beat it quickly. To do so, Ponta faints away on the highest ground when the life of the boss leaves two, releasing Hinako to have her attack the boss there.

	"Ponta shoots at an empty place once before getting to the final boss. It looks like a miss, but the purpose of the shooting is to keep some enemy from appearing. Before beating the boss, Ponta releases Hinako and steps forward a bit to lead her to the ideal place.   Then I finish inputting keys. Hinako beats the boss automatically.
