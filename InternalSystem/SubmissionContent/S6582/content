	"I'm currently making a 200% TAS. I'm currently 40 minutes into a run that should be roughly an hour and 10-15 minutes long. I have all the parts with DK done in the 200% TAS, so I thought that making an any% out of inputs I already have would be good. Since this TAS is mainly made out of these inputs, I manually added the rerecord count of every room in the game according to what I have in the tasproj files that I used for testing routes and strats. Without those rerecords added, this movie would have 5143 rerecords.

	"The biggest thing that was found since PiePusher's TAS is the discovery of "speedgrinding", which is a technique used throughout the entire TAS to go faster. By alternating between L and R on every frame, you get the speed of the first frame of releasing a hand, but for every frame where L and R are alternating. Outside of that, there's been some more strategies found, and they will be discussed in the level-by-level description.

	"You guys asked it, you guys get it. In PiePusher's TAS, he takes a hit off of an enemy early on in his run, and it makes it so that you could hear the beeping sound of having low health for the majority of his run. People complained about it when his TAS got published, so I chose to not do that in my TAS, at the cost of losing half a second.
