	"This is a new run of Castlevania Cotm wich clears the game in deferent way than the previous runs.It uses something like "replay mode" or "new game+" in Sotn,is Magician
	$LF
	"This mode uses the same caracter in the regular mode,but ther are some differents betwen the both like HP that is devided by 2 (50) and STR (75) and that makes the movie a little bit unoptimazed,however,I tried to do my possible to show the good playing, but the good thing is MP that increased to 400

	": Everyone agreed that optimization efforts put into this run are very good. But to be published in Moons, a run also requires to represent enough unique content, to prevent overlap, or be better than already existing branches, and obsolete some of them if similar enough.

	"This run appears to look pretty similar to the current any% run, but isn't more entertaining than that, and also uses a replay/newgame+ mode, which makes it incomparable with any% in pure speed. However, most people agree that a "no DSS gltich" run would definitely be entertaining and unique. Rejecting this one though.
