	"This run completes the whole game with four players controlling the main protagonist Aban, while collecting all skulls. There's an additional restriction, where we don't allow switching characters in the middle of the run (characters are unlocked progressively after stages or skulls). The reason is for entertainment, because some characters totally break the level design of the game.

	"Stabbing another character launches it at a high speed, but with a dizzy state. This state lasts 139 frames, but can be reduced by mashing jump/attack buttons. With a perfect mashing, it can be reduced to 47 frames, which is low enough to be worth using.

	"When stabbing, Aban's hitbox is slightly moved forward, so it's back enter inside a wall. If he turns around at that point, the game will push him toward the closest free space, which can be downward, upward or to the side. When performing a high jump and a stab against a three-tiles wall, we have just enough height so that we can clip upward, resulting in doing a three-tile jump. By superposition two or more characters, they can stab each other without hitting each other.
