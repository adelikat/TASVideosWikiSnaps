	"Hello everyone. I complete the TAS movie for Contra 4, this time. Which is a project beginning from 2011. But RNG is too hard to manipulate in 3D stages. So I gave up for several times. And do it again for several times. But after finishing Contra "pacifist" TAS, I feel that I could improve it this time. And I did it!

	"Contra 4 (魂斗羅 Dual Spirits, lit. "Contra Dual Spirits") is a 2D action game for the Nintendo DS and the eleventh original installment in the Contra series. The game was released in North America on November 13, 2007. Contra 4 was produced by Konami Digital Entertainment in America and developed by WayForward Technologies, making it the first Contra game developed by them, as well as the first original Contra game for a portable platform since the 1991 Game Boy game Operation C. Contra 4 was designed to be a direct sequel to the Contra games for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Super NES (Contra, Super C, and Contra III: The Alien Wars), with a gameplay model similar to those games, and was also in celebration of the 20th anniversary of the original Contra.
