	" About the game:
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Club Penguin: Elite Penguin Force is a point-and-click videogame released in the year 2008 on the Nintendo DS. It was developed by 1st Playable Productions and published by Disney Interactive Studios as part of the famous Club Penguin franchise.
	$LF
	"The game stars a player penguin, as he/she finds a mysterious puffle with a map piece after reading the local newspaper. After some investigating, the player discovers the super secret organization called the Elite Penguin Force, who helps and rescues people in time of need. After some basic training with some specially trained puffles with the help of agents Dot (the purple penguin with blonde hair) and PH (the pink penguin wearing a hat and a whistle around her neck), the player finds him/herself investigating the strange disappearance of Gary, or G as he's known in secret (the blue one with the lab coat and glasses), a very important agent who later on after getting rescued, lets the player solve an even bigger mystery involving some strange evil robots wreaking havoc on the island.
	$LF
	"The game is a point-and-click game, with various puzzle and adventure elements in a similar vein to late 90's DOS/PC games with a similar style of gameplay, either from LucasArts or Humongous Entertainment. This game in particular is a brand new set of PSA Missions, which were originally on the now discontinued online MMORPG Adobe Flash game Club Penguin, which had very similar mechanics and gameplay.
	$LF
	"This game was a huge financial success, selling more than 3 million copies worldwide. A year and a half later, a sequel named "Herbert's Revenge" was released (which I made a full TAS of as well), and featured ports of some of the old Flash missions.
	$LF
	"Both games had Nintendo Wi-Fi Connectivity, letting you transfer items and money to your real Club Penguin account. In this game, downloadable content like an extra mission was available, as well as some online polls and a newsletter.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I remember playing this game back in 2009 when I first got into Club Penguin. I was shocked when I found out this game existed and it took me a while to beat it. I have more nostalgia with the sequel however, so I'm not too entirely attached with this one.
	$LF
]p
[h3 id=AbouttheTAS:
 
	" About the TAS:
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Well, where do I begin... This TAS beats the current RTA WR from supermanover00 by 11 minutes and 24 seconds (with RTA timing). This TAS was started back in March of this year
	$LF
	"Also, this TAS was made to celebrate the game's 10th anniversary. Yep, this is a decade old game now... holy frick i feel so old right now...
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In this movie, new EPF agent Guest solves various problems, builds his Spy Gadget in record time and pauses his way through the game's 13 missions, deactivating all of the Test-Robots in under half an hour.
	$LF
	"This run makes very extensive abuse of pausing bugs and exploits, as well as some HUD/menu related glitches and a small amount of skips.
	$LF
]p
[h2 id=ControlsandBasicMechanics:
 
	" Controls and Basic Mechanics:
	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"These games have a very intuitive control scheme, using the touch screen capabilities relatively well, for the most part. They feel fluid and natural once you get the hang of it.
	$LF
	"The DS CP games have a surprising amount of depth for point-and-click games. Like a LOT of it. So here's me explaining as much of how the game works as I can.
	$LF
]p
[h3 id=TheCursor:
 
	" The Cursor:
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"These games use a cursor to simulate the feel of a point and click game from a computer. You move it with the touch screen and drag it around or click on things. On the surface, it seems very simple... But of course it isn't.
	$LF
]p
[h4 id=Movement:
 
	" Movement:
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"It feels near analogue and it overall feels responsive. The way it works is that you hold the stylus on your screen to move the cursor around any pixel of the bottom screen. Moving the cursor to the edge of the screen and holding it in that position moves the camera around. You're also able to move the cursor with the D-pad... for whatever reason.
	$LF
]p
[h4 id=Clicking:
 
	" Clicking:
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Cursor clicks on things. Takes a few loading frames after you click on things. To click on things when you're moving, you have to let go the touch screen and click on the clickable things afterwards. 
	$LF
]p
[h4 id=Dragging:
 
	" Dragging:
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"When you click on items from the items menu in particular, it takes a few frames to spawn the item cursor. Then you have to drag it around to whatever clickbox is intended to be used for. You have to let go the touch screen in order for the game to detect the item being successfully dragged to its target. Combining 2 specific items will give you a combined item.
	$LF
]p
[h4 id=CursorShapes:
 
	" Cursor Shapes:
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Your cursor usually changes shapes to tell you what to do when you're inside a clickbox/exit or when you click on an item/gadget.
	$LF
]p
[h3 id=TheCamera:
 
	" The Camera:
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Because of the small resolution of the DS, the camera takes a big part in these games compared to its Flash counterparts. Now the camera can scroll vertically, and because of the nature of the cursor movement, the camera movement feels somewhat similar in comparison. It is recommended to use the stylus to move the cursor and therefor, the camera, since it will move faster compared to the D-pad. Normally, the camera keeps track on the cursor, so if the cursor moves slightly out of the camera's view, it will scroll quickly to keep up with whatever the cursor is doing. It's not too noticeable at first on normal gameplay. Moving outside the camera with unintended methods and the D-pad makes the camera scroll really really fast, sometimes being faster in certain instances compared to regular movement.
	$LF
]p
[h3 id=ClickboxesandExits:
 
	" Clickboxes and Exits:
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Clickboxes are the point and click equivalent of hitboxes. They're usually larger in size compared to the standard size of sprites, so it looks like I can click on people earlier than I should. When it comes to exits, it takes a couple of frames to load said exit until I can click it and go to a different area. Sometimes doors have some long animations that take some time to finish in order to get inside or outside.
	$LF
]p
[h3 id=TheText:
 
	" The Text:
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"A large part of the game is this. The game doesn't scroll through text, instead the game features textboxes containing fully shown text instead. There are 3 different types of textboxes, each having 1 or 2 variations of each other.
	$LF
]p
[h4 id=DialogueBoxes:
 
	" Dialogue Boxes:
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The standard type. It takes 30 frames after you click on a textbox to skip it, and in sequence. Sometimes is 1 or 2 frames more if lag is present. When a textbox has the (...) on the corner, the textbox takes longer to skip for some reason.
	$LF
]p
[h4 id=ChoiceBoxes:
 
	" Choice Boxes:
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Usually when an NPC ask you a question or make a decision, a textbox or a set of 2 or 3 textboxes is displayed to you. Clicking on the first or second one gets you to skip the selection earlier. Thing is, sometimes a latter box gives you less textboxes to skip, making the earlier choices slower.
	$LF
]p
[h4 id=PlayerBoxes:
 
	" Player Boxes:
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"These show up on the top screen where the player's avatar says or thinks of anything, either after an event trigger or after getting an item.
	$LF
]p
[h3 id=LagandFramerate:
 
	" Lag and Framerate:
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Unlike what it seems, the game runs at 60 frames per second. It's just that the game renders a frame on a different screen, making it look like it looks at 30.
	$LF

Something very important to note is that when there’s an animation after hitting a target or when an event trigger happens, there’s usually a small mini-cutscene that happens and you usually can't do anything. This is because these animations give you a bunch of lag frames until it ends. After a lag frame, you have to wait 1 frame to click on things successfully on the next frame.

[h4 id=Whydidyouusethisversion?
 
	" Why did you use this version?
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This version has less frames of loading lag. I'm not sure is this is related to the emulator itself or if it's applicable to real hardware, but I wanted to play it safe with this game.

	" Why do you wait some time to do X or Y thing?
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"As I've mentioned before, there are lag frames whenever an animation from a NPC happens, so you can't really do anything about that most of the time.

[h4 id=WhydidyouuseGuestModeinsteadofastandardsavefile?
 
	" Why did you use Guest Mode instead of a standard save file?
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Good question. On a standard file after beating a mission or a minigame, the game saves your progress, which takes a long time to do so. It is not as quick as the sequel, where it's instantaneous. Using Guest Mode doesn't save anything at all since it's a temporary file, and saves a significant amount of time.

	"I get your skepticism or hate towards Club Penguin. I get it. I don't care as long as you're civil about it. I'm tired of CP being called a shit meme game or the Nintendo games being shovelware or something like that. Listen, CP means so much to me, so I'm asking you to at least don't insult the game our laugh at it for being dead or anything like that like certain Youtube channels are currently doing. Please. I'm gently asking you. Thank you for understanding.

	$LF
	"I worked really hard on this movie, being one of my biggest projects in a long time, but nowadays I understand other people's thoughts about this TAS being Vault locked and not very entertaining. I'll respect the judge's verdict on the tier regardless.

	"This TAS did not really strike a chord with me. The gameplay was typical point and click adventure stuff with a smattering of glitches here and there. Those glitches didn't feel particularly gripping either. The minigames did not feel in any way spectacular. There were some decent audience replies but also a bunch of negative votes.

	"As a note to the publisher. The author has listed "heavy glitch abuse" and "uses warps" as tags. Heavy glitch abuse I feel is questionable (the glitches were rarely noticeable and didn't have too much impact on gameplay). The "uses warps" tag, is just outright incorrect usage of that tag though. It is meant for things like Super Mario Bros. style warps that allow you to skip entire stages, not quick travel methods and the latter seems to be what is featured here.
