[div class=p 
	"You might be wondering why i choose Gena because its simple, she have the best handling plus good steering, here is the best part about her Taxi Car it's very Small Compared to other characters in the game, since her Taxi Car is small she can fit tight gaps between Traffic to make this TAS even Crazier,  you might notice sometimes when i drive i almost hit the cars between getting through that tight space which is Radical to think about it!

	"Limiter Cut is a game mechanic where you put your Taxi Car on reverse, then put it on drive, which gives you a big boost but the tricky about this Trick is that, that it has a certain timing to do it, your not allowed to like spam, you have to do timing right in order to do a limiter cut, it can be tough for new players but after all they can master it in no time like i did, when i played Crazy Taxi.

In this TAS you can manipulate Traffic in this game by using savestates in the emulator, its similar how other tasers manipulate rng, trying different inputs or wait a certain timing in order to get what you want, but for me i don't really have to slowdown i just keep using savestates until i get the traffic that im satisfied with, that give me a lot money, for example at the start of the run i got good traffic then, the 2nd customer i got good traffic including all of them, i got good hella traffic Rng...
