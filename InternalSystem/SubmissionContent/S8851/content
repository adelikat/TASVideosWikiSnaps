[div class=p 
	"If you jump, then throw an item after letting go of B, then jump again in a relatively short window, it’s possible to jump off of an item to gain more height. This can be used for some big shortcuts, especially in The Alley, where it saves nearly 2 minutes over taking the intended route and the level is finished in well under 20 seconds.

A few frames were initially lost in the making of the final draft due to random lag, but Induviel managed to save more than enough frames to make up for that.
