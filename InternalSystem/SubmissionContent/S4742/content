	"While looking through DSDA for comparisons I found a very slightly faster (0.09 seconds) movie for E4M7, which seems to be because it takes the corners better. If this episode is ever improved, that should be looked into. I realize that the Doom community has traditionally only cared about whole seconds, but here we are a bit more petty. (There are also faster movies for E4M1 and E4M2, but there are good reasons for that, namely that picking up the rocket launcher and BFG saves more time in later levels.)
