	"One thing was clear to me after finishing the "Sonic 1" run - I would never TAS another Sonic game again. And what happened? I TASed another Sonic game. It started at the very end of my last project when I was bored and just felt like trying to shave off some frames in the first level of this game. After saving a handful of those I still wasn't motivated to take on the run as a whole, then I found a timesaver of half a second at the end of the level - still not motivated, but then after another half a second timesaver at the middle of the level that pushed the time down another ingame second I did start to consider taking it after all. 4 months later the total ingame improvement became 3956 frames (65.93 seconds) with the following breakdowns.

Tails' behavior after losing control over him was extremely weird:). At the end I choosed, like in the previous run, to hit the capsule with Tails', losing 10 ingame frames. It could be seen as both "real time"-saver (which proved to be very important later on in the run) and a speed/entertainment tradeoff.

At the second to last booster I utilized a glitch which sets Sonic in a state where he, among other things - such as not being able to spindsh under normal circumstances, reacts with a slope in such a way that if helands on a slope with a certain angle, then he'll keep moving in that angle until he jumps. To learn more about the glitch, read
