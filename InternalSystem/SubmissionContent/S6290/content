	"There's a glitch with this game. In the MUSIC TEST mode, from the 15th tune, subsequent tunes have glitches. Opening the game, enter the MUSIC TEST mode, choose the 26th tune in a particular frame (in fact, other tunes can be, but No.26 is the front), wait for the screen to pass, press ST button and go straight to the end. I found this glitch in process of MMC3 hacking and don't know why this is so. What's the meaning of this movie? This is a very low-level work. This is probably not in conformity with the norm, sorry...

	"First off, there have been brought doubts about the legitimacy of the glitch itself, in the submission thread. It's indeed very suspicious how multiple people were unable to reproduce this game end glitch on more accurate emulators than FCEUX. However, that doesn't necessarily prove that the glitch itself is the result of inaccurate emulation, since there are potentially infinite variants for causing the glitch itself. But that also means that there are no guarantees that an actual proof will ever be found, and since we can't keep a submission potentially forever stuck in the queue, it makes more sense to just reject it now and keep the idea that it could be potentially un-rejected in case a proof is found later... Except that for this specific submission it's never going to happen, as there are two more reasons why it should be kept rejected.

	"The second issue is about the usage of the music test mode. We don't allow cheats and debug functionalities, because these are found outside of intended gameplay. I found no evidence suggesting that the method for accessing this sound test is mentioned in-game or in the official game manual, which would make it allowed. Instead, I

	" in the thread, by looking at the movie inputs and performing tests I could learn that this game end glitch can be triggered by meeting just two frame-perfect inputs, which would make it easily matched by human attempts. We can't accept movies that don't feature superhuman gameplay, as it's the main purpose of the site.
