	"I would like to first go off saying this game was terribly brutal to TAS. It took numerous days upon days to finish this fully. This was a challenge for me, but I really wanted to beat this in a well polished fashion. For the numerous people who have heard of this game that haven't been able to see anyone complete it or even master it.
