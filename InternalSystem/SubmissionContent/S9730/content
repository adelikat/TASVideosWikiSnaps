	"Aran_Jaeger made a test TAS of this game back in 2018 that had a final time of 1:05:16. This improves upon that effort by 4 minutes and 58 seconds thanks to a new glitch discovery, improvements in routing, and lots of lag reduction. This TAS would not have been possible without Aran_Jaeger's initial effort. Here are his comments on that original test TAS:

	"Holding Up+Down at the base of the ladder will cause you to climb straight through the floor! This sometimes lets you access areas much quicker than you would be able to otherwise. The shortcuts allowed by this glitch alone saved several minutes over the previous run. Notable levels where this saved time include Levels 6, 12, 14, 16, 17, 21, and 23.

[div class=p 
	"There is so much lag in this game (the worst of any I have TASed, in fact) that it is a real pain to minimize in ways that make sense and are predictable. One change I made from the test TAS that shaved off a few lag frames in most levels though, was not holding right/left while Bugs is in midair. Holding left/right will cause Bugs to walk in place in midair, and I think not holding anything reduces lag because the game would not have to constantly cycle through those animation frames.

[div class=p 
	"The lag is primarily caused by all the enemies moving around the stage. Luckily, there is a clock item we can collect to temporarily freeze all enemies and their lag to save time. And MAN is this thing good at reducing lag! Definitely worth going out of your way for. If I'm not mistaken, every clock in the game except for one in Level 25 was collected in this TAS.

[div class=p 
	"The lag in this game is so bad that it is often worth it to go out of your way to collect a weapon you don't need and use it to kill a random enemy for the lag that it'll reduce. I'm not kidding, sometimes it means literally going through an extra door to pick up the item, which takes a lot of time. Oh and of course, you'll have to hit the enemies at point-blank range so the weapon sprite is on-screen for as little time as possible lol. Notable places where this saved time were in levels 3, 7, 11, 17, 21, 22, 23, and 28.

[div class=p 
	"Other routing improvements outside the influence of ladders or lag—from changing which enemies are killed to just plain old getting from point A to point B—were found. The most notable example was Level 26 where I ascended the long column of pipes in the middle of the level only once as opposed to twice in the test TAS. The funniest improvement was on Level 22. Midway through the level I decided to go up a ladder to get a key from this door guarded by Yosemite Sam straight away instead of dropping down after collecting the shield. This change gave me enough time to bypass the last ghost in the level before the shield ran out, allowing me to use the bomb on the Magic Mouse instead. Because a lot of time was spent manipulating Yosemite Sam, this clever rerouting only ended up saving a measly
