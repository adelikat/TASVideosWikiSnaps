	"Finally I managed to make a good run of this game. You see, I tried multiple times in the past but always backed off because it seemed really tedious. But this time it was a breeze! Almost every room has been improved. I also recently found that you could save&quit on the pause screen, and resume gameplay almost immediately afterwards. Doing this while collecting Star Keys or while inserting Star Keys in the Bowser map skips cutscenes and lets you move on quicker. This is the major time saver in this run.
