	"Hey all, here's my 2nd version of this FCE Ultra timeattack.  This game is interesting in that it features three different types of levels, which you'll see in the movie.

	"Right off the bat I will say that the time FCEU gives is slightly off.  I timed it and it was about 13:01; if you don't believe me, try it yourself.

[div class=p 
	"The driving and FPS levels are mostly autoscrolling, so to make them interesting I aimed to get 100% kills and 100% items.  This goal was achieved in levels 1 and 4, but not in 10 and 11; I was able to do this in level 10 in version 1, but this time a few more (unhittable) enemies were added, which I could do nothing about.  As for level 11, you *could* get 100% items but that would waste time...killing the last enemy ends the level, so that needs to be done ASAP.

[div class=p 
	"A couple more notes on these levels...when shifting gears your car shoots flame behind it; this is put to excellent use in stage 10.  In the FPS stages, if you do not grab the item dropped by the final enemy, they end exactly half a second faster.  Hence I don't count this toward 100% items.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Now that that's done, on to the meat of the game: The action stages.  They're sort of a cross between Castlevania and Ninja Gaiden, except that this game is quite a bit faster than NG even.  This is the main reason I think you'll enjoy this movie: It's fast-paced and features a lot of cool split-second moves.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Getting hit has a similar effect to Castlevania's, except that you move more slowly.  Hence, it's something to be avoided unless there's a shortcut requiring it or there is just no better way to get around something.

[div class=p 
	"If you attack while on the ground, you pause.  If you attack as you're about to land from a jump, however, you continue moving forward without missing a beat.  This is why you see me use the latter a lot.

[div class=p 
	"The light whip (main weapon) and gun are pretty self-explanatory.  The grenade is a little more complex...it starts up more slowly than the other weapons, but moves more quickly than the bullets and is longer-ranged.  It can deal either 1 or 2 points of damage, depending on whether the enemy stays in the blast radius after being hit or moves.

	"Ladders are strange, you can't usually drop down them quickly.  You can keep jumping to climb quickly, though.

	"You can run forward while crouching.  I use this quite a bit, though usually it is hard to see because I specifically aimed to stay crouching as little as possible.

	"One level note...the reason I wait like I do in the waterfall part of stage 5 is that you need to do this to randomize the position of the logs.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"The bosses are mostly self-explanatory.  In the driving stages it looks like I fire at them a little slowly, but I am not; they just stay invincible longer than they appear to.  Also, even though the first boss doesn't flash sometimes, I am still hitting him.  And finally, the second boss is quite annoying to randomize.  The ideal way of killing him is very slightly faster than what I did in the movie, but I could never make him throw that high girder using the optimal method, no matter what I tried.
