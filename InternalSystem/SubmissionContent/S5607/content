	"The input with the highest precendence will be used to determine the direction the character will move or the direction of a prjectile. The fact that that movement and shooting delayed are different let's one shoot in mid-air left or right while going up or down and left while going right. But that only works for these three case, not for other, because the subsets of movement and shooting delayed need to be a inversion of each other to make this trick possible.
