	"Backwalking
	$LF
]h3
[div class=p 
	"Backwalking has the highest average speed of any glitchless movement option with the sole exception of goron rolling. As human, it has a top speed of 8.25 and a top speed of 9 as Deku, Goron, or Zora. The acceleration is a little slow, only gaining 1.5 speed per frame as compared to 2 speed per frame from forward walking. However, forward walking caps at only 5.5 and 6 speed as the different respective forms. Backwalking can also be angled slightly by holding slightly left or right of straight down. When angling to the right, Link will gradually curve his movement angle to be in line with the joystick angle, but when angling left, the change in movement angle is instantaneous. Releasing Z during a backwalk will cause Link to turn around in line with the backwalk angle and continue running forwards with the backwalk speed for a frame before gradually deteriorating back to walking speed. In order to sharply change angle out of a backwalk, Links momentum must be completely stopped to get him out of his running animation.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Pressing Z during the first frame after turning out of a backwalk will maintain Links speed and movement angle, as will releasing it. This can technically be called a Z-slide, but in reality, it happens every single time the Z button is pressed or released. So for the purpose of the glitchless definition, I refrain only from doing this multiple times consecutively with the same speed.
	$LF
]div
[h3 id=Sidehopping 
	"Sidehopping
	$LF
]h3
[div class=p 
	"This form of movement has a high top speed (8.5) and instantaneous acceleration. Unlike in Ocarina of Time, sidehop speed deteriorates over time in the air to a minimum value equal to walking speed (5.5 as human, 6 as Deku, Goron, or Zora). It is also possible to angle the momentum of a sidehop by holding the joystick forward or back, and it is possible to cut the momentum of a sidehop quicker by holding against the direction of travel. This makes sidehopping have an overall slower average speed than backwalking, but it still has a lot of utility due to its high acceleration and flexibility.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Additionally, releasing Z on or before the frame a sidehop is performed allows Link to change his angle 1 frame sooner after landing. If this is done with the first sidehop in a chain immediately after turning, then Link will turn slightly in the direction of the sidehop while maintaining the momentum from his original angle, allowing for some cleaner corner rounding.
	$LF
]div
[h3 id=Rolling 
	"Rolling
	$LF
]h3
[div class=p 
	"While not as common as sidehopping or backwalking in a TAS context, it still has utility. Rolling has a maximum speed exactly equal to backwalking speed. During the first frame a roll, Links current speed is maintained for 1 frame before accelerating by 2 units per frame until reaching top speed. This means it is usually best to get up to walking speed before initiating a roll. When a roll ends, Links speed will abruptly decrease by 8 units to a minimum of 0. Uniquely, it does not put Link into his running animation even if he still has some speed, allowing for immediate turns in any direction following a roll. This can be especially useful out of a backwalk in order to change angles without having to awkwardly stall Links movement. Unlike backwalking or sidehopping, rolling has a static movement angle, meaning there is no way to influence the direction of a roll after starting it.
	$LF

[h3 id=Spinning 
	"Spinning
	$LF
]h3
[div class=p 
	"A form of movement unique to Deku Link, this takes the place of rolling. Like rolling, initiating a spin will maintain Links current speed for 1 frame before the normal spin speed mechanics take over. Unlike rolling however, spinning has a maximum allowed speed on each frame of the spin that gradually decreases to approximately 4.8 on the last frame. Link will either accelerate towards the maximum allowed speed at no more than 2 units per frame, or decelerate towards the maximum allowed speed at no more than 1.5 units per frame. During the first 3 frames of a spin, the maximum allowed speed is actually higher than backwalking top speed. This makes it useful to perform a spin out of a backwalk when near a loading zone or cutscene trigger to get a small boost. I will also sometimes spin out of a backwalk off of ledges in order to have a higher starting speed while in the air.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Also unlike rolling, deku spins can be curved freely in the same manner that Link can curve while walking normally. Another added bonus is that text triggers will not activate while in the spinning animation.

[h3 id=GoronRolling 
	"Goron Rolling
	$LF
]h3
[div class=p 
	"Goron rolling is a very fast form of movement. It is especially important to get up to speed before initiating a goron roll as Links speed is locked for the entire during of the curling animation before he can begin accelerating. The curling animation also takes much longer when doing so from a standstill and not holding Z. Normal goron rolling has a max speed of approximately 15.6. While goron rolling, however, there is a timer that counts up to 54 so long as the joystick is being held sufficiently far from neutral position. When this timer reaches 54, the goron roll will instead become a spike roll, which has a max speed of approximately 18. These speeds are greatly impeded by slopes, so trying to stick to flat ground or shallow slopes when possible is good. A spike roll consumes 2 units of magic to start, then consumes 1 unit of magic for every 10 frames it continues. The normal magic meter has a maximum value of 48, making management of magic very critical in this run. Goron rolling and spike rolling can also be steered relatively freely unlike normal rolling. Colliding into walls in certain ways can also cause Link to rebound off of the wall for a quick angle change.

	"Quick Roll
	$LF
]h3
[div class=p 
	"When starting a goron roll on sand, snow, or ice, the acceleration is supposed to be dramatically slower than when on other surfaces. However, this can be negated by holding the stick at a partial tilt until reaching near max goron rolling speed. The spike roll buildup timer will not increase while doing this because of the partial stick angle, but it will increase if holding full tilt and eating the poor traction on these surfaces. Usually a quick roll is better to get more distance quicker, but it can at times be advantageous to forego it in favor of building of a spike roll, especially with limited runway space.

	"Sticky Roll
	$LF
]h3
[div class=p 
	"I don't believe there's actually an official name for this technique, I've just been calling it sticky rolling. Goron rolling and spike rolling is designed to be able to launch through the air by going up steep slopes like a ramp. When doing this however, the reduced lateral speed from the ramp is maintained until landing, making it somewhat undesirable. I can often avoid these jumps by precisely managing my position such that Links Y position is exactly in-line with the next surface when goron rolling between changes in slope.

[h3 id=DiveJump 
	"Dive Jump
	$LF
]h3
[div class=p 
	"When jumping off of a ledge over water and holding A, Link will instead dive off the ledge. This is most often used to enter the water as Zora without having to sit through the zora swim startup animation, but it does have some other applications. Notably, if a dive lands on the ground, it will transition into a roll on the ground without any speed loss. This can be useful for consecutive jumps over water.

]div
[h3 id=DolphinDiving 
	"Dolphin Diving
	$LF
]h3
[div class=p 
	"Zora swimming perfectly level has a speed of 9. The startup gives Link a brief speed boost, and swimming up or down trades some lateral speed for vertical speed. By repeatedly diving in and out of the water though, it is possible to maintain a much higher swimming speed. Links speed diving out of the water will be greater the shallower the dive is. The maximum speed attainable this way is ~11.69, regardless of how fast Link was swimming prior to diving. The tricky part of dolphin diving is the dive back into the water, as Link also gets a speed boost when diving into the water. The degree of this speed boost is based on horizontal and vertical speed combined, with vertical speed being a much greater factor. Faster horizontal speed and faster downward speed both aid in granting a greater boost in speed entering the water. TLDR: A shallow dive out of the water is a faster speed, but sacrifices speed when re-entering the water, so it is necessary to find a balance.

]h3
[div class=p 
	"I also don't know if this technique has ever officially been named. While riding Epona, her normal galloping speed will fluctuate between approximately 8.5 and 9.3. Using a carrot will cause her to accelerate towards a speed of 15 after a one frame delay. This acceleration occurs at a linear rate over 15 frames, no matter the speed Epona was galloping prior. Upon reaching 15 speed, her speed will taper off at a rate of about 0.06 speed per frame until she returns to her normal gallop rate or another carrot is used.  If I start aiming the bow before Epona reaches 15 speed, her acceleration will be paused, but the 15 frame acceleration timer will not be. Once I stop aiming the bow, Epona will again accelerate towards 15 speed over the remaining duration of the timer without consuming a carrot. If the timer has reached 0 already, she will be set instantly to 15 speed from whatever speed she was at before.

If I press Z against a wall during this, Links facing angle and movement angle will be instantly redirected into the wall. This allows me to grab high ledges or slip past corners very sharply. Traditionally, gainer refers only to backflipping forward by targeting a wall, so I rarely actually use this term directly.

]h3
[div class=p 
	"By holding slightly outside of the deadzone on the joystick, Link will begin shuffling in place and turning to be in-line with the joystick angle. Holding Z after starting this shuffle and flicking a direction on the stick will cause Link to quickly turn before gradually returning to his original facing angle. By combining this with backflips or sidehops, I can backflip or sidehop in unusual directions (Twisted backflip/twisted sidehop). This can be useful to grab ledges quickly or as just an additional movement option. Rolling after an ESS twist will not return Link to his original angle until after the roll ends. This can also allow jumping off of a ledge while facing an unsual direction (Twisted roll jump).

	"This technique is only possible on the Japanese version of the game and is one of a few reasons behind choosing the Japanese 1.1 version for this run. On the Japanese version of the game, Links crouch stab ability was never assigned a damage value. As a failsafe, the game will simply apply the most recent weapon attack damage value and properties to the crouch stab, allowing me to store high damage attacks to a very quick move. The stored values are reset upon loading a new area of putting on/removing a transformation mask (Deku, Goron, Zora).

With a goron pound however, much larger obstacles can be cleared with damage boosts. I will refer to these specifically as goron damage boosts.

]h3
[div class=p 
	"Anyone who has watched a Zelda 64 TAS will have seen using first person items such as hookshot or bow while holding Z to aim faster. Well the Majora's Mask camera has an interesting quirk that allows for even faster use of first person items. When pressing the Z button to center the camera behind Link, the camera will appear to rotate and center behind him. In reality however, the game will treat analog inputs as though the camera hasn't changed at all for 5 frames following a Z press, then will treat analog inputs after that as though the camera has completely finished changing. During this magic 5 frame window, it is possible to move freely while charging a first person item. This is very apparent especially with the hookshot. In some circumstances, this window persists even after cutscenes. A common example of this is using first person camera delay through mask transformation cutscenes.

The second kind of popup is done by grabbing a corner of a ledge in a specific way such that Link gets popped up onto the ledge, skipping the climbing animation.

Romani Ranch is blocked by a huge boulder until the 3rd day, but the sidequest that gives Epona back to me becomes unavailable once time reaches night 1. In order to destroy the boulder, I need a powder keg. In order to get a powder keg, I either need to beat Snowhead Temple, or get the fire arrows therein to melt the ice blocking Biggoron. But even before that, I can't actually reach the mountains without glitches until I get the bow from Woodfall Temple.

There are a minimum of 4 doors that need to be opened to reach the mirror shield; the items needed for these doors are as follows: 5 Magic Beans, A fish in a bottle, A big poe in a bottle, and milk in a bottle. The big poe and the milk are especially troublesome. Milk can be obtained in the well, but it necessitates Hot Spring Water in a bottle. I would either need to climb all the way back up to Darmani's Grave to get this or bring a blue potion to get the hot spring water in the well. To do this, I would either need a wallet upgrade and 200 rupees to buy one from the Business Scrub in Ikana, or Mask of Scents to get a free one from the Magic Hag Potion Shop in Southern Swamp. Both of these are huge detours, so it's best to get Milk outside the well. As for the big poe, the one in the well needs 2 more doors to be opened: one with 10 deku nuts, and one with 10 bombs. Given that the big poe outside the well takes a long time to get and these are fairly simple requirements to meet, the big poe in the well is very appealing. That being said, the big poe outside the well and a source of milk both come with an additional bottle, which is an important factor for routing in the next key point.

	"Another key obstacle is that I must collect all 7 zora eggs to learn New Wave Bossa Nova and enter Great Bay Temple. There are 3 eggs in Pinnacle Rock and 4 eggs in Pirate's Fortress. In order to collect the eggs, I need empty bottles. Despite there being 6 bottles in this game, there are only 4 that are potentially viable: The red potion bottle from Twinrova in Southern Swamp, The gold dust bottle from completing the Goron Race, the Milk Bottle from defending Romani Ranch from the alien invasion, and Big Poe bottle from night 3 graveyard. The red potion and gold dust bottle are convenient because the route goes right by them anyway. Getting a 3rd bottle can eliminate an extra trip to Pinnacle Rock, but the other remaining viable bottle options are not especially fast with the exception that they come with one of the items needed for Beneath the Well. Ultimately, the Big Poe bottle just isn't fast enough to be worth getting, even though it skips a few additional requirements in Beneath the Well. The Milk Bottle is obtained in top level RTA runs, but it has a time of day constraint. The invasion starts at 2:30AM and ends at 5:15AM. It's not necessary to kill the first set of 10 aliens until about 3:45AM, but they must be killed one more time a little after 4:00AM to successfully defend the ranch. Link must also be present in Romani Ranch at the end of the invasion to receive the Milk Bottle.

Beyond that, I tried completing Woodfall Temple between Aliens waves, but also leaving the boss key until this return trip.

I was 2 frames early to Curiosity Shop as it is, so this would only have resulted in waiting outside for longer. That being said, if I had gone back ALL the way to Deku Palace and moved my Inverted Song of Time points to get an even tighter night 1 transition, I could potentially save about a second.

While some glitches allows you to skip big chunks of the game, there's nothing like watching link chaning masks a dozen times per minute, exploting movement and skills to an extreme. The optimization quality is undeniable.
