	"Every world has four stage types which are presented in the same order: visions X-1, X-2, X-3, X-5, and X-7 are platformer stages; visions X-4 are board stages; visions X-6 are autoscrollers; and X-BOSS are boss fights. In an Any% setting you can skip X-4 or X-5 and X-6 or X-7 levels, but we're going for 100% completion of the game. This requires beating all levels, collecting all the dreamstones within them, including the 3 EX stages.

	"In platformer stages—which represent the majority of stages—the objective is to find three stars to unlock the ending door. These platformer stages have 30 dreamstones each. X-4 levels have Klonoa riding a surfboard to the end, and X-6 levels are autoscrollers which have nothing but playaround since they can't be sped up. These two latter types each contain 100 dreamstones per vision.

		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Klonoa moves 1, then 2 pixels horizontally at max speed (1.5). Since double jumps stop his movement, each one can be a pixel SLOW, so we always jump the frame he moves 2. That way, his speed goes 1, 2, 2, 1.
		$LF

	[li 
		" **Damage boosting** is done by firing the wind bullet and turning before an enemy hits you to get sent in the opposite direction faster. This gives you extra height as well, which is used to reach higher areas faster than intended. Another form of damage boosting involves walking into an enemy and jumping at the same time to increase your jump height by 10 pixels. This can also be combined with grabbing the enemy to bring it to higher platforms.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" By fluttering for 1 frame in the air, Klonoa can reach the ground 6 frames faster. If you want to stay in the air longer, you can **air step** by fluttering and shooting the wind bullet on the same frame to reset Klonoa's Y velocity.
		$LF

		" A **perfect flutter** is performed by frame perfectly releasing the A button at the end of it. This gives 1-5px of extra height.

		" In board stages, Klonoa’s speed is dictated by his Board Speed Momentum (BSM). Klonoa accelerates as he moves downhill, and his acceleration is only lost by landing on an upwards hill, landing on a springboard, or entering a new room. Repeatedly jumping up hills loses less BSM than riding them, and fluttering slows you down so we try to avoid it.

	[li 
		" After a double jump with a Moo box—if done low enough—it's possible to regrab it in midair to get the box higher up. This is done frequently to either skip or speed up sections.
		$LF

	[li 
		" When jumping into a ceiling, or with the extra height from a Perfect Flutter, you can clip into it slightly which allows you to make another jump. This can theoretically be combined endlessly, but that sadly has limited use in the run.

	"This world introduces the Boomie bombs. Upon being grabbed, a timer starts ticking down on a 26 (0-25) frame timer for each “second” on their clock. Each time it is regrabbed, the timer goes down by 1 second and the frame counter resets to 25. Optimally, you want to regrab it just as it has ticked down, saving 26 frames. This makes for some interesting strategies on how to optimally throw or double jump and then regrab as quickly as possible.

	"5-Boss: The first boss, Jillius, has a 255-frame timer that runs when he starts charging up the lightning ring. This timer keeps ticking until the eye in the middle has been hit. Then for the second phase, the timer will continue where it left off, meaning the lower the time is, the further the boss has to travel before starting to charge and the further he has to travel back after the hit. The first hit is therefore set up to be as high as possible while still getting a time of 91 after the second hit, which sets up the third hit to be charged as early as possible.

[div class=p 
	"The lightning storm during the final phase can either be three at once (fast) or 1+1+1 (slow). It was faster to bring up the pause menu after the first lightning hit, as RNG changes every frame then as well, rather than delaying frames before the previous hit. The same RNG manipulation strategy is used in the final boss as well for the projectiles that attack your from below.
