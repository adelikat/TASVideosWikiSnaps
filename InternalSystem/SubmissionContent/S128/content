	"I don't believe this game is very well known, so here it is in a nutshell.  There are seven scenes.  Each scene has two levels, Daytime and Nightime.  In each Daytime level, you get the opportunity to rescue Van Helsing.  At the end of each Nightime level is a battle with Dracula.  When your weapon runs out, a refill automatically floats onto the screen.  If you rescued Van Helsing, you get a better weapon here.

	"I think the movie is worth watching because it's played very fast, like all time attacks.  In some fights with Dracula I allow my character to get as close as possible to Dracula without getting hurt, or I allow Dracula to come as close as possible before delivering the final hit.  I kill a few enemies before they even come onto the screen.  Another thing I try to do is allow some enemies to live just to make the challenge of dodging them or projectiles that they shoot.
