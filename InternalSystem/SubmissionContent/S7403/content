	"The game since has had an updated version that would be faster but it was exclusively released on mobile platforms, so it is not an option to use with libTAS, yet. This version of the game has an intentionally frustrating control scheme where we have to time a spinning arrow to jump in the right direction. This is not a huge problem in most places but in some corner the jump option can be messed up due to weird collision detection. And there are some seemingly weird jump choices made but it is to get more optimal and quicker jump options. It defaults going to the right first everywhere which makes the place where we need to go left comparatively slower. This problem is circumvented in some places by jumping into corners which can instantly give a neat 45 degree jump option right away. There is one small skip at the rotating platforms where we can use the momentum to give ourselves a boost to reach the higher level. Since we need the right jump option at the right time, we need to wait for the cycle and do some back and forth to make this work. Other than that it is pretty much done in the intended way. There isn't much material to compare this run with. The only person to even complete the game as far as I know is "Andrew Snipers" and got a time of 
	[a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6nn8XWRbOc rel=noopener external nofollow 
		"34:00
	]a
	". There are some other RTA runs of the easier mobile version and this run also comfortably beats them by more than 2 minutes. I had a lot of fun working on this little project and I would like to thank the speedrun community of the game for helping me with the strats.
