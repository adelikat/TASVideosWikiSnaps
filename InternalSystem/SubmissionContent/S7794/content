	"Art Style: PiCTOBiTS, known as Art Style: PiCTOPiCT outside the US, is part of the DSiWare and WiiWare line of Art Style games. This is a puzzle game developed by Skip Ltd., the Chibi-Robo! devs, where the goal is to match colored bits in rectangles of at least 4 bits in size. The main goal of this TAS is to clear all 15 normal stages with in-game time. This game is still available in the 3DS eShop until the online closure that's coming March 2023.

	"When I discovered better times out there, I mainly improved the individual stages that saved in-game time. Since RNG is real time clock dependent and I don't have enough energy to work on better times for stages that weren't beaten by RTA play, there are gaps where nothing happens until the next stages start. Most notably, due to big time saves in stages 1 to 4, stage 5 has over a minute of waiting before starting. I do apologize but that's what going for in-game time get for me.

	"Combos and color combo orders are the bread and butter for fast completion. Bigger chains means the number of bits added to the picture is multiplied by the chain number, up to 9. How this can be used is dependent on the color situation, though in general the colors that need more bits are used near the end of combo setups.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Some combos are built from using a falling bit shape in a way more complex than the simplest approach. The tradeoff is that it means spending more of the initial bits which does lead to problems down the road. However more bits can be made available by having the falling bits stop and split into individual, usable bits as long as they aren't marked. Marked bits cannot be moved by the player unless they spend one of the held bit slots to make them drop down, which takes a fair amount of time to play out as well as reduce the max number of held bits at once.

	"I don't drop some falling bit formations immediately since doing so would cause it to separate into split parts. It's better to wait if the intention is to make bigger combos. Sometimes I do stop bit formations to make more usable individual bits for later since that allows for clearing the next formation with larger combos.

	"There is definitely some RNG seed settable by the real time clock that might make all the times outside of stage 15 faster. I only discovered the really fast in-game times from TokusiN much later in doing this TAS. I could have worked with earlier seeds but it would require having to replan pretty much every stage to meet or beat the first pass, so I went with waiting out for the right seen which I don't like but works okay enough. Some RNG manipulating loremaster would be better off just finding a more ideal RNG seed that would just cut times across the board, as well as cut down on the waiting between stages.
