	"Atlantis no Nazo is a pretty strange puzzle game with a huge amount of warps. This movie is a good example of how many stages can skipped in this game by picking the right warps.

	"This is a 5 seconds improvement over Morimotos version. I take the same route as Morimoto, the 5 seconds improvment comes from optimized movement and some abuse of the frame advance function :)

	"Generally, this movie was pretty easy to make, there were only a few places that were quite hard to frameperfect. I made this movie in just one day after doing some planning the day before.

	"This run went pretty well, 5 seconds of improvement for a game this short is pretty good in my opinion. Anyway, I hope you enjoy this run!
