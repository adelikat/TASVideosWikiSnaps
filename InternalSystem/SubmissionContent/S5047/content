[p 
	"SMB3's game designers apparently wanted to ensure that the giant ? blocks found in some levels, containing special suits, would only be used once per level; i.e. you can't keep getting a Hammer suit by entering the same pipe over and over again. They chose a kind of odd way to enforce this - tracking big ?'s in 8 slots, indexed by the block's X-High (x / 256 pixels) value. Moreover, the byte that tracks this ($7e2) is cleared when Mario dies or enters a new world, but NOT on routine level entry.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This works fine for SMB3, which used these blocks sparingly. But KMB3 uses them extensively, so certain strings of deathless play can result in some or all of the big ? blocks being hit before the level is entered! If the level design requires use of that suit, you're forced to take a death to reset $7e2. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"My patch above fixes this problem without any other significant effect on gameplay (though this movie won't synch due to different resulting lag in F3). And just to be clear, this movie was done with the original ROM, working around the glitch by choosing which ?'s to hit and using a TAS-only strat to complete the otherwise-impassable final castle without taking any deaths. Unless someone is able to scale vertical walls in Bowser's castle unassisted, it is impossible to complete the unmodified KMB3 unassisted without dying.

There are a huge variety of ways to combine jumping into the field of coins with throwing the shell; many have bizarre or useless results. This combo is the best I found, allowing for rapid construction of an exit tunnel 2 blocks high, with running room to accelerate.

Grabbing the leaf in the air shortens how long P-speed is active -- this actually saves time because Mario decelerates while flying, and max flight time is not required. Once P-speed expires Mario maintains near running speed while gliding by allowing a few frames of free-fall before each tail wag.

Because of Kuribo's bouncing movements, big Mario can't make it through the narrow spike tunnels like small Mario can. Fortunately, it's faster to ditch the Kuribo's shoe at the tunnel entrance and use the invincibility period to get P-speed and fly up to the top of the level. More time is saved by doing a duck-jump/flight through the short tunnel into a wall jump to shorten the flight time upward.

	"At the top of the level is that rare case in SMB3 where P-speed is easily available but it's faster not to use it -- if P-speed is obtained Mario decelerates as he flies down to a speed of 23 -- just under walking speed. Without P-speed, Mario can still glide pretty far but by spacing out the tail flapping slightly can maintain a much faster x speed of 38-40.
