	"For the most part, this was a very fun run to work on.  Planning out a route through the game for the use of sub-items and when to be powered up with what in order to finish the game quickly was very enjoyable to me.  The only part of this run I didn't like recording was World 8, because Genisto already dominated that World and I was just floundering in a sea of non-ninja-ness trying to catch up.

	"Several levels may appear to have a delay when grabbing the card at the end.  This is done to manipulate the hammer brothers on the map screen into moving as little as possible (or into a specific spot, if needed).  It was also important to make sure that three matching cards were never grabbed.  In some levels, a flower was reachable without slowdown, but in others, delays are needed so that different cards are taken.

It's possible to enter the second pipe underground and glitch through the pipe there to finish the level, but this ended up being slower than the (somewhat) standard route.

Also thanks to Nitsuja, Hanzou, and Kyrsimys again for helping me with the glitch that lets you zip (well, crawl is more like it) through the walls.  Thanks to FODA, 4Masty, Tailz, Bag of Magic Food, Randil, Saturn, A Runnelid, Andypro, Kitsune, and everyone else on the forums who offered encouragement (you can never have enough of that)!  And finally, an extra thanks to Hanzou for editing the movie to begin from power-on rather than soft-reset.  Color me n00bed!
