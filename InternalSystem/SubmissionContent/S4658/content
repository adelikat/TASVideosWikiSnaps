[p 
	"I used Bizhawk but not VBA. Bizhawk can't run Super Game Boy properly as long as I tested, so I decided to use original GB mode. This mode has shorter loading over SGB mode which is part of save time. Major timesavers are better movement, different battle strategy and tricks. In Soulrivers' run, he used star to kill boss. Star is most powerful (10 damage) but he had to wait until boss produced it. Coo Cutter is good ability because not only Coo can move fastest during flying part but also Cutter damage is really good (3-ways shot, it can damage 6).
