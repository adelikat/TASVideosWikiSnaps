	"Star Wars: Bounty Hunter has several gameplay aspects that allow for entertaining and optimized speedruns. These include:
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		" Blaster speed is only dependent on framerate, so you can shoot up to 30 times per second! This is very helpful in levels where lots of enemies need to be killed.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" When Jango targets an enemy and jumps towards them, he will move significantly faster than if he were to use a jetpack or just run normally.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Out of bounds is present in several levels and easily saves a few minutes of time, such as in Sebolto's Compound or Tusken Canyon.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Intentional death is useful in The Escape, as it is faster to die and respawn at the checkpoints rather than go back to them.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" A level ends when all of the cutscenes are played, and they do not have to be in order. This means that in some levels, it is much faster to play cutscenes in a different order than was originally intended.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Other miscellaneous strategies that saved lots of time, such as certain ways of completing the level that were not intended by the developer. For instance, in Gardulla's Palace, Jango would normally have to get all his weapons back and fight dozens of enemies and kill the Krayt Dragon at the end. Several minutes are saved by punching the dragon at the beginning which, after passing through another checkpoint, will end the level extremely quickly.
