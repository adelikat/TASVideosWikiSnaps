	"Cyborg Hunter is a horizontal scrolling, action video game released in 1988 on the Sega Master System. The game was originally developed as a title called Chōonsenshi Borgman (超音戦士ボーグマン), and was based on an animated TV series of the same name. For non-Japanese territories the game was marketed as Cyborg Hunter. The Japanese version of the game has a storyline more resemblant of the anime series.

	"I decided to TAS this game for 2 reasons: 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"1 - This is a interessing game.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"2 - The published TAS is one of oldest SMS/GG movies, and was done on Dega emulator. I actually decided to TAS this game 1.5 weeks before at the creation of the 'Dega Project' topic.

[p 
	"This TAS was played and is done using the USA/Europe version, since the published run used this version. Also, the japanese version of the game was originally released with FM sound.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"It's possible to play the FM sound on the western release. But since the FM wasn't released outside Japan, I resynched the TAS to FM on the japanese version of the game (It's a cool sound): http://tasvideos.org/userfiles/info/40095784595525036

	"JP version is 21 seconds faster than US/Europe version, because of faster text. But due of version and sound differences, the pattern of the last 2 bosses (I tried to fix this), was ruined, forcing me to add more time on that bosses. Most of the run was resynched with TAStudio, but due of different pattern of the last boss, I did a new (but slower) way to defeat this boss, manually.
