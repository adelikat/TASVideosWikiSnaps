	"This is a 333 frame improvement over my 2018 submission.  There's not really a whole lot of new stuff here, the majority of the timesaves is just due to better optimization.  Some of the changes include getting slightly faster level warps and a few general movement changes to save frames.  The only real change comes from the second to last stage in "Mickey and the Beanstalk" where I used a moth to skip the first ledge in the stage.

	"So this game has an interesting panic handler.  In that under certain conditions, if the game detects a crash is about to happen (such as too many sprites on screen), it will bring up a "level warp" screen that lets you skip to the next level.  This is apparently a trick that Travelers Tales did for their old games to get past bug testers.  If the game does anything unexpected, it will pretend that you unlocked a secret level warp.  As far as I can tell, only a few TT games have producible instances of this, Toy Story on SNES is one of them.  They weirdly do not come up often for any of their Genesis titles, and my theory is that TT usually developed their games with Genesis in mind, and these bugs only popped up when they were porting it to Super Nintendo.  I have no proof this is the case, but it's the most likely explanation to me at least.
