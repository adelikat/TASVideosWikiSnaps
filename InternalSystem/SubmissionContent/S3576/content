	"Being my first full TAS, I really didn't know what to expect. I felt like working on some game that probably wouldn't get done. I've been working on this for several weeks. Quite a bit of planning has gone into this, specifically route planning. I've had to draw out the map of the game and where each of the clues are located many times. My first attempt was 69990 frames, while this one is down to 69467, a 523 frame improvement.

	"The main improvement has been timing on jumps. A jump that would normally overshoot a platform can be used to jump again and maintain speed. Another improvement is intentionally taking damage. At the end of each case, the health is restored, allowing eight hits to be taken during each case. Other glitches include:

Sadly, I think the NES library is pretty tapped out of good titles worthy of publication. Sorry, rejecting for bad game choice. However, I hope to see more TASes from you in the future!
