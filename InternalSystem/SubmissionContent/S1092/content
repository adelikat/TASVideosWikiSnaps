		"Avoiding lag from pressing the "run" button. In order to initiate Pan's running, the Y button must be pressed and held. Unfortunately the Y button is also linked to his sword attack, which causes ~20 frames of delay. I discovered a clever way of avoiding the sword attack animation sequence. By pressing the pause button hitting the Y button and then unpausing, the game thinks that you were already holding the Y button before you paused the game. As a result of this trick there is no attack animation. You will see the game quickly pause and unpause at the beginning of every stage, in total the tricks uses 3 frames.

		"Ledge detection tricks are used in a couple of instances. Basically if a slanted ledge is too high for Pan to reach, you can reverse directions in the middle of the jump and when Pan does his flip, he will catch onto the ledge.

		"In level 3 I use damage boosts from a couple enemies to reach platforms which would be otherwise unreachable. This trick saves an absurd amount of time. Probably ~20 seconds saved compared to the traditional method of climbing the level.

		"I discovered one nice little sequence break during the game. In the final level you see me land on top of some spikes, and then run and reach that exit door. Normally a person would not be able to reach that door, and it requires frame precision to get enough momentum to make Pan jump far enough.
