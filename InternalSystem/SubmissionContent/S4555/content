	"The floor is made of tiles. When the boss zaps a tile, the tile becomes deadly. The challenge is to manipulate the the trap layout so that no unnecessary moves are required. It becomes a bit complicated, because the upcoming section needs to be manipulated too. The final challenge is a door with 8 possible keys. Hugo is given five seconds to memorize the the shape of the lock and then he needs to choose the correct key. 2 frames could be saved by having the correct key at the initial cursor location.

	"I'm not sure whether I should submit this or not. I was going to make a little better run, but the game turned out to require too many tiny RNG manipulations for my taste. Even the order of levels is randomized, which makes perfect luck manipulation rather tricky. Do whatever you want with this.
