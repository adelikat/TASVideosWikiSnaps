	"Crusader of Centy (also known as Soleil in Europe and Shin Sōseiki Ragnacënty (新創世紀ラグナセンティ, Shin Sōseiki Ragunasenti) (New Genesis: Ragnacënty) in Japan) is an action-adventure game that was released on the Genesis/Mega Drive. The story centers on Corona, a boy who has just turned 14 years of age and must inherit his late father's sword to fight the monsters that threaten the human race's existence. Gameplay uses an overhead perspective and focuses on exploring, battling enemies with a sword, and solving puzzles. As the story progresses, numerous animals join the hero and aid him. They are used in gameplay like weapons or tools, which often grant passage to previously inaccessible areas.

The dungeon have some different strats. In RTA you could carry the stone to speedjump and save some time and use slides to skip some parts of the map. TASing this part makes it possible to slide precise build some speed and clear this dungeon while the first storm cycle because we got the speed of "cheeta" and sliding. Also I skipped the textbox of the boss with framperfect pause.

Inside we prepare just open the way with some tricks and need to manipulate the game spawn that allows us to get oob and skip the most of the map. The boss Georama needed some manipulation about movement because we need to give him the last hit while we're standing at the door to leave the room. That looks and sounds easy but also this boss is a trollbeast like Roxie about that. Leaving the room after killing him skips the whole undercastle part and a boss.

In there we skip the first part with the bee manipulation. The bee carry us the whole way to the end. The next door we manipulate the spawn to skip the rest. This happens if we dont touch the place with the sign and fall down. Inside the boss room we using slides to save some time and kill the boss fast from behind.
