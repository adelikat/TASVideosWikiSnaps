	"This run is kinda "an appetiser" to fighting game players who are still undecided to try this game. It's not perfect but it has it's nice moments. The enemies can be quite annoying and I had to throw em quite a few times to keep myself safe, sneaky little buggers. 
	$LF
	"Sometimes I stop hitting and enemy and turn around to attack another one. It's intentional because I know more enemies will spawn and I can defeat them in one bunch later. Few miss punches but nothing really time consuming happens.
