	"This run is kinda "an appetiser" to fighting game players who are still undecided to try this game. It's not perfect but it has it's nice moments. The enemies can be quite annoying and I had to throw em quite a few times to keep myself safe, sneaky little buggers.

	": Well, I think this topic is closed now. Btw, at bonuses stage, you can hit things twice by doing the normal attack then doing the other one. It's when you press down+hit. It will be a lot faster this way.
