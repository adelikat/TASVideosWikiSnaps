Most of this timesave, though, was actually found before 2021, so this run has been in the works since before tunneling was found. For example, the Wario painting clip which saved time on the Endless Stairs Skip was found in late 2017.

It was also known that we could cancel the top of the pyramid star with the upper pyramid loading zone to collect 2 stars in 1 trip into the stage. It turned out to be faster to do these 3 stars than collect the red coin star in LLL. At first this route was only 40 frames faster but eventually it was improved to over 15 seconds faster, mostly by using shell hyperspeed to open the pyramid (suggested by ThePianoEnthusiast) and by cancelling the top of the pyramid star by clipping through the rising pyramid top instead of using a fly guy (found by Really_Tall).

Soon after, Really_Tall found the Sideways Long Jump technique in hopes of saving time with this strategy. It is most useful on slopes that you can’t long jump on when facing up the slope, but can long jump on when facing down the slope. There aren’t many of these in the game, but the bridge after the vine satisfies this condition. Migu TASed it and saved 14 frames, and Sharkey91 improved it by another 8 frames. In 2024, Rupa redid this whole section saving another 50 frames.

	"In 2021, Adeal and Really_Tall discovered that it is barely possible to do a triple jump with Y run speed off the box, dive at the peak of the jump, and wall jump the wall of the platform above. The box first needs to be pushed because this moves the box up slightly. The starting vertical velocity of a jump is proportional to your speed, but if there is a large difference between your motion and facing angles when starting a jump, your horizontal speed is dramatically reduced, which is done here. Sharkey91 and Migu TASed the triple jump. Migu and Rupa TASed the movement up the rotating elevator. This saved 96 frames in total.

	"Coming from this direction, it became faster to activate the staircase which makes it possible to do a strat that was theorized while making the previous run. We can do another low-speed triple jump from the top of the stairs and dive and wall jump off the side of the arrow platform, instead of landing on the checkerboard platform as in the previous run. This was TASed by Migu and saved an additional 182 frames. Afterwards, Migu found a way to land and double jump immediately after the first jump on the stone walkway, which was 10 frames faster than the previous method of cutting the double jump short.

	(__wikiLink|displaytext=major skip glitch|href=/MovieTagGuidelines#MajorSkipGlitch)
	" is that it needs to skip a major chunk of the game compared the quickest goal avoiding it, the most obvious case being 50% of gameplay being skipped. With tunneling, if we discard all of the intro, I get 35% skipped. Still this only affects the class this movies goes to, which doesn't put any extra limitations on this goal even if it's considered Alternative class only.

	"The branch labels need some explanation too. If tunneling is going to be avoided in most goals, then we can't use "no tunneling" because it'd imply most goals are an exception to the norm (usage of tunneling). Since avoiding tunneling is more common, we highlight the goal that features it. But since the goal that avoids it (this movie) doesn't 
	[em 
		"feature anything other goals avoid

	", there's simply nothing to put into its label. This is common for games with major skip glitches, and from my talk with Really_Tall from 2018, BLJ is the major skip glitch that is normally used already (hence it doesn't need to be in labels).
