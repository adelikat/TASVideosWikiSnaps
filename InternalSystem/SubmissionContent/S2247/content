	"The most important feature of this run is to keep damage boost-speed. By pressing Down, the speed is kept, but to avoid crouching, one must jump as soon as the player hits the ground. This does not to the skateboard or snowboard. Yeah. He has a skateboard. He rocks. This reminds me of my

	"I start the run by picking up the egg in the room with the old dinosaur. The egg is later used as a teleport device. I decided not to take damage in the first room since it would have been less effective than later. After getting out of the cave, I stumble on a rock for the purpose of manipulating luck. The aftermath of this is that I get a star from the spider-thing. The Star is used to kill the miniboss faster (The Star does 16 damage per hit, the bone only 2, and the boss has 30 HP). After getting the Hammer, I proceed to the right. Now, it's time for the first damage boost in this game! As you might notice, the game keeps the speed when entering a new room. Thank you, game designers!

[p 
	"The first "dungeon" is a joke. See how short it is! I manage to hit the boss twice per attack, making the Hammer as efficient as the Bone, but I won't have to change weapon, which saves time. The boss goes down with relative ease, and I am awarded with a torch and a Dino! Woho! Running through the room leads you to the cabin again. Time for new adventures!

	"As you progress down the ladder, you see that the cookie has crumbled! Cookie, in this case, being another word for rock. Early in the next room, I take damage for another damage boost. It is relatively short, but I gain time from it due to getting the dinosaur in the next room. The Dino moves slightly faster than Higgins and does 4 damage per attack. It can also walk through lava. Using the Dino's lethal powers, I get the Water Gun...thing which must be used to resurrect plants and put out fires. I take a long damage boost when there's Volcanoes in the background and progress to the boss. Here, Dino makes the best of the situation, and in the end, I sacrifice him as a lethal weapon to kill the last flame. On a related note, the dinosaurs are returned to the the den after each boss so booo.
