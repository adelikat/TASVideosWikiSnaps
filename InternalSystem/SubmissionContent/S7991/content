	"Jigoku Meguri (translated roughly as Hell Tour), also known as Bonze Adventure, is a platform game for arcades released in 1988. This TAS is of the PC Engine port made in 1990. You play as Bonze Kackremboh, a Buddhist priest and son of the Divine Dragon. Your mission is to confront Emma, the King of the Underworld, as he has lost control of the underworld and monsters from Japanese folklore are spilling into the overworld. Bonze must travel through nine levels to get to Emma.

	"Bonze's only form of attack is shooting Buddhist prayer beads at his enemies. Collecting a ring of prayer beads will increase the amount of beads allowed on screen, up to 5 I think. The beads begin as blue, the weakest beads. Collecting a green, red or purple bead will turn the beads that colour respectively, and collecting other beads of the same colour will increase the size of your beads. The different colours also allow you to use different special attacks when you press down and attack. Green gives you a ring of smaller beads that envelope the screen, red gives you a wall of fireballs that shoot outwards, and purple is a screen-wipe lightning attack. Purple is the most powerful, green is the least, however all of them are used in this TAS.

	"Invincibility frames are your best friend in this game. Being inside an enemy while invincible damages them every frame (I think)Two items can give you invincibility frames. One is the angel thing, which gives you a forcefield, which gives you an extra hit and a second or two of invincibility frames. The second is the mirror, which gives you like 20 seconds of invincibility. This item is the most useful, as it means I can just speed through enemies without dying or slowing down to hit them.

[div class=p 
	"One thing to note about this game is the item pickup. Hitting the ground in certain places with your beads will make an item spawn. It is very easy to change what items are spawned, but, knowing my luck, very hard to get what you need. Usually I need the mirror, but it's so rare I can just never get my hands on it, despite my manipulation attempts. There are places of slowdown that can be improved, but when I tried it, I could not get the invincibility required to kill the boss of level 3, so I had lost more time than I gained. Everything is as it is for a reason, I guess.

	"Yeah so this level is fairly straight forward. I pick up an invincibility mirror so I can just walk straight through the evil obelisk and to the end of the level. Also, ladders are weird ijn this game. Instead of pressing up or something, instead you just kinda stick to ladders when you're in the right place. The fastest way to climb is not hold up, but rather to jump out and back into the ladder, so you stick to it again, and rinse repeat. It gets more annoying in the later levels.

	"The ONLY boat level in the game. Though it controls the same as boatless Bonze so it doesn't matter that much. The geyser blocks the bottom path at the end of the level, which forces a slowdown because I can't jump over the spikeball without waiting a bit.

Twice in this run they block my path, very annoying. Also this level has an unskippable boss. I defeat it by using the lightning attack from the purple beads and using the mirror from the secret patch in the boss arena to deal invincibility damage. Few more beads and the guy is down

	"This ice level makes it very hard to turn around. Turning around in the air in other levels is usually instant, but in this level, it is almost impossible to do quickly. The quickest way to turn around is to hit a wall and then turn around, as it happens instantly and saves time over turning gradually. I damage through the slime thanks to the angel item, saving me loads of time and button-mashing.
