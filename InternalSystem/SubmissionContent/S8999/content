	"1. The goal is simply unacceptable under our current ruleset, which has limitations on the 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=type of goals allowed for publication|href=/MovieRules#GoalChoice)
	". Mainly, we generally only accept movies which actually complete the game in one form or another. Simply crashing the game is not acceptable as a possible publication goal, especially if such a movie is nothing more than a slightly different fastest completion route using ACE. Crashing the game could potentially be allowed under the

Of course, this just highlights the issue of slightly modifying an existing movie which uses ACE to perform a different goal, as you simply don't provide anything significantly different with your movie (something required for movies looking to be published under the 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Alternative|href=/MovieRules#Alternative)
