	"Marvel Land is a platformer. It was originally an arcade game but was remade on the Genesis/Megadrive. King Mole has captured the four protectors of a park named Marvel Land. Prince Talmit must race through Marvel Land in the fastest time, defeating four bosses and rescuing the protectors.

	"This run plays the hardest difficulty, Game Master, which makes the enemies stronger and more numerous. In addition, Game Master (as opposed to the easiest difficulty, Digest) plays through all the levels available in the game. All difficulties, however, are such that one hit will kill the player, so taking no damage is a must.
