	"the hardest levels to TAS were the mermaid stages, hitting the A button on every other green frame allows barbie to move at maximum speed.  it's annoying because I had to hide lag frames to make sure I got it on every other green frame as much as possible.  if you wanna know where most of the rerecords came from, it's these stages.  also barbie's mermaid sprite is huge, so it's difficult to get around some enemies.
