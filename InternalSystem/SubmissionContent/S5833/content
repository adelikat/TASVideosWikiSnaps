	": This movie is an excellent masterpiece among Super Metroid TASes. The new tricks and techniques push the game to the limit and almost put it to its breaking point, although this run retains its goals of using no major game-breaking glitches or out-of-bounds tricks, so that it does not outright skip very significant parts of the game. The result is a spectacle to watch throughout, even when the graphics break near the end of the run. Samus' movement is trickier yet sleeker than ever, intended sequences are broken more than ever, and the routing is crazier than any of its predecessors. Ammo and health management are top-notch too, and are pushed to the limit repeatedly. Technical optimization is on point all throughout the movie.

	"While RBO was a significant novelty back when the category and TASes of it were first introduced, its significance has been reduced thanks to various new tricks that have been discovered since the latest RBO TAS (dating to 2012) and have been applied in movies such as this. In particular, this run features a highly unusual boss route of its own, with Ridley done before Draygon and Draygon done before Phantoon. In essence, three out of four bosses are already done in reverse order, meaning RBO's novelty is largely reduced to leaving Kraid for last and backtracking to him later in the run. Many of the currently published RBO run's famous gimmicks, like suitless Maridia, are now also featured in this movie, and while it still does have some unique features including the suitless health management in Lower Norfair, it does not do enough unique things to distinguish itself as its own unique category anymore - hence, I'm making the decision of having this movie obsolete it.

	" requirements. Currently it does not look like a new movie following the same rules as the currently published RBO TAS, but using the same tricks as this movie, would provide a sufficiently different movie to be worth a separate publication again - but this situation might change in the future, or the category itself might diversify itself enough with different rules potentially involving Mother Brain or sub-bosses, but no definite judgment can be made on this unless or until such a movie were to be made.
