[pre

[p 
	"This is an even newer Any% TAS of Super Metroid, involving a vastly different and superior route to save an enormous amount of time over my previous Any% TAS. With a real time of 35:58.3 and in-game time of 20:59:44 (minutes:seconds:frames), I have improved upon that TAS by a whopping 103 real time seconds and 97 in-game time seconds. Even though the in-game time is right on the edge of the next minute, no real time was sacrificed to achieve it.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"X-Ray (along with a R-Tank) has been incorporated into this run, which saves around 11 seconds through various wild applications. This is also the first full-game TAS that takes complete advantage of the moonfall technique.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The production of this TAS was lengthy, and multiple times, it would be restarted from some point in the beginning to correct mistakes and/or incorporate new discoveries, such as moonfall. There are many tiny, near-invisible optimizations in the majority of rooms, and some cool, completely new strategies applied throughout.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The main goal of this Any% TAS was to beat the game by applying all of the discoveries from the past several years, barring the usage of out of bounds and memory corruption of course.
	$LF

[h2 
	"Route Outline
	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"Proving itself to be the greatest boss order of all time, and matching the Low% TAS, 
	[b 
		"Kraid -> Ridley -> Draygon -> Phantoon
	]b
	" is the boss order of choice here. As a result, most of the beam upgrades were brought back (sorry Spazer), and Gravity Suit was thrown into the ocean.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Yet again, I grab the Brinstar R-Tank as it is required for performing a trick referred to as "God Mode", or G-Mode for short, which is activated to enter Lower Norfair from what is normally its exit, rather than from its elevator. Although the R-Tank can serve as a replacement to one E-Tank for the purpose of surviving MB's rainbow beam, a fourth tank (a third E-Tank) would prove too valuable to attempt skipping, due to the extreme amount of energy consumed throughout the run from sparks.
	$LF

[h2 
	"New Techniques
	$LF
]h2
[h3 
	"Moonfall
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"By moonwalking then pressing jump (frame 1: < or > + X, frame 2: A), instead of performing a jump, Samus will perform a turnaround animation right before performing the jump.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This particular jump will not write a new value to its vertical direction (7E0B36), causing its Y-speed value to underflow, if performed from the normal ground state. Normally, Samus's falling speed is capped at ~5 pixels per frame, but by performing this jump, her speed will be uncapped.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Therefore, by performing a moonfall, it is possible to acquire a large amount of falling speed, which can be used to pass through entire tiles. A standard tile is 16 pixels by 16 pixels.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Additionally, it is also possible to store this speed by pixel-and-frame-perfectly unmorphing onto a surface, whereby this stored speed can be unleashed later by performing the moonfall inputs again. The speed will remain stored so long as Samus does not crouch, uncrouch, jump, fall off of a surface, or get struck by something.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Inverse CWJ Methods
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"A few new methods were found for performing inverse CWJs, or ICWJs, during the development of this TAS:
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		"Freezing an enemy in order to ICWJ from it, and then slaying it immediately after walljumping from it to prevent colliding with it and thus losing speed. Performed using the Mochtroids in 
		[a class=extlink href=https://wiki.supermetroid.run/Colosseum rel=nofollow 
			"Colosseum
		]a
		".
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		"Performing an ICWJ and then immediately morphing afterward to prevent a collision. Performed in the 
		[a class=extlink href=https://wiki.supermetroid.run/Three_Muskateers%27_Room rel=nofollow 
			""Three Musketeers" room
		]a
		" upon entering Lower Norfair through G-Mode - by kicking off of the second mechanical pillar and then morphing afterward, it became possible to barely maneuver over the acid.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[h3 
	"X-Mode
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Activating X-Ray on the same frame that the knockback timer expires alters some properties of X-Ray, allowing for horizontal movement via arm pumping, and even activating sparks. X-Ray normally resets the spark timer immediately upon activating, but does not do so in this mode.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"G-Mode
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Discovered by EternisedDragon in 2015. Running out of energy during a door transition does not trigger the R-Tank's "Auto" feature before the next room is fully loaded. When the next room finishes loading, there is one frame of game play before the R-Tank activates.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This frame can be used to activate X-Ray, and although doing so would normally cause the less-useful "R-Mode", found many years ago by Kejardon, G-Mode can be achieved instead if the input used for activating X-Ray is released within a ~3 frame window, while the R-Tank finishes refilling Samus's energy.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This enables control over Samus, but leaves some properties of X-Ray active - for example, the game is unable to execute any PLMs, such as crumble blocks or screen scroll controllers (which is the reason the camera doesn't follow Samus during this mode), meaning activating too many PLMs will cause the queue to fill up and make most of them nonsolid. Thus, through G-Mode, Lower Norfair is easily accessible through 
	[a class=extlink href=https://wiki.supermetroid.run/Single_Chamber rel=nofollow 
		"what is normally its exit
	]a
	" by jumping through the nonsolid pillars and crumble blocks.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The mode is disabled whenever X-Ray is activated again, and since doors are also PLMs, they will not open while the mode is active (excluding the initial door, which stays open when the mode is first activated, allowing the mode to persist into the room you were originally in).
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Superjump
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Discovered by SUPERMETROIDFTP in 2015 after he found that releasing X-Mode while sparking vertically would result in a crazy amount of speed. The reason for such speed is that during vertical sparks, speed continues building by ~7 pixels per frame for unknown reasons.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Despite the speed increase, the spark does not use the memory address associated with such speed; however, if the spark is interrupted by deactivating X-Ray, that speed becomes Samus's new speed, which can be a value of up to hundreds of pixels per frame depending on how long the spark progressed before X-Ray was deactivated.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Additionally, whenever X-Ray is deactivated while sparking, a blue suit is generated, which proves to be quite useful over the course of the run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Although superjumps can be used to easily access out of bounds areas, Samus never enters an out of bounds area during this run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"A superjump can be stored if it is released slightly above ground height. Samus will be placed in a standing position on the ground with her vertical speed maintained, which can be unleashed through various different means. This is referred to as a "stored superjump".
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"Dash Swap
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"If dash is held while X-Ray is selected in the HUD, it prevents the Charge timer from increasing and even allows for the release of the shot button to maintain the Charge timer's value. As a result, it is possible to morph in midair - while maintaining a beam's charge - without turning around first.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Although a unique detail, it only managed to save one frame within the run - while revisiting 
	[a class=extlink href=https://wiki.supermetroid.run/Wasteland rel=nofollow 
		"Wasteland
	]a
	", a charge was maintained through the tunnel in order to open the vertical door one frame earlier due to the charge shot's larger hitbox.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	"X-Plasma
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Certain foes, such as Phantoon, Botwoon, and Draygon, are unique in that their invulnerability frames will still elapse while X-Ray is active, effectively allowing for one charged Plasma shot to strike them multiple times, similar to the infamous "pause glitch" in Mega Man. Technically not a new technique, but worth mentioning anyway.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"There were no real time improvements to this area compared to my previous runs; however, I did manage to save 1 in-game frame by falling down Construction Zone 1 frame faster, which caused the door to become 1 pixel off-center.

	"Kraid's Lair
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Two of the pirates were farmed at the cost of 10-20 frames, and the d-boost before the Gadora was skipped at the cost of 9 frames, in order to maintain enough energy for the lag reduction performed during Kraid's rising sequence (without getting "health bombed" afterward).

	": This movie is an excellent masterpiece among Super Metroid TASes. The new tricks and techniques push the game to the limit and almost put it to its breaking point, although this run retains its goals of using no major game-breaking glitches or out-of-bounds tricks, so that it does not outright skip very significant parts of the game. The result is a spectacle to watch throughout, even when the graphics break near the end of the run. Samus' movement is trickier yet sleeker than ever, intended sequences are broken more than ever, and the routing is crazier than any of its predecessors. Ammo and health management are top-notch too, and are pushed to the limit repeatedly. Technical optimization is on point all throughout the movie.
	$LF

	"Regarding categorization: as this movie is defined by having no major skips or usage of out-of-bounds glitches, this movie shall not be affected by published Arbitrary Code Execution or previously published X-Ray Out-of-Bounds glitch movies, and instead shall obsolete 
	(__wikiLink|3362M|the currently published any% run)
	". Alongside that, it shall also obsolete 
	(__wikiLink|2078M|the currently published Reverse Boss Order movie)
	".

	"While RBO was a significant novelty back when the category and TASes of it were first introduced, its significance has been reduced thanks to various new tricks that have been discovered since the latest RBO TAS (dating to 2012) and have been applied in movies such as this. In particular, this run features a highly unusual boss route of its own, with Ridley done before Draygon and Draygon done before Phantoon. In essence, three out of four bosses are already done in reverse order, meaning RBO's novelty is largely reduced to leaving Kraid for last and backtracking to him later in the run. Many of the currently published RBO run's famous gimmicks, like suitless Maridia, are now also featured in this movie, and while it still does have some unique features including the suitless health management in Lower Norfair, it does not do enough unique things to distinguish itself as its own unique category anymore - hence, I'm making the decision of having this movie obsolete it.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Note that this does not mean any sort of reverse boss order is no longer publishable, but it does mean that a new movie of that category has to prove itself again as providing sufficient amounts of new and different material, per 
	(__wikiLink|Moons)
	" requirements. Currently it does not look like a new movie following the same rules as the currently published RBO TAS, but using the same tricks as this movie, would provide a sufficiently different movie to be worth a separate publication again - but this situation might change in the future, or the category itself might diversify itself enough with different rules potentially involving Mother Brain or sub-bosses, but no definite judgment can be made on this unless or until such a movie were to be made.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Going back to the judgment of this particular movie: viewer response to this movie has been highly positive, even compared to previous Super Metroid movies, and has also been favorable compared to the presently starred Reverse Boss Order publication - therefore, my judgment is that this movie should inherit its star.
