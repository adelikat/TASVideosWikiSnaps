	"genesis differences:
	$LF
	"Enemies are less agressive but bosses are much harder in later stages, i actually used super attack in the stage 3 boss cause the cycle was infuriating without it and i couldn't find a way to not get knocked down.

	"Super attack icons are absent in some locations and i couldn't find any replacement for some of them.
