	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Unlike the previous run, RNG manipulation is achieved by intentionally allowing the game to decrement a random number generation counter, that counts from 0x270 to 0x1. After 0x1, it goes back to 0x270. This is called the "RNG counter". The lottery ticket prize generation is determined by another value associated with the RNG counter, called the "determinant". It helps to guarantee the lottery ticket prize generation to be unique, after every cycle, rather than being predetermined by the RNG counter that loops between 0x270 and 0x1.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"In the previous run, RNG manipulation is used to obtain consecutive prizes using Lotto Tix (in-game lottery tickets) in order to have enough money to buy stats-boosting items, as well as manipulating the store stock refresh item listings. For this run, RNG manipulation is used to buy a higher Lotto Tix prize (3rd prize), and quick store item stock manipulation to get a special item, Skaterz.

]div
[div class=p 
	"For every couple of frames, the game calculates what random action the enemies will take, such as jumping, running, moving up/down/left/right, attacking, or running away, subtracting from the RNG counter. There is much to learn from the mechanics of the RNG counter and how it affects the CPU enemies' responses to player actions, and enemy types throughout the areas. You may see me do weird behaviors that priorizes RNG manipulation over speed, for this reason.

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The first one is about manipulating lottery tickets faster. This can be done, but you would never have any idea of what potential improvements you will get, unless you can efficiently defeat the gang types in MOOSE and ROCKO areas, and get to Merlin's Secret as close to 0x1 or 0x270 as much as possible. In this run, I tried to get the maximum value possible, 0x1E3. There are cases where, even if you get the same RNG counter values, the determinant values can increment more than one time within a single frame. Therefore, it's not guaranteed you will get the fastest 3rd Prize winnings, but it's more probable to start from the extreme ends of the RNG counter.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The second one, I had the chance of trying this out on IVAN. Unfortunately, when bosses recover by jumping into the air, they have a ton of invincibility frames until they land on the ground. These invincibility frames can also trigger when they are hit by a large weapon 1 time, including being kicked towards them. This does not have any potentials for improvement.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The third one is the most promising one, and the most cursed one of all. In Merlin's Secrets, there is an item called "Skaterz", which allows you to warp to your enemies' back when you initiate an attack action. Attack action is when you do any of the combinations of buttons that will trigger a special technique, including techniques belonging to someone else when you obtained the Custom Char scroll item. However, you require to turn this technique off for the final boss fight, as you cannot guarantee to force the bosses out-of-bounds without being able to toss them behind your back, and warping away from the ideal position to pull this off.

[div class=p 
	"When starting the game, the game menu first shows up. This is where I need to quickly configure the difficulty, as well as the text speed to VERY FAST. This helps with unskippable cutscenes with a lot of dialogues. I turned off Weapons, because this can make the run harder to complete on time and lose the "No Damages" specialty.

]div
[div class=p 
	"I make quick short work with the gang before MOOSE shows up.  To defeat MOOSE, the easiest way is to throw him down the construction zone pit. However, this time, MOOSE chose to activate his Shuriken technique, and not his usual movement pattern of moving downwards. There is small distance between my character (ALEX) and MOOSE, to pick him up and throw him down into the pit. Despite all of that, I was able to throw him down into the pit, at the cost of some frames due to his quick recovery.

	"The next boss is ROCKO. Entering the factory is where I begin fighting the gang in that area. Luckily, it's the Frat Boys, so their HP is pretty low and they are all easy to deal with. When ROCKO enters, I had to guide the enemy towards the left-most side of the factory, and then initiate the glitch to make ROCKO fall through the ground by re-aligning his position. If I don't do this, the battle will take even longer to finish.

[div class=p 
	"From here, I head on to the Armstrong Thru-way, to enter the Merlin's Secret shop. After obtaining 2 Lotto Tix, I head out, and start RNG manipulation. The goal is to decrement the RNG counter as fast as possible, and this means, attacking the enemy and landing hits as quickly as I can while I move around. After 2 successful 3rd Prize winnings, I head back into the shop to buy a couple of Excaliburs and a pair of Rocketeers. Excalibur allows you to increase your attack stats. Rocketeers allow you to run at the fastest possible speed. After exiting the store, I re-entered the shop to buy the special item, Skaterz, which allows you to warp around as you attack.

Then I did what I can to fight against RNG, and abuse the glitch to realign all 4 bosses off-bounds, in order to quickly end the run as fast as possible.
