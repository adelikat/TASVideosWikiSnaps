	"This is an any% run that uses a very different route from the previous submission. Using save corruption, one can trigger a glitch that allows you to overflow the boundaries of the inventory menu and use the menu's sort feature to pull values from unrelated sections of the game's code around as you see fit. We use this here to write a program that triggers the good ending, to put it as simply as possible. Will write a better description eventually
