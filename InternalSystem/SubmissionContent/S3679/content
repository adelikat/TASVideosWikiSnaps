	"Pressing any button affects when enemies attack, what attack they do, and probably other things. In the run, I often press "up" to manipulate enemies since it doesn't affect my speed.

	" Maintaining Speed
	$LF

[p 
	"When jumping with any character other than the fourth one, you automatically slow down. Attacking in mid air corrects this; it also allows you to prepare another sprint without losing speed.

	" Special Attack
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"When you use a special attack, you can inflict more damage as long as you spam the attack button. You can spam the attack button sooner if the special attack misses its target at the first hit - see the last boss battle for an example.

	" Preventing Knockback
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Usually, enemies get knocked back after you spam the attack button ~4 times. You can avoid this by pressing up/down every now and then to simply punch enemies without becoming a combo, therefore preventing enemies from flying away.
