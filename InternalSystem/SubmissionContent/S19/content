	"There was some discussion about whether this game can be done warpless, and 
	$LF
	"it turns out it's not possible. Not counting levels that require you to warp 
	$LF
	"to a new area in the same level, towards the end of the game there are some 
	$LF
	"levels that don't have flags, so you have to warp to new levels. As a 
	$LF
	"result, this run is not entirely "warpless" but is an honest attempt to 
	$LF
	"complete the game using as few warps as possible.

	"I did make a run which uses a special warp to get to the final boss from the 
	$LF
	"second level. I don't think it's submission-worthy, as I consider it a cheat 
	$LF
	"(nor is it particularly impressive, considering it's just the first two 
	$LF
	"levels and, magically, the last level). It's done by standing on a 
	$LF
	"particular P block, pushing down, right, and all three game buttons at the 
	$LF
	"same time.

	"First, the bad stuff. There's some unavoidable waiting that needs to be done 
	$LF
	"in four levels I can think of, two of which are significant. The flying 
	$LF
	"could be improved, particularly in areas where I can bounce on an enemy's 
	$LF
	"head to gain speed. There's a minor bit of lag on some climbing sequences, 
	$LF
	"and some tight staircases are hell to navigate quickly. The first boss I 
	$LF
	"think can be done a few seconds quicker. All in all I'd say there's maybe a 
	$LF
	"minute or two of improvement, using the same route. There's almost ten 
	$LF
	"seconds of score-counting at the end of every level (more if I get an extra 
	$LF
	"life), which makes a warpless version so much slower. I take damage on two 
	$LF
	"occassions because it's just not worth taking the in-game time to avoid. A 
	$LF
	"couple of helmets never see any use (maniaxe, eyeclops, and juggernaut) 
	$LF
	"because I don't really need offense or the ability to reveal hidden blocks.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"And now the good stuff: The hoverboard levels I think are particularly 
	$LF
	"impressive, as is climbing with Micromax (the fly). A couple of levels have 
	$LF
	"helmet-specific shortcuts that take a level that'd take a minute and cut it 
	$LF
	"down to a second. While I keep some helmets for quite a number of levels, 
	$LF
	"the helmets I use vary as time goes on, so it's not always the same. All 
	$LF
	"levels are done in less than a minute, including one which the game thinks 
	$LF
	"three and a half minutes is a fast time. I'm particularly proud of some of 
	$LF
	"the boss fights, too.
