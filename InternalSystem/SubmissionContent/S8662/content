	" in 1h 42m 29.53s made in 2017, the speedrunning community found a new interesting glitch, being the

It allows to equip the boomerang as adult Link in a fast and convenient way, allowing to complete Jabu Jabu's Belly as adult, which opened new routing possibilities for a new TAS and triggered my attention to start a new TAS. In the following months, new strategies were found to make new TASes faster. For instance, a

After extensive routing and testing, I felt ready to start the new TAS in December 2020, which I originally finished in August 2023. When I started the TAS, I expected this run to be about 7 minutes faster my previous TAS, but in the end, thanks to other strategies discovered throughout the run, I ended it up with a time of 1h 28m 25.55s, so 14 minutes faster, the double of what I initially expected.

But fortunately, it was the only point that desynced. Therefore, I had to redo the playthrough up to the first game reset, which resets RNG and global timer, so that the rest of inputs could be reproduced. In the end, it was fortunate that this desync happened, as I was then able to implement a new strategy that was found during the making of the TAS which I could not have implemented before because I already got past the adult section. This trick is the

Moreover, I improved other sections up to the reset after the Deku Tree wrong warp, where I saved another 10 seconds.

I could have reached the loading zone from lower, by climbing less the vine, but that would have caused Link to enter in the boss room with walking animation, which is problematic for the Wrong Warp later, because Link must exit the door by walking slowly (so that the door close closes slow enough to not disturb the camera), which is only achievable by landing on the loading zone while in the air.

	" trick, or either with a precise angle and a speed of -10 (obtainable from a slown down HESS). Using this strategy would allow to reach Dondongo's Cavern faster by roughly 25 seconds (in this case, we would catch bugs under the rock near the House of Skulltula and HESS to the gate). I also confirm that time of day is not a problem, as I am able to reach the Castle's Courtyard about 66 frames (22 "visual" frames) before guards blocking the courtyard arrive. I did not hover past the gate when this strategy was unknown because it required 4 bombchus, which was too much for the tricks coming later. This new trick was discovered when I already got past a big part of the adult section, so coming back to redo this part was not possible, even by hexing inputs later, as the Death Mountain Trail cutscene, and blowing up the rock in Goron City, would have required to redo most of the adult section I had already done.

	"- In mid 2022, it was noticed that being in first person mode (by pressing C-up) enables to gain control of Link a little sooner after some cutscenes, notably cutscenes where a chest appears. The time it saves depends on the cutscene and some other parameters I poorly understand. I have been aware of this trick while I was doing Forest Temple, so I used this trick from this point. I could have used it in at least one place, being the Hover Boots chest cutscene, which could have saved roughly 15 frames (5 "visual" frames).
