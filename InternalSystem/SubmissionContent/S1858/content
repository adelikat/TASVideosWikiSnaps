		"LFSR
	]a
	").  The RNG cycles on nearly every frame, but by playing in certain ways, it can be made to lag.  Hammer brothers will always move once, and continue to move until they land on an unoccupied space.  They will not attempt to move over a completed level or a pipe.

It would have gaine a few seconds overall, but due to hammer brother placement on World 5, it is not possible to avoid them without using a musicbox because the tower is considered the same as a pipe, which the hammer brothers will not move onto.

This is seemingly convenient because we're already fighting this hammer brother for the cloud, and we get a leaf in 6-5 anyway.  Unfortunately, getting this route to work required 2 extra hammer brother map movements, and then, having the leaf in the level prevented earlier jumping (due to the way the p-meter works).
