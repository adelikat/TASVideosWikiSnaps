	"Deal or No Deal is a popular TV game show that is based on cases. You pick a case as your own, not knowing what's in it. Then you choose from a variety of other cases, trying to get the lowest numbers from them to get a higher offer. After a certain number of cases, you get your offer and choose if you want it or keep going. Then  you pick more cases. If all the cases are picked but one, you get whatever is in you case.

I did enjoy the twist, but it still doesn't make up for all of the silly speech parts. Also, Howie Mandel really sucks. Audience reaction is the same - Deal or No Deal makes for a bad TAS.
