Annoyingly they would sometimes stand still for one frame upon landing, so I changed up the jumps to avoid this where necessary. The last level took far longer than any of the others, and it's definitely still improvable.

	"When I grabbed this original submission for judging, I stumbled across a quick glitch improvement on the very first level (explained below).  I checked to see if Randomno wanted to investigate the glitch further or if I should more fully examine the run myself to see if the glitch was an option beyond the first stage.  I ended up doing the more detailed evaluation of the run for further glitch use and any other improvements (as the original submission notes suggested there may be improvement possibilities in the final stage).

	" I quite accidentally discovered that pressing either character's jump button just before stage 1 started caused the level graphics to fade back out immediately after fading in.  The two characters were still visible and moved as normal, and the stage's geometry remained unchanged.  The stage was still completable as normal by getting the characters to the doors.  The fade-out glitch simply eliminated the need for a fade-out

Interesting fade-out glitch at the start, and then a couple other things caught me by surprise like jumping off the lava, and getting stuck on that one block deliberately so that the other player could move.  The game play certainly makes for a nice short watch. I was unable to find any improvements anywhere so quite optimized.
