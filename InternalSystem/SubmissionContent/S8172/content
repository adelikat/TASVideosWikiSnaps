	"When it comes to making Tetris games, when you make a full line, the game is supposed to remove it and make the rest of the stack above it fall one row. In practice, the easiest way to achieve this is by copying the row above the full line into the full line, then the row above that one into it, and you keep going until you reach the top of the playing field. So for example, if you fill the 4th row from the floor, row 5 gets copied to row 4, row 6 gets copied to row 5, row 7 gets copied to row 6, and so on.
	$LF
	"However, when you do this, you have to remember to then replace the highest row of the field with an empty row, otherwise you end up with the stack falling as usual, but whatever was in that row ends up copied into the row below, and nothing happends to the highest row, and it ends up duplicated. This is exactly what happens in WonderSwan Tetris: the field is actually 24 rows high (4 rows are invisible above where pieces appear), so row 24 gets copied down on every line clear, although the devs probably didn't notice because they never realised you could actually place pieces that high.

	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Unfortunately, the top of the visible field is also where our pieces appear, and if they appear in a wall, it's usually game over. It does end up being a problem when building to get pieces up high, but fortunately for us, the game straight up forgets to check whether our piece spawn location is blocked right after clearing a line for whatever reason, so once our line from row 24 gets copied into the visible field, that line gets cleared every time we place a piece so we don't have to worry about being blocked anymore, and we can let the game finish.

While you can't manipulate the piece sequence once you've started like you can in NES Tetris, you can still get a different piece sequence by waiting on the title screen. I took the first piece sequence I could and worked with it until i found something that worked, but I did end up discarding a few pieces on the stack. There could be either a better sequence or a better strategy that could lead to a faster time.

While there might be indeed a better possible piece RNG seed that seems like something that would be better suited for an improvement in the future due to the amount of work needed to check that.
