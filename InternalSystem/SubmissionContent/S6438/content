	"After 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=5562|href=/5562S)
	", I thought of a new movement pattern that should save time in certain parts. I didn't feel it warranted to redo the whole TAS, but it was admittedly itching a bit. A year later (autumn 2018), I picked up this game again for console speedrunning. I looked a bit more into the game mechanics this time around and got a better understanding of what happens during the flying glitch. It turned out that the diagonal movement in the helicopter in area 1 in my previous submission was completely unnecessary and 20 frames had been wasted. I decided to add an update on my to-do list...

	"The game has three different types of movement frames. 'Straight' (S), 'half-diagonal' (HD) and 'diagonal' (D). The first and last frame in a chain of diagonal movements will always be HD. When not limited in either direction, HD is the more efficient diagonal movement. The distance covered is very close between D and HD. However, HD's smaller angle means that it's better from a geometrical perspective when moving between two points that require diagonal movement. The previous submission used the following two methods.

	"There is an invincibility period when respawning after a death and also at the start of a new area. The timing for this period can be reset by getting hit by an explosion (but not e.g. by gun fire). This way you can extend the invincibility period indefinitely in certain parts of the game. The conditions are too specific for this to be any major game changer during normal game play, but it can be used to save time against the last boss.
