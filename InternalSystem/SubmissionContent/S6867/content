	"Crimson Room is a point and click series originally made in Adobe Flash and ported to Nintendo DS. The goal is to follow a set of steps to escape the room you're trapped in, and the DS version added an ingame timer to track your fastest escapes with. The Blue Chamber category is exactly what it sounds like, you escape the blue chamber as fast as you can. This TAS is on the Nintendo DS version.
