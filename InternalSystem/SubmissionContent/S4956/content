	"Borderline is a mediocre game for the SG-1000.  This is the sega console that pre-dates the Sega Master System.  There's really not much to say here.  The game is dull, and the TAS is dull.  Fortunately it is short.  It is just 4 levels, that repeat forever.  I complete the 4 levels once and end the movie.

	"The white thingies and even some of the walls and missile thingies are random here.  Some of my missed shots are to manipulate these.  Other missed shots your shots alternate coming out of the left or right side of the vehicle. This fact is a theme throughout all the levels, you will see me waste shots in order to set up the correct side for later.

	"Other than manipulating and shooting things optimally, you simply need to hold up to get to and maintain maximum speed.  That's about it.
