	(__wikiLink|displaytext=discussion|href=/Forum/Topics/8052)
	" about unpublication has been brought up before but think this could be a good compromise.  If this were published, any movie could be set as "obsoleted by" the publication grue.  This can be useful in some publications where a movie is indeed obsolete (due to an abundance of new tricks, or a change in TASVideos quality standards) but has no movie for which to replace it.

	" is a good example where the current run is heavily outdated and improvable by about an _hour_! Yet we are nowhere near seeing an improvement.  In such a case it could be obsoelted by the publication grue.  This way the movie stays on the site (and treated just like any other obsoleted movie) but is not displayed as a current "record".

I chose rerecord counts and movie length as such that they wouldn't mess with site statistics in any meaningful way.  If published it would be in its own unique "Grue" category so it would not interfere with movie lists.
