It is slow, autoscrolling stages, without a lot of extra room for playing around, beyond vibrating. It is clear the authors put a deal of work into this movie, but the end result can't make up for a really crappy, slow, painful, auto-scroller of a game.

For that goal, it surpasses all known records by a significant amount of time (over 20 seconds realtime compared to the fastest unassisted run) - so it qualifies for vault tier.
