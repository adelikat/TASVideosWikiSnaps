	"This is our first TAS. We chose this game because of its difficulty. Unlike what it seems, this game isn't easy to TAS because of bad hitboxes. We think that beating this game without killing any enemies unless absolutely necessary to complete the game is very entertaining.

	": So, I have to say, I think that the goal choice was good, given the game - and the movie was probably the most entertaining that this game will ever get. Which, granted, is not very entertaining. It is slow, autoscrolling stages, without a lot of extra room for playing around, beyond vibrating. It is clear the authors put a deal of work into this movie, but the end result can't make up for a really crappy, slow, painful, auto-scroller of a game.

	": Accepting for the vault tier. The pacifist goal does not appear to slow down the speed any, so this run can qualify for fastest time. For that goal, it surpasses all known records by a significant amount of time (over 20 seconds realtime compared to the fastest unassisted run) - so it qualifies for vault tier.
