	"An attempt to collect every Coinless-Cannonless-Capless star in Super Mario 64. At first, this run aimed for minimum possible completion time, but soon after the run began, many star times became obsoleted. It was possible to match every frame count in the latest 120 star TAS, but the run would look very similar to said TAS, so, like the first 120 star TAS, I decided to sacrifice a few frames here and there to make the run entertaining and different from previous runs. It can probably be improved by at least a minute, but hopefully that won't happen for a while.
