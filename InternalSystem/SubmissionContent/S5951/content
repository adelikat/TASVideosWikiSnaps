	"I think the levels got harder and harder as it went on; I think many of the levels were pretty easy with slowdown, savestates, and whatever other emulator tools. Death was actually a mechanic within this hack, it allows you to respawn above them. You cannot be crushed by them, you can glitch through a wall when you respawn while a wall is above it. You can only respawn if you die below or above them.
