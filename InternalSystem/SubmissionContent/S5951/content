	"I think the levels got harder and harder as it went on; I think many of the levels were pretty easy with slowdown, savestates, and whatever other emulator tools. Death was actually a mechanic within this hack, it allows you to respawn above them. You cannot be crushed by them, you can glitch through a wall when you respawn while a wall is above it. You can only respawn if you die below or above them.

	"The first stage was pretty simple, all I had to do was to kill the goomba with the blue block and kicked the blue block into the yellow block, Then I took the key and put it into the keyhole.

	"This was also pretty simple. A trick I did was I jumped through the hole when the yellow platform was extending. I popped one of the goomba's bubble and kicked the goomba into the yellow block. I grabbed the key and put it into the keyhole again.

	"I could probably improve the execution by using glitches or maybe the route (number order) could be slow. The restart could've been avoided if I hadn't overwritten my savestate on accident and I would've saved some more time.
