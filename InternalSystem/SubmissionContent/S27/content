	"Notes:
	$LF
	"About playing the GMV file, it apparently desyncronizes when player 1 is set to
	$LF
	"a 6-button controller. To properly play it, player 1 has to be set to 3-button.

[div class=p 
	"There's one or two parts I have doubts about, but I think this run came out
	$LF
	"really good. Recently I've begun to wonder if the game really would be
	$LF
	"faster with
	$LF
	"Fang. I suppose that warrants a future time attack. Right now, though, me
	$LF
	"and my
	$LF
	"brother are working on a two player time attack, so it might be a while
	$LF
	"before I try
	$LF
	"something like that.

[div class=p 
	"What's impressive in this movie? I think the inhuman usage of Browny's Yo-yo is
	$LF
	"the most impressive. Some of my favorite examples:
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-Killing the first boss so fast that he never enters his second attack mode.
	$LF
	"-"Hovering" the yo-yo on the waterfall miniboss and the final boss' second
	$LF
	"form to
	$LF
	"kill blazingly fast.
	$LF
	"-Killing the strange robot ball's (level 4) final form as soon as he flys by.
	$LF
	"-Cockily attacking the 4th level boss' final form.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"I also spent time making sure I fired only when a boss\miniboss would start
	$LF
	"taking damage and stopping as soon as they were dead (IE, bullet conservation).
	$LF
	"There may be a few parts where I didn't do this perfectly, though, such as
	$LF
	"stage
	$LF
	"5, where I fired the yo-yo and didn't hit anything. This escaped my
	$LF
	"attention during the creation process and I didn't notice until I had already
	$LF
	"finished the battle against the scientist.

[div class=p 
	"I suppose in stage 5 it also would have been more entertaining to play around
	$LF
	"with the B weapon's boomerang as opposed to killing all the monsters (which
	$LF
	"includes the ones that attempt to committ suicide by jumping down a hole).
	$LF
	"Ah well.

[div class=p 
	"An interesting thing to note is that, against the omnibot (boss of level
	$LF
	"4), in his
	$LF
	"first mode I unduck for a single frame, my head clearly thrusting into the
	$LF
	"boss,
	$LF
	"yet I don't get damaged.

	"Anyways, I hope you find this run satisfying enough to put on your site

	"sometime

	"in the future. :)
