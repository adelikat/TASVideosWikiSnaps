	"I'm totally sure this will be accepted because it has a valid goal and very optimized strategies. (As you can('t) see) I'm using tricks that aren't even in the Game Resource page of SMW (eg. not 49 hopping or 6/5ing but just pressing the direction is about 1.43 times faster). I should also mention that my input is very entertaining in the loading scenes, which is why I included it in the video. I unfortunately didn't end input as fast as possible, because then the rest of the run wouldn't sync (this game is really hating hex edits), but this shouldn't be a reason to reject this run (that wouldn't make sense at all then).

	": This was a nice run, and is the kind of thing we're looking for at TASVideos. However, TASVideos only accepts runs which complete the game, and this sadly does not. Also, Snes9x 1.4x is no longer accepted. Please however don't get discouraged, and try making a nice full run on a newer emulator, and I'm sure you can get published!
