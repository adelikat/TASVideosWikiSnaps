	"This is a 15610 frame improvement on my current publication by Pinning the opponents where it saves time and speeding up the score tallies. This run uses Mike Haggar for his great damage and Attack Range.

	"Another Note: Wrestlers can get Stunned in this game after taking consecutive hits and fly in the air on the stun hit and get up dizzied. Leaving me to have to delay hits to avoid stunning them at times
