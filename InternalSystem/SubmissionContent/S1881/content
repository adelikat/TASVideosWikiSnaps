	"Why I choose this game. Actually, I wondered why this game is not TASed already. This game was one of first which I ever saw on NES, and was somewhat popular between my friends. It was known for good animation, unusual style of music (for NES) and also for great difficulty. This game even can be completed only in Hard mode, so not much of my friends was able to do that.

	"Seems that game is well-programmed. I found only one real bug - in some places and with certain conditions it's possible to go into the wall, but in this case hero just will be killed. Other almost-bug is that in certain conditions objects collision detection does not work, so it's possible to walk thru enemy, but this happens very rarely.

	[li 
		" Hero shoots slowly while standing on floor, because shooting animation. This animation is not presented in jumps, so it's possible to shoot like machine gun by using jumps with minimal height

	[li 
		" Of course, taking coins must be avoided because it's counting slowly after level completion
