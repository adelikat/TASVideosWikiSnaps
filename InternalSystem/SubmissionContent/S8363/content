	" is a 2009 Sega Genesis / Mega Drive homebrew platformer about... well, Pringles. It has 9 levels, which are split into 3 worlds, no music and only 3 sound effects. You play as the pre-simplicity era Pringles mascot who has to bounce on Pringles to reach the goal in every level.

	"The physics of this game are quite simple. When Mr Pringles touches a Pringle, he gets more vertical height. When he touches the top of a can, the same thing happens as he bounces off of it. Touching the goal will end the level, regardless of how many Pringles you've collected.

This is important because it means we can approach the goal from below instead of above, saving ~15 frames in the process.

By landing on the right corner of the leftmost Pringle, we can fit through a narrow gap and land on top of the rightmost Pringle, which we can then use to land on top of the middle Pringle and land on the can above. This saves an estimated 2 seconds over the intended route.

Instead of turning around slowly like the RTA record, I turn around as soon as possible after landing on the leftmost Pringle in this section. This saves 6 frames over the RTA strategy.
