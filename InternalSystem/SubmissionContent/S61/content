	"This run uses the warrior, who frankly makes my life a little easier by having one major way of killing things; poking them with his sword. He also walks a little faster. He gets a fireball-shooting sword midway through, which makes for some interesting sequences.

	"Like Zelda, the fighter can turn around during his sword-poking animation, allowing me to hit enemies on both sides of me in the same swing. This also makes use of the fire sword, allowing me to shoot a fireball at an enemy I jumped over earlier.

	"Up until midway through the final boss, I take a total of eleven points of damage: two from jumping in the water early on, one from a hit you literally have to take (The bandit on level 4), and eight from passing through a set of spikes no less than four times, two hits each. Just about everything else does 20 damage to me, a cap I'm thankful for.

	"You can gain levels by killing stuff. Since levels directly affect the damage you do, I make it a point to kill just about everything in my way, but I don't stop to level.

	"The final boss. Ugh. You'll see it when you get there; he normally has two modes of attack: A fire-breath and a tail whip. Normally the fire breath takes up about a third of the screen in front of him, which is fine because he's half a screen back and there's a "safe" spot under his head, which is right where the tail whip hits. Midway through, he starts leaping forward, giving you maybe a quarter of the screen to work with, until you do enough damage to force him back. I die because he does all three attacks at once, which literally cannot be avoided, and since I'm such a low level when I get to him, I can't do damage quickly enough to force him back in time. Thankfully, death is like a free heal, so I just get revived and start hacking away again.

	"The second worst part of the vid is likely the start of level 3, right before the worm. I do like most of the rest of the vid, so I'm submitting it.
