	"This was a top favorite of mine, during my teenage years. As with many of my games, this was also a very difficult game to play. I may have gotten to about the 8th room. Nevertheless, I played it heavily due to it having a mix of action and puzzle solving.
	$LF
	"In July 2019, I had a temporary layoff and was looking at some C64 games that I used to play and remember Big Mac. Even though I started TASing this game back then, I wasn't enthusiastic enough to keep it going. So...I pecked at it over a long time and finally decided to get serious as of late. Having seen youtube videos, over the past 3 years, I finally got more and more ideas on how to cut time....which now you are seeing the culmination of all my effort.

	$LF
	"During one of my many "run-throughs", I finally saw how re-enabling a floor switch (the purple one) actually helped improvement routing on screen 16 to get to the yellow switch. This was a situation where I had to break my idea of thinking on the permanent disabling of all switches. Seeing this problem means that other spots could exist; however, I'm not able to find them anymore....maybe because they don't exist??
