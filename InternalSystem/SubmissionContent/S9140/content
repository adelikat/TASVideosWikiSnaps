		"Tactics Ogre - The Knight of Lodis

	" is a tactical role-playing game and part of the 
	[em 
		"Ogre Battle
	]em
	" series. The story revolves around soldier 
	[em 
		"Alphonse Loeher
	]em
	", who discovers that his military is not only brutally oppressive, but also seeks the power of a sacred demonic spear. This TAS abuses a glitch that creates overpowered characters and clones of those characters in an effort to complete the game as fast as possible.

	"The overpowered character and clone glitches both rely on bugs with the game's team-sorting procedure. To execute these glitches, one of your units must die in battle and the unit that follows that sacrificial unit in the team list must also be present in the battle. For example, if you have 6 total units, kill #5 in battle and make sure #6 is deployed too. After the battle, sort the team. If you have any unit other than #6 highlighted, then #6 will be cloned and you will also now have 255 extra copies of their inventory items. If you have #6 highlighted, a glitch character will be created. Depending on your party composition and which characters are locked, executing either of these glitches will also delete other members of your party. To keep the glitch character, you need to swap them with another party member (who will be lost).
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"That's the basics. I don't fully understand why it's happening, but looking at the party data in memory shows that, for cloning, the sort action copies unit data into the empty (killed) character space, rather than cutting & pasting it. As for the glitched character, I suspect that's an under/overflow and/or a pointer error. Team data starts in memory at 0x02000030, with each unit taking up 104 bytes. The glitched character data is being drawn from much further away, around 0x02006648.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"There are also a number of complications that arise when executing these glitches, especially the glitched characters. The first complication is that other party members are going to be deleted. You can get some control over which ones bite the dust by locking characters in the team list, but I've only managed to get that to work some of the time. The deletions often result in game crashes if they hit unique party members. The second complication is that it can be difficult to keep a glitched character. Depending on your party composition prior to executing the glitch, you may be unable to manually sort/swap them with another party member. It also seems that until now, people thought you could only keep a glitched character by swapping it with a unique one -- but I found out that's not the case (it's just somewhat trickier to swap them with a regular character). The third complication is that glitched characters crash the game at various points. If you change their class prior to battle 6? Crash. If one particular glitched character is not an archer at Haena? Crash. In fact, if you bring ANY glitched character - barring one - to Haena? The boss dies and doesn't trigger the end of the battle... so, crash.

	"It's because of these complications that ultimately, I've landed on a version that unlocks the secret shop (which sells Orbs) as quickly as possible. In previous versions I instead had a team of glitched Ninjas that would one/two-shot most bosses. But this "Orb" version ended up being several minutes faster (for now, anyway).

Moreover, if one of the first glitched characters (but not the odd one out) is any class other than Archer, the game crashes.
