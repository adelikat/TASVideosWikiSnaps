	"I had a ton of fun creating this TAS. It's my first attempt at making anything. AFAIK this is the only successful attempt at TAS for Genuine Arcade Version. If this TAS were to be adjusted to run at same speed as the Xbox/Steam variants of Double Dragon - this TAS blows the Speed Run Records out of the water (With all the lag and original arcade speed, this TAS finishes in about 8:03 (timed from the point Billy is controllable in Stage 1, to when the boss dies on Stage 4... compared this to sped up lag-less World Record with Steam Version, 8:13).
