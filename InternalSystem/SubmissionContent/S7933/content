The simplest way to explain it is if you jump on the right frame, you can transfer horizontal speed into your vertical speed to get a super high jump.  It seems to only work in certain spots but unsure as to why it does this.

There's a few skips I could have done to avoid having to get rid of the police guards, but it's incredibly difficult to do and I wasn't willing to spend all my time doing it, so I just did the RTA route.  Once we see Skipper go through the brick wall through the pipe, we avoid talking to the monkeys by doing another Proxy jump by hitting the pipe at a weird angle.  We then just kick trash cans at the people and the janitor cart.

You'll notice after this point there's no traffic, which gets disabled when the police section is skipped, this is carried over to the Gloria section as well, which explains why the level looks so empty.  This also means the two overhead areas have zero cars to avoid where we can just walk forward.  (Also we have to collect the powercards for Gloria here otherwise the game won't let us continue).

]div
[div class=p 
	"It's worth mentioning that there's an insane glitch you can do if you exit the stage after getting powercards, this is known as hippo hop which involves going out of bounds and spawning inside a cop car that for some reason gives you a ton of speed.  Unfortunately it requires having a memory card and I didn't TAS this game with one in, and due to the loading times it likely only really saves time on the PC version.

	"Melman's stage starts out with a simmilar glitch but not as fast, if we grab a ledge as the bus approaches us, jumping here causes us to get a ton of speed and lets us get to the end of this section.

We then open the crate of bowling balls and throw one through boxes to hit a guy on the other side.  normally you're supposed to put the ball into the pipe so it hits him that way, but that cut scene is long so doing this skips it.

[div class=p 
	"Quick side note, there's a 50/50 chance if you play this game on the PC version where the bowling balls can be movable without picking them up.  The community refers to it as "Gassy Balls" due to the fact that they're not solid balls, and because calling it Gassy Balls is really funny.  (Update: as it turns out this bug happens if the game is not running in Windows 98 compatibility mode)
