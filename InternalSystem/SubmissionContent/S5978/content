	"I've been watching Legend of Zelda Speedruns for years now, but the one that really peaked my interests was the All Medallions Speedrun by Nacrissa Wright back in 2013. Since then, numerous improvements have been made to the run. As a TASer, I've always done projects on a smaller scale, like getting the Master Sword as fast as possible for example, but I wanted to get out of my comfort zone a little bit and try to make something much bigger, and thus, the All Medallions TAS was born.

	"There is only really one thing that can really improve this TAS, and that is the version that this was played on. This TAS was made on version 1.0, but there is a glitch called Bomb OI, which is exclusive to versions 1.1 and 1.2. How it works is you pull out a bomb, wait for it to explode, allow Link to take damage from the explosion, and walk forward as Link takes damage so he is still holding up his hands, and then pressing the bottle button a few frames afterward, causing the Ocarina animation to play. Using this glitch could have saved about 10 seconds for each time I had to do OI. I had not realized that until I was halfway done with the TAS, but fortunately, there were somethings done with RBA in this TAS that helped compensate for the little time loss, so I saw it fit to leave it as it was.

	"This movie aims to collect all the medallions, and then finish the game. Medallions are typically rewarded for beating the dungeons in the adult half of the game, whereas stones are the reward for the dungeons of the child portion. This run does not elect to collect the stones, which can be considered as equally important as the medallions in terms of game progression. No real reasoning is given for this decision, just the fact that RTA players have run the category. Additionally the method this TAS uses to "collect" most medallions is a glitch called Reverse Bottle Adventure (RBA). For those that don't speak OOT, it more or less allows you to write items to your inventory with setups involving a bottle. The reward for collecting medallions only actually requires two of them, the rest are collected for the sake of completing the goal. This run does not actually use the reward from collecting the medallions, nor does it even show the medallions are indeed in inventory at all (I manually checked that they are in inventory). It instead sets up a wrong warp to the credits when it is done collecting them.

	"The combination of all this makes the movie feel incredibly arbitrary and the audience response reflected this. Not collecting the stones makes it seem like the TAS is choosing to complete a seemingly random portion of the game, but the bigger concern comes with the usage of the RBA glitch (inventory manipulation). The RBA glitch changes the method of gathering medallions from completing dungeons to what would appear to be effectively doing random tasks on the overworld. There is obviously meaning to these tasks, but the process makes the movie very hard to follow, greatly hindering the entertainment value. Additionally, the usage of wrong warp completely bypassing the usage of medallions altogether makes them feel like random trinkets rather than a valuable item. The items obtained through RBA might as well be quiver upgrades or basically any other item in the game when it comes to the content of this movie.  Using all known glitches to collect the medallions, a specific subset of items, is not a particularly sound branch for TASVideos. Major skip glitches are to be used efficiently, not to skip arbitrary portions of the game. Additionally if the medallions are to be collected through this method, they should be used.

	"This TAS also suffers from significant content overlap. The defining feature of this TAS, the RBA glitch is not unique to this category. RBA was previously demonstrated in older any% TASes and the route for this category somewhat resembles them. It is also demonstrated in the All Dungeons, No Doors TAS with much more interesting and diverse applications. A large number of other segments also feature overlap. The entire start is pretty much identical to the start of every other OOT TAS, going from Kokiri Forest to Kakariko Village to obtain a bottle. Then it goes to castle town and does the door of time skip that is also present in 
	(__wikiLink|href=/3463M|implicitdisplaytext=3463M)
	" and 
	(__wikiLink|href=/3537M|implicitdisplaytext=3537M)
	". Once the RBA stuff is done, then the movie completes the Fire Temple in a manner similar to that of the MST TAS, with the relatively minor exception of having to kill the miniboss with hookshot. After that, it completes Dodongo's Cavern and performs the wrong warp to credits. The trip through Dodongo's Cavern itself is fairly similar to other OOT TASes. This means about 98% of the movie with overlap in content. Only the "Ganonless" Wrong Warp that allows one to warp directly to the ending instead of fighting ganon as the biggest thing setting it apart. Given that this is only done at the very end of the TAS, we pretty much have only 2% unique content, which is not enough for acceptance. Obviously there are some other differences throughout the TAS due to route, but they feel minor at best to someone not heavily invested in OOT speedrunning. At TASVideos we need branches to feature unique content in order to be accepted.

	"Due to all the pitfalls introduced by the goal of this movie, I must reject it. While this TAS's goal was deemed too arbitrary, that is not to say that all TASes with new goals will be rejected, but considered on a case by case basis. We have 3 OOT branches at the moment, so any new branches need to stand out from those 3. I encourage you to keep TASing however, and if you find a movie of yours that is more suitable to TASVideos to please submit it.
