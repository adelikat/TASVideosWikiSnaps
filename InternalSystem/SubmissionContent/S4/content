	"It?s Flintstones again, actually I wasn?t that satisfied with my first 
	$LF
	"version so it was a good thing to redo it again. And also, Orccu at the 
	$LF
	"forum discovered a nice glitch at the last stage (The future) that saved me 
	$LF
	"minutes! So this is a much better version, I fixed some minor mistakes, 
	$LF
	"killed some bosses faster and so on. For some reason I had to wait for 
	$LF
	"Dracula to get on the right side before I could kill him. Odd but it doesn?t 
	$LF
	"affect the time really. So here it is, 2 minutes faster ;) Enjoy it when you 
	$LF
	"have time for it. Hope it?s going well with the new site also! I wish you
