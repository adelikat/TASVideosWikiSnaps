	": Improvements kept getting suggested in the submission thread, but the author is not responding (I also tried contacting them on youtube a week ago). Other judges liked the idea of canceling this movie until the author returns, but improvement suggestions piled up and they feel significant. If it was just one suggestion that saved a few frames, I would have probably already accepted this, tho ideally we'd have the author review it still. But in the current state I feel it makes sense to reject this submission and hope for a new submission that incorporates those improvements.
