[div class=p 
	"Below are shared or universal abilities of all characters:
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-Normal Attack
	$LF
	"A simple hit that upon connection makes an instant combo if tapped. You can
	$LF
	"also target your attack upwards or downwards by pressing in the desired 
	$LF
	"direction. Attack upwards will juggle or knock air-bourne foes down. Attack
	$LF
	"downwards will usually sweep an opponent of their feet or hit a grounded 
	$LF
	"opponent. 
	$LF
	"Note that any special move will link after a Normal Attack combo, but that 
	$LF
	"doesn't mean EVERY last interrupt will create an inescapable combo.
	$LF
	"If you press down+normal while in air, you will cause yourself to slam 
	$LF
	"downwards and flatten foes. They will also be dizzed by this if you land
	$LF
	"directy on top of them.
	$LF
	"Certain characters will either perform a diagonal air-dive by pressing normal
	$LF
	"attack while air-bourne or an air-dash attack. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-Special Attack
	$LF
	"Varies from character to character, but in many instances the same result.
	$LF
	"By itself it usually performs a projectile. Combined by pressing up will
	$LF
	"usually result in an anti-air/uppercut attack. Lastly, combined by pressing
	$LF
	"down will usually perform the Digimon's most unique ability.
	$LF
	"Some special attacks can be charged or delayed by holding this button down.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-Jump
	$LF
	"Makes you jump quite obviously, but every single character can perform a
	$LF
	"double jump by pressing this twice, even tin cans and pinatas. One character
	$LF
	"can even triple jump and another can high jump.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-Gaurd
	$LF
	"You can gaurd while on the ground when either standing or crouching. This is
	$LF
	"interchangeable while holding the gaurd button down. You CANNOT air gaurd.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-Evo
	$LF
	"If your evolution meter is full and you are a first or second stage Digimon,
	$LF
	"you will evolve to your next stage. While evolving, you are invincible, 
	$LF
	"including about three seconds after you finish evolving. Additionally, while 
	$LF
	"evolving, your blue aura acts as a shield that will nullify projectiles and 
	$LF
	"beams. 
	$LF
	"If your Digimon is at its final stage, this button will activate its Ultra 
	$LF
	"attack, which generally is the most powerful attack available to them. Also, 
	$LF
	"during an Ultra attack, you are invulnerable.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-Healing
	$LF
	"If you have any evo energy in your meter, you can heal yourself gradually by
	$LF
	"holding down gaurd+normal attack. This will quickly drain your guage, but the
	$LF
	"small amount of vitality you gain could very well be worth it.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-Charge Blast
	$LF
	"If you press gaurd+special attack when your Digimon is in its final stage, it
	$LF
	"will perform a powerful attack. If you hold the two buttons down, you will 
	$LF
	"charge the attack, making it more powerful or/and adding more shots or/and
	$LF
	"longer range. This attack always has a bit of start-up delay, so don't abuse 
	$LF
	"it too often.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-Walk/Creep
	$LF
	"You can augment your movement speed by slightly leaning your joystick left or
	$LF
	"right. This, of course, is only possible through an analog control method (i.e.
	$LF
	"the GameCube's joystick) and not the cross pad.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-Grab
	$LF
	"Pressing the grab button will cause your Digimon to reach forward. If an 
	$LF
	"opponent should be within reach, you will pick them up and be able to carry 
	$LF
	"them. It is at this point that you can then throw them. It is espcially a good
	$LF
	"idea to toss them off into a pit or into a wall.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-Rapid Recover
	$LF
	"Rapidly mash directions to speed up your recovery rate getting up from the 
	$LF
	"ground, air-recovery, dizziness or to escape a throw. You can also use this to
	$LF
	"escape from combos, if you're quick enough.
