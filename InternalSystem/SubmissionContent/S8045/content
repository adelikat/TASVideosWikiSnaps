	"There were a lot of small bits where the RTA record saved time over this TAS using lag reduction techniques or tighter movement to reach sections a bit quicker. It happens enough that another pass would be needed to incorporate all these small time saves. There's also some faster bosses in the RTA run but those would require RNG manipulation that's different from the NES DuckTales 2 as they don't work the same way. I can't count that against you since there's not much that I could find for luck manipulation for the GB version.

	"I did a test run of the Mu stage up to the boss and saved 131 frames through small things such as lag reduction by killing enemies and grabbing a rope to get a horizontal boost forward. I stopped before the boss as I couldn't get any RNG manipulation from my brief testing in the fight. I have provided my file for you to check out here if you want to take a look at it yourself:
