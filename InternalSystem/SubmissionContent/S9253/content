	"Illusion of Gaia is the second Action RPG in the Quintet trilogy (Soul Blazer / Illusion of Gaia / Terranigma), which is loosely connected around the "restoration of the world" theme. The hero, Will, follows events which will carry him and his friends around the world, through some ancient civilizations' landmarks (Angkor Wat or the Pyramid) and some mythological ones as well (Mu or the Tower of Babel). Eventually, Will will have to vanquish the evil comet which is altering the normal course of humanity and evolution. The game is known as Gaia Gensouki in Japan and Illusion of Time in Europe.

	"After I finished my Soul Blader TAS a few years ago, this was the next logical project to undertake. I started it in 2019 and finished in August 2024, working on it on and off with a couple big stops. All in all, about a year's worth of effort was put into this TAS. Additionally, there has not been any full-game TAS of IoG since Halamantariel's TAS from 17 years ago, so this game really needed a good update. A lot has been discovered since then!

	"Illusion of Gaia is a fairly linear game, with no money/shops, and no experience system. Instead, you are supposed to receive an upgrade of either Strength, Defence or Total HP when defeating all enemies in a single room. This TAS will collect no such upgrade because the corresponding cutscene is too time-consuming; but especially, the upgrades aren't really worth it anyway because, when you defeat a boss, you will be caught up on all the upgrades missed from the dungeons. That is why all the hero's strats are significantly boosted after every boss fight. However, the game doesn't catch you up on the few stat upgrades hidden in towns, which the TAS also disregards anyway.

	"The game offers two control types to the player at the start of the game. RTA speedrunners typically prefer Type 2 because the A button can still be used to skip through text (without triggering any other action), and attacking with B instead of A is more in line with other games of the genre. However, Type 2 offers no benefit for the TAS, so I keep the default Type 1: attack with A and use items with B. Regardless of which control type is picked, either shoulder button (L or R) can be used to guard: this technique can block some enemy projectiles, and attract some objects like statues. The Select button brings the player to the inventory. Interestingly, it is possible to move items around, which is useful in the TAS! Indeed, you want quest items to be in the top-left spot most of the time to save cursor movements, so moving items out of the way can achieve that and save some frames.

When you hit an enemy, the damage dealt will be the hero's attack power minus the enemy's defence (the result of this will be brought back to zero if it is negative) +1 for Will, +2 for Freedan and +3 for Shadow. Will also has a jump attack ability available from the start of the game, which adds one to the attack power. It is performed by pressing the direction Will is facing during an attack. The jump attack also makes Will invulnerable for the whole duration of the jump, which can be useful in some places (especially the fight against the Vampires).

Will and Freedan can attack every 17 frames, and Shadow can attack every 16 frames. Most enemies and all bosses have 16 frames of invulnerability after being hit, so you can only damage them once every 17 frames. For some enemies, it's once every 18 frames for some reason (like the bush enemies in Ankor Wat). You can pass through an enemy during their I-frames, which is abused quite a lot in the run.

Depending on the situation, the TASer's ability to manipulate RNG might be quite limited without sacrificing time (especially in Tower of Babel, because nothing apart from the bosses themselves can help you change RNG). This is fine for the major part of the run though because it is often possible to play optimally (or almost optimally) regardless of enemies' behaviours.

When the game gets busy, lag can sometimes be mitigated by avoiding diagonal movement, or refraining from attacking or guard-dashing. That's why I will prefer moving in straight lines in some areas, instead of doing fancier movements. Besides, I also have to be careful about menuing. Indeed, the number of lag frames occurring when coming back from an inventory access can vary depending on the area, so when I need to menu, I try to do so in a place which will result in the least possible amount of lag frames. In this game, some loading times can vary by one or two frames.

Bear in mind that, on the 3rd frame after starting the attack (or 5th frame with Shadow), if you input a direction which is different from the one your character is facing, the attack will be cancelled.

And fortunately, Earthquaker is never required in the rest of the game, so you can completely skip it.

Turning into Freedan in the third section is faster than doing it in the fourth section; this was discovered years ago by Crawek. At the end of the fourth section, after a lot of trial and error in the previous room, I eventually found an RNG seed which makes the blue robot shoot to the left upon getting the Crystal Orb, so I can die earlier.

But in the end, I'm quite happy without how it turned out.
	$LF
	"In the first room, you need to get close enough to the golem to get it to start moving. During that time, I take one damage from a blue jelly. For the next golem you need to kill, I tested quite a few strategies, and going around while hitting him proved to be the most efficient one. The damage strat I found in the second room is quite cool and happened unexpectedly! In the third room, you need to be in the correct subpixel for the spike damage to send you upwards instead of back to the left: this is faster than jump attacking over the spikes. To pass across the bouncy bubble, I attract it with Will's telekinetic power, and while it is moving up, I get very close to it and start doing a jump attack upwards. When the bubble reaches me, it is sent upwards because that's the direction I'm facing, and it doesn't bounce me away. After that, the path to the left is about half a second faster than the other path; this is also true on the way back. For the ramp trick with the golem on top, I also tested a lot of ideas, but the best one turned out to be quite simple: hit the blue jelly during the bounce from the bubble, then jump attack downwards through the golem. At the end of the room with the switch controlling the spikes, there is a wizzrobe changing RNG, so I wait there for about 10 frames to manipulate good patterns from the firebars two rooms after. Getting cleanly to 1HP just before the deathwarp is probably one of the neatest achievements of this TAS! After getting the Psycho Slider, I cannot Freet-dash through enemies anymore so I do the "walk while attacking" technique described above.

This seed has most things I could ask for: both Vampires joining up frequently, and staying mostly at the top part of the arena. This is important because, when they make their huge energy ball (this cannot be avoided), you want to lure the ball outside of the screen as quickly as possible to avoid a dramatic amount of lag. I managed to finish the fight with an 124 on the bomb timer, which exceeded my expectations. Fun fact: I kill off both vampires with the same attack, and they both die in two consecutive frames!

At the beginning of the third screen, you can quickly enter the door during the jump with sub-pixel-perfect positioning. In the room where you need to maneuver around a lot of statues, when you move a statue, the tile it occupied still remains solid for 16 frames, so you have to account for that. Fortunately, manipulating a perfect 5/5 egg fight on Fanger wasn't too difficult, because you only need to manipulate the first egg pattern.

So I try to use them a lot to damage myself, which influenced some strat choices. For example, using a Spin Dash through the four golden skulls in the room with the second Mushroom Drops would have been faster, but I preferred to take two hits from flute fairies instead. In the room with the third Mushroom Drops, I still needed to take one hit from spiders, which was a bit inconvenient because that part was quite laggy.

When the statue dies, the crawlspace becomes available immediately without having to do an Orb-cancel glitch, for some reason (this is the only instance of this oddity). Then I take a hit from the pink head at the same frame I jump down the ledge. The garden was quite a pain to optimize because of unpredictable enemies and soft corners everywhere... I managed to get decent patterns though. In the next room, I take damage from the golem while charging the Dark Friars during the Earhquaker skip, leaving me with 1HP. I later kill myself with a beetle statue projectile (those only deal 1HP worth of damage) after triggering the next checkpoint: the point of this is to get Will back because I need to slide through a crawlspace later. The game expects you to go to a different Dark Space later to transform back into Will, but deathwarping accomplishes that much faster. The garden on the way back is quite difficult as well because of those pesky bush enemies: they can only be moved when you hit them the second time, but if they receive damage from a bounced enemy, it will not count... so I had to be smart about this: this is where I discovered the "attack into dash" technique which was quite useful.

In the cutscene with the Jackal, after playing Lola's Melody, I carefully move such that I will be as close as possible to the hieroglyph wall without making Kara waste frames when she walks towards me. Yup, that also matters. You can interact with the hieroglyph wall without facing it, so I place all hieroglyph tiles while moving towards the exit.

I waited before attacking Castoth's hands to manipulate a better pattern from Viper. Vampires were pretty fast, but unfortunately I couldn't get egg patterns from Fanger. However, that turned out not to be so bad! Indeed, with a lot of patience, I managed to get the boss killed in two horizontal patterns, hitting him 9 times in the first phase! It is still a bit slower than getting two egg patterns, but so much cooler. Also, getting 7 and 7 hits instead of 9 and 5 was three frames faster, but I decided to keep the 9 and 5 fight because it looks nicer. This is another speed-entertainment tradeoff. When Will gets transported by the friendly Viper, you want to talk to her from the left side by being as low as possible to minimize her slow downward movement when she drops you. Mummy Queen started with the brick summoning pattern which isn't perfect, but at least I got the clean 6/6 rings without needing to waste any time. When talking to the friendly vampire, the optimal position is the one which requires no movement from him to pick you up. In the last cutscene before the Comet, I talk to the last soul from the top to minimize the travel time of the other souls towards Will. This actually matters quite a lot.

You want to hit the Comet as soon as possible everytime, because the next opening is always exactly 529 frames after the previous hit. I unfortunately had to delay the last hit by 93 frames so that Dark Gaia would open her mouth about 200 frames earlier, so it was worth it. The first mouth opening from Dark Gaia isn't the fastest it could have been, but again, I was quite limited in my options to manipulate RNG. The next two mouth openings are the fastest possible (1378 frames apart).
