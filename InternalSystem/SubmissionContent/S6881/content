[div class=p 
	"NYMX was working on the C64 port of the game on his own.  This prompted DrD2k9 to investigate the Coleco version.  Once each of us completed our own TAS, we swapped files and reviewed each other's work.  We each made improvements to the other person's TAS then swapped back again.  During all the back and forth, we decided to investigate the published A2600 run.  Using knowledge gained from doing the other two ports (and a bit more file swapping), we effectively did a complete reTAS of the A2600 port by testing alternative inputs room-by-room.  This resulted in improvements on every level through the run. As we each worked on and made improvements to all three ports, we are both authors on all three submissions.

Others come from dropping bombs further from the rock walls; the current publication gets closer than necessary in a number of cases before dropping a bomb which then results in a later passage through the hole blown open.  The rest of the improvements come from movement optimization.

Due to emulation differences between the versions of BizHawk on which the old and new TASes were made; instead of staring the comparison from power-on, this video cuts the first few frames of the old TAS to allow the first frame of character control to be synced between the runs.  This allows for a more accurate representation of improvement from game-play differences.
