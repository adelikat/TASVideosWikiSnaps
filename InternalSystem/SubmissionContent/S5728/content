	[em 
		"Jail Break
	]em
	" is an arcade game produced and released by Konami in 1986.  The game's story is loosely based on the 1981 film 
	[em 
		"Escape from New York
	]em
	", wherein Manhattan has become an island prison from which the hero must rescue the President of the United States, who is being held hostage.  In 
	[em 
		"Jail Break
	]em
	", the game's hero, Aki, must fight through 5 stages to rescue the warden of a prison following a mass escape.  The settings for the various stages are all real locations in and around Manhattan, and the game follows a logical geographic progression.  Even the game's original title, マンハッタン24分署: N.Y.151・西・第100ストリート (Manhattan 24 Bunsho: N.Y. 151 Nishi Dai 100 Sutorīto) refers, with curious specificity, to the New York City Police Department 24th Precinct, down to the address at 151 West 100th Street!  Of technical interest, 
	[em 
		"Jail Break
	]em
	" was built on modified 
	[em 
		"Green Beret
	]em
	" (
	[em 
		"Rush'n Attack
	]em
	") hardware.  Certain sound effects may be familiar to those who played contemporary Konami arcade games--even the NES games of the era used this shared sample library.  The game also features digitized speech, using the same hardware as previous games such as 
	[em 
		"Track & Field
	]em

	" Tricks and Glitches
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The Bum's Rush:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Ordinarily, Aki travels at a rate of 1 pixel per Frame.  Using this technique, Aki can travel at a rate 37 times greater: 111 pixels per each 3 Frames, or 37 pixels per Frame.  Hold Down, Right, and Left on the joystick simultaneously to cause Aki to rush forward.  The Bum's Rush prevents enemies from spawning.  It also causes Aki's Y location to fluctuate and causes his sprite to appear glitched.  Holding Up, Down, and Right or Up, Down, and Left on the joystick simultaneously produces mostly the same effect, but reduces Aki's speed somewhat to 64 pixels per each 2 Frames, or 32 pixels per Frame.  This is useful in a situation where using either technique as the last movement increment will reach the destination, because the "slower" technique requires only 2 Frames of travel as opposed to 3 Frames of travel with the "faster" technique.  As a point of reference, even if Aki could advance to the end of the Stage without interruption at his normal rate (which he can not), it would require 12,820 additional Frames...more than 2 times as long as the entire TAS.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Teleport:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"While screen scrolling is unlocked, pressing Down, Right, and Left on the joystick simultaneously causes the screen to scroll rapidly.  However, when the end of a Stage is reached and screen scrolling is locked, using this same input allows Aki to instantaneously move to an arbitrary location on the screen, including a location which is beyond the screen boundary.  There are various locations to which Aki may teleport.  Pressing Up, Down, and Right or Up, Down, and Left on the joystick simultaneously produces a similar effect, but allows fewer destination possibilities.  Holding Teleport input allows Aki to change his location every Frame that the input is held.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Carry On:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Pressing Down, Right, and Left on the joystick simultaneously while any of the first 2 character memory blocks are occupied causes any of the characters occupying those memory blocks to be "carried" with Aki to his destination, where they are then juxtaposed near him.  This technique applies to Citizens as well as Prisoners.  This is useful for forcing Housewife to despawn early on Stage 2 through Stage 4.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Prevent Enemy Spawn:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If all 7 character memory blocks are occupied when an enemy is scheduled to spawn, the enemy will fail to spawn.  In such a case, the game considers the enemy to have spawned and been destroyed.  Destroying the final "scheduled" enemy of a Stage on the earliest possible Frame requires 30 Frames for the enemy to despawn after being destroyed.  As such, it is faster to allow the 7 "occupying" enemies to remain destroyed but not yet despawned just long enough to prevent the final scheduled enemy from spawning.  This is useful on Stage 1, where the last character scheduled to spawn is a Machinegan.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Angle On Demand:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Normally, when Aki changes angle he is facing by less than 90° and then fires a Weapon, the projectile will be fired at an intermediate angle between the original facing angle and the current facing angle.  This effect persists for 8 Frames, after which a fired projectile's angle will match the current facing angle.  This game mechanic allows firing at 16 possible angles with an 8-direction joystick.  This 8-Frame delay can be prevented by simply changing the angle that Aki is facing by 90° or more before then turning to face the desired angle and firing.  This technique allows for more precise firing in a shorter amount of time.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Kill The Warden:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Normally, if Aki hits the Warden with a projectile, the dynamite strapped to his chair is detonated, the message "MISS SHOT !!" is displayed, and the game is over, regardless of how many lives remain.  However, the detonator has a delay, the Warden can be destroyed, and if Aki can destroy the Warden before the detonator delay expires, the explosion is prevented, and there is no penalty!

	"The hero's name is Aki.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When an enemy is hit, Aki becomes impervious to collision damage from enemies.  This status persists until the enemy despawns.  Note that Aki can still be hit by a projectile during this status.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"A weapon can be fired at any of 15 different angles for pinpoint accuracy.  To fire at a secondary-intermediate angle, first press the joystick in one of the 2 directions nearest to the desired angle for 1 Frame, and then press the joystick in the other nearest direction for 1 Frame.  For the next 8 Frames, the Weapon will fire at the desired secondary-intermediate angle.  For example, to fire at a 23° angle, press Right on the joystick for 1 Frame, press Up and Right on the joystick for 1 Frame, and then press the Shoot button.  It does not matter in which order the directions are pressed on the joystick.  Strangely, it is not possible to fire at a 202° angle, though it is possible to fire at all other secondary-intermediate angles.

	"The playfield extends horizontally from X 32 to X 208.  Horizontal center is X 120.  Note that until the end of a Stage is reached, Aki can not move beyond X 128, as this is the point at which the screen begins to scroll.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The playfield extends vertically from Y 89 to Y 208.  Vertical center is Y 148.  Using Teleport can allow Aki to move beyond these limitations.  If Aki walks up beyond Y 89 (where the background meets the playfield), he will not be able to walk back down to the playfield using normal input.  However, he can return to the playfield by continuing to walk up beyond Y 0, which causes him to wraparound to the bottom of the screen, where he is then ejected back up to Y 208 within the playfield.  Of course, using Teleport again can also allow Aki to escape from the background as desired.

	"Hand Pistol does 1 Hit Point of damage.  Hand Pistol allows a maximum of 7 projectiles to simultaneously occupy the screen.  A Hand Pistol projectile moves faster than the other Weapon types.  Aki must be at Y 68 or lower on the screen in order for a Hand Pistol projectile to avoid being destroyed by the background.  At Y 68, Hand Pistol must be fired directly down.  Starting at Y 70, Hand Pistol may be fired downward at a 45° angle.  At Y 71 and lower, Hand Pistol may be fired at any angle.  Aki must be at Y 13 or higher on the screen in order for a Hand Pistol projectile to wraparound to the bottom of the screen.  Aki must be at Y 8 or higher on the screen in order for a Hand Pistol projectile fired at any angle to wraparound to the bottom of the screen.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Bazooka does 1 Hit Point of damage per each Frame that it is in contact with a target.  Bazooka allows a maximum of 1 projectile to occupy the screen.  If there are 3 Tear Gas projectiles on the screen, Bazooka can not be fired.  A Bazooka projectile moves slower than a Hand Pistol projectile, but faster than a Tear Gas projectile.  Aki must be at Y 69 or lower on the screen in order for a Bazooka projectile to avoid being destroyed by the background.  At Y 69, Bazooka must be fired directly down.  Starting at Y 70, Bazooka may be fired downward at a 45° angle.  At Y 71 and lower, Bazooka may be fired at any angle.  Aki must be at Y 12 or higher on the screen in order for a Bazooka projectile to wraparound to the bottom of the screen.  Aki must be at Y 10 or higher on the screen in order for a Bazooka projectile fired at any angle to wraparound to the bottom of the screen.  A Bazooka projectile will penetrate any Enemy or Citizen.

[p 
	"Tear Gas does 1 Hit Point of damage per each Frame that it is in contact with a target.  Tear Gas allows a maximum of 3 projectiles to simultaneously occupy the screen.  If there is a Bazooka projectile on the screen, only 2 Tear Gas projectiles can be fired.  A Tear Gas projectile moves slower than the other Weapon types.  Aki must be at Y 40 or lower on the screen in order for a Tear Gas projectile to avoid being destroyed by the background.  At Y 40, Tear Gas must be fired directly down.  Starting at Y 44, Tear Gas may be fired downward at a 45° angle.  At Y 45 and lower, Tear Gas may be fired at any angle.  Aki must be at Y 12 or higher on the screen in order for a Tear Gas projectile to wraparound to the bottom of the screen.  Aki must be at Y 6 or higher on the screen in order for a Tear Gas projectile fired at any angle to wraparound to the bottom of the screen.  A Tear Gas projectile has homing capability against an enemy in a window.  When a Tear Gas projectile collides with an obstacle, enemy, or Citizen, it explodes.  The explosion from Tear Gas remains damaging for 16 Frames until it has despawned.  If an additional target collides with a Tear Gas explosion before the explosion's timer has expired, the explosion's timer is reset to 16.  If a target remains in contact with a Tear Gas explosion, the explosion's timer remains at 16 until the target is destroyed.  It is the ultimate power in the universe.

Molotov Cocktail enters attack posture 32 Frames after spawning.  Attack posture requires 16 Frames.  Molotov Cocktail enters attack posture 32 Frames after attack posture ends.  If there are no mitigating factors, Molotov Cocktail enters attack posture every 54 Frames until he is either destroyed or despawned.  Note that if there are (or are scheduled to be) 8 enemy projectiles on the screen, Molotov Cocktail will not attack as scheduled.  He may attack after a delay of 2-4 Frames, or he may not attack again at all until one of the enemy projectiles on the screen has despawned.

When the Warden is hit for the 1st time, the bomb is armed, and the delay timer begins to increment at a rate of 1 per Frame.  Additionally, Aki becomes invincible.  When the Warden is hit again, his damage counter is incremented.  Each hit increments this damage counter by 1, to a maximum of 30.  When the Warden's damage counter is at 30, the next hit will disarm the bomb and destroy the Warden.  It is difficult to tell whether this game mechanic is a glitch or an Easter egg.  Considering Konami's penchant for such things (even within this game), as well as the relative ease of exploiting it, it is plausible that it could be the latter.
