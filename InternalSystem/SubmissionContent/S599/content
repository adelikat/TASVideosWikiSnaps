	": I'm putting this submission out of it's misery. I don't even think the author seriously meant for this one to be published, but reasons for rejecting just for the record: the game is godawful OMG unthinkably worthless, the votes and feedback have been absolutely terrible, and you moved three steps down to options instead of one step up.
