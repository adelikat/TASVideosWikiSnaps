	"First of all I want to thank Blublu! He was kind enough to show me some simple but yet very useful things that I had totally missed in my previous run. You can skip 2 of the 4 boring dialogues simply by going over Wilma and that other lady. This saved a bunch of seconds.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Another useful tip was that I can skip winning at the basket ball game and still be able to proceed. This time I still win but at the very last second of the game so it doesn't affect anything and thus I saved about 4 seconds. Thanks Blublu for that, I totally missed that too.

	"I'll simply list where the major time saving parts come from.

		" First, the dialogues as mentioned above. That simple trick saved loads of seconds.

		" Second, compared to my previous run I now have optimized pretty much everything. When hitting an enemy Fred will stop for a few frames, this can be avoided by jumping and thus I jump whenever it's possible to avoid delays. This is however not possible everywhere and therefore I have to slow down for a brief moment at some places, for example in the ocean, killing those green grass creatures.
		$LF

[ul 
	[li 
		" Third, every boss fight is improved. This is because in my previous run I underestimated Fred's ordinary weapon, the good old club! It's actually prefered over those egg bombs at almost every boss. Exceptions is the elefant and the second form of the last boss.
		$LF

	[li 
		" Forth, this time I skipped one game of basket ball. This added up a few seconds in the castle but compared to what I lost in my previous run because of that extra game of basket ball it's worth it! I didn't check but I think that saved 30-50 seconds, or more ;)
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"Also, in the castle, I managed to do a hard jump this time, I have no idea why I wasn't able to do it in before but now it worked fine, so compared to use wings here I only lost a few frames.
	$LF

[ul 
	[li 
		" Fifth, the glitch at the last stage was performed better. I don't know why I didn't succed with this either in my previous run.. Well, now it looks good ;P

	"One final thing that might look weird. 
	$LF

[p 
	"The boss in the castle, the vampire, It doesn't change anything if I hit him while he's a bat and thus he is killed as fast as possible as it is now. He's also one of those bosses that's vulnerable to bomb eggs but it's not faster than to use the club.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Well, at the moment I can't think of much more to add. This run has a time of 14.44 which is over 2 minutes faster than my old one run AND a whole 4 seconds faster than my previous attempt!
	$LF

[p 
	"I'm also aware of that this isn't the most exciting game ever made but now it's alot faster.
