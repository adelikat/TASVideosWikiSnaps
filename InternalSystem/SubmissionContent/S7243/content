However, it turns out to be an act of deceit; the ambassador and her assistant are actually villains named Cackletta and Fawful, who quickly steal Peach's voice and escape with it into the dark sky. As an attempt to save their princess' voice, Mario and Luigi (forced by Bowser) now team up to retrieve Peach's voice and save the Beanbean Kingdom in record time while defeating every boss along the way.

	"This run is done on the Japanese version of the game. Despite the general pattern of Japanese versions of games being released first, for Superstar Saga this version was released after the English version and because of this they changed a few things from the English version. The most notable changes they’ve made for this version are the Mush Badge being significantly nerfed and costing more coins, the major price increase of the #1 Trousers and the differences in the bosses’ health and their drops. There’s also some visual and audio differences between the two versions that you’re gonna be seeing throughout the run. They changed a few mechanics in the Japanese version for example switching the bros probably in an attempt to fix some glitches but instead they added even more to the table, most notably a way to clip into or up walls. More on that later though.

	"The Mush Badge gives an attack bonus based on how many mushrooms (including super, ultra, and max mushrooms) you have. This bonus is added on to the base damage. On the US version, each Mushroom and Super Mushroom increases the bonus by 51/256 points (the total is rounded down to an integer). However, on the Japanese version of the game they only increase the bonus by 20/256 points which is roughly a 60% decrease in damage from the US version. Ultra and Max Mushrooms do increase the bonus slightly more but are rarely ever picked up in the run. Where Mush Badge really shines however is when combined with Chopper Bros. This move is supposed to do many hits that do a small amount of damage, quickly decaying to 2 damage per hit. But the Mush Badge bonus is added to every hit, so the total damage is effectively multiplied by the Mush bonus. TAS can do a maximum of 27 hits per attack using autofire.

These trousers are especially broken on the US version not only because of the Mush Badge, but because they only cost 250 coins and both bros can wear it. On the Japanese version however they raised the cost of the #1 Trousers, from 250 coins, to 1290 coins, while also only making them wearable by Mario. Due to the price being increased by over 1000 coins sadly they won't be picked up in this run. Having the #1 Trousers would've been especially useful for Fawful but I'm gonna talk more about that when we get there.

While some people consider it to be a boss as well, because of not having a boss theme the community decided that he ultimately isn't a boss and that it would make the category less fun because of only being able to attack with Luigi, therefore we don't fight him.

After this we backtrack and use this High Jump to reach a tall ledge while changing action commands in order to get "hop on barrel" for Mario and we start sequence breaking. We take pipe 5 to pipe 4 and head to east part of Teehee Valley. We use the barrel action command that we got earlier for Mario in order to clip through the lake and reach the other side. We grab a Max Nut from talking to a mole before performing some teleports in the maze and in the room after that, then we teleport past Trunkle in order to reach Fungitown early.

Once Hermie is defeated, we surf again with Luigi this time to Joke's End, where we take pipe 9 to pipe 3 to go to Birdo. We need to do Birdo first because of 2 things; it sets our respawn location in the first room of Teehee Valley and it gives Mario the Hand on his A button which we will want to keep in order to unlock a door in Joke's End. After Birdo we take pipe 6 to pipe 9, unlock the door, use barrel clipping to skip large portions of Joke's End and use Moonjump to clip Mario through a door.

Attacks, consuming items and failing a jump or a hammer don’t advance RNG at all, meanwhile jumping on an enemy advances RNG once and using hammer advances RNG 3 times.

Second, on the Japanese version, probably in an attempt to make the fight easier they made it so Mario and Luigi always attack first regardless if they outspeed Cackletta's body parts or not.

For example defeating Birdo always sets your respawn location to the first room of Teehee Valley, however if we defeated Chucklissa before Birdo our respawn location would've been Oho Oasis instead. We use this after defeating Chucklissa in order to skip all the long cutscenes and going to the broken Koopa Cruiser.

By then spin jumping into the ledge the game tries to move them to a place where they can fit, and since there’s a ledge above them that also acts as standing ground, they will be clipped up on that ground.

	$LF
	"There is a variable at $2440 and $2420 in IWRAM that keep track of the action commands for Luigi and Mario respectively. Normally, when you break out of a barrel, without doing Barrel Storage, the game simply sets $2443 to FF. But how it does that is it copies the value at $2443 to $2441, and then it sets $2443 to FF. $2441 tracks the action command of Luigi when he is in front. When you're inside of the barrel, $2443 is usually 00, and when you're not inside the barrel it's FF instead. With barrel storage however, you are inside the barrel, but $2443 is set to FF. Now, if you break out of the barrel the game copies $2443 to $2441, meaning $2441 is now also FF, which means Luigi will have the blank action command on his A button.

	"Talking to the sign after doing Barrel Storage has interesting results. If we talk to the sign, the first byte is set to 00. But again, the game handles this a bit differently; what is actually happening is the game copies $2441 to $2444, and then it sets the $2441 to 00. But the game copies $2441 to $2444 1 frame before $2441 is set to 00, which means even though the $2441 is 00, $2444 is still FF. Because $2444 is FF, it will keep the action command of talking to the sign even if you get away from it. Now let's go back to the variable at $2430: the first byte there is set to 02, which means Mario should be talking to a sign, but he is in the back so you still have the normal Jump. However, after you switch, this byte is responsible for being able to change Luigi's action commands past the intended limit. This gets us Spin Jump but on Luigi's B button after we switch. Using Spin Jump on Luigi sets the equivalent of $2441 of Luigi, but for Mario (at $2428). It sets it to $8204, which for Mario is apparently a value that works to make his action command ID go up. We get ID 21 after we land for Mario's A button, which is the "Emerge" action command, but because this command is not intended to be used by Mario, after using it $2428 is set to FF. Finally, we talk to the sign, we switch twice and we can now leave the room. All of this was to get ID 3 for Mario's B button after leaving this room.

	"Luigi can use Hammer on Mario to flatten him. Small Mario walking through a tunnel will cause the brothers to get separated. When Luigi then approaches Mario, Mario will walk behind Luigi and Luigi will turn Mario back to big. However, if Luigi approaches Mario in a way that Mario does not need to walk behind Luigi at all, Luigi will forget to turn Mario back to big. This can be done by having Luigi jump twice, then aim at Mario and land precisely in front of him. In other words, small Mario is exactly behind Luigi at the time they are united again. Using actions such as flattening one of the bros, using Spin Jump, etc., determines the game to "fix" the command it's supposed to show; for example, the action command that we got for Mario earlier, an X, gets changed to "Hand" instead after Luigi flattens him. The byte at $2419 is set to 0B when in Mini Mario mode and remains unchanged when performing Mini Mario Glitch (just like Sign Glitch and the spin jump on Luigi), which is why we can get to ID 6. Now, if we use this action command, which is a Hammer that is fake, the game tries to fix it and makes it show the "real" action command we should have, a High Jump. Using this High Jump on Mario works just like the Spin Jump on Luigi; using it allows for both bros' action command ID to keep going up. We are able to use this High Jump and get a "hop on barrel" action command for Mario.

	"This is the only glitch that's used in the run that's exclusive to the Japanese version. If you turn Luigi into a barrel while walking at normal speed and get Mario to be next to the wall that you want to clip through you can then switch places. Since Luigi is considered to be a barrel, he uses up more horizontal space and is thus considered to be inside the wall. By then precisely positioning Mario we can switch and clip both bros past the wall. Once inside the wall with both brothers, we can walk until we hit the next "wall unit" at which point you can switch twice in order to advance further into or past the wall. The reason why this works on the Japanese version is because there is a wall collision check while switching the brothers' places on the US version that only lets Luigi clip, but this check doesn't exist on Japanese. Also, this only works for horizontal walls; for walls that are placed upwards or downwards we have to use Teleporting to get past.

Furthermore if Luigi jumps when you have glitched movement, he'll advance by 8 indices per frame like normal. So if you move for n frames in the air, they will coincide at entry 128+8n instead, and warp to entry 136+8n. In this way, we can warp to any entry (that's a multiple of 8) from 129 to 256.

We need to have Luigi enter the loading zone since he's in front. This means Mario actually teleports a little bit past the loading zone, which can cause Mario to get stuck. If Mario is stuck when Luigi enters the loading zone, there's about a second when Mario can't move after entering the next room, so we avoid this. Before getting glitched movement in the next room, we are in a strange state where if Luigi jumps, the follow path is reset every frame.

Getting a "barrel break" action command and then using it has the same effect. The caveat is that the game doesn't just change his height; it also teleports him horizontally or vertically. If you precisely position him near a wall such that where he warps to is inside of a wall he will be able to infinitely jump and gain height.
