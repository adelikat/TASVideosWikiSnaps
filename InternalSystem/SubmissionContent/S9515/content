	"Hello! This is a TAS of the infamously difficult Flash game: Unfair Mario. This TAS beats the current RTA WR by about 5 seconds or so (in RTA timing).

	"This game is notoriously hard to play, and more so for having a big spike in notoriety thanks to some of the biggest YouTubers playing the game on their channels back in the day. The game features a lot of intentionaly frustrating level design and obstacles that require constant precision and near perfect timing to avoid. This game features 10 levels, and beating them all gets us to the final "ending screen" showing us how many times we died during our adventure.

	"Mario himself feels rather strange to control (having the game run at the oddball 22 FPS doesn't help), and has a fixed jump altitude, meaning that no matter how long we press the Up key, his jump height will always be the same (unless we bonk into a ceiling, which is incredibly rare anyways). Mario begins to "walk" slowly for a few frames, and then starts running at full speed shortly after. Mario stops accelerating when either turning around for around 3 frames+ or if we stop holding a direction key. The turning around alternative is used for most of the run since it's easier to manipulate our position while maintaining as much acceleration speed as possible. Mario can't accelerate if we hit a wall (either visible or invisible), so this is also avoided as much as possible, as long as I have enough spacing and speed to reach a floor or platform.

	"Due to the nature of this being a TAS, you'll notice that quite often I'm "randomly" turning around and slowing down or jumping for no reason, almost making the levels looking not very challenging. In reality, I'm avoiding all the crazy obstacles the game is constantly throwing at me, so please keep that in mind when watching this run.

	"In level 2, this is the only real instance of having to hug a wall (or block in this case) because I don't have enough space to slightly slow down in midair. If somehow there was a way to do this without slowing down too much, I could see at least 2 or 3 frames of timesave, but alas, I couldn't figure it out. As an upside to this, that moving block with spikes obstacle is completlely avoided by simply just... jumping right through it! With careful timing and positioning, Mario just phases through that obstacle, barely avoiding death.

	"Level 4 can be completely skipped by pressing Space. That's the troll in that level (or maybe not???). Level 5 you're forced to die in order to advance to the next level, so I get killed by that Big Boo at the start. Level 8 on the other hand is a proper chase sequence that you have to finish properly.

	"The twist in level 9 is that the finish goal is on the left side, while level 10 is back to the right side, and that's pretty much it.

	"Thank you for watching. Next time I might (hopefully) tackle a certain other difficult Mario Flash game of the "boss rush" variety. Stay tuned.
