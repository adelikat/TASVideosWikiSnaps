	": Nice run, everything looks good. The rule about games with no clear ending doesn't apply, in its current or previous form, because this game has an ending. So just like with Ghosts'n'Goblins, we don't require a second playthrough, because each of the loops has an ending. Feedback was good, and the game is quite intense, accepting to Moons.
