	"At the beginning of the game, the player (or players) choose from one of three characters:
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" 
		[b 
			"The Huntress
		]b
		": A voluptuous swords-woman with fastest movement, and even range and attacks.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 
		[b 
			"The Warrior
		]b
		": A muscular man with an axe and the best attack, but limited range and movement.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 
		[b 
			"The Sorcerer
		]b
		": A haggard old man armed with a staff that had the best ranged attacks, but was the weakest of the three in strength.

[p 
	"From there, the player/s are thrown into the levels one at a time with a warning about the boss at the end of each one. The player/s can collect items such as silver coins, potions and magic they could access in their inventory through the pause screen. While still in the pause screen, the players are able to get a better view of their surroundings by holding the C button and moving the screen around the player character with the directional pad. All of the levels are large enough to explore and many of them have secret areas that would award the player with additional pick-up items, such as potions of healing, invisibility, force fields, poison gas immunity, scrolls that increase player strength, keys, armor for additional attacks and strength per player, the Midas Ring which turns all enemies into bags of money and the Blast Wand which destroys all on-screen enemies.

[ul 
	[li 
		" 
		[b 
			"Pause
		]b
		": This trick only works if we use 2 players. Pausing a player, the other is follow its continuity, and player paused has the freedom to choose an item and while this paused, you will not receive even the slightest damage, so you can abuse it in some situations.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 
		[b 
			"Ultra jump
		]b
		": This wonderful trick is very useful when going to a very high place, if you do not get with a normal jump, you can get an "Ultra Jump". Pressing "C + B" you can use this trick. After a few frames by pressing "C" to achieve a "Ultra Jump" must keep "C" and press "B" to achieve a satisfactory jump

			"Level 6

		" (Golden Castle): Here's where it gets hard. It is used as the first part of the damage to save time, but is very minimal. Several elements are used to eliminate enemies quickly and an element in particular (Immunity) to evade enemies, both the huntress as the wizard. There are many doors, many walls and enemies who hold keys to follow the path, which is very annoying for me :(. But luckily, I were able to do as quickly as possible
