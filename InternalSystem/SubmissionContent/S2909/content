	", AndyD discovered a faster, more optimized route at the second stage. He also came up with the brilliant idea of using the routes made by mike89 in his 100% run, and modifying them to work in the Any% run. Lastly, he discovered how the Final Boss's Run energy works, which helped in shortening the battle.
