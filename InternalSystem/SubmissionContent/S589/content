	"My first run using FCEU. I can't stress how good frame advance is. The entire run was done frame
	$LF
	"by frame, so it is very precise.

[p 
	"New Improvements:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"1-1. Uses the ladder warp glitch, which requires both careful timing of the "Get enemy stuck 
	$LF
	"in the floor" glitch and "Fall through the floor" glitch, to get to Birdo and finishes the level
	$LF
	"4.25 sec faster.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"1-2. Toad is used instead of Luigi. This time Toad is unharmed from picking up the enemy 
	$LF
	"underneath the flying carpet. Jumping on the carpet is more precise. Over 3 seconds is saved by
	$LF
	"using the Illusionary item glitch to defeat Birdo with a vegetable instead of the key.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"4-1. Faster by 14 frames using a quick double jump.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"6-3. Is around 5 seconds faster using up+down to jump the wall instead of double jump.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"7-1. Around 7 seconds faster using up+down.
	$LF

[p 
	"Just about all levels and bosses are done frames faster.

	"I also try to improve the run aesthetically.
