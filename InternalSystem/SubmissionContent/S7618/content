	"A few notable examples of what to look out for: Your slides all seem to be done a frame or two later than the game first allows, plus you can run for a frame between slides in order to get a little distance without stopping. When you stop to jump up ledges, there's a noticeable gap between turning around to stop the slide and jumping, when you should be jumping the frame after turning around. You jump too close to ledges as well, getting right up next to them when jumping a few frames earlier will still work. At the ladder at the end of the first screen, you jump too early and lose a little height before grabbing it. Ideally, you'll want to grab a ladder as soon as you hit the peak of your jump in order to maximize forward movement from sliding while also minimizing time spent climbing.

	"Should you choose to retry this run, my highest recommendation is to refer much more strongly to the published run and ensure that you are matching or surpassing it in all comparable parts. There are a good number of screens that the two runs will still have in common: For example, Star Man's stage will be completely identical between both runs as it contains no time-saving zips, so there shouldn't be any loss of frames screen-by-screen in terms of pure movement (barring potential RNG changes, can't remember how much of a factor that is mid-stage). Also, if you're not using it already, TAStudio would help immensely with fixing a lot of these issues. Set some easy to reach hotkeys for inserting and deleting frames and you can very efficiently find the first frame where an action can be done or the most efficient frame to time a jump or a ladder grab.

	"Most of all though, keep trying! While this run does need more work, it's still a good first effort, and it shows you're getting the hang of the process. Take my advice to heart and feel free to ask for more on the forums or 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=on Discord|href=/DiscordServer)
