	"In 2 levels this run loses a bit of time to existing movies, but overall the level of play is significantly better. I can assume that time was lost due to character choice. Since this game is RNG heavy and also involves planning out the score (which gives extra lives that players can borrow from each other), redoing a single level would invalidate most of the future events. So implementing those known improvements would require redoing the whole run.

	"Nowhere does this movie look sloppy, the author does their best with their character choice, so I believe this movie is worth publishing as a considerable improvement. I also encourage the author to improve it even further through testing various character choices available upon turtle death and probably manipulating the bosses better. Accepting to Moons over
