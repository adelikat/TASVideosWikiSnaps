	"Based on puzzle originally devised in the mid-1800s by the great mathematician, Karl Friedrich Gauss, Eight haughty queens have quarreled, and now each one refuses to speak with any of the other seven. The question is, how do you place the queens on an 8 X 8 chessboard to give each queen sole possession of her row, column, and two diagonals? Those of you familiar with the game of chess will realize this means that no two of the pieces on the board can be in line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

While an assumption could be made that all 92 possible solution layouts would require the same amount of time to complete, it is

	"possible that one of the other layouts could still yield a faster TAS depending on way the game evaluates for conflicts given the current piece placement.
