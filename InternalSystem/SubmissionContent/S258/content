	"After watching the Vegas Stakes movies yesterday I decided to make my own run through the game. This movie also includes a faster gambling strategie than the previous movies to reach 10mio. $ the fastest way possible. It's my first published movie anyway :).

	"Edit: The previous 4 movies are aiming for entertainment but failed ;). That's a reason why there was entered a name at the beginning or typing in a dream at the end what you would do with your virtual cash. Beside this the rest of the run doesn't look very smooth and was played slow (or lets say.. at the speed you would normally play it on a real console).

	"A speed run on a casino game is a nice idea, like the time attacks for the adventures in the NES section. Nobody knows what's going on but mastering such a game as fast as possible is fun!
