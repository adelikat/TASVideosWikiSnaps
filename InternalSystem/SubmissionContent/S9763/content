	"Our site strives to show off some of the best of what Tool Assistance in gaming has to offer; typically (but not always) from a speed optimization standpoint. Even when there is an additional goal besides simply going for speed (i.e. Maximum Score), such runs are generally still expected to meet the stated goal as optimally as possible.

	"It appears you may have misunderstood the submission process and/or movie rules before submitting your run.  While we don't have a current publication of this game and your run is generally good play, it is clearly not optimal when compared to the best human runs of the same goal, 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=as mentioned in the forum|href=/Org/Forum/Posts/536591)
	".  Our rules require that new submissions must either meet or beat known records (which would include the best RTA run for this case).  Since you submtitted a run that does not beat the known human record, I'm going to guess that you didn't realize that your run needed to beat/meet all known records in order to be accepted. We do not operate on a leaderboard system like speedrun.com where the best any one individual can attain is accepted, we only publish the best single run of a category for any given game.
