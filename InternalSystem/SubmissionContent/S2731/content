	"Super Metroid is a classic platformer with many advanced techniques and a very fine, subpixel-based move engine. The story is about a bounty hunter called Samus who has the goal to explore a foreign planet called Zebes to find and destroy Mother Brain, the evil leader of the galaxy who is breeding a mighty species called Metroids to abuse them for her own benefits. During the journey you will find alot of items such as new ammo, energy tanks, special upgrades that speed you up or allow to pass certain areas you would normally not be able to, and making your character strong enough to be ready for the upcoming showdown against Mother Brain.

	"Despite being over 15 years old by now, it is considered as one of the best games ever made, and is still played by many people on a regular basis. Due to the many different move techniques, a high variety through the new upgrades, and alot of route possibilities, this game is a very common target for many types of speedruns and playthroughs.

	"This is my reborn any% TAS project for Super Metroid, recorded between April 30 and July 5, 2010. It uses an optimized route I designed back in 2006 when working on my first any% TAS attempt, which collects all the necessary items to maximize mobility, variety, and damage power of the beams for much quicker battles, while also using the latest speed tricks and boss strategies, with some of them
