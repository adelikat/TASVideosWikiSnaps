	"On the streets, I picked the right time to take bullets just to speed me up a little bit and save time.  To make up for it, I needed to manipulate luck into having the blue cops drop Soylent Sodas (energy canisters) so I'll have something to give away if I needed to take another bullet later down the road.

	"I maintained my own infamous song-to-gunfire dance in Richter's apartment.  And then when that woman appeared, that was when Aerosmith gave silent word that "Janie's Got A Gun!"  Then to speed things up precisely after I picked up her gun, I made sure that every bullet managed to strike her, even in the air.  I never missed a lot of shots like the last time.  (1,2,3,5,6)

	"The security hall at the Subway was where I cornered at least 2 security guards while bullets from ceiling orbs were coming at me in all directions.  I do not know if I took damage here, but I really knocked out the security guards slightly quicker.  And to close this deal, Quaid walks in the air again. (1,3,4,5,6)

	"And downstairs to the boarding area of the Subway.  I only focused on the gray soldiers while avoiding all the red ones and the rabie dogs that were trying to attack me.  I did pick up nearly all EN-canisters as I made way toward the front.  I took no damage here.  After I jumped on board, a red soldier was still at the top.  As the subway train started moving, it looked like it was moonwalking.  For that, I think that is indeed another glitch I noticed.  (1,4,5,6)

	"I bought 6.5 energy into the concrete area.  I used the ball-and-chains to take damage just to save time.  That is probably the only best improvement on this stage.  Everything else looked about the same.  (1,3,5,6)

	"The blue hallway was a little bit of precise improvement, at least in the first room.  It was crazy to shoot a laser gun on the right and then another one on the left all in one jump.  But it's pretty quick.  Then I defeated the UFO's in each room even quicker.  I still avoided the red robots; but if I did mess with them, I would probably push them back so they're least likely to throw a grenade at me.  (1,3,5,6)

	"As soon as I stepped foot into Mars' (what I call) "Trailer Park", I did more precise firing and whatever bullets I shot would go through some of the Martian Cats I took out.  It would make the viewers think that I was missing shots that way, but believe me, that's not true.  Everything else was fine.  (1,3,5,6)

[p 
	"And then the caves where a few guys and skeleton zombies would go after me.  I was slightly quicker here as a matter of fact, and I only took out those that were a bigger threat to me.  And then going into the Digger Dan boss, I managed to fire the laser even quicker to where Dan's head came off the drill before it backed up.  That means improvement with a capital "I"!  (1,3,5,6)

	"The final stage of Mars was about the same as my first submission.  But this time, I had enough energy to get a boost from the electric pulses just to save a little more time.  From there on, Richter fell again and I rise victorious!  (1,3,5,6)
