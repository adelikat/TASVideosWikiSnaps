Splatterhouse is great. As I said five years ago, it's self-aware about what it is as a series.

	" when jumping because, without holding a direction, Rick's speed is maintained during a jump. This means that jumping on the first frame out of a slide without pressing anything causes Rick to travel at slide speed over the course of the jump. It gets more interesting when factoring in how sliding and speed work in tandem: The higher we jump, the higher we can begin sliding, which gives an extra pixel of movement per slide, which can save a frame here or there if the stage allows for it (it almost always doesn't!).

It starts moving in an arcing pattern across the screen once it reaches a point near the bottom of its oscillating cycle. We want to arrive just after that point while it's travelling upward, as there isn't enough time to reach it while it's travelling downward. Hitting it will, for whatever reason, pause it in place for a few frames before it snaps back to where it should be on the cycle if it hadn't paused, meaning it's possible to hit it past that point going both ways and keep it on the right side of the screen. On the last hit, we want to be on the far right side to reduce the time it takes for the screen to start fading out, so the final jump and hit are timed perfectly to be able to hit the Cross as early as possible while still reaching the far right side of the screen.
