The final conclusion is that it's okay. Being able to outperform my last time by more than 34 seconds is a relatively significant improvement.

	"There was one small bit I felt was potentially missed. In Heat Man's stage, around the 3 minute mark in the TAS, Item 2 could've been used as an extra platform to jump up from to skip a part of climbing the ladder. This only popped out to me when there was still some weapon energy left for the weapon at the end of the stage. Otherwise this all seems fine and well optimized to me. Nice work!
