	" is a synth pop concept album cleverly disguised as a rail shooter arcade game, developed by Simogo and published by Annapurna Interactive in 2019. We play as a heartbroken woman, tasked with amending the world and the pieces of her heart by running, sword fighting, riding bikes, drifting, flying and so many other setpieces that make this game an absolute vibe.

	"This submission aims to finish the game in style by obtaining the maximum possible score in each of the game’s 23 levels. Score is not transferred across levels but each level keeps track of the highest score the player has gotten in it, so this run aims at maximizing each IL separately. The game recognizes scores by giving them ranks, which can be Bronze, Silver or Gold, as your score goes above a certain threshold. An additional rank, Wild, is recognized by the game but only after obtaining a Gold rank on all levels in the game. For reference, I’ll be including these thresholds as well as the best known RTA score for each level.

	"Before talking about the game itself, it’s worth stopping and talking about the highly unusual framework used for this submission. Sayonara Wild Hearts was developed in Unity (specifically version 2018.4.7f1). While previous submissions have used a system to port the official Steam Windows releases to Linux, this was not feasible for this game as the Windows build only supports Direct3D 11 as its render API, which a native Linux build cannot provide. However, the game has a Mac build which we could use for that purpose.

Each following collection multiplies, and each collectible has its own separate counter. The combo counter resets on death or after completing the level.

	"This is a rather short level, but it introduces several major elements. For starters, it is the first motorbike level. While riding the bike, we can earn 50 points by performing a Slide, which is done by holding a direction until reaching a distance threshold. Additionally, this level is the first where one can feasibly die by colliding with buildings or with traffic. This, in turn, enables us to gain even more points by obtaining Risky bonuses by grazing hitboxes. These two bonuses give 50 points every time they’re obtained, and while they do not stack, they can be obtained multiple times per level with well planned movement. These two sources of points are commonly referred to as style points.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"A new technique, called Slide Chaining, has been discovered and developed for this movie and shines in this level. By releasing a direction after the minimum distance to cash in a slide and quickly pressing it again 4 frames after, we can get the points from the slide while retaining almost all our speed in said direction. This, in turn, allows us to get two or more (potentially several) slides in a single direction and removes the need for snaking in order to get slides. While snaking would definitely be faster for the sake of generating points, using slide chaining allows us to sneak in some more points out of long slides.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Finally, there’s an interesting usage of a pause. In order to prevent players from getting multiple risky bonuses out of the same collision, Risky bonuses have a short cooldown in which you cannot get another one, even from a different source. Here we take a pause to wait for the cooldown to finish in order to cash in one extra Risky from a line of cars.

We can skew our hitbox by moving left or right, but this also takes us away from them. The best known strat is to wiggle with a certain rhythm, but said wiggle has to be executed differently depending on your position, and the best wiggle we could achieve collected 15 hearts, leaving 3 behind.

	"The first “boss” level and the end of the first act, this level is lengthy and a significant step up in difficulty. Early level routing consists mostly of collecting all possible items while obtaining as many style points as we can get away with. A couple interesting choices are intentionally hitting a fence on our way out of a tunnel to set up for a slide + risky towards a tram (as hitting the fence just lowers our horizontal speed, making it so by the time we get into position we’re not carrying as much horizontal speed, giving just enough time to recover and hit the slide while making it to our target). It’s worth mentioning there’s a known slide right at the end of this section which is obtainable on console and with joystick, but this TAS was unable to obtain it as it uses keyboard inputs.

[div class=p 
	"Each boss level contains at least one big KO section, where the game expects us to mash over and over for points. Similar to small hears, for each of these, every button press adds 1 more point than the previous one, so mashing N times results in N*(N+1)/2 total points. Interestingly for us, this mechanic has a frequency cap in mashing speed which can only be reasonably achieved at high framerates. The game defaults to Vsync and the framerate is uncapped. Therefore, during these sections I increase FPS to 120 in order to hit optimal mashing and therefore maximize score. I do not opt to run the entire game at high frame rate because other physics based tricks, such as slides, tend to be either much harder or impossible to perform at such high FPS. This will be done in all sections of this type for the remainder of the movie.

The gun shoots every 5 frames on its own, so we can only control where they spawn by moving to good positions.

Like Hearts & Swords, the level is structured around split paths, which we can take by moving in midair or by hitting specific big hearts.

	"Early level is just a simple snake pattern, but once the screen wrap is introduced, things change a lot. We aim to spend any idle time teleporting back and forth, as this is a constant source of points. However, this is not as simple as you may think: the game preserves the speed in which you enter the teleporter, so we aim to enter with the minimum possible speed. We also must be aware that there is a cooldown on teleports (as in, you can’t enter them too soon after you just exited one) and trying to do so not only delays the timer further, it can also cause the game to deny us the points from the most recent teleport. A look at reverse engineered code seems to indicate that this is due to the game not properly reporting the score gain if we wrap the first possible frame.

This means that for one frame, effectively, The Fool has a hitbox covering the entire screen horizontally at her vertical position.

As such, it is possible to switch directions fast enough that we go from meeting the requirements for drifting on one direction to drifting on the other before the counter is reset. This allows us to obtain much more points by turning drift chains into a single, continuous drift.

This does not result in a net point gain if performed in the middle of a slide, as the next queued scoring event will be fired at the appropriate frequency again, but it can be used to obtain one extra score event right at the end of a drift.

Dying resets our counters for all collectibles right away, but heart pickups do not increase the streak counter immediately. As such, dying while collecting hearts in a precise way can make the game give us the points (and therefore, increase the heart counter) after death. While the score is properly reset to what it was at the last checkpoint (0 in this case) once we respawn, the streak counter is not, so we can start the level with the counter already increased, adding a massive amount of points to the whole run (to be precise, dying as we collect m hearts in a level with n hearts total adds m*n points).

Once we have aimed at a target (by moving our target reticle towards it, done with the arrow keys), The Fool fires an arrow at it after 30 frames (when running at 60fps, and this wait scales with framerate to always match about 0.5 seconds). Objects destroyed by an arrow shot give 10 points each plus streak. On top of this, an additional mechanic exists called combos. By queuing at least one arrow shot during the 30 frame window for the next one, all kills queued in succession are counted for a combo bonus that is given to the player once the last shot is fired. The combo bonus amount is related to the length of the combo: you get a Small combo for 2 or 3 hits worth 50 points, a Medium combo for 4 to 7 worth 200 points, a Large Combo for 8 to 13, worth 1000 points, and an X-Large Combo for 14 and up, worth 2500 points. Since the combo bonus does not scale any higher than 14, It is optimal to only get exactly 14 kills or an XL combo when possible, and subdivide to get combos efficiently for the remaining targets.

I tested getting a kill streak stored via Dama Death, but a skull kill scores points (and therefore increases the streak counter) instantly rather than after a delay, and even if we time a kill to the same frame we die, skulls have a failsafe that causes them to despawn instantly if they’re aimed at and the player is hit, not granting us any points in the process.

	"Beyond potential execution improvements (such as collecting more hearts or more style points using the shown routes), I’m going to mention some specific levels that have unexplored or unexplained tech that could increase their score in the future:
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		" Runners theorize it might be possible to trigger a Dama Death on Fighting Hearts during the final large heart patch. My best attempts either got no hearts on death or collected the hearts too early for the glitch to work.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" The extra slide on Begin Again that was not obtained
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Forest Ghost has potential for both a Dama Death and for a different style point route.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Laser Love can increase its score by dropping one heart box, if it gets one more wolf kill and can get all its three hearts. While I have been able to get the kill, I was unable to set a kill that would allow me to collect the hearts, so it was not worth it.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" A glitch has been documented in Dead of Night that causes the Mecha Wolf heads to spawn at a much lower angle than intended and makes it possible to shoot at them from ground level. However, we don't know of any consistent setup to trigger it. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Hearts & Swords has that slide that didn’t work.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Parallel Universes has one slide after the first square coin that causes us to drop hearts when performed. There's a chance a setup for it exists that allows us to get it without missing any collectibles, but I couldn't get it. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" I was able to collect all 15 hearts in the big patch in Heartbreak IV with teleport spam, but doing so causes me to be too late to grab the square coin after. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" I’ve heard reports of RTA runners getting over 2000 points at the start of Night Drift, before the first camera pan. I couldn’t find any footage of this being done.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" There’s potential for a more aggressive Risky route for Reverie, but a lot of the ideas are hampered by the difficulty of getting them to count to begin with.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" The World We Knew offers the most room for changing strats, as a potential different strategy for the first chorus section could lead to massive score differences.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Hate Skulls has an strange risky + kill off the skull right after the big boost pad. I’ve only seen it done RTA once, and despite my best efforts I was unable to reproduce it.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" During the Hermit section in Wild Hearts Never Die, it might be possible to obtain more hearts, but the window to collect them all is very small.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" At the very end of Wild Hearts Never Die, the seven rings contain a total of 35 obtainable hearts (5 per ring) but I’ve been unable to collect all 35.
