Of course, I don't expect this movie to ever be published, but I still wanted to share this speed run with anybody who happen to know this game. Anyway, it's that day of the year, which hopefully is reason enough to forgive this submission :P

Anyway, yes, it's 6 re-records, but it's actually the third attempt (I beat my own time twice). Also, it's a very short game (only one level), notice how the movie is only 47 seconds long.

	$LF
	"1. I cannot find this homebrew.  So not a good choice.  
	$LF
	"2. Homebrew is an incomplete demo. Looks like there is not even a single complete level.

	"3. Does have Nazi symbols in gameplay on some boxes based on a video I saw and I know certain countries have rules against showing that. Not sure if this could be an issue for those that live there and visit this site.
