	"The game itself has only one stage, yet shows off a very capable engine. Of course, I don't expect this movie to ever be published, but I still wanted to share this speed run with anybody who happen to know this game. Anyway, it's that day of the year, which hopefully is reason enough to forgive this submission :P

Anyway, yes, it's 6 re-records, but it's actually the third attempt (I beat my own time twice). Also, it's a very short game (only one level), notice how the movie is only 47 seconds long.
