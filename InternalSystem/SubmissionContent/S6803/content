	" seconds faster than the 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=current movie|href=/4196M)
	". Almost all of the savings come from a new exploit that ktwo found. By jumping into an exit, it's possible to save up to 35 frames per screen. Typically, the player runs to the exit and then holds either up or down for a long time until the game transitions to the next screen. By jumping before the exit, the player can start holding up or down earlier.

The platform-action RPG style resembles a Zelda II dungeon, and the variety of playable characters is still seen today in the Curse of the Moon series. However, Heroes of the Lance fails because it is too short and linear, the controls are limited and unresponsive, and collisions are totally unpredictable. But with all the slow door transitions removed now, at least the movie is a little more entertaining.
