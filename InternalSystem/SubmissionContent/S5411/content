	"I don't really have too much to say here. The run was inspired by a run of Bomber King on niconico, but the US version is shorter by 2 seconds due to being able to skip the title screen much quicker. It does have longer gameplay, however, due to a certain invinciblity glitch with the bombs no longer working. This doesn't matter however, since you have to wait for the background music to completed a full loop before the glitch can be triggered, so all you see is me waiting in the menu for less time. I think the final boss fight is done as fast as possible, so I don't think that this can be improved. I could be wrong, though.

	": As has been noted in the discussion topic, the disassembly of the debug menu access method points to it being a deliberate code, and not a glitch. As such, rejecting for using a debug code.
