	"Robo Warrior, known in Japan as Bomber King, is an action spin-off of the Bomberman series. This run uses a glitch to access the game's debug menu, skip to the final level and kill the final boss.

	"I don't really have too much to say here. The run was inspired by a run of Bomber King on niconico, but the US version is shorter by 2 seconds due to being able to skip the title screen much quicker. It does have longer gameplay, however, due to a certain invinciblity glitch with the bombs no longer working. This doesn't matter however, since you have to wait for the background music to completed a full loop before the glitch can be triggered, so all you see is me waiting in the menu for less time. I think the final boss fight is done as fast as possible, so I don't think that this can be improved. I could be wrong, though.

	"The ROM Hash is incorrect because I started TASing on the (J) version, then switched over. Just ignore it (and fix if you want). Also, first new NES game for me! #TASMania

	": As has been noted in the discussion topic, the disassembly of the debug menu access method points to it being a deliberate code, and not a glitch. As such, rejecting for using a debug code.
