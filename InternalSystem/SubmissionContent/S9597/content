This ekes out some extra money each time you do the level. During advanced mode, you're forced to get the Genius and Prodigy merit once each, so I summon two objects that I want to use later while that is forced to happen (I switch to Study in particular because in order to get past 4000 money I need a bit extra from summoning the new object. Study is a bit faster than Classroom so I continue to use it once the merits are no longer a concern). Each merit has to fade into view in the list, which takes

				"My original submitted idea for A1-1 grind was to use a Living Room (abbreviated to the two-letter LR), because it's very fast to type. However, two days after submitting, I realized that it's an unnecessary timeloss to get the Entertainer merit every time (this happens because the Living Room contains a TV and a Console, and the merit triggers when you summon two entertainment objects). Despite this, the route saved 
				(frames|amount=571)
				" over the previous submission. Some of this timesave is from not using the white OK button on the level and world select, as this loses a few frames (maybe like 4-8 each) in some cases, but the majority is just because both P1-1 and P1-2 are slower.

The apple is of particular interest because it can be used for the chef in the tutorial, bypassing the initial All New and New Object merits in A1-1. Unfortunately, this makes me lose out on 25 Ollars, just barely putting me below the required 4000, but I solve this by summoning Study during advanced mode where you're forced to get merits anyway.

Unfortunately, neither of these were faster, although 7 was maybe a bit more promising than 11. It may still be faster to do 3-7 once, if you use Nothing during the tutorial, but it didn't seem like it from rough estimates (you still get a new object merit no matter what if you do it this way, since you'll get it on A10-1).

A10-6 seems less laggy and could potentially be faster than A10-3 if not for the fact that the hat that Maxwell wears at the start of that level counts as a new object and gives merits.

However, a day after submitting, I realized that the jetpack might have just enough airtime to get above the gates and path to the Starite from there. I spent some time trying to get the earliest possible final input; this requires panning the camera left for the entire duration of the level and tapping the Starite in the corner as Maxwell lands on the gates, while giving him a good landing angle so that he can stay on top of the gates while in autopilot.

When I was watching it back afterwards, I noticed that some loads may be different in Collection, as it sort of pushes ahead and pulls back in the first 3 levels of world 10, on a scale greater than just the difference from not being able to exit the tank immediately. I don't know the full potential impact of load differences between versions, and I didn't even consider that this was a possibility at first.
