	"Flying Warriors is a hybrid action/adventure/fighting game. However, some people found it to be boring, and this TAS is for them. By skipping right to the ending cutscene as fast as robotically possible we avoid having to slog through the game and don't have to play it at all. This provides technically infinite entertainment and enjoyment if you don't enjoy the gameplay. The title screen music is good at least.
