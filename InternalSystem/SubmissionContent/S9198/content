	"At the end of every bossfight, Mathayus will move to a specific spot to do its victory animation. Also, the victory animation only happens after the health reffil is done. At the end of every shrine the victory animation and health refill also happens, but in that case they happen at the same time, so the refill doesn't lose time.

	"I don't really know how the RNG works in this game, from what I've seen, at least, it depends on how you deal with enemies, which you kill, how exactly, sometimes when, and sometimes wether you get a fire orb or not depends on where you are while waiting for the drop. So really, to get the fire orbs drop where needed, which is really the most important part of the TAS, what you have to do is to just deal with enemies in slightly different ways until you happen to get the right RNG.

[div class=p 
	"On the 1st bossfight, there's some attacks that seem to not land, this is because you can attack that boss 1 frame before you'd think, but it messes with the stun animation, so damage is dealt and the boss gets i-frames, but its not stunned, so it can still move around and attack. And, because it can attack between attacks if doing that, its not done in every atack to prevent atacks that give the boss invulnerability.

[div class=p 
	"On the 4th bossfight, there's some RNG manipulation that was done to prevent the same totem face from turning around consecutively, because if a different face turns around, the turning back animation of the last face happens while the new face is turning. A repeat loses 15 frames.
