	"The Fifth Element for Playstation 1 is loosely based on the movie of the same name. Regularly considered one of the worst games ever made for the PS1, it features unprecise tank controls, weird camera choices and AI that is either dumb of unfair. it also doesn't follow the movie's plot but instead creates it's own story mixed with cutscenes from the actual film. But we won't see any of it's plot anyway as this game is host of a few out of bound glitches that skip basically every stage.

	"You either play as Leeloo or Korben. For Leeloo's OOB you need a place with a lower ceiling - like a doorway - then jump against a wall at the right angle and press either up or down (depending on the level) at a pretty precise time. For Korben you have to stand on the egde of a platform you can safely fall from, then melee attack to fall from the platform with the momentum of the attack. Afterwards you have to hold up and can press jump to teleport through walls. The direction and distance you teleport is dependent of the angle you're facing and the timing of jumping, making it seemingly random. Almost every OOB can be achieved with one jump. An exception is stage 7.1, where I couldn't find a way to get the clip without jumping twice.

	"Most levels just have an endtrigger that you walk into to complete it, while some require you to collect certain items or hit switches beforehand. The plan for them is similar: Find a place to go OOB, navigate around the void without hitting invisible walls or clipping back in and walk to the objectives/end of the level. There is one intentional death in this run in stage 5.2. You need to hit two switches before returning to the start of the level. Once you find the area of the switches you need to jump over an invisible wall then fall through the world without taking fall damage and hit both switches before the enemies kill you. In doing so you will respawn at the beginning of the level and can end it. You can't go too far into the room with the switches though as you will trigger a checkpoint that respawns you right there. You also need to pick up the shield at the end of 5.2 or else you will die from enemy fire in 8.2.

	"Thanks to AleMastroianni amd yep2yel for finding and providing the coordinates for this game. Without them it would have been much harder to navigate through some sections. yep2yel did a WIP of this game roughly a year ago but wasn't actively working on it anymore. I didn't use any of his inputs as most of the OOBs for the PS1 version weren't discovered yet at that time.

	": Trimmed empty input at the end and added missing cycle count. With this core, you need to enable pausing at the end of the movie and save the movie on its last frame outside TAStudio to make it have the right cycle count, which is needed for the site to properly parse the total time (due to variable framerate of PSX).
