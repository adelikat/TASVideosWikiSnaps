	"Moving the cursor while holding a piece takes longer. However, the amount of frames before you can move the cursor seems inconsistent. At first, it seems to be a range from 57-60 frames, and then on the final move, it throws that out of the window and starts being 66-70 frames. No idea what's going on with that.

So for the time being, I believe that this is the fastest you can win on Level 8. Like other board games released for the Atari, computer thinking times are present, but for this TAS, they're essentially negligible.

Unfortunately, not only do I not have a plan on how to accomplish this, but it seems that every time I make my first move against Level 7, BizHawk crashes. It might just be my friend's laptop, I hope. The good news is that the entire game has been

	"In regards to optimization...the 3 move mate is very common and exploits the CPU's weakness to stop it. Unlike other 8-bit consoles, where weird things occur, this version seems to have better coding. In fact, it has been reported that only one person has beaten Level 7 (The harder level, also mentioned in this submission)...which says a lot about the ability of this game. After reading the atariage article, I see that the CPU broke down on a sacrifice; however, it did give a valiant effort as it took a long time to perform the calculations.
