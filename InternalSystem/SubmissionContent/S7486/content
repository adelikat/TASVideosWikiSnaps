	"Resident Evil: Gaiden is a Gameboy Color game released in 2001. The title depicts a viral outbreak on a luxurious passenger ship. It introduces an underground organization established to put an end to the global operations of Umbrella, the company responsible for the Raccoon City disaster. Leon S. Kennedy, one of the protagonists of Resident Evil 2, joined the initiative and received orders to investigate the ocean liner, Starlight, which is rumored to be carrying a new type of bio-organic weapon (BOW) developed by Umbrella Corporation. Eventually, the headquarters loses contact with him and Barry Burton, a support character from the original Resident Evil, is sent in to find his whereabouts.

	"Gaiden was an extremely ambitious game for the Gameboy Color. Essentially, Headquarters sends us (Barry) in at the beginning of the game to both find Leon who was sent in before us, and investigate/secure a BOW that escaped from one of Umbrella's labs. The game follows a top-down perspective in the exploration mode, allowing you to go about finding key items and using them. When you are either grabbed by an enemy, or you aim with the B button at an enemy, you'll enter the combat mode, where a cursor will go back and forth across the screen with you having to time an A press to hit an enemy. If you land right in the middle of an enemy's bar, you land a critical hit.

	"A couple things to note in this run; Sometimes when an enemy aggros onto you, the game randomly spawns 1-3 additional enemies just offscreen to make larger encounters without having them loaded at all times. However, enemies spawned by the game like this cannot grab you and are safe to run by at any range. This means that only "real" enemies can force you into combat. Another thing, the gas launcher weapon is bugged; When you try to run away in combat, the cursor becomes the run away indicator and you can no longer fire any weapons, except for the gas launcher. What's more, when you fire the gas launcher in this manner, it doesn't consume any ammunition.

	"There's definitely a little bit of potential for improvement; Most likely involving more lag reduction with different lines. And there's theoretically a tad more timesave with more BOW skips, the last one just saves more time easiest.

	"There are a couple other technical errors. It seems the movie was recorded without BIOS or with the wrong BIOS. There's also a message about it not saving cycle count. I have verified that it syncs on my emulator with a proper ROM, though.
