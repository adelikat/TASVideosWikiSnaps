	"Here is the all red gem run, for best ending. For those who do not know the difference, the best ending is when 70 red gems are collected. In the end,it shows Alladin, played by the computer, in some of the game levels, while cast names are displayed. It is, imo, a much better ending than showing the same lame Jasmin/Aladdin/Carpet level, all the way to the end.

	": I agree with many of the responses in the thread; this run provides a lot more variety and chances for exhibition of acrobatics than the previous version. However, I believe that the general content of both this and the any% run are too similar to be published alongside each other. To use a poor metaphor, they're both the same meal, and this version simply adds a little more spice. I'm accepting this run as a "good ending" version of the game, to obsolete the current "any %" run.
