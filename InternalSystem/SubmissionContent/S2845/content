	"I decided to do this TAS after seeing the 
	[a class=intlink href=/2643S 
		"GB submission
	]a
	" by mugg.  It was rejected for not using SGB mode so I decided to give it a shot.  Its a short game, only 4 levels.  It has a variety of power-ups but the important one for a TAS is the flying squirrel power-up.  With it radical shortcuts are possible which are always nice for a TAS.

	"This movie has 55 frames of improvement over mugg's submission.  However, it is 287 frames slower overall due to longer screen transitions of the SGB mode.  Most of the improvements are from making fewer jumps by utilizing the flying ability more.  The character moves at 7/8ths of a pixel per frame.  1 full pixel is lost every time he jumps so the fewer jumps the better!  Of the frames lost, 14 of them were due to different randomness.  I'm not sure if this is an actual different between modes or just bad luck.

	[a class=intlink href=/2643S 
		"mugg's submission
	]a
	" got votes passable for acceptance (it rejected for being recorded in the wrong mode), the audience deemed it not a good game choice this time around. Watching the movies side by side really makes me wonder what caused this sudden change of heart, but that doesn't change the fact that this movie got very poor votes. Rejecting.
