	"Ever since I posted a bunch of youtube videos of me beating this game's bosses, people have been pestering me again and again to show them how to complete this game. After like the 2.147 Billionth person PM'd me on youtube, I decided to piss them off by making this TAS. UMAD, Subscribers?

	"By pausing the game 2 frames before you enter a doorway, the game fucks over and allows you to do crap. Fix this by exiting the area or floor. Also the main point of this run. By the way, to find out where you are while off-screen, simply pause/unpause the game - You'll appear in the screen along with the room you're in for a very brief period of time during the fadeout.

	"Health management was tricky, but I managed to beat the game without healing since picking up candies for the first time pops-up a dialogue box. Sadly, while skipping the box is possible (by triggering another cutscene while on top of a candy), the route used doesn't allow such situation to appear.
