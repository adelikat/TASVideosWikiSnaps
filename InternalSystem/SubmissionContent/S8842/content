	"The 12th Annual Vanilla Level Design Contest: Collaboration Hack, which I'll refer to VLDC12 for here on out, is a compilation hack of the entries of Super Mario World Central's 12th Vanilla Level Design Contest. Within the 
	[a href=https://smwc.me/t/102983 rel=noopener external nofollow 
		"constraints of the base game without any custom graphics or assembly
	]a
	", the contestants make the best level they can in a given time frame. This hack compiles and organizes the levels into general themes on the overworld and tracks exits reached, dragon coin sets completed when available, and moons collected when available. The hack also uses the SA-1 chip mostly to allow for more RAM available which in turn increases the sprite limit and greatly, but not completely, reduce lag. New to the VLDC compilation hacks for this one is the removal of the "Worst World" area which in my opinion greatly increases the appeal of this hack as it doesn't have something that can bee seen as a shame zone.

This one caught my eye since it shows off the sheer creativity of an entire community willing to stretch the limits of what Super Mario World is capable of. Just because it's vanilla doesn't mean that those vanilla mechanics are the same thing. A lot of levels use a fair amount of unexpected interactions that definitely would leave you in awe.

Some levels have additional dragon coins or additional moons, so I opted to collect those as well to cover all bases.

		" During the boss Big Boo's death animation, if it's scrolled off screen far enough the level end starts sooner as the death sprite will despawn immediately. This is mostly possible in stages with a boss Big Boo whose arena scrolls horizontally and is used when possible. I'm also pretty sure the level Different Results makes this practically a forced mechanic due to how the boss fight is implemented.

[dl

		"Leaving and re-entering stages
	]dt

For JURASSIC SLAM JAM this can be cleared with a Start + Select input to set it back to no dragon coins collected. This doesn't work with CUNNING PLUMBING but there's a dragon coin route which mitigates the issues with this bug.

Either the floor is all sloped to prevent ducking with walls too short to wall jump while ducking into the next pipes, or the pipes are over water which stops the ducking state of Mario when entered.

A lot of this can be skipped with wall jumps. A damage boost is used to reach the fourth dragon coin and activate the snake block on one cycle. The door requires the moving platform to get into place so a blue throw block is used to hit a yellow turn block while Mario bumps into the other one.
