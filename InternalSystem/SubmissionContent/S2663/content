	"Not much to say here, the level is quite straight forward so there isn't much of a change from the old run. A little time where saved on the way to the boss, mostly through lag reduction (sometimes at the cost of an ingame frame). Then 10-12 where saved by landing in a better spot before the boss appears (after I land the screen has to scroll for a bit so I made sure to minimize the amount). The rest comes from the boss, minor tweaking in positioning and movement during the fight made it possible to shoot it at a higher frequency when it moved to the sides.

	"Besides some small movement optimizations all of the improvement comes from handling the the platforms with the turrets (possibly the most annoying enemies throughout the whole run) differently. Generally I found it to be faster to either slow down a little, or first land in the water, in order to be put in a position where I could kill them without first landing on the platforms.

	"mmbossman missed an opening in the roof where you could jump up to the next level a bit earlier, which saved some good time. Most of the saving comes from being more efficient with the boost damage on the two bosses though.

	"Normally I have to shoot once diagonally upwards when I land after a jump to avoid losing a bit of my speed (this is used throughout both mine and mmbossman's run, though I sometimes skip out on it because of lag), but I noticed that for some weird reason that is not true in this specific level. Due to this I was able to save some time by being allowed to jump a frame earlier without losing more speed, and there is also less lag since I don't shoot as much.

	"The big brownish enemies in this level where quite annoying, as it is pretty random when they will shoot (and to my knowledge this was not changeable in any non time-wasting way), that made me lose some time in a few placed, but gain some in others as well. Overall nothing was really changed up to the boss, but I still save a bunch of time by doing everything a little cleaner. The boss at the end is easily the most boring part of the run. I have to keep him of screen and basically move as little as possible to not cause massive lag, and he has a really long invincibility time. I think I saved over 200 frames on lag reduction on him though.

	"One of the most pathetic bosses in any game ever. I noticed that I could shoot every frame here by alternating A and B, it usually isn't possible but it was in this level. Because of this, as soon as he lands I can kill him before he has time to move again.

	"On the way down I did some of the jumps a bit differently, and I cut some corners better on the way down (which at a point made me need to shoot downwards to slow me down less times). A lot of the time saved comes from activating the 2nd of the 3 bosses faster. After I killed the first one the second does not activate until I reach its blueprint, so I made sure to be positioned as best as I could when the first one died.
