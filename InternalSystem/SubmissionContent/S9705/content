In fact, obtaining the 000000 points via roll-over of the score meets our definition for a "maximum score" run.  As "maximum score" is one of our acceptable Standard class goals, we can accept this run for that goal...for now.

While it is suspected that a run which used deaths in aiming for the point roll-over would be faster than this run, we cannot know for certain until such a run is actually made.  In such a case, that new run which utilized the deaths to save time in reaching the point rollover would usurp this submission as the fastest way to reach the maximum score/roll over upon beating the game.  That new run would then be more appropriate for the Standard class publication for "maximum score" as the fastest way of reaching the maximum score/rollover.
