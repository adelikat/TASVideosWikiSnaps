	" lets you jump into the air once per level/life. There are also multiple multiplayer modes, however this TAS will only focus on the one player story. The NES port's story mode cuts out some levels (down to 30 from 99), but gives each group of 5 a specific enemy and lets you choose which order you want to do the first five groups in. There's no real reason to change up the order so I just go left to right here. One last note: if both sides die at the same time (say, by bashing their heads together,) the game counts the level as a WIN for the human player, but they lose a life. Super awesome decision by the devs--I feel most games count ties as a LOSS for the human player. So, I show this off a couple times in the run, when it doesn't lose time.

	"On the last level, I planned to show off an OOB glitch--jumping a sliding vehicle into the top-right corner and bouncing out of the playing field is possible. If you go up, you'll wrap around to the bottom of the screen and hit the wall and die, but if you turn left or right while off-screen, you'll keep wrapping around in an area where walls can't be made. You can just keep running out there forever until the computer eventually boxes itself in and dies. Except somehow my movements spooked the A.I. so much it just rammed its own clones into their own walls over and over so quickly that I could barely make it to that corner in time! I extended the input a half-dozen frames longer than necessary to show my character going outside the playfield, at least.

	"If someone likes, they can create a 2-Player run of the story mode! 2P starts in the bottom right, and two CPU opponents start in the upper corners. This could possibly be even faster than 1P, since in 1P the top half of the board is empty and if the CPU runs up there, the level can run long. Not a problem if a 2P cuts the board in half! However, clone levels will probably have a ton of lag--a couple of levels in the 1P mode are bad enough to run at half-speed. Now that I've glanced at it, though, there's a chance 2P vs. CPU mode could be more entertaining and possibly faster.

	" of this game. Comparing the two, this submission pulls ahead early for each level set, either by small margins or by large amounts. The Nicovideo link doesn't have any input time but by noting when the victory fanfare plays this submission is roughly 14-15 seconds faster than the older TAS. The control of the opponent AI is overall better optimized in this submission so this beats all known records out there that I know of. Seeing how messy the computer opponent movements can be it seems like it'd take considerably more work to get faster victories without losing time later due to potentially worse AI patterns. Nice work!
