On Normal, Nightmare Mother at least gives you time by stopping while spinning, but on Xtreme, it never stops while spinning, so one slip-up while climbing the wall and you get hit for massive damage.

	"I started a test run soon after finishing a MMX4 test run. I preferred this run due to a mix of X and Zero action, as well as the strategy.

[div class=p 
	"Not obviously, the run uses option 2. To beat High Max in a secondary area, you need to first beat "Copy Zero" in a secondary area, so that High Max is there afterward. Then you need to beat a Maverick other than Shield Sheldon (note this can be interchanged with beating Copy Zero). Then go beat High Max with that weapon. High Max must be stunned (X-Buster, any of Zero's special swords), then damaged (X's special weapon except Guard Shell, any of Zero's special swords or Z-Saber or Z-Buster). Some weapons are only effective on High Max as X, not as Zero. Because of this process, reaching the fortress quickly is longer but more satisfying than in MMX5, where you reach the fortress through what seems like a cheap gimmick.

Once you reach the fortress, you find that it is impossible for X to do Gate Lab 1 without Blade or Shadow Armor, or Wolfang's weapon + Jumper part + 500 Nightmare Souls (souls are required to equip parts due to the level-up system). Fortunately, it is possible for Zero as is. Then Gate Lab 2, you fight High Max again. I found a trick that not only cuts down the battle time greatly, but makes it possible for Zero to beat the stage (since the weapon I got does not allow stunning High Max as Zero). X's route turns out to be faster, mainly because X has an acid rain part whereas Zero has a compactor part which goes very slowly.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Zero cannot be obtained until beating Copy Zero. Since Zero can SDC any Maverick boss except Infinity Mijinion and Blaze Heatnix, it is preferable to obtain Zero as soon as possible. This is achieved by going to Shield Sheldon's secondary area. Now since a boss must be defeated to defeat High Max, I considered beating Commander Yammark, as his weapon does damage easily, can be autowobbled for superfast damage (see 
	[em 
		"Programming errors abused
	]em
	") and supplements Zero perfectly (since Zero's normal weapons cause delay). Furthermore, his stage is short. Then I went to High Max at Infinity Mijinion's secondary area. I used X here, since he does charged damage against High Max (since SDC is ineffective against High Max) and the Illumina cables (minibosses) can be destroyed with charged Yammar Option. I had considered Commander Yammark's secondary area but X cannot reach it without help. Zero can but he doesn't have the weapons to damage High Max.

		" The goal in this TAS is not do to the stun/damage combo, but to get High Max to go berserk as fast as possible, which is achieved by destroying his barrier twice. This makes the battle go quickly, but High Max's berserk has "YOU MUST DIE" written all over it. If you don't know what you're doing and you make him go berserk, you won't win, period. Especially since Yammar Option is one of the worst weapons (for your health) to use against this form. Fortunately, I use TAS.

		" I believe the order of the capsules to be fastest. Blaze Heatnix and Infinity Mijinion (the first two I fight) cannot be SDCed. For Heatnix, I use triple third slash and Z-Buster. For Mijinion, I mostly use Z-Buster as hitting him with the saber causes him to be invinicible for a long time. All others fall by SDc. Occasionally I change up the SDC pattern a little, either because the boss is floating in mid-air, or the boss would hit me.

Air slash (not spinning from double jump) does 5 damage whereas spin air slash does 4. I had luck because the platform was in a good position. It is possible to Z-Buster him so the shot does continuous damage (4x5=20 damage) but it should only be done last and there wasn't a good way to do it. Also, the weird movement when he opened his mouth was to get the exploder target on the left side of the room so it doesn't hit Zero during the onslaught.
