	"Speed is a lot more complicated than in the Bonk's Adventure/Bonk 3 engine. There is a larger amount of speed values. Common caps are as follows:
	$LF

		" Normal walking: 384

	[li 
		" 1 or 2 meats but no invincibility: 512

[div class=p 
	"If you are above the speed cap for your current form, pressing the direction you are moving will push your speed down to it's proper cap. If one lets go of the dpad or does one of several other methods of maintaining speed, the cap will be ignored.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"These methods of maintaining speed include:
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		" Landing on the ground will keep your speed stable for a couple frames (pressing a horizontal direction one frame before landing allows you to keep it longer)
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Jumping will also prevent your speed from being modified until you actually start the jump. This can be combined with the above to allow for bunny hopping.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Attacking in the air will prevent your horizontal speed from being modified for the length of the animation. This means that if you need to slow down while hovering, one might need to do it either before starting or space out hover inputs.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[div class=p 
	"There's also some things that set your speed to a specific value:
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		" Landing on ice on your head causes you to start moving at 512. If one exits that state, they keep that speed and can go up to the usual 640 on ice.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Wall jumping sets your speed to 448. If one holds directions this can easily be overwritten by the usual caps but it's useful to take advantage of when no meats are available.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Jumping off a conveyor belt moving in the same direction as Bonk sets his speed to current + 256. With bunny hopping one can repeat this process to gain a theoretically unlimited amount of speed. Note that a conveyor belt moving in the opposite direction will reduce bonk's speed by 256, meaning you desperately need to avoid these.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[div class=p 
	"There's also a couple of unusual circumstances that allows one to gain speed at or above the cap up to a limited amount:
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		" Swimming while at 512 speed will allow one to go up to a max of 572 speed. If you go above that cap, your speed is forced back down to 320.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Powering down from 1 meat to no meat will cause one to accelerate. It was previously believed the max you could get out of this was 632, however I (Memory) found a way to get 636 speed from this at the end of Round 7. We did not go back and incorporate this.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[div class=p 
	"As I mentioned before starting to jump will keep your horizontal speed. This was known with bunny hopping. However, I discovered that it also keeps your vertical speed until you actually start jumping at which the normal jump speed applies. By hovering into a slope, one can clip into it. This leads to Bonk being given enough vertical speed to be ejected from the slope (how much depends on how embedded you are into it). By performing a bunny hop in this, this vertical speed is frozen during the "preparing to jump" animation. This can allow for extra height off jumps. I call this bunny ascension.

Select can also impact rng but it's not as consistent. Blocks have their drop determined by the RNG value 1 frame prior to it disappearing. Not all blocks give drops however.
