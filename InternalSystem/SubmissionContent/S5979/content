	"Chester Cheetah: Too Cool to Fool is a 1992 video game that starred Cheetos mascot Chester Cheetah, only released in North America. It was released for both the Super Nintendo, but also the Sega Genesis. The game is a side-scroller, with a couple of action sections thrown in.
	$LF
	"The story involves Chester Cheetah trying to get his bike back from the nasty Mean Eugene. He will have to go through various landscapes in order to collect all of the missing bike parts and get back to Hip City... and maybe eats some cheetos I dunno.
	$LF
	"The SNES version was used because it has better graphics, and it has Mode 7.

	"The bike parts are either hidden on the levels, or you go into an autoscroller and get the part that way. Yeah, it's a bit unfortunate the game has so many of these.
	$LF
	"There's different power ups, the running shoes being the only useful one. The other ones either make the screen dark, send you to a bonus level, or makes you invincible... BUT you're unable to move.

	"The game doesn't really begin until we get to the running shoes. Before that, a big roadroller rolls over you, either you get squashed and move on, or go down the manhole, which is slower.
	$LF
	"After obtaining the running shoes, you move about 4.5x faster than walking. Then you encounter Mean Eugene's dog whos inside a big machine. It goes away faster by going at the other side of the screen. The bike part in this level is under a manhole, so I have to go down there and slide my way through the small pipe maze. After I obtain the part I have to go back and finish the level.

	"To collect the part in this level, you need Chester's monkey friend to get the part for you at the end of the level. Before that, you have to find him, but before that you'll need to get the running shoes. You'll need the shoes to reach a swinging rope which is too out of reach with standard shoes. The ropes in this game are a little weird. Chester needs to be at the very center of the rope in order to climb them. In this level, the ropes on the trees have a strange property where you have to wait a bit in order to jump into a platform that's above it, otherwise the platform will zip you back and you'll have to climb that part again.

	"The laggiest level and also the most imfamous. It's very straightforward, except it has a lot of enemies I have to avoid in order to not die in this level. The worst part is the water. It instantly kills you and sends you back to an earlier section of the level if you don't land on the ground.
	$LF
	"After that I go into the first autoscroller in the game where you're in a boat and have to avoid a bunch of logs.

	"You're in the dark and you have to face a lot of bats. The small bats slow you down when they get attached to Chester. The more bats are attached to Chester, the slower he will go. I slow down so I can avoid one of them. The one I don't avoid and that's attached to me doesn't slow me down that much. This is because I jump while climbing a rope and I only slow down horizontally.
	$LF
	"After that Chester goes to a minecart section... I tried to make it entertaining. Finally, I face of against a boss on a train. You have to jump on his head multiple times so you can get the bike engine and beat the level.

	"After I go through the start I jump to the trampoline at the earliest frame to jump over it faster.
	$LF
	"Right after this, there's another autoscroller... The whole thing is nothing special up until I get the final hit on the final boss. To hit the boss, a bird has to drop a bomb on Mean Eugene's helicopter and hit him, you have to be near the bird in order for the bird to drop it though, so I take an intentional hit, adjust my position and end input early so I can both beat the boss AND obtain the keys to Chester's bike. If you don't collect the keys, you're unable to beat the level.

	"The audience reception wasn't very welcoming, and the reason is pretty obvious: plain game mechanics and lots of autoscrollers.
