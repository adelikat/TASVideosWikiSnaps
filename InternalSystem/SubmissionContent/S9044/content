	"Street Fighter was a 1987 arcade game from Capcom about going around the world and duking it out with various opponents to see who's the best. There were only two playable characters, Ryu and Ken who played the same, but many different opponents with their own fighting styles. While the version with the pressure sensitive buttons wasn't a big hit, the standard 6 button cabinet was a pretty decent hit.

	"Fighting Street was a 1988 PC Engine CD port developed by Hudson as part of the launch lineup. This has redbook audio remixes of the arcade original's music but is mostly the same game. There are a few mechanical changes here and there but generally plays the same.

If this action is another jump they can get hit by the DP again for big damage. While the second hit will have greater knockback this leaves the opponent at low enough health that another strong attack will finish them off.
