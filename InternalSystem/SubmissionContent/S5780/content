	"This game has almost no depth, and uses a grand total of three different types of input across the run: Left, Right, and A.
	$LF
	"A, B and C are all identical, and will always perform the same function: If Barney cannot interact with something, he will blow a kiss. If he can interact with an object, he will interact with it. If he can jump up to a platform, he will jump. Object interaction always takes place before a jump if both are possible simultaneously.

	"The only forms of optimisation possible in this game are lag reduction and ending inputs early, which I have done where possible. After initially believing it would not be possible to save time on the final stretch of the run, over 40 frames were saved, including releasing Left early and allowing Barney's momentum to carry him to the end of the stage.

	"All stages begin with Barney in the middle of the stage, and from there the player can freely choose to exit left or right. There are a myriad of objects to pick up and collect, but these invariably waste time in any%. The only object collected throughout the run is the final present in Stage 4, as it removes 8 lag frames and does not contribute to the run time as the extended end-of-level screen takes place after the final input.
