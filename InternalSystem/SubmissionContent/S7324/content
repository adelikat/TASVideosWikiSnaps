	"Cameltry(On the Ball in US/EU) is a labyrinth game where you tilt a maze to navigate a marble to the goal. This is an arcade port, although there are some pretty significant changes to how the game plays, such as 70 extra mazes, as well as more significant speed up and the ability to tilt the maze much faster. The last goal is hit in 36:21.403, which is 18:24 faster than wr, although some of the courses are quit out of earlier, so accounting for that this run is probably about 16 minutes faster than the RTA all worlds WR. This improvement mainly comes from being able to optimize moving the maze as quickly as possible and avoiding hitting walls while doing it, which is unfeasible to do RTA.
