	"Hmm. This run plays the same route as Bisqwit did, but 
	$LF
	"slightly faster. I suppose it could be faster but it´s 
	$LF
	"really hard to judge wether it´s better to kill 2 more 
	$LF
	"robots wasting another 10 seconds or just go straight to 
	$LF
	"Ligar (hardest boss EVER I tell ya!) and fight him for 10 
	$LF
	"more seconds. Ah well. It´s 9 seconds faster and that´s 
	$LF
	"the best I could do right now after trying several tactics 
	$LF
	"all over the game.
