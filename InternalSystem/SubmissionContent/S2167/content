	"As with the most which games I end up tasing, I had no plans to TAS this from beginning. I did have good memories from my childhood of this game so I thought I could just play through some levels for old time sake, and being a taser also made me try tasing the first level just to see what I could do. I then somehow immediately found a way to accelerate faster from the start of the level. I compared this to the run of this site and saw that it didn't use that trick. And since I understood that it could be used to gain time in almost every level it motivated me to start the run. In the end, I have beaten the previous run by Guybrush by 3482 frames or about 58 seconds.

Values above 96 and below 160 can only be gotten by gaining speed from slopes or performing the acceleration trick explained below. When having a speed higher than 96 you can keep it by jumping and when touching the ground it decreases 3 values every frame, this is why this run has so much jumping included:)

	"Normally when you start with zero speed, as in the beginning of a level, your speed increases with contant values up until the speed 64 is reached, then it stops increasing for some time before starting again, stopping again at 80 before it increases to 96. The "Acceleration trick" makes the speed increase up to it's maximum without these stops. Perform it by jumping at the first frame that you can control the player for best effect.

	"Due to the quite slow control of the player, for example when changing direction, this game is rather hard to optimize. By deeping studying in the game's physics this run has quite alot better precision than the previous. And having around 12 times the rerecord count of the previous one it's quite expected to be better optimized huh? :)
