I was very keen to TAS the game but encountered some oddities with movement that I couldn't figure out, which put me off it for a while. Eventually I started TASing individual levels again and then put this together.

	"I started this TAS back in April 2022, but it's finally complete now. Halfway through making this TAS, Randomno discovered the mashing technique. This meant many of the stages I completed needed to be TASed again with this new technique. Fortunately, it was very easy to replace the input from a stage with a new version. There were no desyncs we had to worry about, including across different libTAS and ruffle versions. I'm very glad that Randomno was able to finish the TAS I started.
