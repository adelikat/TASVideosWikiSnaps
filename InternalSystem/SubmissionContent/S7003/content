	"Unfortunately while the discovery of using high-speed hero in this room was a neat discovery, it is currently not panning out. In order to actually make it to the right side of the screen the Hero has to "RUN". Leaving high-speed hero on through the wrap around will dump the hero into the pit unless there is a keyboard input in the buffer to interrupt it. Turning off high-speed hero will work and leave the hero in the normal expected location. Typing "PULL" will let the hero pull the chain and then miraculously appear on the platform below him (unfortunately not near the door). I tried some keyboard and mouse inputs to see if I could make the hero clip to the final door but was unable to find anything that would work. The best outcome I could get with this trick looked something like this:

[div class=p 
	"C-Square noted in his previous submission that despite the improvement of 1.8 seconds, Elsa took 0.8 seconds longer to hop the desk. She seems to be on some sort of frame rule that is anywhere from 0.95 to 1.05 seconds. With the changes I have made above (including removing the TAS name), Elsa's room finishes drawing about 514ms faster than the published TAS and her animation to jump over the desk begins about 956 ms sooner. Out of curiosity I experimented with delaying the final click to "open" the door to her room:
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		" 0-92 ms delay - animation begins at 41892ms
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 93-1042 ms delay - animation begins at 42834ms (currently published TAS)
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 1043-2092 ms delay - animation begins at 43833ms
		$LF

	[li 
		" 2093-3092 ms delay - animation begins at 44831ms
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 3093+ ms delay - animation begins at 45887ms
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[div class=p 
	"The improvements in the cafeteria were not enough to make this frame rule. In order to make it, the TAS name entry also needed to be removed. With the frame rule varying between 950-1050 milliseconds, it is highly likely that the next one would require another 900 milliseconds or so to be saved. The alternate movement I came up with in Yorick's room by itself is not faster because of the need to WALK again, but WALKing in Elsa's room would take about 600 milliseconds (very rough estimate) to type and enter. Thus if the alternate movement above is the difference between making a frame rule and not making it, it's worth doing (also worth it for entertainment purposes if you happen to be on the lower end of a frame rule).
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"This submission was mainly to familiarize myself with the workings of JPC-rr and Hero's Quest and to make sure recent findings were reflected in the TAS. A big thanks to c-square for their work on previous submissions, all I have done is to make some minor changes to the already-existing file. And big thanks to Mr. Miller for his discoveries that I tried to add. Mr. Miller also discovered a few things in Quest for Glory 2 that should be easier to add with less learning curve.
