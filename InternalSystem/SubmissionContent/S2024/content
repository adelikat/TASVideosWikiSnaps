	"Uchuu no Kishi Tekkaman Blade is a game about the severely crippled ninja Alf who broke his legs somewhere around frame 6787 of Batman Begins. Basically Alf broke his left leg so badly that he was deemed never to be able to dash again. Of course this was too much for Alf to take and he started to look for happiness in the bottom of bottles, which only tore him down even more, until he one day dragged himself to watch a game of curling as part of a bet to get more beer, and as he saw how the players were sliding, and he thought to himself, " :o Maybe I can do that!" and he left the incredibly boring match (Are there any other kinds of matches in curling?) and started sliding home on his knee!
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"However as he was sliding, he suddenly reached the end of a bridge, and fell off, and as he was falling towards the water, Alf used his belt to grapple a nearby pole and swung away, from the dangerous water. Alf was now a ready ninja with alternative ways of moving. It was time to kick ass and chew spaghetti, and this dude is all out of pasta.

	"The fastest way of moving in Uchuu no Kishi Tekkaman Blade is to use a grapple jump over a long distance (Which only works where it's a good distance to the ceiling), the second fastest way is to slide by pressing B before Alf lands after a jump, or pressing B 2 frames before an earlier slide is finished. The third fastest way is to jump, and the slowest way is walking, due to the broken leg.

	"After the bosses, I walk away from them and just wait next to the wall without doing too much, and that has a reason. This game lags like Crysis on a PII especially when bosses are dying, so that's the reason.

	"The Space Station is a place with moving floors and stupid escalators, so stupid that jumping is faster than sliding to get past them. Here, wild cyborg animals are roaming free, including huuuge hug-monkeys (That's monkeys that hugs). Alf rejects their love and eventually faces the cyborg animal in charge, Batmeister, a former bat who likes to bite.

Alf however shows that he is the only real man around and defeats Ick before he get to use his staff, and the world is saved once again! ...not that it ever was in danger but at least this makes Alf feel good.
