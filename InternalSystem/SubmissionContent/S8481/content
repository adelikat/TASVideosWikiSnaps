	"I had some trouble finding glitch information for this game. There doesn't seem to be any English information whatsoever, which doesn't surprise me given the SFC version was never localized, so I had to look for Japanese information and machine translate it, and even that took me some time. What I'm seeing though is that there aren't many glitches at all in DQ6, and that the ones that are there aren't really worth using for one reason or another.

		"I managed to find this page detailing the bugs allowed in RTA
	]a
	", which lists 3 battle-related bugs that I don't think would matter too much under TAS conditions and a warp bug that the page describes as having "not much benefit". Again, I machine translated the page and it's the only thing I found detailing SFC DQ6 bugs, so I could be wrong about this, but I'm going to say that the "glitchless" label isn't really necessary here. It can be revisited if a glitched run is submitted. I've changed the branch to "best ending" both to reflect this and to be more in line with our naming standards.

	"Outside of that, this is quite clearly a masterclass in manipulation. Given the requirements for the best ending, the fact that this TAS is almost hour faster than 
	[a href=https://www.speedrun.com/dq6 rel=noopener external nofollow 
		"the RTA any% WR
	]a
	" is astonishing due to all the extra grinding needed for the best ending. The run is, indeed, a lot of grinding, but there's something quite fascinating about the extreme efficiency of all of it.
