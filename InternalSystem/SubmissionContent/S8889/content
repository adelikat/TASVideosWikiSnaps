				" I used GuitarPro to figure out how long my frames are in terms of GP notes, then I made it 6/4 to get the tempo I wanted from those minimal note durations, then I created a catchy beat... and then it didn't fit into the game at all.

				" The "kick" sound is fine, I can hit that button every other frame. But the voices imitating snare only launch on 4th or 5th frame after you poke the guy, and my 16th note kick pattern failed to properly fit in among those pokes that were made well in advance. It made the beat sound skewed and bad, so I had to remove the neat stuff.
