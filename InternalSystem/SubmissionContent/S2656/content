		"published run

	" from 2006. This was another of my old favorite games, and it seems I was still in the mood for some heavy luck manipulation, so I decided to see what I could do ...

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Most of the improvement came from the battles (now twice as fast), largely from better luck manipulation but also better strategies and route planning (sometimes at the cost of more walking or other delays, but always regained), and doing less inn trips.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"For how linear this game is, there's quite a bit of route planning (who to get, weapons, etc.) ... I've redone fairly large parts more than once, and kept finding new improvements.

[p 
	"When canceling the first character's command, a table index underflow (for TP used) clears a byte in the "character status" table. Guo Ji (from Xu Rong's battle, before Dong Zhuo 1) just happens to belong to that byte, so he's completely removed from the game!
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"An unexpected (but also minor) one came up near the end, when the game skipped the HP increase text on level up. I have no clue how it happened, but it did save a few more seconds (and looks funny) ...

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The random number is 4 bytes (32bit), and changes in 2 ways:
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" Simple randomizer function (bit shift and additions), called every frame (except lag) and in a few cases where a random value is needed
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Add one of the bytes to another and use that as random, in many cases (but not all) where a random value is needed
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"That second one alone adds a lot of complexity, as it changes the random value sequence and depends on timing. For example, it's called after every step where a random battle can happen, so different step delays before a battle (or anything) will each give completely different results.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"During All-Out in battle, I can only manipulate whole turns at once, by introducing delays between each (and canceling/restarting All-Out, which however takes time). Because of this, and the endless possibilities, there's no way I'll get perfect luck or even optimal manipulation ... but I still make most of the game seem much easier than it really is.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I've looked through the game code for everything that happens during All-Out (attacks, tactics, formulas, etc.), and simulated all of it in C so I could bruteforce through lots of delay combinations (up to 1 billion per hour!) and pick the best one I find. Depending on the battle, this ranged from near instant to a whole day ... and that's from a single starting point. I still had to do the rest manually (try different step delays and such, bruteforce All-Out for each), so there's still quite a bit of potential improvement left. But that's easier said than done ...
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I've also done the same for random encounters, mostly for manipulating (and optimizing) the few specific encounters I need. Han Zhong, Wen Hun and Zhou Yu each came almost instantly with minimal rebel forces, and each was done multiple times to pick the best All-Out manipulation as well. Then the more extreme case, Lu Sun and Tai Si Ci by themselves (and in this order), is about a 1/20000 chance, and was limited to a very small area at 1/32 encounter rate ... but it still only cost half a second to manipulate!
