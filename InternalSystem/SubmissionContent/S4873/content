	"After having read a book about mermaids Barbie falls asleep thinking about the busy day to come: Going to the mall to pick up a new outfit, Lunch at the soda shop, swimming at the beach, and meeting Ken at the party. In this game you lead Barbie through her busy day, collecting pieces of her enchanted ball gown ensemble along the way, in an attempt to make her dreams come true. Collect them all and she is off to the Fantasy Ball with Ken!

	" About the game:
	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"The mechanics are pretty straight forward, Barbie can walk left and right, jump (A), or throw a charm (B). You can choose between the available charms with the select button. Pressing down in some places may reveal secrets (mostly health drops, but also secret areas). There are also a few water levels where you are a mermaid, in these levels you can move around with the dpad and mash A to go faster. You begin with 5 Z's (health) and have a max of 9, if this runs out Barbie will wake up and you'll need to continue.

	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"I was inspired to create this run after watching twitch user KyhYang (RTA WR holder) do speedruns. I was surprised that there was not a TAS already and decided to make one (both so that there will be a published run and in hopes that the strategies employed would be useful for the RTA run).

[ol

		" jump over the triggers for boss fights. Normally you get frozen in place while the screen scrolls and locks into the fight (also triggering the action), but you must be on the floor for it to trigger. Additionally if you make your next jump frame perfect it still doesn't recognize that you're on the ground. In two of the boss fights (fountains and ice cream) avoiding the trigger and scrolling too far yourself results in a soft lock!
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" On the topic of frame perfect jumping the jukebox level has raised platforms over a moving walkway that sweeps you back to the beginning of the level. In the TAS we can exploit the fact that the physics engine doesn't really recognize that you're on the ground until the second frame and just frame perfect jump our way across.
