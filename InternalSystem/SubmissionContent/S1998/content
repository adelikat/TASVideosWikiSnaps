	"Rockman & Forte is the Japanese version of a game that was, before it was released on GBA as Mega Man & Bass, not distributed in North America. As such, most of the game is in Japanese. The Robot Masters' names are in English (or Latin alphabet, depending on your POV). The item names are in largely decipherable katakana, but, since I don't understand their descriptions, I had help from
