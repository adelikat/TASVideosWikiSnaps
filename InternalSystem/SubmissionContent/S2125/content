	"TAS of Megaman 4 (Rockman World 4) for the Gameboy from 1993. Bag of Magic Food started this run back in 2006 but stopped progress. So more than half and a year later I decided this game deserves a finished speedrun. So with BOMF's permission I continued.

	"Every Gameboy Megaman game adds a 9th boss. In Megaman 4 it is Ballade. And, as in every Gameboy game, the weapon of the 9th boss is the only (good) way to beat Dr. Wily's forms. This game futures cool cutscenes. And, for me, it has the best soundtrack of every Megaman game there is, and I played them all. It's just so classic.

	" Comments

]h3
[p 
	"The run starts with Pharaoh Man. BOMF did this because using Bright Mans weapon versus him is pure time waste. Pharaoh shot is incredibly valuable in all stages, especially in the first 4 and the Wily Fortress Defender Machine. The route after Pharaoh Man is obvious: Ring -> Toad -> Bright.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"As every 9th Gameboy boss Ballade has no weakness.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"After beating Ballade v1 it gets more tricky, because weapon energy isn't refilled automatically between stages. So one has to plan ahead and manipulate more energy refills from enemies at certain places.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The second route starts with Charge Man, because you get Rush Jet after beating him. Crystal Man is done afterwards using Ring Boomerang on him, as Charge Kick is slower. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"On Napalm Man's level the authors switch, after the collection of the Wily Letter in the stage to be exact.
	$LF
	"Ballade v2 is difficult, because he produces lag with the Crackers and leaves small Crackers on the ground when jumping anytime. So this makes maneuvering harder.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Space Station Defender bites the dust thanks to the almighty Pharaoh Shot (and BOMF's tip).
	$LF

[p 
	"The Hunters (eye thingies) fall pretty quick to Napalm Bomb.

	"Wily's forms get owned insanely quick. I actually feared the game would glitch somewhere, because it was that fast :)
