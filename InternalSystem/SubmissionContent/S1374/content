	"This game is a crappy NES platformer about a purple alien shape-shifter named Widget who wishes he was Mega Man. He's on a mission to destroy all the evil villains responsible for kidnapping animals and polluting the rainforest and stuff. Fortunately for him, he has the power to completely ignore the laws of physics. This is an improvement of 43 seconds over the previous (unpublished but accepted) run.
