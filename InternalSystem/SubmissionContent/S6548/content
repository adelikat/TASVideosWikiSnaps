	"LEGO Bionicle (subtitled in some places as Tales of the Tohunga or later as Quest for the Toa) was a game taking place in the universe of the Bionicle, a brand of LEGO toys with an accompanying storyline. It was released during the brand's first year and takes place directly prior to the first story arch. You play as Takua, a Tohunga (later renamed to Matoran) villager, and you go around to the 6 areas of the island of Mata Nui and rescue the 6 Turaga (village elders) and reclaim the 6 Toa Stones. I don't actually rescue all 6 Turaga or reclaim all 6 Toa Stones because this game is incredibly broken.

		" RNG manipulation: I found the RNG address for this game finally and that allows me to save a lot of time due to screen transitions. When you transition between areas, the game selects from two different animations to transition to the next screen. The fade to black transition is approximately 30 frames faster than the pixelated screen transition. I manipulate that when possible. The RNG address only increments when it is called, an easy way to advance it is to talk to NPCs with randomized dialogue boxes since entering and exiting a conversation only takes 5 frames.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" You can cancel the period of time you lose control over the character after certain text boxes by pressing A prior to triggering the text box. I only found out how to apply this more widely towards the end of the TAS so this is not used for much of the TAS. The game is not particularly sync friendly meaning I would have to essentially redo much of the TAS to incorporate it.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Lavaboard speed abuse: The lavaboard item uses separate speed addresses from normal. These addresses are only set to specific values under a few condition. Landing on the lavaboard on the ground will set all lavaboard speed values to 0. Jumping on or off the lavaboard will set the lavaboard speed for whatever directions you're facing. Therefore if you jump off the lavaboard speed facing up or down, your x speed gets maintained and will be used again if you jump on the lavaboard while facing up/or down.
