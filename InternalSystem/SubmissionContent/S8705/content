[div class=p 
	"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2: Battle Nexus is a Stealth Action Platformer for the Gameboy Advance released in Autumn of 2004. It differs significantly in many respects from its console and PC ports. The player collects the Turtles' weapons on each stage and features massively different levels, enemies, and bosses. Occasional hoverboarding and 'Shump' stages break up the action. The video game has the Turtle(s) going through 3 worlds across 6 levels each, totaling 18 levels.

Well, I tested both grabbing and not grabbing gems, and the outcome is that grabbing the gems on the levels that are not hoverboarding levels turned out to be quicker because the game expects you to at least collect the reward it drops for defeating the bosses. The total amount of time takes forever to finish IF you don't collect the gems this way, but sometimes it's not faster, so I had to manually test each of the outcomes to get a better result.

I grab Leo's Katana Swords in this room, which are located up in the corner on the right side. I have to avoid the laser beams coming through the floor, so I have been extra quick. Luckily by being in a ducked state which happens when you are in a small space, I can avoid knock-back from the laser beams, and take damage. When exiting the room, I'll need to kill the guard that's holding a keycard after a small space slide. The last room I can rush while being seen.

	"•Stealth is the name of the game, but I'll need to wait out the cycle for the motion sensor moving back and forth so I just stand in place (no the movie didn't desync I am literally just standing there). The first room requires stealth, so I'll have to hide in the little door alcoves and exit on the first frame possible. In the second room I climb the pole while also getting "caught" by the sensor, I need to jump over the guard since sliding past won't work. Once above, I'll grab the Twin Sai's and head right. I use the wall cling ability in order to skip having to climb the pole which ended up being much faster. I'll make my way across and up to the door on the far left. In here I'll get a keycard from a guard and exit. This keycard goes to the red door seen earlier. When backtracking to get the keycard door I get caught once again, and I have to kill the guards here otherwise the door does not and will not allow me to go through. I tested if it was faster to kill them or to wait and killing them was faster, and this same thing applies in the next room.

I let the boss hit me, since I want to be on the same side at all times because I found out that by moving in certain directions only after the 1st cycle is finished does the spot change, so I had to test where the boss would be, and turned out that standing and getting hit was the play. I'll finish off the boss and I'll have to avoid the grab move it does and attack again on the next possible frame. I'll collect 20/20 gems here as it's faster.

	"•By selecting Don, I can utilize the higher jump here. The first room has a bigger enemy that would take longer to defeat, and getting the path of it would make it so I'd get grabbed, however I'll avoid this by jumping at a precise time so that the enemy will use the wipe as priority first to which I'll barely avoid. I'll go into some alcoves, climb up some poles and eventually end up getting Don's Bo-Staff. In the next room I'll need to wait for a platform cycle to go from left to right back to left, so in the meantime I'll play with my food and teabag the enemy on the ground while waiting, a nice little treat. I'll have to wait so the outcome of the platform cycle is barely close enough to ledge grab. Ledges are different in that, the one seen on 1-1 and here are ones that won't make sense to quick jump with since the ceiling is lower. By using Don's Bo-Staff I can pogo high jump to a ledge to avoid any unrequired rooms. In the next room there are sphere-like bounce pads that will spring you upwards. I can mitigate the time it takes to bounce high up and fall back down to the bounce pad by swinging the Bo-Staff with B, I'll use this method for future platforms of the like. I'll make my way up to the door and defeat the bigger enemy here holding the keycard so the platform can lower.

Once down, I'll need to avoid the spike ceiling otherwise I'll take knockback damage which would be slower. I'll slide/jump over the gaps and to the other side collecting the Twin Sai's and wall clinging upwards. In the next room I'll also wall cling upwards. More of the bounce pads, so I'll take advantage of the sideways bounce which tosses me further to the side decreasing the distance between me and the ledge grab. Another spike room, except this time I'll play with the spikes and make it to the lower part right before I would have taken damage. This room can be done in 1 cycle despite having two little floor alcoves. I'll defeat the enemy for the keycard to lower the platform.

I'll attack the bigger enemy in the next room otherwise I won't be able to go inside of the alcove, I tested whether or not I could sneak my way past, but it turned out to not be possible. I'll have to deactivate the glowing green buttons in order to bypass the blockade, I'll do the same all the while ducking in the electrical flooring (as mentioned before I can be in a ducking state which won't put me in knock-back. I'll grab the Twin Sai's after climbing the alcove and make my way to the enemy on the far left of the room on ground level for a keycard. These enemies require 3 hits instead of the usual 2 as seen previously as they are much stronger. I'll had back and defeat the enemy seen previously after getting the Twin Sai's. I'll need to defeat the enemy here in order to make it past otherwise I'll grabbed. Once outside on the other side, I'll head right and through a stampede room, although the stampede won't reach me in time thankfully, due to timing the slides correctly. I'll defeat the enemy on this next screen here otherwise the door will not open. Once in, I'll do a sideways swipe with RR_RR+B to put the bigger enemy in a stun position to go into the alcove.
