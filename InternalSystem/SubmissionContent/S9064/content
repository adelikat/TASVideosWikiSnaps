		"Hunt the Wumpus
	]em
	" is a 1973 text-based game developed by Gregory Yob and published by the People's Computer Company. Armed with a bow and five "crooked arrows", your goal is to hunt a wumpus that's hiding in a cave system arranged as vertices of a dodecahedron, while avoiding bottomless pits and super bats. It became influential in the days of terminal computing, introduced concepts that defined the adventure genre, and received ports for the TI-99/4A, BSD and Linux, to name a few. This port to the ZX Spectrum was made by Wilko Schroter and released in 2006.
