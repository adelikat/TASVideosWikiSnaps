Even though beating the Cub mode does give the credits, all the viewers agree that this 9-level game doesn't feel completed if one just reduces the challenge to make things easiest, and only beats less than a half of the game. This is the case when the easier difficulty setting isn't justified, so for any future submission of this game some other difficulty should be picked, to show the entire game. Judging by the
