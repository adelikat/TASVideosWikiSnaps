	"The goal of this run was to beat the previous run by at least 2 seconds (60 frames). Thanks to a series of improvements I found, this was more than possible, and I actually managed to save more than 4 seconds in the process, which I never expected would happen initially. The exact number of frames saved over the previous run is 133, which is 4.43 seconds.

It was quite a good experience, since it's the first full run I've done on my own, but overall, I preferred coauthoring this game over doing it myself.

	"The first timesaver I found, as I mentioned above, was in the lobby. This was done by BLJing on the opposite set of stairs from what one would normally BLJ on (the ones outside Bob-omb Battlefield). After doing a series of quick BLJs, I did one large BLJ, then managed to fit in another quick BLJ before shooting off. When Mario left the stairs, I guided him into the porch, and managed to get him merged in the vertex, so he could turn around enough to make it to the stairs in the center of the room. If he hadn't gotten merged with the vertex, he wouldn't have been able to turn around enough to make it onto the stairs. I tested this extensively. I also tested doing something similar on the JRB stairs, which proved to be several frames slower. This new strategy saved 50 frames over the previous strategy, which is just over 1.5 seconds.

[div class=p 
	"However, I then started thinking about beginning the BLJ from further away from the wall, just in case I'd be able to fit more BLJs in on the step, potentially preventing the need for that "slow" BLJ. I also thoroughly experimented with which step to BLJ on, and the second from the bottom turned out to be the fastest. After many hours of tedious experimentation, I finally got it to work, and this saved an additional 28 frames (just under 1 second), bringing the total number of frames saved at this stage up to 77, which is just over 2.5 seconds.

	"The next timesaver I found was something which, after I did it, I was surprised that me and AKA hadn't done it in the last run. In Bowser in the Dark World, rather than killing some of the speed after BLJing by doing a normal jump, I kept Mario at full speed, and just took a slightly different path, utilising diving rather than jump kicking. This saved 28 frames, which is just under 1 second.

	"However, after redoing the section before BitDW, I decided to redo BitDW too, because I felt I could've made it more entertaining. So I did, and also managed to save another 4 frames, which brought the total number of frames saved in BitDW to 32, which is just over 1 second.

	"As for the first Bowser battle, I found that if I manipulated him to swing at Mario right after the battle started, I was able to grab his tail 2 frames earlier than the normal method, but sadly, this put Mario too far away from the bomb for it to ultimately save any time. So I just did the traditional method, as it is still the fastest.

	"After BitDW, I tested a lot of different move combinations, and concluded that a jump kick followed by a long jump was the fastest. It got Mario into the correct position for doing the BLJ quicker than any other combination of moves. This meant I was able to start BLJing earlier than in the previous run. 6 frames were saved in this section.

	"As for the basement, no frames were gained here. I tried for days to eliminate the need for the "slow" BLJ outside the 30 star door, but it just wasn't happening. The reason for this is that, if I did do another BLJ on the stairs, although I was actually able to do it, it was only possible through obscure analogue movements, which effectively zeroed Mario's speed anyway. And as was the case in the last run, a very precise speed was needed to bypass DDD, and I wouldn't have maintained that speed all the way from the stairs to the entrance to DDD, even if I had somehow accumulated it on the stairs. The buttslam is also still required, because it's  the only move which cancels his speed suddenly enough for him to fall into the level. If you dive, he just shoots to the back of the area. So all I did differently here was change the camera angles while Mario was falling into BitFS.

	"AKA suggested trying a series of dives at the start of the level, similar to what was done outside the castle. I tried this, and sadly, it ended up being slower than the traditional method, so I went with that. No frames were gained on the first tier of the level, but 4 were gained on the second tier and moving platform area, thanks to a new combination of moves, and curving Mario around the moving platforms, rather than doing a jump dive. (also suggested by AKA) At the end of BitFS, I did a slide kick into the lava, instead of the traditional jump dive. mr_roberts_z came up with this strat, and it saved 2 frames.

	"In the room with the Endless Stairs, 5 frames were saved. This was thanks to not LJing onto the stairs, but rather doing a jump kick, because it put me within reach of performing the BLJ much quicker than the LJ did. This saved 10 frames on starting the BLJ, but in the end, only 5 were actually saved, since Mario was closer to the bottom of the stairs when he began BLJing, so he had more distance to travel before reaching BitS.

I did manage to get to the lifts at the end 3 frames quicker, but this gain meant that the lifts were in a bad position, and ultimately cost way more time than it saved. So I just did what was done in the previous run. As for the stuff after the lifts, it too was optimal. I tried some new strats, like stutter jumping after the second LJ, but that proved to be really slow. I used a slightly different strat right before entering the pipe, but it didn't save, or cost any time. I just did it because it looked cooler.
