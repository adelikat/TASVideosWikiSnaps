	"-This movie was made in my spare time, it took about 8 hours to complete, and I would try to make a better speed run soon, after making this movie I watched Phil's and Genisto's Contra III speed run, it was very fast and full of action, and unfortunately in the making of my movie I couldn't Dual Fire my weapons, because the hardware limit on my keyboard. This game was also played in 1 Player mode on the hardest difficulty. I hope someone will approve of it; this is also my first submission.
