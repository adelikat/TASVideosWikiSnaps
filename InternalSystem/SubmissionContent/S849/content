	"Well, what can I say about this movie? First of all, the planning to a lot more time than the execution itself for this movie, and I mean a lot. Of course, the rooms get harder and harder, so the last levels, especially the Castle levels, took quite some planning to do. This run was really fun to do, and I hope you think it's as fun watching!

	"Of course, I tried to do every room as fast as possible, but since this is my first run on this game, it's possible that I've missed a thing or two. If you find anything, please let me know, it's likely that I will do another version if there are lots of stuff that can be done faster.
