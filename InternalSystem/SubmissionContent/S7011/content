	"When I first played this game years ago, it seems like the kind of game which should be easy to break. I'm very satisfied that it happened, though it wasn't discovered by me. It seems that a few days ago, folks in the RTA community discovered a use for an OOB glitch which was languishing in obscurity. The ability to OOB using frame buffering was discovered sometime in 2014, before the current published TAS (though it seems no one here knew about it). However, this run uses an RTA trick that abuses incorrect collision on one corner of the map.

However, because you are still in the tutorial, the next "cutscene" hasn't been set yet, and is still initialized to the ending credits (thanks for the clarification on this from StarrlightSims). Thus, this is a Wrong Warp glitch.
