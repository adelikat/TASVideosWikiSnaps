	": The cite can not currently support submissions this big. A few things would need to be rebuilt first, and that's a distant future plan. I guess nobody expected submissions to ever become so enormously gigantic, tho that doesn't mean there's anything wrong with that conceptually. The only reason we can't publish this thing (that I actually liked) is pure technicality, and even that is temporary. Once such support is built, this will be judged and most likely accepted. Canceling until then.
