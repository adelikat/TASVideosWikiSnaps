	"Anti-Idle: The Game is an idle game created by Tukkun and playable exclusively on Kongregate, first released in 2009. The game follows standard idle game rules but also incorporates several elements from other types of games into one game. This run is an IL run of the Typing feature, aiming for the fastest completion.
