	"Mega Man: The Wily Wars, also known as Rockman Megaworld, is a Genesis remake of the first three NES Mega Man games by the developers that made most of the Game Boy Mega Man games. The loose premise is that Dr. Wily has gone back in time to stop Mega Man in the past, and Dr. Light has sent Mega Man back in time to stop Wily yet again. This doesn't mean that Mega Man gets to slide in Mega Man 1 or 2. After all three games are finished the Wily Tower challenge is opened where Mega Man faces Wily's newest gauntlet reusing the assets of the other games but introducing new bosses. This collection known for being slower compared to the NES versions in both terms of gameplay pace and the amount of lag present in many places.

	"I was watching a steamer known as Smight, who was doing a 45 game Mega Man damage shuffler. He ran into the problem of the version of Wily Wars he was using didn't have working saves and thus didn't have access to the Wily Tower. When helping out a bit on the tech side it did get me interested in seeing what a full TAS of the entire set of games would be like. I was also reminded of jc564's fantastic Wily Tower run but thought it was a shame that so much of the interesting level design gets skipped over using zips that weren't really documented here. That's where I got an idea that took too long to commit to: how fast would each part of the game be beaten without zipping and going out of bounds? It certainly helped that there were some previous times that I could compare and compete against.

Doing this can lose some horizontal distance but can also mean sliding can be done slightly earlier than not clipping. As such this is avoided in Mega Man 1 & 2 for long horizontal stretches and used when possible in Mega Man 3 and Wily Tower if it means getting a slide earlier. This is also abused to "wall jump" off the crash bomber walls in Heat Man's stage since technically Mega Man is jumping off the floor next to them.

	"Pausing has some useful effects for both casual and speed play. When unpausing, the initial vertical velocity is set to 0 regardless of how high it was before pausing. Pausing also cancels out Mega Man's hit stun when he gets damaged, which is faster or slower depending on multiple circumstances. In general pausing when getting hit is helpful for having as many i-frames to get past subsequent obstacles, stopping Mega Man from being knocked back into less favorable positions, and/or having a convenient spot to also swap weapons. Otherwise regular damage boosting or not boosting at all ends up faster. Just a small note: getting hit while sliding does not allow pausing so anytime I do need to pause out of a slide I do a small jump the frame before getting hit.

Shooting out hard knuckle the frame that Mega Man touches the boss doors causes him to retain player control. This has multiple time saving properties. Mega Man can enter the next screen sooner, no longer has to wait on the door closing animation, and for certain bosses allows for attacking the boss way earlier before they're ready. The main downside is that pausing is usually disabled and thus only hard knuckle can be used, thus limiting the uses for this glitch. The early boss attacking can still be done with other weapons but it requires zipping into the room to bypass the door.

	"The stage itself is not that notable in differences from the NES version. The Yellow Devil fight, however, is a real lagfest. The game lags like crazy, especially if Mega Man is airborne. It is possible to do double hits so it only takes 4 cycles. I do intentionally get hit before going in for the shots since I want to get thunder beam off screen as soon as possible for lag reasons. Since the door on the left isn't there anymore, likely for lag reasons, I do stand there for two of the cycles to keep lag to an absolute minimum. Moving too far left, however, also causes large amounts of lag since Mega Man being partially off screen there apparently causes problems.

This boss fight took a long while for me to figure out most of it. I get the gist of how jc564 got the quick hits on the first phase of the Wily Machine. Each buster shot after the first one hits at the very tail end of the invincibility period of the previous shot, with the first one having the standard 45 frames the rest having 8 frames. The problem is that at the fastest Mega Man shoots every 9 frames. Mega Man has to both keep a rhythm of shots that hit the weak point as well as keep moving in such that every bullet hits that sweet spot frame when it contacts the hitbox. The problem I ended up having is that I couldn't get  it done buster only before the second cycle started and the first phase only despawns at the end of a cycle. My workaround was using spark shots for the last two hits, which has a double time loss due to entering the menu twice more than the other run. This at least means I don't have to wait on a very long second cycle. The second phase also has this property but fire storm both doing more damage and having more convenient methods of getting hits in makes it less of a pain to do. While bunny hopping and shooting thunder beam at the third phase is possible, the lag frames means that doing so is slower. Instead I wait for when Wily is at the nadir of his movement to have two parts of a thunder beam shot get removed from the screen, which cuts down on lag a little bit.
