	"This has a couple tricks the original did not. Namely :
	$LF
	"1) L and R to switch weapons without needing to go into the start menu.
	$LF
	"2) Getting hit by Bubbleman instead of dodging is slightly faster.
	$LF
	"3) Avoiding shooting some destroyable shots by some enemy bosses.  On some bosses it makes no difference on others it does.  Also RNG dependent so not really seen that much.
	$LF
	"4) Keeping some Magnetman power for the last boss. The tradeoff is while Hardman takes longer, the last boss then takes less time. Last boss has lots of invincibility and Magnetman can be used on it to freeze it in place for a short while then to immediately switch back to the rapid fire normal shot. Then repeat that when possible.

	"The game is mostly an interactive movie where the game wants you to select several options to choose a path.  However, ultimately they lead to the next area, but there are major time saves possible by choosing the fastest options.  For example the tas skips two boss fights, and as many of the extra info chips as possible. On some "action" sections the game wants you to make a directional input in time, but the outcomes differ. Sometimes Megaman will take a hit resulting in a long damage animation, othertimes you "fail" and the game sets you back, or a new route is entered. The guide linked below shows how the various options result in different outcomes.

	"The fighting sections of game are basically the same as lightgun games but you move with a controller and there is a pause menu.  By holding the fire button a charged shot can be used.  The pause menu allows the player to switch weapons, and restore life and energy tanks.  Changing weapons is better done with L and R in the fight however.  The energy tanks are used rarely like on the last boss to restore the Magnet weapon.  The enemy weapons tend to be pretty useless overall unlike most Megaman games.  With very few exceptions they do roughly same damage as a charged shot. Another bad thing about the weapons that are effective on a boss is that there is usually a long pause while the enemy is invincible so using the charge shot or regular shots are better most of the time.  However, the best spot to use the effective weapon is for the final shot since in total it saves couple seconds.  Starting on Disc 2 Megaman gets a rapid fire normal shot and it is extremely useful since it rapidly drains the enemy health and does not stun in between hits.

	"Having separate discs would only make sense if anything was carried between them. In this case it'd be the weapons but since this TAS doesn't bother carrying those over there's not really any need to have separate publications per disc as essentially the gameplay would be the same. This input file essentially covers all of the discs except for the disc 1 & 2 credits so unless some folks really want those credits sequences I will say that having an input file per disc isn't needed for this case.
