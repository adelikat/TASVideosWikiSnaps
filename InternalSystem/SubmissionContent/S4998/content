	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"Pirates of Dark Water is remarkable for its eccentric setting, utilizing the source material's melding of swashbuckling adventures, sword-and-sorcery fantasy, and Road Warrior-inspired fashion aesthetics. Drawing from the cartoon's backstory, players fight rival pirates as well as fantastic creatures sent to hinder the heroes from finding the Treasure of Rule by the evil pirate-lord Bloth.

	" Characters

]h4
[p 
	"The game features the main crew of the 1990s TV show - Ren, Ioz, and Tula - searching for the Treasures of Rule in order to rid the world of Mer of the Dark Water and return Mer and Ren's homeland, Octopon, to its former glory.
	$LF
	"At beginning of each stage the player can chosen one of the three main characters:
	$LF

[ul

		"Ren - medium strength/medium agility;

]ul
[p 
	"Ioz can kill most enemies in one hit, Ren is the most balanced while Tula is the fastest but weakest.  If you feel a change is in order you can feed 10 watermelons to monkey bird companion Niddler to switch. However it is take too long.

	"[>]
	"x10 
	"[>B]
	" 
	"[>]
	"x25 [ ]x14} but places to apply pure theory in reality are very rare. Usually many factors of influences, like surface angle, low/high ceiling, enemies on way, distance to aims (need exact amount of jumps). So each real place require some adaptation to make double jumps longer or shorter.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Gravity potion & side-effects
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Gravity potion is inba item. This wonderful potion allow player to make jumps at sonic speed 15 pixels per frame during double jump, blank input as akways help to maintain high speed much longer after that. Potion's effect works 899 frames, for TAS with precise sequence of inhuman jumps it's enough to completely crack whole levels. Beside high speed, there are also interesting side-effects of potion:
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		"Tula (and Ren) able to use vertical zipping in some places.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Ioz is even more broken, he can jump thru close doors without having key.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"However such priceless game-breaking potions are enough rare, and some of them are hidden in so far places that it is cost more time to get than benefit from usage. In my route 14 gravity potions will be collected and used. During route planning i tested two things: 1-How many frames cost to get each particular gravity potion in game and 2-How many frames will be saved if use gravity potion in each level. Then compared these numbers and figure it out how many potions is optimally - result is that Goldilocks number is exactly 14.

[p 
	"Near with some ladders possible grab for air and became able to climb up (or down) infinitely high. Used only once in very beginning.
	$LF

[h4 
	" Falling limit
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"There is falling limit, if character is fall down too long it will lost HP and be respawn from place where it was before falling. Possible to slightly extend this limit by using double jump during falling or by taking damage. Several tricky jumps in this run done extremely near to very boundary of this limit.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Avoid dialogues
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Dialogues with secondary characters are just waste of time, so where possible they are skipped. To do it usually need simply jumped over their "speaking area", only 2 or 3 of such skips are more or less tricky.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Zipping
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Zipping is zipping. Very powerful glitch, it allowed to move inside some walls with fantastic speed. Very useful especially in vertical levels. Need use gravity potion + some set up to activate.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Ceiling effect
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Ceiling is reflect you back to ground. So middle-high ceiling allow make double jumps more frequent and reach higher average speed, it is very useful. On other low ceiling forbid double jumps and make average speed almost equal walking. Special case is corner effect, at corners possible to get angle almost parallel with ceiling, even at low ceiling where normally it not possible.

	$LF
	"Partial: 3)During double jump acceleration.4)During use of potions. In TAS all 4 cases were used.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"For some reasons if stand on button - effect of potion will immediately disappear. Conclusion: Never stay on buttons during potion. Never.

[h4 
	" S+ state
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"To execute double jump we need to make normal jump. However in some places, where need to come down is not handy or even impossible to jump up. So is worth to make preparatory jump without acceleration. After landing we get ability to make do double jump second jump with acceleration without pre-jumping. I called it S+ state. Used many times.

	$LF
