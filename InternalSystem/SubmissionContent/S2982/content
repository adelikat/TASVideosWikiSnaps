	"The Terminator is the unacclaimed license-based game of the similarly titled movie. It is often said to have an outrageous difficulty (with no continues) and bad sound, among other issues. You probably know this game by now thanks to AVGN and the rejected TAS Glitchman did of this game a few months back. This is a 2066 frames (a bit under 36 secs) improvement in comparison, thanks to new glitches and techniques.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"You start the game in the decadent future, playing as Reese. You have gun and some grenades to help you survive against the endlessly spawning baddies. Once you get far enough in the game and travel to the past, you lose all your lethal weaponry and suddenly learn to punch and kick in its stead. Honestly, the world of the past is no better than the hopeless hellhole of the future, with everything set out to kill you, from stray dogs to policemen to mere drops of water falling from the ceiling. After roaming for a while, there are two driving stages and, finally, the factory wherein Terminator gets what is coming to 'im.

[div class=p 
	"You could say that the game beckoned me to play it, somehow. I became intrigued the moment I saw it, and once having started playing it, it didn't take me long to find time saving tricks. Also, I don't think this game is that bad. It was fun to TAS, with one glaring exception of a level which I'll get back to later... The music is strangely minimal. Most level music is one very simple loop, which after maybe about 10 seconds gets another minimal layer on top of it. At best it gives the game a dignified, even slightly surreal effect (as is the case with the music in f.e. screen 5). Overall the game has its hostile, barren beauty... like extreme metal?

		"Tricks & techniques:
	]b
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Reese has a slow landing animation, making him stop for about 11 frames each time he lands. This can be avoided by punching or kicking in air at the right time, or throwing items (optimally at the last possible frame, including grenades - something Glitchman overlooked). Cancelling a landing still causes you a small sub-pixel loss, apparently.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Doing a jump without speed gives you a "high jump" in which Reese jumps noticeably higher than normal, but this jump is preceded by about 17 frames of preparation. Sometimes it's required, but for the most part it's better to do without it.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Another new trick: hitting an enemy while landing from a jump allows you to skip the landing animation. This is used several times in the future levels, where you still don't know how to punch/kick to avoid the landing delay. It's basically as if you get a freebie jump. In the last future room, there is an unique glitch in which landing in a protruding spike causes Reese to do his high jump while strangely sliding in air - this is a phenomena I didn't notice anywhere else in the game, but which managed to luckily save time regardless.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Reese has an unique talent with ladders, being able to climb out of them and through collision. Used with U+D. This is another new technique and allows some very nice skips in the run. Doing this may also cause the graphics of the next room glitch up, for some reason.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"You can manipulate enemies away during platforming sections by turning away for a frame. In some cases I was able to win time by not manipulating an enemy away and instead jumping over him, trading a full frame loss for a sub-pixel loss. However, the presence of enemies on the screen causes "invisible lag", but it's not a big deal here compared to the driving stages.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The driving sections are very tricky to optimize, and my Achille's heel, as far as this run is concerned. It seems that the presence of The Terminator on the screen causes noticeable "invisible lag" which will ruin your record time without you even noticing, not to mention your car's steering capability simultaneously turns into strawberry jam. You will not make those tight corners if he is around. It's hell manipulating him to stay out of your way while at the same time trying to keep him as much as possible outside the screen per se. It's almost as if he was programmed to specifically get in your way at worst possible times. You can tell he has a certain "rhythm" to his antics which you can only partially manipulate. The Terminator's actions may change depending on when and how you ram him, when you shoot bullets (missed bullets also affect him, making him sink farther away down the screen than usual) and even wild turns can affect him.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"In both driving sections, ramming into Terminator at a certain angle at the start gives you a speed boost which saves some frames.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"I accidentally noticed a glitch in the driving section which made the Terminator become stuck for (from quick tests) about 1800 frames at best. However, I could not manipulate this to happen in this run... for those interested, there is a .fm2 of this occurence in the auxiliary topic for this game in the NES section.

	"Screen 5:
	$LF
	"Before the moving platforms, I jump on top of the enemy's head and moonwalk briefly in a pale Super Mario imitation. Don't worry, it didn't waste time. By ducking at the right frame before a bullet hits you (it seems to vary a bit), you minimize the negative momentum Reese suffers and you are able to continue onward a lot sooner. In the downhill part, I again utilize the jumping technique in which I scathe enemies when landing, allowing freebie jumps (this time for profit and not just fun). A somewhat different timing causes me to retain more of my health than Glitchman did, as if it mattered. Total of 1220 frames ahead.

	$LF
	"I found out the hard way that this destroyer plane can come from two possible directions, from east or west. Glitchman had east, as I too had on my initial attempt.

After my first attempt, I realized I had lost 50 frames out of nowhere! It's so devious with these levels. The green car which comes from the side does the most damage to you, and if you're not careful, you will lose all your health in this level.

Oh hell, I'm not going to recount it from the beginning, but let it be known that as I drove down these 8-bit roads hour after hour, suffering The Terminator's anti-social traffic behavior and the overall lagginess, feeling compelled to improve over my first attempt which lost 200 friggin' frames with me barely even noticing... at some point my mind began to drift away and I succumbed to something which might be classifiable - mentioned simply as a meagre afterthought that tries to bestow some reason to the whole sickening ordeal - as a sort of shellshock.

The second attempt fared much better, but still not that great, with 59 frames lost. Then, the third finished attempt and the one you see on this vid... 40 frames lost. While antithetical of what a respectable TASer would say, I have no choice but to conclude that "It will have to do", while wishing godspeed to the next poor soul this game beckons.
