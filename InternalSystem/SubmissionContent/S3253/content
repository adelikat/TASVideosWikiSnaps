	"Two techniques were used to save frames. The first is an extension of the backstepping glitch. When a player backsteps and then defeats the opponent, they go tumbling across the screen, but if you hit them so they land on the street instead of the sidewalk, they disappear instead and instantly goes to the next round. This glitch saves a lot of frames, but some of those were lost as I have to be a step further back to perform the glitch. This means taking more time backing up in Round 1 and more time moving forward in Round 2, but ultimately saving frames.

	"The second technique is combining heavy punches with the sliding glitch, and just some polishing in general. Generally, heavy punches are slower than series of light punches, but by using the sliding glitch to move further ahead than normal, I'm able to save frames. I did a lot of testing with all the different punch combinations, and in most cases, heavy punches are best. Light punches are best only for finishing stages. It's also helpful to use heavy punches, even if light punches will defeat the opponent in the same amount, because you can start a round in several different locations, the time lost from doing more than necessary will be gained in the following round. In other words, if my character is further right than necessary to finish a round, I'll be starting further right in the following round. Of course though, I did the bare minimum in Round 3, since any extra distance won't help.

	"I spent a lot of time testing punches, the glitches, and different combinations of things, so once again, this is completely optimal unless there's still more glitches I haven't discovered. With the speed of the rounds, I would imagine any time-saving glitches would involve cutting down on the between round cutscenes.
