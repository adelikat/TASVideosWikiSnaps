	"This is a rather short TAS of this rather short timing based game. This game is a fangame for Flash based of Touhou Project. It was made by AZIMITOKI as the first part of a duology. You play as Hong Meiling, who must stop Youmu Konpaku's attack and break her sword as fast as possible. This TAS does just that, and achieves a final in-game time of 1"050.

	"I stop the sword at the last possible frame. There's a 2 frame stopping window where Sakuya briefly appears, looking impressed at my timing. This only happens if I click on this speficic frame window, as Sakuya doesn't appear if I'm too early. I don't think clicking any earlier has any speed benefits, as it doesn't look like any faster or slower if I stop at the earliest or latest frame I could stop.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Now for the important part, the breaking the sword part. There's a meter at the bottom left of the screen. You fill this meter by moving the mouse left and right. The pattern performed is 1 frame right, 1 frame center, 1 frame left, 1 frame center, so on, so forth. This is the most optimal sequence of inputs I could find. The meter decreases rather quickly, and the game runs at 20 FPS, so this is as fast as I can make it.

	"I skip the silly little cutscene that happens at the end to get to the result screen quicker, since I still need to make an input to reach the credits sequence. A bit unfortunate, but what can you do.

	"I had to redo this movie like twice because I initially got a time of 1"100, but after further optimizing my mouse movement, I got a better time. I had to verify this was the limit again by doing a different movement pattern (1F right + 1F center + 1F right), but I finish at the exact time of 1"050, just like my previous attempt.

	"I was browsing through Flashpoint for some Flash and PICO-8 games to TAS until I stumbled upon this little game. I thought it was pretty charming so I decided to TAS it. I might TAS the sequel, but right now I'm focused on other Flash games of the spunchbop and mayro variety, as well as some bigger stuff like Regular Show and Hamtaro, so it might take a while to get there.
