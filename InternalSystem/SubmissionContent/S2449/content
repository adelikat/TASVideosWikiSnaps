	"Phantoon first has always been the fastest route, and probably always will be. Doing Kraid after Ridley and Lower Norfair allows me to have the Speed Booster for his lair, but 1 less energy tank for Lower Norfair. The only major time-saver for having Kraid’s e-tank for Lower Norfair is the Big Acid Room Hero-Spark. This spark does not justify the amount of time lost from not having the Speed Booster in Kraid’s lair. The other argument-worthy point is also being stocked on supers from Mini-Kraid. Well, there were more than enough refills along the way to Lower Norfair to justify that alone, but not enough on the way back for Maridia. Thus, I am easily completely stocked for Maridia after doing Kraid’s lair, saving even more time. The estimated time gain is ~3.5 seconds. Yes, a sexy amount. This will also be the most optimal real-time any% route.

	"Other than the route, all known optimization tricks were applied where they would save time, including a new optimization trick I discovered during this run. We all know about the inverse WJ trick, which wasn’t really anything special other than for entertainment purposes. Well, utilizing this trick and jumping with .4096 speed going right, you can inverse WJ with .4096 speed, thus allowing the game to set your Y sub speed higher than that of a usual WJ. So far, it saved a frame on the wall before the pre-Draygon spark and a few frames in the escape sequence.

You’re just fun to talk to and without you around to push me forward, this run would still be stuck at fucking Norfair and the preparations for Lower Norfair.
