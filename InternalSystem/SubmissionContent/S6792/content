	"Clockwork Knight was one of the launch titles for the Sega Saturn in the US, it was essentially a tech demo for what the Saturn could do.  Much like Toy Story, the story features toys that come to life, but only when the princess sings to them, but now the princess has been captured, and it's up to our main character to rescue her.

The Bigger timesave comes from the world 2 boss improvement.  I really hated how I did that boss and wondered why I didnt just kill it in the first cycle.  Turns out I had no idea what I was doing so I improved it by 18 seconds.
