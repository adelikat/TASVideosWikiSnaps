	"This is a TAS to complete all exits as fast as possible. Most of the game is pretty straightforward, and some others are very tight. There's a decent amount of under/over the level for some levels that take to much time for stopping. There aren't too many autoscrollers either which means it mainly fast-paced gameplay
