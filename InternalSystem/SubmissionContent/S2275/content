	"This movie beats 
	[a class=intlink href=/2274S 
		"Nineko's submission
	]a
	" by about 13.5 seconds. I mainly made it to prove the point that it could be done with 7 lineclears (6 tetrisses and a single line). It nearly gets the approximately highest possible score, but the last lineclear obviously isn't a tetris as that would take longer. I picked a 'level' where it would be possible to make the single line clear at the end with a single block.

	"The goals of this movie are quite similar to 
	[a class=intlink href=/927M 
		"the Tetris DX movie
	]a
	". This completes 40 lines at height 5, and this 25. A difference, besides the amount of lines is the blocks underneath (it's solid at Tetris DX, and has holes at this version). There are also a few other differences, but they are pretty small. I don't know if this movie is different enough to be published (I would have never made it if it wasn't for Nineko's submission)...
