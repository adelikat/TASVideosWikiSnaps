	"It took awhile, but here is the final product.  Of the X 
	$LF
	"series games on the SNES, I think X2 is best for a time 
	$LF
	"attack, as the weapons are all extremely unique from one 
	$LF
	"another, and many actually manipulate the environment, from 
	$LF
	"a grappling hook, to a weapon which can create platforms out 
	$LF
	"of monsters to a weapon which gives you additional, and 
	$LF
	"faster midair dashes.  I make sure to use the optimum weapon 
	$LF
	"in every single case.  There is a massive amount of 
	$LF
	"rerecords because upon landing from a dashing jump, a couple 
	$LF
	"of frames can be saved by pushing dash at just the right 
	$LF
	"frame.  Additionally, many actions take place which must be 
	$LF
	"done at the exact frame from the exact position to actually 
	$LF
	"work.  None of these will actually be apparent, but they are 
	$LF
	"there.  These two factors combined led to a large number of 
	$LF
	"rerecords.

	"I am slightly upset that the latter 4/5 or so of the movie 
	$LF
	"is of better quality than Wheel Gator's stage and boss 
	$LF
	"fight, which I am slightly unsatisfied with, but it's 
	$LF
	"something to be fixed in later versions(which may not come 
	$LF
	"for a long time)- most of this movie is astounding, and it 
	$LF
	"only gets better with time due to a greater selection of 
	$LF
	"weapons to choose from.  The Shoryuken makes boss fights 
	$LF
	"less exciting, but as the other special moves in the X 
	$LF
	"series after it is acquired the movie goes extremely 
	$LF
	"quickly.  I wouldn't be surprised if a 100% run actually 
	$LF
	"took less time than a minimalist run because of it.  A last 
	$LF
	"note to be mentioned about it is that it actually takes a 
	$LF
	"split second to activate, hence the short pause between 
	$LF
	"dashing and using it.

	"An additional thing you might notice is that 
	$LF
	"when jumping off walls I often do small double
