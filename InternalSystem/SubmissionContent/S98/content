	"This is a little known game in which your character must go through a long series of nonlinear levels, her only equipment being a grappling hook which requires great skill and timing to manipulate correctly.  Because of the difficulty required to use the grappling hook(even with emulator tools), I believe that while it may become close, there will never be a truly perfect run, which makes it ideal for competition: the player must plan their own path through each level.  I feel that my route is the fastest, and that I executed it close to perfectly.
