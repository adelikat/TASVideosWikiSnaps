	"I was really hesitant to submit this and even now I don't have much confidence in it. The version of the game used seems arbitrary and it really is but there are so many clones I just picked one that looked decent. I'm also not 100% sure how maximum score for this game would be defined. Visibly, you can only go to 99999 but it should be possible to go on forever, the score counter just resets every 99999 points so I just kill the dino at that score.

	"The majority of the movie was automated using 
	[a href=https://tasvideos.org/UserFiles/Info/638185264480958107 rel=noopener external nofollow 
		"this script
	]a
	". Simply, when an obstacle's x position is less than 60 ($1602 and $1622) the dino will jump and that's it. Because the linked script is in it's final form for the max speed portion of the run, you'll have to remove the down inputs after jumping bit and this should carry you to 284. I think the game reaches max speed between 3k and 4k points, definitely before 4k. I never found the y value for obstacles which is why the dino jumps for flying dinos too (which I only noticed weren't birds while making this) and so I had to remove all A inputs manually which was fine and I wasn't too bothered about it.
