	": Welcome, sirstarmagic. I think you misunderstand the intentions of this site. This site is to host the best TASes of individual games, therefore, as stated in the rules, it must beat all known records. This run does not. Please familiarize yourself with the way this site operates before submitting again. Thank you.

	"To the rest of the site: Users who do not understand how we operate will continue to come to the site, and from time to time there will be sub-par submissions. The good of the 3 day waiting period far outweighs the bad, and thus it is perfectly fine for legitimate runs like this to sit on the bench for 3 days. Plenty of users provided helpful feedback to sirstarmagic. However, negative commentary is not necessary, and makes this site look bad to all. Additionally, there is no need to remove a subpar run from the twitter feed.
