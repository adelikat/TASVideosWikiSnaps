	"This little baby is perhaps better known from it's arcade-platform and this SNES release is kinda overshadowed by it.

	"Graphics are good and music is just excellent. Sounds could be improved tho. But I always like the "HOP!" sound end of each stage or so.

	"Some tactics I used:
	$LF
	"Percival was used because he has a running attack and a powerful overhead smash with the axe, which is the most powerful single attack in the game too. He is slow but running helps. Only if you could run diagonally too... 
	$LF
	"All the enemy guard only from the front so I attack some from the back, otherwise the attacks are blocked. (happens in some places, Scorn for example)
	$LF
	"I use special attack to kill of weaker or weakened enemies in a bunch or out of screen where normal attacks wouldn't reach. Saves some time.
	$LF
	"I also just run through in some areas and hit some enemies so they are left "behind" and new enemies spawn. Saves damn a lot of time.
	$LF
	"Treasure and levels are pointless because it don't raise your attack power at all. It just makes Percival go bald.. -.-' 
	$LF

	"I used Snes9x 1.43 WIP1
	$LF
	"I don't use codes or warps.
	$LF
	"I do abuse some programming errors (dissappering enemies)
	$LF
	"I don't take hits from enemies. It doesn't save any time.

	"It was a long and painful process to get this game under 20minutes. I started out from 33minutes (first version ^^') and it was HARD to manipulate every single enemy to spawn in right places and walk in right directions. I only have under 2000 re-records because I learned some difficult ones beforehand. Otherwise it would be like 5000+ or so.
