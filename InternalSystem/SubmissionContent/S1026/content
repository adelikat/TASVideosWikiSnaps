	"Dragon Warrior is an epic RPG series which now spans 8 games across many systems. The second game greatly expands on the first to include a party of three heroes (all descendents of Erdrick and the hero of DW1) and battles that may include many enemies. The world is much bigger and there are many big dungeons to explore as well. Luckily there are new abilities and items to make this easier. Enemies can randomly drop items when defeated and there is a lottery which is the precursor to the casinos which appear in each later DW game. Finally, you might notice that many of the enemies in this game appear in later games, particularly DW8.

	"It is necessary to assemble all three heroes, else you will be stopped when crossing a shrine. The shrine near Cannock won't let you through without the prince of Cannock and the shrine by Moonbrook won't let you through without the princess of Moonbrook.

	"The overall goal is to reach Hargon's castle in Rhone and defeat Hargon and Malroth. However, to break an illusion in Hargon's castle it is necessary to use the Charm of Rubiss, which means getting five crests which are scattered around the world. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The first task is to assemble the party. The second member needs to be tracked down by first visiting his home castle and talking to his father, then visiting the Spring of Bravery in a cave. After that he appears in the village of Leftwynn and joins you. Now you can travel across a cave to another continent where the kingdom of Moonbrook lies. The third member is in the village of Hamlin but has been turned into a dog. To turn her back you need to pick up the Mirror of Ra from a swamp in the area, then she will join. To proceed it is necessary to pick up the Cloak of Wind from a tower to the southeast of Hamlin. Then you can journey to Lianport, which requires crossing a strait by jumping off a tower with the Cloak of Wind. In Lianport you rescue a girl from two gremlins who just happens to be from a rich family that owns a ship, which is your reward. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Now the game opens up a bit and you can sail around the world collecting the many items necessary to take on Hargon. Probably the most important are the keys. The golden key is in the island village of Zahan where a dog shows you the way. The jailor's key and the watergate key are in the underground town of Wellgarth which you need the golden key to enter. The jailor's key is bought from a shop that doesn't want to tell you exactly what you are buying. You find the watergate key when you catch a thief who tried to escape but didn't get very far. The watergate key opens up the watergate in Tuhn. This floods an area which allows access to an island with a tower. Here the moon fragment is found, which allows access to a volcano dungeon by changing the tide. A group of wizards in the volcano dungeon have the Eye of Malroth, which opens up a cave leading to Rhone. So after this the party can navigate the cave and storm Hargon's castle. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"However, the five crests need to be picked up at some point and brought to an underwater shrine where the Charm of Rubiss is obtained. The water crest is in a jail in Hamlin guarded by some ozwargs. The sun crest is in the Fire Shrine on an island in the middle of the ocean. The stars crest is in a tower, but you have to beat some more gremlins for it. The king of Osterfair has the moon crest and he gives it to you after you beat a saber lion in his little colliseum. Finally, the life crest is in the basement of the cave leading to Rhone.

[p 
	"Hargon's castle looks like Midenhall until you use the Charm of Rubiss. As you climb the tower there are three subbosses to defeat: Atlas, Bazuzu and Zarlox. Then Hargon and Malroth.

This is a good reason to give most items to the hero since he is the only one alive at times. Luckily all items go to the hero by default when you pick them up. You can transfer an item to a living person, but that would waste time. It's also faster to throw away items than transfer, so that's how I manage my inventory. By throwing away a few items once they served their purpose I was able to manage my inventory well enough that it was never necessary to transfer an item.

	"Unfortunately, it's more difficult to manipulate things in this game than in DW1 or DW4. Button presses have no effect, all I can do is wait. Even worse, when walking around in random encounter areas, stops can only be made in 16-frame increments. Any menu or dialog can be closed with a resolution of one frame, which makes manipulation much easier. Also, opening the menu and waiting can produce different results than just adding pauses while walking. In general, most tougher manipulation is done by adding frames when closing a menu or dialog since this has to done regularly anyway. To avoid enemy fights I couldn't find any better way than using those 16-frame pauses. Occasionally it is faster to open a menu to avoid several of these pauses, I try to save menu trips to throw away or equip items for this. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I manipulate random encounter battles to appear a few times. When my goal is just to die the enemy group doesn't matter so much, I keep my hero weak enough that he will die in one hit. Picking a fight with a particular enemy group is much harder to manipulate. Adding wait frames seems to affect steps to encounter first and only changes the enemy group after the steps go to zero. Sometimes it can be 40+ steps to the next fight and at 1 step/frame it would take a while to get the fight I want. Luckily I can change things by opening a menu. Besides steps there is apparently another encounter mechanism. When you walk into darkness and there is a fade-in/fade-out effect it sometimes triggers an encounter instantly. Because it is an instant effect it isn't subject to the 1 step/frame rule, so I use this to get the quite rare encounter with one green dragon.

Furthermore, the slots tend not to stop on these symbols, they will go forward or back. Also, if you hit the button for the next symbol while an earlier one is still settling, you may change the results. For this reason I pick three moons for third prize since it lets me stop the slots pretty quickly. The top prizes of the lottery are all pretty neat:

The 50 gold plus 113 from selling leather armor gives me enough to buy two wings in Cannock. The main reason for doing this is actually to get the lottery ticket. Playing the lottery nets me a Wizard's Wand which I can sell for 1875 gold. I also pick up an Iron Helmet from a metal slime which sells for 2363 gold. This is more than enough to buy the rest of the items I need: a broadsword (1500 gold), jailor's key (2000 gold), more wings (80 each). In one test run I spent some extra time at the lottery to buy a light sword for 16000 gold. Though it was nice to have, it took much too long to get and use that many lottery tickets.

At level 13 I can do 8-9 damage easily while level 12 limits me to 5-6. The princess learns sleep at level 2, infernos at 4 and surround at 6. So my goal is to have the hero on 13 and the princess on 6. Any more than this wouldn't be worthwhile.
