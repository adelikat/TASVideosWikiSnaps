	"For a long time I have wanted to push Acmlm's original run of this game below 1 minute, but I was stuck near the beginning. Eventually though persistence and some help from my random guessing script got me to the end. Acmlm's run can actually be truncated down to right around 1 minute, as it will still beat the game with no further input after that point. By this standard, this run is ~200 frames faster.

	"This run also uses a mechanic that I'm not sure Acmlm was aware of. The blocks that appear white with green edge (as opposed to green with white edge) will clear all the blocks on screen if you make a rectangle out of them. I take advantage of this in several places. It pauses the screen for a bit, but it provides a great deal of freedom for luck manipulation during that time.

[p 
	"While there is probably a slightly faster run possible, the level of effort (and pure luck) needed does not interest me, and I'm happy that I reached my goal.
