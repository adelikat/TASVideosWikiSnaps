	"The glitch I abused involves pausing the game, which after a while, goes into this "Demo" mode where it loops through the whole game (kinda like a preview of it). If you move, normally, it would unpause the game and put you back to where you were. But if you were on a door, it glitches and allows you to enter.

	"If such a crap game like "E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial" got accepted, why not this? This was reviewed by the AVGN after all. Anyway, this TAS is comparable to The Amazing Spider-Man TAS by nitrogenesis since you're not supposed to do this in normal gameplay. But since playing legit knocks people to sleep, I drastically shorten the game!
