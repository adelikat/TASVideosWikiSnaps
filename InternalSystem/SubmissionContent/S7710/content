	"Lang (Stage 4) was already a perfect 65 frames per hit. Like Selene mentioned,there are some occasions throughout the TAS where it makes more sense to delay a couple frames to open up a faster overall pattern; the "first available" hit frame isn't always the best choice to take down the line due to the knockback and movement patterns which can create situations where you can't get optimal hits.

	"There is also a pseudo-global timer that changes the AI patterns a little bit. Even though you can hit on the same frame from multiple strikes/distance/etc. it actually matters what attack you throw to get the proper hit on the proper frame.
