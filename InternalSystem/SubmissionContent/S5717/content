	"This run exploits a programming error that allows the author to start playing from the second half of stage 5, skipping a lot of this game. If you notice that there's nothing meaningful going on in the first 2 minutes of the movie, this is normal: the actual gameplay takes place only after triggering the "major skip" through one of the demos.

So, if you press start at one of these frames, the game will be paused until you unpause when the loading finishes, allowing you to control Porky in one of the demos. Since the 3rd demo sets on the second half of stage 5, you must need to wait a lot (about 2 minutes) to this. Also, I choose the hard mode after the first 2 demos, otherwise, the next demo will be set on the normal mode.

If you don't hold a direction, you can mantain some speed for a few frames by jumping off a slope or not. With the help of RAM Watch, I discovered that by not jumping off a slope gains 1 more pixel forward (on level 6).
