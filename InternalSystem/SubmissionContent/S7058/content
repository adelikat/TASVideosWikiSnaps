	"The Witnes is a puzzle game released in 2016 by Thekla on PC, PS4 and XOne. There's no HUD, no tutorial, no living thing besides the flora and the player, who must solve puzzles on panels scatered around the island. Jonathan Blow presented us a masterpiece of game design, both artistically and technically.

	"On the surface, the puzzle increase on diffulty, just to force a smooth learning curve. Solving the 4th puzzle enables 3 new areas of panels straight away, and you can play them in any order. I called each one A, B and C, based on the order of wires leading to them, from left to right, and each one shows a new puzzle mechanic (I won't spoil here). The final puzzle panel is only turned on when the player completely solves all these 3 areas, and it contains all the puzzle mechanics.

	"The final puzzle is very close to the last puzzle of area B, my only doubt was where I would start: A or C. It turns out that starting on A, then heading to C, then B, takes a total of 164 tiles, and starting on C, then A, then B, takes only 152 tiles, so that's the optimal route to go. Here I considered each tile to be 16x16 pixels, because the player always stops at 16 pixel multiples.
