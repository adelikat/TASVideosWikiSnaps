		"The United States: Las Vegas: The common strategy for this is to always use a nitro on the first frame possible and go left to avoid the car in the front. Generally, this works because the car in the front will more than likely fade to the right. This gives enough breathing room to get around and back on the track. Near the end of the track, I purposefully stall the nitro use to catch the car duo to get the RHS glitch. This makes the track much faster.

		"The United States: Los Angeles: This track can give two different outcomes. First and foremost, the normal RNG pattern is way right and middle. The best RNG pattern is nitro right away and make it in-between the middle, I got the best of the two here. I'll use RHS here to reach the wall quicker. Then I'll use a gear momentum shift to get back up to 165 mph and then go to 4th gear to get enough speed to do the wall glitch.

		"The United States: New York: Snow. While it might come as a shock, this track does use RHS. Snow is a hectic one and I'll need every advantage I can get. I got the most favorable RNG here as well. I'll use HpTR to keep the slide state from occurring. I did a little cheeky slide momentum near the tree section and right at the end Tokyo Drift Style for style points.
