	"Vectrex controllers consist of a joystick and 4 buttons which are numbered 1-4. Left and Right on the joystick move your car to the left and right around obstacles. Up and Down on the joystick do nothing. Pressing the 1 button makes your car shift to a higher gear. Pressing the 2 button makes your car shift to a lower gear. Pressing the 3 button makes your car brake. Lastly, pressing the 4 button makes your car speed up.

	"We start in 1st gear, and there are a maximum of 4 gears for the car. Basically, you want to press 1 to shift to a higher gear at the perfect time. Too early, and it will take you a longer amount of time to reach the same speed. If you wait too late, then you will also lose time from having waited. In this case, I just used trial and error to find the fastest 3 places to shift gears. (from 1 to 2, from 2 to 3, and from 3 to 4).

	"My goal for this TAS was to finish with the fastest in-game time. In the end, my final time was 96.6 seconds (the fastest claimed human time for this game is 100.1 seconds). This is also why I end input early - since holding the 4 button for the final 1/2 second of the race doesn't get you to the finish-line any faster (it takes like 1/2 a second before you go from 15 speed to 14 speed, which is why this works). This also resulted in the same (fastest) real-time ending to the game, as well.
