	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"At first there was superjumps, which can be seen in all the other publications, where you can gain speed by changing direction then jump on a ledge over water or lava. It was pretty fast, but jumping meant that you had to wait until your land to get another one of these boosts. Now here comes superwalking, which is basically the same glitch, except you don't even need to jump to gain speed. This is the main mode of transportation used in this TAS, and it allows to gain insane speeds.

[h4 id=SpeedConservationNew 
	" Speed conservation (new!)
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"Once you gain insane speeds, the game will try to back to normal speed every 5 frames (in the air), every 6 frames (on the ground) or every 12 frames (in the air, above water). To avoid that, you can switch direction the frame before you start losing speed to delay the slowdown by another framerule.

	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"It was done by accident in the previous TASes, but here's how it's actually done. Once you get a horizontal speed that's faster than ~5.5 pixels per frame (about triple the normal walking speed), the game will only apply gravity on Banjo when he's turning.

[h4 id=50JiggyDoorSkipNew 
	" The 50 jiggy door skip (new!)
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"With everything that I explained so far, it's still impossible to clip past the 50 jiggy door, since it's impossible to gain enough speed to clip. The only workaround is to clip into a nearby bridge, and use that bridge as a really convenient spot to gain speed. While you're clipped into that bridge, you're on ground, but somehow the game considers that you're also above water, since there's no proper floor separating Banjo from the water down below. Clipping out of the has its challenge in itself, you need to moving at either 8 or 13 pixels per frame moving up, so precise speed control needs to be done in order to have enough time to gain rightward speed while not clipping out too early.

	" Final boss phase skips
	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"For the first 2 phases, you can shoot an egg then backflip to get a knockback which lets to play the quiz. This works because the game checks if you're in the egg firing mode or not to determine if an egg hits an enemy, and since I'm in a backflip when the egg hits, the game considers that I hit Grunty or Klungo with a melee attack, which causes a knockback.

Even if it looks so to do, it can still save about 2 seconds to get rid of a location question using this technique. Overall, for this run, the pause-buffering technique saved about 7 seconds.

This does not give a lot of time for you to hit the ghost, so you gotta be quick.

	"Allright, so the run starts by Banjo getting 6 jiggies in Spiral Mountain, as they are the fastest jiggies to get from the fact that most of them are standing still. This lets us open both Cliff Farm and Breegull Beach at once. Once we're in Cliff Farm, we only need to learn how to climb, so that's all we'll be doing here. Once we're in Breegull Beach, we unlock Kazooie and eggs with the notes that we got along the way, and we're ready for the boss fight.
