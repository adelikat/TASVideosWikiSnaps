	"Hello, this is my first submission and here is an improvement of 123 frames to the 
	(__wikiLink|1353S|previous movie)
	" (and 65 frames to the 
	(__wikiLink|1850S|cancelled one)
	"). This run will look somewhat different from the existing movies. This is because including corner-boosts causes a change of fadeout lag and the previous score route then fails to be the best. I give a level-by-level comparison to the previous movie as follows:
