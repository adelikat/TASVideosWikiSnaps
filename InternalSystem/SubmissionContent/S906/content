	"In this run I use warps. This is how the warp is done:
	$LF
	"In the bomb rooms, when you touch the first bomb, another one will be lit. Then you have to collect all the other bombs and the lit bomb last, then you will warp to next bomb room.
	$LF
	"So, order of bombs that you take is very important.

	"I use glitches when I pass trhough enemies and in room 11 when the mummy is dropping and you jump at the right time, mummy may drop through floor.It saves time in that certain spot.
	$LF
	"No hits from a enemy is taken.
	$LF
	"And I don't know if this is a glicth but if you slow emulation speed and jump and hold turbo A you can glide in the air. It helps very much. 
	$LF
	"And in every bomb room, when you enter it you can jump while in the air by pressing jump button. It didn't happen all the time but with re-records I made it in necessary places.

	"In the movie hardest parts were room 13 and some rooms at the end because there were so many enemies. Room 13 because bombs are in very tricky order and enemies are very close.
