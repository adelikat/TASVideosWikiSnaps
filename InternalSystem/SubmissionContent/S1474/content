	":  This movie uses an European rom but runs it at 60fps.  This is unacceptable.  But the previous movies were done & published this way too so it is unfair to the author to reject.  I am accepting this run.  But any future run that is done in this manner (including future Blue shadow submissions) way will be rejected.  If using an E rom, it should run in PAL mode.
