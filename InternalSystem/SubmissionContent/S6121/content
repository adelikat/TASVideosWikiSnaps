	"This one was much easier to complete than the Harry Potter TAS I did, lemme say that for nothing! I always liked this game growing up as a kid, and what with it being a game that isn't too RNG-heavy, it was also quite a fun run to do. Wish there was more to the strategy than what appeared in the end product, but ah well.

	"In Robot Wars: Extreme Destruction, you get to play as or build your own robot, and go through several competitions in a variety of arenas in order to come out on top as the true master of mayhem. Featuring famous robots from the TV Show, like Hypno-Disc, Chaos 2 and Razer, claiming the crown as the champion of Robot Wars will be no easy feat - especially with the big bad House Robots on your tail!

	" (1) Vs. 101
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"So, the strategy immediately as the fight begins is to go for the pit release button. Seeing as you can't achieve OOTA (Out of The Arena) flips in this game, the quickest way to win a fight is to dump your opponent in the pit. In the time it takes for us to go for the pit button, 101 will have darted across the arena towards us, at which point we ram into them with our rear end, in an attempt to bounce them off of our rear and immediately into the pit. It took a few tries because 101's spike on the front instantaneously pushes you away, but it also pushes them back a bit, so after 3 attempts we were able to get them in.

	"This time around, we started with  a good power-up - Aerodynamics. It's the only powerup in the game worth using, and it basically gives your bot a 2X speed boost. Same strat as before, but  with the 2X speed boost ending this fight in only 5 seconds!

	$LF

[p 
	"And here it is, the toughest tournament. The strategy is roughly the same, although it's a lot harder to push the house robots because of their increased weight, and so the strategy changes accordingly.

[h4 
	" (13) Vs. Dead Metal
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Same as 2, except here we used the flipper to get out of Dead Metal's jaws and give ourselves more leverage on the push. This game's physics calculations are... approximate, at best, and it generally calculates who's on top of who based on visible pixels, so popping the flipper as we went into his jaws made the game think we were above him.

	$LF

[p 
	"Matilda was a very interesting fight because while she is the fastest House Robot in the game, she can't steer very well, and has a tendency to just charge into stuff! She'll try to turn, but her turns are generally very wide, and we abused this to make her drive herself into the pit.

	$LF

[p 
	"This and Dead Metal were the toughest fights. Sir K is by far the heaviest house robot, and the hardest to push - not to mention he has one of the most damaging killplanes on a bot right out in front of him, so  getting around to his sides was quite important for winning this one. Again, like the Dead Metal fight, using the flipper to gain leverage, and just gradually, slowly pushing him back until he collapses into the pit.

]h3
[p 
	"This TAS could probably be improved by finding out what determines the power-ups you receive at the start of a match, and then abusing that so you get Aerodynamics at the start of every match. However, even if you get that, I don't think this TAS will come out of Vault, so it'll remain unoptimized unless someone wants to pick up the slack.
