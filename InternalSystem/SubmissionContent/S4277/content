	"Screen 1 is probably completely optimized, unless someone finds a bug. But, I found better routes to squeeze 109 frames out of screen 2, then 54 in screen 3, a nice 3 in screen 4, and finally 137 in screen 5. Screen 2's save was from the fact that I found that when I would want to change lanes to lessen the distance I needed to travel to get somewhere, it would save something around 30 frames to take the long way around as it takes THAT long to change lanes.
