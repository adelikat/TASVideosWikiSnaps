[h3 id=HistoryofthisTASprojectbyWST
 
	" History of this TAS project by WST
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This project was started many years ago, probably by Qwerty, also known by NaturelLorenzo, but I am not completely sure, because he often referenced to Sonikkustar when I talked to him (at least Sonikkustar really had a Knuckles 100% project). And the first public WIP of this project (this particular gmv file) was probably 
	[a class=extlink href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07LBfYYh4wI rel=nofollow 
		"this
	]a
	". Qwerty did it up to Ice Cap zone, but at that point he already had a strong feeling of imperfection and thus decided to start his work from scratch, instead of proceeding to Ice Cap zone or taking 
	[a class=intlink href=/Forum/P/277006#277006 
		"marzojr’s ICZ example
	]a
	". First, he did a testrun of 
	[a class=intlink href=/Forum/P/343924#343924 
		"Sandopolis 2
	]a
	", probably the hardest of all stages. Then he redid the beginning of the game up to Carnival Night zone, but then again came the feeling of imperfection, and he decided to leave his work to me (WST). I accepted his challenge, and my first goal was improving Angel Island 1 by 1 in-game second, though Qwerty told me he considered AIZ to be already well done. At first I almost succeeded. 
	[a class=intlink href=/Forum/P/363957#363957 
		"Almost
	]a
	". Then I got a message from Aglar with his own “testrun” of AIZ1 as Knuckles, which was slightly faster than my “serious” project, so I returned to work.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Meanwhile, there were 2 almost-joke submissions of Sonic & Knuckles:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"— Sonic and Knuckles (Knuckles, any%) by Qwerty
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"— Sonic and Knuckles (Knuckles, any%) by WST, feeuzz, Qwerty
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"They were made very quickly: the goal of the first run was just getting a first TASvideos publication, the goal of the second one was simply showing how bad was the first run — it took me and feeuzz just 3-4 days to completely redo the run, improving every single stage.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Then there was a 
	[a class=intlink href=/Forum/T/15667 
		"“serious” submission from McBobX
	]a
	". Surprisingly, the first half of that run was poorly done, and the second one was a result of copy-pasting mine and feeuzz’s work without even mentioning us in the submission text.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Of course, I did not abandon the Sonic 3 and Knuckles any% project. I found ways to improve Aglar’s example run, and finally got 0:40 in Angel Island 1. Redoing Angel Island 1 was hard because of the tunnel trick, which I really hate, but I have to thank marzojr, who performed it for me many times — and did it again.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The further work does not need much explaination. Qwerty left the project and I worked on it alone. I played all zones up to Carnival Night 2, but stucked on Carnival Night 1 boss — as always, feeling of imperfection did not let me continue. Also, I often found improvements to already finished stages — for example, glide-glitching from AIZ1 to AIZ2; new zips in HCZ1 and HCZ2. Redoing it all again and again, I got bored and almost abandoned the project (almost — because, well, I 
	[a class=extlink href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdeRUqFi-Ic rel=nofollow 
		"recorded FBZ2
	]a
	", for example). The other “issue” was my promotion at work — I became head of department, and since that moment I had incredibly great amounts of work and responsibility. Beleive me. I cannot be as active as before anymore — and it is not my fault.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Fortunately, an active newcomer, Evil_3D, decided to continue the project. I intentionally didn’t tell you any technical details and told the story behind our project instead — because… Well, because Evil_3D actually replayed and improved most of my input, and he’s the one who knows the technical details, and I am the one who knows the entire project’s life
