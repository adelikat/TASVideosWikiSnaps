	"This game is a licensed game based on the popular TV show SpongeBob Squarepants released in 2001, around the same year as the Gameboy Advance platform was released.
	$LF
	"This is a different version of the game, based on the PlayStation version released the same year. This version has a lot of differences compared to the PS1 version. For one, the life system is completely different. Instead of having a Sonic-esque life system, this version now uses a lifebar. The level design is completely different as well. Also this version controls slightly better than the slippery PS1 version. Now you end a level when you pick up the required item, instead of picking the item up, and heading to the exit. The music is SO MUCH better on PS1 though.
	$LF
	"The plot involves Spongebob wanting to give his best friend Patrick a birthday present, which is a signed photo from his heroes, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. These folks want Spongebob to do various tasks in order for them to sign the photo. It's up to Spongebob to get what these heroes want by going through dangerous landscapes, such as the prehistoric era and literal hell in order to get the best birthday present ever for his starfish friend.

	"These are the most effective way of attacking enemies while moving forward. When you land, it's about a 2 frame delay until Spongebob moves again, but it is a frame faster to jump inmediately the frame after he lands on the ground. This is also useful for landing on platforms faster, like in Sandy's Treedome or the Parasitic Worm boss fight at the end of Chapter 3. Hitboxes in this game are really wonky, so I have to do a lot of them in order to kill enemies and avoid others, or avoid projectiles. I also fall in the air faster which is also used in a couple of places.

A lot the times, no matter how fast you go, you're unable to reach a moving platform, and you have to wait some time until you can reach it. As you can tell, it's really inconvenient, and I have to do random stuff while I wait, like letting out my anger with karate chops.

Useful for avoiding unnecesary stops. Landing on spikes or lava hurt you, and you can use this to reach high platforms or used to keep moving forward if you miss a platform cycle. Also used to avoid getting hit from enemies and projectiles.

Using your net, which you only use in this boos fight, you shoot the baby jellyfish back to their mother. I save up 5 jellyfish to quickly shoot the last few hits at her. When a boss is defeated, they get knocked out like a regular enemy, however, the sooner they stay out of the screen, they despawn more quickly and Spongebob's thumbs up animation happens earlier.

He does like to move around if you're not careful. You also have a chance of hitting him 3 times instead of 2 before he throws rocks again and becomes temporarily invurnerable.
