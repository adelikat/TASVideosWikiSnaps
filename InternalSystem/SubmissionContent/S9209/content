	"Klonoa can run, jump, flutter (for ~1s) and shoot his Wind Bullet. He also has a whirlwind ability that no one seems to remember exists. At the end of Klonoa's flutter, if he shoots his Wind Bullet he'll gain a little more height than if he didn't, which is called a perfect flutter. His wind bullet can also pick up enemies (i.e. Moo's) or activate switches. If he's holding a moo, he can throw it or use it to double jump in the air. He can face forwards and backwards (necessary for entering doors or shooting enemies into the foreground/background). Running down slopes gives you more speed than running on flat ground, and jumping up slopes is slightly faster than running up them. His speed on slopes (as well as rivers) can be preserved either by fluttering or double jumping.

	"Damage boosting is a strat used throughout the TAS, where taking damage on one side of an enemy will knock you further down the path. Taking damage also gives Klonoa invincibility for ~1 second. This can be abused in certain places, like in the Rongo Lango boss fight, or in 5-1 to damage boost through fire instead of waiting for it to go away. Taking damage also restores Klonoa's flutter after he uses it.

	"Klonoa is a 2.5D game, meaning that while Klonoa can only move left/right on a plane, there are occasionally overlapping planes that correspond to the visible paths Klonoa walks on. If the planes overlap, Klonoa can jump between them. In some cases, this is intended, but it can also be used to easily save time like at the end of 1-1 and the end of 2-1.

	""Moo squishing" is a technique where you "squish" your "moo" under doors that it's not supposed to be able to go under. It's done by running left/right towards the place you want to clip, and then facing down before colliding with the wall. It'll preserve your momentum and not check for collision with moo, allowing them to "squish" under the door.

	"Throughout the run, we collect enough dreamstones to enter Pamela with 46. This is important as Pamela's RNG is dependant on your dreamstone count. Pamela has 3 attacks: Bubbles, Lunge, and Spike. By far the slowest attack pattern is to have one with bubbles in it, because of how slow it is. Whether an attack has bubbles or not is 6n+4. This TAS gets 6(7)+4, but technically 6(6)+4 could've worked as well. But the reason I don't go with 40 or something else is because between attacks she can do a twirl animation, which can lose ~4 seconds, so that also has to be avoided. This fight has you grab Seadoph off of Pamela's back when she lunges at you, or when he jumps onto a spike ball, and then throwing it at Pamela.

Right after his first meatball attack, he's supposed to jump and stay suspended in the air, until falling back down and allowing you to hit him. However, you can damage boost into his shell right after his invincibility ends (soon after his meatball is thrown) and attack him again, skipping the jump attack. This alone saves ~10 seconds. After that repeat hitting him when his invincibility ends.

Instead we can deathwarp back to the hub if we die during the cutscene that raises the next pillar. In the 2nd corridor, we break an armored moo and inflate him with our Wind bullet.
