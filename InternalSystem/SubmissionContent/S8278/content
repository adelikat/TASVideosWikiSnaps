	"With the dagger, the fastest way to defeat the enemies is with a torpedo attack off a wall. But if a wall is too far away to rebound from, the power attack is the faster option. The vault combos are also used in some situations. If a double or triple knock down can be setup with a torpedo then that is worth some time spent. The moon tank route is carefully planned in a way that the mega freeze power once obtained can be used with maximum effect.
