	"Gotcha is a zapper game for NES that also mixes in the use of the controller.  The plot is that you are in a paintball fight with another team.  The object is to go to the other teams flag, take it, and bring it back while stopping them from taking your flag.  The game has 3 levels, but loops them endlessly.  I play the first 3 levels and stop, since there is no ending sequence to that game.  I played on the hardest difficulty.  In this difficulty the enemies are more numerous, and the time they spend aiming at you is shorter (thus requiring better reflexes).
