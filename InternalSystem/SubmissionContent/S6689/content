In order to do this, I make sure that the first hit is two bullets shot, and avoid hitting the boss from the sides (the boss hitbox is simply a square). Right after beating the 3rd loop, I press B button to commit suicide, because you need to restart the play in order to access the other minigames.

When you land you lose speed, except if you jump again in the same frame you land. Some basic routing was necessary for optimizing subpixel and speed when touching the end line, in order for the playable character to walk outside of the screen sooner.

To check that, the movie will have to be redone, otherwise it's hard to theorize an improvement here. Maybe it won't help even if you reach 2k before the 3rd boss. I'd leave this test for a future TAS iteration. I also checked bosses' HP and all bullets do hit them, none is obscured by projectiles.
