	"Ninja Gaiden is a game that invites you to go full violence: you get a sword, you get weapons, you break things, you kill enemies. However, it is also possible to beat the game without harming anything but the end-of-stage bosses. Even the final boss --the Demon-- can be treated nicely, only killing it by hitting its heart, and not his head, tail or shrimps.

[div class=p

		"My work on this category started shortly after Scum and I were done with the any% variant, having improved that one by a single frame. feos had asked me if I was planning to do the pacifist run, pointing me to the unfinished work by MESHUGGAH. It seemed like a good choice because I had all the knowledge for NG1 already and the bot ready to go. Little did I know that pacifist is a whole different monster. I can divide this adventure in two stages:
		$LF
	]div
	[div class=p 
		"At first, I assumed I could just re-do the entire movie, only using the MESHUGGAH's movie as reference. After a week of painful progress, winning and losing many frames to RNG and enemy manipulation, I ended up on stage 3-1 15 frames ahead (see:

		" This is where my progress came to a halt. After two days of work, I could not make 3-1 work without losing all 15 frames. At this point I decided that I was tackling this project wrong, and decided to pursue another strategy.
		$LF
	]div
	[div class=p 
		"The second stage consisted of me figuring out that my job was to finish the previous work, not to create something anew. After this realization, the project became fun again and I could dedicate my efforts to completing the last few stages without pressure. Even then, I managed to find many (supposed) improvements to the way these stages were solved. What I'm proud of the most, is the fact that I totally squeezed the Ninja HP stock (a precious resource), ending Stage 6 with only 1 HP left. This strategy could have backfired, but in the end avoiding death saved a ton of frames compared to previous attempts.
		$LF

I am 99.9% convinced that many more frames can be saved without too much effort (other than resyncing). So this movie is an invitation to both old and new players to hone their TASing skills and see if they can beat my execution of 6-1 onwards, or MESHUGGAH and company's execution, 6-1 backwards.

]div
[ul 
	[li 
		" Enemy Spawn Delay (ESD) trick: This one consists of pressing L/R alternatively just before an enemy appears. By doing this, the screen keeps scrolling, but the procedure that checks whether an enemy/item must appear is not checked. Therefore, one can use this to 'delay' an enemy spawn by a few pixels/subpixels. However, if done for enough frames, it is possible to outright prevent the appearance of said enemy. This technique allows clearing up the path out of hard-blocking enemies, without having to kill them.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" RNG Manipulation: The game contains a global timer which keeps advancing through stages. This means that delaying pressing S during a cutscene can make it possible to start the next stage with a more favorable RNG.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Enemy Slot Manipulation: The game allows for having a maximum of 8 concurrent enemies on screen. When a new enemy spawns, most of its attributes are reset to its proper values. However, some values are not refreshed, leading to some crazy effects like 
		[a href=https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1497514873 rel=noopener external nofollow 
			"Joecurr's pre-kill
		]a
		". Another value that is not refreshed is the enemy's X subpixel, which is then inherited from the previous enemy to the new enemy occupying the same slot. By altering the order in which enemies spawn or de-spawn, it is possible to assign new enemies a favorable X subpixel. This is a crucial aspect in many skips in this movie and any future movies in this category.
