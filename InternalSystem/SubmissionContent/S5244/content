	"Machanics: Mario's Xspeed is greater when he is sliding down most slopes in the game, but the are exceptions, like in 7-Castle, which slows Mario down instead. A wall jump boost is used every time when there is a wall close enough to perform it when exiting a pipe, which helps Mario to gain momentum incredibly fast. Some slopes are too steep to perform a enemy-stomping acceleration, but it is performed on possible slopes like in 1-1. When Mario is on a vine, his speed is actually faster than running, so jumping shortly after grabbing a vine allows Mario to maintain his momentum, but his jump off a vine is very low. Mario's Yspeed is greater when he is flying, so parts of vertical levels uses more flying than jumping to save time.
