	"Sonic the Hedgehog - Pocket Adventure is classic 2D Sonic action, except on one of the most obscure systems known to man, the Neo Geo Pocket Color. It more or less takes the themes of the Sonic 2 zones, renames them and makes new levels around them. It also uses Sonic 3 & Knuckles music in the most confusing method possible.

	" Running
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Normal max running speed is 2048. If you are below that value you will increase in speed until you reach it. If you start running at above that value (usually done by jumping onto a downwards slope), you will maintain that speed until something causes you to slow down. However, while running, your speed will never go above 3840. If you have speedshoes, your speed will build until it reaches 3840.
	$LF

[h4 
	" Rolling
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Max rolling speed is 3824. If you roll along flat ground you will gradually lose speed but if you do it on a slope you will gain speed.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Spindash
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Spindash has a max rev of 8. It starts at 0 with the first button press and goes up from there. Rev will frequently increase by more than 1 at a time so you only need a total of 6 button presses to get max rev, the last must be the frame you let go of down to get 8. Note that it costs 0 frames to go from 0 to 2 so 2 is more or less the minimum spindash used throughout the TAS.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Also worth noting Sonic cannot crouch and therefore spindash if he is on the edge of a platform doing the balancing animation. You also need to be at close to a standstill to crouch instead of roll.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Jumping
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"If you enter the air you will gradually lose horizontal speed until it reaches 1984 (if you are holding right, otherwise it will go below that). However, if you press jump, you will maintain the horizontal speed for a little longer depending on how long you hold jump. Bouncing off enemies will also freeze the horizontal speed value for a little while.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Slope Jumps
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"These work more or less how you expect with one exception. If you jump on the first frame you touch a downwards slope, you don't really lose any vertical speed over jumping on flat ground but still gain a lot of horizontal speed. Jumping onto a downwards slope will result in huge speed gains, depending on the angle of the slope.

	" Horizontal Springs

	"I tried doing a downward slope jump right before the platform with the ring box and land on it to maintain speed but the ring box would either just block me or bounce up and crush me. The speedshoes are critical for the end of this stage. This strategy for skipping the loop was found by dekutony and I found it to be several frames faster than my old strategy. In order to get the jump onto the steep part of the downwards slope I had to pass through the spring, which is possible at max speed with some controlled positioning. I could save an extra increment of IGT here by holding jump for longer at the very last slope jump, however this would cause me to enter the bonus ring so I don't do it. I don't "GET MORE CHAOS EMERALD!" as the game puts it because it would require me to do the Sonic 2 bonus game 6 times and I would really rather not make people sit through that.

It's not extremely relevant in this level but it's more in the next. The jump where I avoided hitting the bumper and the wall and landed on the platform at the end is fairly precise. The end of the level also features one of the rare cases where jumping over an upwards slope is faster since the end of level trigger is right there.

	"Diamond44444444, a time trial/RTA runner for the game suggested I use the flippers to get on top of the conveyor belt and spindash from there instead of what is done in RTA, and it turned out to be faster. That block is on a local cycle that starts as soon as I get close enough and so I pretty much have to wait for it. The spindash jump out of the elevator was a fun little thing I found. It's faster to do a regular jump over the spikes at the end then to do a spindash jump because you will build downwards speed faster by doing so.

The spindash jump is very precise, you can't hit the drop in the ceiling and you still have to make it to the other side. The next spindash jump is precise too, I don't do max rev because I would just hit the side of the next block. The pistons that launch you up into the air are on local cycles that start as soon as you get close enough. No you can't spindash off the launch you get from them, the launch will eat any horizontal speed unfortunately. Dodging the attacks of the preying mantis robots can be fairly tricky. I timed jumping onto the conveyor and then the platform to be faster than doing a single slope jump onto it. The next spindash jump is fairly precise due to the preying mantis robot.
