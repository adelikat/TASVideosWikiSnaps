	"zer0 made two runs of this game. His 
	[a class=intlink href=/353S 
		"first run
	]a
	" is the currently published one. He made a new 
	[a class=intlink href=/1038S 
		"faster version
	]a
	" in april 2006, but he realized that there were parts, that could be improved. Unfortunately he cancelled the submission, due to shortage of time. So after his long marathon, I picked it up again and finished the last meters. Thus, he put probably more work into this project than me, work from which I could benefit. I want to give him full credit for that.
