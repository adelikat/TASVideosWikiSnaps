	"However, while it is optimal at times, and the game's RNG is a very painful matter, it has many flaws and at some times sloppy. Swordless Link, with the help of me, started TASing this in 2007, which finished the 4th dungeon. While that has been obsolete thanks to new findings, like the Text Warp, it's still using several strategies in certain rooms that are faster than this submission. The WIP was posted in the forums and dungeon TASes could easily be found on Youtube with a simple search. Despite this, the submitter claimed to not know of any other TAS WIPs than Drenn's, also posted in the forums, which shows a lack of general research. Some strategies are also found in the published Oracle of Seasons TAS.
