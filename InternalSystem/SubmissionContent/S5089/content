	"This movie uses multiple exploits to beat the game as fast as possible, such as an exploit called "text warping", that forces the game to move link to the next room even if the exit is designed to take him somewhere else.
	$LF
	"The game's random number generator is also only called when specific actions happen, such as swinging the sword. Due to this, enemies can be easily avoided and rupees can be dug up in large amounts at a time very easily.

[p 
	"After getting the harp, I use a text warp to get to rolling ridge, and use a Like Like to get Link out of the tree. This accomplishes two things, getting bombs early from a chest skips a cutscene, and getting pegasus seeds early lets Link move much faster.

	"The Map Data of most houses and some caves is stored on the outside of the map, which explains why text warping takes Link to where it does.

	"The last glitch of the run, veran warp, can be used in many ways, including a way to complete the map in a non-linked game. The map was previously unable to be completed.

	"The main difficult part of making this movie was getting the RNG to work well, because I had to manually make it progress instead of just waiting on or two frames before entering the next room.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This movie is not completely optimized yet, mainly due to the item duplication method on tokay island being discovered halfway through making it, thus slightly obsoleting the expert's ring.

	"However, while it is optimal at times, and the game's RNG is a very painful matter, it has many flaws and at some times sloppy. Swordless Link, with the help of me, started TASing this in 2007, which finished the 4th dungeon. While that has been obsolete thanks to new findings, like the Text Warp, it's still using several strategies in certain rooms that are faster than this submission. The WIP was posted in the forums and dungeon TASes could easily be found on Youtube with a simple search. Despite this, the submitter claimed to not know of any other TAS WIPs than Drenn's, also posted in the forums, which shows a lack of general research. Some strategies are also found in the published Oracle of Seasons TAS.
