			[li 
				"The max-damage uppercut trick originally used in the Super Macho Man fight is used to speed up phases 1 and 3. But there's a catch: Honda doesn't lower his guard before the star hits, so the only way for these stars to do max damage is if they hit right as he's about to do an uppercut. So to do this fight without wasting time, I have to manipulate a very specific attack pattern in phase 1. And Honda I's pattern is one of the most complex and random ones in the game.

			[li 
				"Bald Bull's guard doesn't speed up until 0:30, which makes it possible to land one more jab after the first hook in phase 2. This single extra hit completely changes the fight. I no longer need an extra star in phase 1, allowing me to save a second there. It also means I can quickly get 3 stars in phase 2, allowing a much faster phase 3.

		"Piston Honda II: 39.97 (was 50.25)
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				"The first improvement found, and by far the largest. The thing about max damage uppercuts is that in addition to doing, well, maximum damage, they cannot be dodged. This gets rid of a huge delay in phase 2 where normally I'd have to wait for Honda's eyebrows. Combined with the extra damage, the result is that almost half the total improvement is in this fight.

		"Soda Popinski: 43.48 (was 45.25)
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				"Soda's misdirection gutters are used six times in the fight. Four of them are to throw a blocked punch sooner, and the other two are to counter one of his uppercuts. These gutters require tool assistance, and each only has a 25% chance to get past his guard.

				"In phase 1 I'm able to skip having a punch blocked by delaying the third hit. Also, toward the end I counter his mini-spin punch -- there's only one frame to do this -- to get the last two hits in faster. Unfortunately there's nothing else; whenever Macho does his super spin punch the game sets the clock ahead to the next second, which prevents any other improvements from working.
