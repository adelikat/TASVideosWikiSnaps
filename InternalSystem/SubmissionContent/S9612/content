		"You are a detective this time, we choose the bad guy (don't know the context). We chase after him. Head right as left leads to a dead end. Don't get the bike as we lose focus. (Goes to the Lawson store to buy food and sleep lmao) Then, continue to chase hIm and we find the bad guy at the park. The camera stays in one place as the detective chases him until you click on the bad guy. The bad guy stumbles after you click on him, beat him up, and take him in for a punishment.
