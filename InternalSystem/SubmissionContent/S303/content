	" Fighting
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Before getting downstab, my fighting technique against 
	$LF
	"shieldless, large enemies is to crouch & stab immediately 
	$LF
	"followed by a jump & stab. This is a different style from 
	$LF
	"what is seen in Boco's and Palatinum's movies. At the first 
	$LF
	"large enemy that I fought, I tried 5 or 6 different 
	$LF
	"fighting techniques, and this one gave the lowest frame 
	$LF
	"count.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"With downstab, enemies (usually Iron Knuckles) can be hit 
	$LF
	"in open spaces 1 or 2 times without slowing down. In areas 
	$LF
	"with low ceilings, Link can downstab every other frame 
	$LF
	"theoretically, but often it is necessary to wait another 
	$LF
	"frame so that Link doesn't fall off the enemy. Against 
	$LF
	"bosses, downstabbing is more difficult because they move 
	$LF
	"differently and there is no ceiling.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Fairies
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Fairies can only go through locked doors if Link has 0 
	$LF
	"keys. Otherwise they will use the key.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Whether going up or down, fairies can get off an elevator 
	$LF
	"quicker than Link's normal form.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" 6-Count
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Every 6th large and 6th small enemy will drop either a 
	$LF
	"magic jar or P-Bag. The 6 count has to be accurately planned 
	$LF
	"out (I have done this.)
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Randomness
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Link's timing is the source of much randomness in the game. 
	$LF
	"The blocks that fall in some palaces are determined by the 
	$LF
	"timing of Link's entry to the room. The Stalfos' jumping 
	$LF
	"and sword swinging is effected by timing. Dripping devices 
	$LF
	"are determined by Link's timing right before the device 
	$LF
	"enters the screen. (I had to manipulate one to drip an 
	$LF
	"enemy on the first drop.)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"On the overworld, only some enemy formations are effected 
	$LF
	"by Link's timing. There are others that will appear in the 
	$LF
	"same formation at a determined time even if Link does not 
	$LF
	"move. This is why all timeattack attempts have had problems 
	$LF
	"manipulating the second fixed battle square on the way to 
	$LF
	"the Great Palace.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"However, what an enemy drops (in the 6-Count) is based on 
	$LF
	"what position they are at when the fatal blow is delivered.

	" Improvement to Boco's Movie
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This movie is better than Boco's because a) it uses a 
	$LF
	"restart sequence b) it uses better routes c) it is played 
	$LF
	"more precisely.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I estimate that the improvement for each category is:
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"~100 seconds improved by using a restart sequence
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"~95 seconds improved by better routes
	[br

	$LF

	" Important Japan-to-USA Changes
	$LF
]h3
[h4 
	" Name
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The Japanese game for 
	(__wikiLink|FDS)
	" is called The Legend of Zelda 
	$LF
	"2 - Link no Bouken. The American game is called Zelda II: 
	$LF
	"The Adventure of Link.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Leveling Up
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"In Link no Bouken, when you reach the next point level, you 
	$LF
	"can choose any of the 3 categories. This allows the 
	$LF
	"possibility to get Attack to level 8 quickly. However, when 
	$LF
	"you lose all of your lives or use the game restart 
	$LF
	"sequence, all of your levels even out to whatever your 
	$LF
	"lowest level is. For example, if your levels are 7-1-1 when 
	$LF
	"picking up Magic Container 6 and you use the game restart 
	$LF
	"sequence, your levels will become 1-1-1. This is why in 
	$LF
	"Death Mountain I must level to 3-3-3 despite that improving 
	$LF
	"Life is otherwise unnecessary in the timeattack. The 
	$LF
	"benefits of using the game restart sequence easily outweigh 
	$LF
	"the time lost for the 3 levels that are wasted (2 levels 
	$LF
	"for balancing in Death Mountain and 1 lost after level 1. 
	$LF
	"Each level up takes approximately 3.07 seconds.) 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In The Adventure of Link, levels aren't lost if they are 
	$LF
	"unbalanced upon restarting, but they require more points to 
	$LF
	"attain. Also, there is the option of declining the level up 
	$LF
	"in order to use the points for something else. In Link no 
	$LF
	"Bouken, you cannot cancel the level up.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Item Pickup
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Fairies cannot pick up items. (Different from USA 
	$LF
	"version.) Link must stab an item to pick it up; he does not 
	$LF
	"grab it like in the US version.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Elevators
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Elevators move significantly slower in the Japanese
	$LF
	"version than in the US version.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Palace Layouts
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Palace 4 has a dripping device in the room before Carock. 
	$LF
	"The small magic jar that I get here from the bot must be 
	$LF
	"acquired earlier in the US version, because the dripping 
	$LF
	"device is absent from this room in the US version.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Bosses
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"In Palace 5 there is a boss fight with Horsehead at the 
	$LF
	"fake wall. In the US version, a blue Iron Knuckle guards 
	$LF
	"this spot.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Also in Palace 5, the end boss is a more difficult version 
	$LF
	"of Helmethead. In the US version, Gooma is here.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In Palace 6, the dragon looks less intimidating and moves
	$LF
	"differently than that in the US version. The Japanese
	$LF
	"dragon rises up into the curtains and then retreats 
	$LF
	"(if you let him. :P) The US dragon doesn't rise as high and 
	$LF
	"will pause. Also there is a thin platform on the left side 
	$LF
	"of the room in the Japanese version that is absent in the 
	$LF
	"US version.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Loading
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The 'WAIT' screen appears when Link enters palaces, towns, 
	$LF
	"or new areas. There were somewhere around 36 instances of 
	$LF
	"the 'WAIT' screen; each time it takes about 4 seconds.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Minor Things
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Palaces 1-6 are only white or green. In the US version they 
	$LF
	"use different wall sprites and are much more colorful.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Overworld enemies are different looking. Stronger enemies 
	$LF
	"are blue, weaker enemies are gold, and fairies are red. 
	$LF
	"There are a few other minor graphical differences, like the 
	$LF
	"animated water.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Some enemies' experience points are different.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Some sounds are different even when emulated correctly.

	$LF
]h3
[h4 
	" Overworld / Fixed Battle Squares
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Any indirect movement or stopping in the overworld is 
	$LF
	"necessary to avoid random battles and/or to make them occur 
	$LF
	"on the fixed battle squares.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Palace 1
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Getting the 2 keys in palace 1 may look dorky, but it's 
	$LF
	"about 30 seconds faster than getting them in palace 2. 
	$LF
	"Despite that someone tells Link to 'use keys in palaces
	$LF
	"they are found in,' keys work in other palaces.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Palace 4
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"It is always a mistake to leave the palace after getting 
	$LF
	"the boots. Here I not only didn't leave the palace, but I 
	$LF
	"didn't need to go up to the statue in order to get the red 
	$LF
	"magic jar refill.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Great Palace
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The ceiling-walking route is about 12 seconds faster
	$LF
	"than the traditional route. The only issue with it is that
	$LF
	"Link must have level 8 magic to use fairy, jump, and 
	$LF
	"thunder without refilling.

	" Programming Errors & Oddities
	$LF
]h3
[h4 
	" Elevators
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Moving downward in elevators doesn't act the same way as 
	$LF
	"moving upward.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When moving downward, Link refuses to walk left or right. 
	$LF
	"I attack the wall to bounce Link where I want him to be. 
	$LF
	"Link can get off of the elevator once his shield is 
	$LF
	"underneath the ceiling.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When moving upward, Link is able to walk left or right. 
	$LF
	"When getting off the elevator, his feet do not have to be 
	$LF

[h4 
	" Downstab
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"In the correct position, when Link stops a downstab attack 
	$LF
	"it will do another attack on an enemy. An example of this 
	$LF
	"is in the first room of palace 5. This tactic is used on 
	$LF
	"the bosses as well.

]h4
