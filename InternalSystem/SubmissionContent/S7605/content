	"In Royal Rescue. you search the Dark Castle for the princess and attempt to rescue her from the fiery dragon. The castle is a labyrinth of rooms connected by halls, doorways, and stairs. Each room is filled with treasures, keys, and the keepers of the castle-the deadly Pink Marshmallows. So get ready. If you're not quick and quick-witted, you'll soon find yourself well done!

	"Because of my choice to TAS Astro-Panic!, in April of 2021, I decided to see if Compute's Gazette had any other interesting and TAS worthy games. Well, in the November 1989 issue, Compute's Gazette started highlighting specific articles and/or games publications with a special status called "Editor's Choice". As you can imagine, these were higher quality than normal submissions for an issue. I ran across "Royal Rescue"...a game that brings back great memories and one of the better publications in the series. It's also a plat-former, which was rare for subscription holders to witness...with a definite ending and screens to explore. One of the reasons I selected this game, is that it had a few spots that were very hard for a human to execute. In fact, there is one spot that I believe is TAS only, where waiting is required by human effort.

	"This game was a fun little effort that mostly was straight forward. Rushing through this too quickly almost hurt me on some opportunities. Thankfully, the experiences I've had from other games allowed me to test ideas out with satisfaction.  Even though this game has simple execution, there are some creative ways to cut time. I never thought about these techniques in my youth, but thankfully...I have them now and they paid off. Below, the "Room By Room Description" will outline some of those ideas used to help out.

By dying, you are returned back to your original entry point...without loosing current inventory. After all keys are collected, an escape is made quickly to the left.

	"Room 5: This room might be TAS only, in terms of not having to stop. The trick to dodging the Marshmallows, is to enter this room on the left side of the ladder, from Room 3. This trick works because each room has a timer and a static starting point for the enemies. This barely works by one frame, but a Human could possible perform this...if they don't hesitate a single frame.

	"Room 7: Here is a very tough jumping situation. Personally, I am not able to easily perform this jump consistenly; however, practice can certainly show ease of effort. The only run, on YouTube, wasn't able to do it easily either. So, this is the perfect job for a TAS. :)

	"Room 8: As with all other rooms, this room also has a static pattern for how the Marshmallows start off. For a human, I see that an approaching enemy makes a direction choice nerve racking, due to the uncertainty of avoidance. The climbing pattern is doable by humans though.

	" did a review of this, so this overall looks good to go. The disk was distributed in a magazine and is easily accessible, so this seems like a good way to handle it. It's fascinating to me that these games were meant to be typed in manually from a magazine. Accepting!
