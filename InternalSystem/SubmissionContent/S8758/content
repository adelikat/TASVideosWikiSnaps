However, due to the limited number of lives that we have for the entire run, it ends up being faster to not die in level 4 and die in level 5 instead. Team 2 had the fastest level 4 without a death, and we were not able to improve on them. They're too good.

He spawns offscreen and will fire at you as soon as you're within a certain distance. The hitbox is ridiculous, and it passes through solid walls to hit you. (so clipping into those blocks doesn't save you). The strategy is to make him fire immediately as he appears so that there will still be enough room to stand between the wall and flamethrower and shoot him throughout his whole animation. After the boss is dead you need to get to the left side of the screen and kill the molotov punk to end the level.

[div class=p 
	"For the few who haven't kept up with the story so far the mayor was kidnapped back in stage 4 and replaced with a decoy. The FAKE mayor is now the final boss. The first obstacle is a stack of crates tall enough that you can't jump over them. You're supposed to wait for a barrel that comes in from off-screen and jump off it to get over the wall, but most teams found a way to clip into the wall and jump over it to reach the boss. The problem with that strategy is that the boss spawns on the ground below the crates where you can't reach him. (So even though you can go all the way left, you can't really do anything until he jumps up on the crates with you.) Some teams brought the shotgun so that the angled shot could reach him, but you have limited bullets and then you still have to wait for him to jump up to you for close combat. If you clip into the wall of crates at the start of the fight, though, you can fire through the wall while still being low enough to hit him when he appears. This presents another problem where you're so far away from the edge of the screen that the bullet limit for the shotgun and pistol was reached. I managed to grab the machine gun earlier in the level which lets me have 8 bullets on the screen at once for non-stop fake-mayor killing action.
