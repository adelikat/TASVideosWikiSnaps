[p 
	"The biggest difference is that I used more "skips".There are 8 fields in this game.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Every field has its secret method to skip.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"For example,in act2 field 1,breaking the wall above the magma can lead to a secret place,
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"where you can choose the normal way or a different one.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If the "skip" way is chosen,you only have to complete 2 acts then it comes the BOSS stage while the normal way has 3 acts.

[p 
	"Fields 1,3,7,8 belong to this kind.
	$LF

[p 
	"Another kind of skip is more useful to save time,in that place you can choose to ignore the last acts of this field and fly to the next one directly,
	$LF

	"as in field 2,5 and 6.

	]li

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Too many time sticks will waste time at the end of an act zone.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In act 1,stage 1,stepping on the obstacle will waste a little time but at the same time release the time sticks by two.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"But we can't judge if it is faster or not by our eyes.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"So I played this act in too ways:using obstacle and no obstacle.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Then the whole length frames of this act is 2054 to 2058.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"That's why I stepped on the obstacle consciously,it's 4 frames faster.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Avoiding the fruits is not so easy.As in act4,stage1 above the clouds.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"But in later steges of this game,there is not so many fruits like before and the bad insect can release the time sticks rapidly.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"These all help to keep the time stick just at one.It's the perfect case.

[ul

		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"To find the answer we can go through the same act twice using too different beasts,no lag and no fruits in both plays.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"At last we find it's always two time sticks fewer using the flying beast than the rolling one.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Does it mean that the big bird is slower? 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"No.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Observing it carefully we can discover a secret that at the beginning of an act,if using the rolling animal we will have EIGHT time sticks while using the bird we only have SIX sticks.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Always two sticks fewer just tell us that the two beasts have the SAME speed.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"But using the bird is easier for us to keep the time stick just at one.
