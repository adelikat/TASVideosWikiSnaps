	"Often abbreviated as DDG it makes Abe invisible allowing him to get past things that would kill him. Abe will die if he falls of a ledge or gets zapped. A video made by Sligfantry can show you how this gltich works:

	"Auto Turn Delay Glitch
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"This glitch works by standing on the edge of the ledge and pressing the down button quickly and run towards a spot where you would like to hoist down. You will need to press either 'left/down' or 'up/down' depending on which direction Abe was facing.

	"Stop Turn
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"By timing this glitch perfectly you can make Abe stop and turn. Combing it with the auto turn glitch above a ledge you will be able to make Abe do a backwards jump. This will allow you to jump backwards to areas and skip Zulags. In a 100% run it will allow you to get to secret areas quicker and it skips a section of StockYards Escape after finishing the secret area. Sligfantry's video can show you how this glitch works:

	"This is one of the biggest changes in this run. The bees in this area allows us to skip Paramonia and Scrabiana completley! Also, you can set up an auto turn glitch using the bees which allows Abe to do a backwards jump so that Abe can avoid dropping down the ledge and killing himsslf. There is also an 'auto turn' glitch setup to make the backwards jump work. Lastly, there was a small time saver done at the start of the stage where Abe does the backwards jump a few frames earlier than the previous run.

	"April 14th, 2011, the first attempt to skip Paramonia and Scrabania; talking to a Slig at the correct frame makes it walk straight forward. It works in a lot of places, but not in Monsaic Lines. December 1st, 2012, the Death Delay Glitch brought the possibility to skip them back to life. We then found a way to set up the DDG by bees. But a "dead" Abe can't survive a fall from high ledges,  also, you can't set up the Auto Turn Delay after the DDG there; not enough room to run. So, a way to set up the running DDG should solve our problem. March 25th, 2013, Paramonia's skip was found, and with it a new way to set up the DDG; running instead of jumping. June 6th, 2014, we finally figured how to set up the running DDG with bees. Sadly, the DDG cancels the Auto Turn Delay, what a bummer. A few hours latter a new trick was found; the Bee Auto Turn Delay, and with it, the last piece of the puzzle was added. Now we can finally skip Paramonia and Scrabania. Only one question remains; what's next?

Also I need to thank Feos for providing us a fix so that now we can use the TAS GPU plugin in Abe games and also he does a great job in encoding the run with the best sound quality!
