	"Super 3D Portals 6 is a homebrew game made by Hincy that's, well, Portal. For the Atari. It follows the popular avenger Hawkeye as he escapes Saw traps. Idk, this game has no plot I'm making this up. There are only 10 levels before it loops, so I TAS until there's no more new content, like every Atari game ever.

	"Portals travel rather slow in this game, so minor amounts of waiting is required whenever I need to fire a portal a long distance. Significant amount of time is saved on the last set of portals by doing an exploit that lets me do a full jump when exiting a portal, letting me skip some waiting on the orange portal traveling.
