		"Flying - When character walks up stair, reachs to top of stair and player continues to hold up direction, let's say continue holding up button "activates" this glitch. Jump up left or right direction then in midair, release all buttons except up arrow causes character flying into that direction. Until player press any of extra button, as long as up button is still held, glitch is still active until letting it go. Letting go of up button deactivates glitch until player use the stair again anywhere, it is necessary to let up button go in order to "walk" thru door. Flying glitch allows player to float over things without having to jumping up and down, and it allows player to going thru few of the invisible walls which saves some time, but not out-of-bound wall.

		"Dying - Game has 3 lives and 2 continues which allows 8 deaths, 9th death is "game over". When character runs out of live, and press and hold start button before "press start to continue" screen comes up seem to be instantaneous. Dying, in most rooms, causes character respawns back to beginning which saves a lot time. Freezer and Furance room is exception: after saving Wednesday, dying respawns character near where Wednesday was next to life-up, and after saving Grandma, dying respawns character right under where Grandma was.

		"Secret treasure room doors - In each of treasure room, there are 4 secret doors leading to each of colored bone rooms (red, blue, green, and death pit), probably developer mistakenly mimicking crypt area. At first it seemed useless due to player having to "go" to crypt place as first objective to obtain key to the house, plus going thru secret door in treasure room causes character fall down under ground and then locks up game. Player can make use of death to respawn character at proper place and skip the whole traveling out of pool and backyard which saves a lot time.

		"Go Thru-Wall - This only works if character has momentum (sliding on ice or swimming movement) or standing up from ducking, so as long as player don't press direction button, character can go thru walls.

	": This run got really strong feedback and votes, and there's a reason. One can very clearly see how well it was planned (damage and deaths) and executed (glitches), so I'm moving this to Moons, while still obsoleting the old Vault run.
