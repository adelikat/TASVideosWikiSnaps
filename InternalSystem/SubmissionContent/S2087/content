	"This run aims to complete all dungeons/temples/Ganon trials as quickly as possible. I originally had the idea of TASing this run to see what kind of time could be achieved in an all temples/trials run which implements the recently discovered "TAS-only" tricks that wouldn't be seen in a modern any% run. One key element in this run is the use of sidehopping over backwalking, which has been proven faster in most cases. Supersliding is also one method of travel used over the current published run and is the fastest form of travel over long distances. The initial goal was to achieve sub-3:30, but with more tricks being discovered throughout the run I was able to achieve sub-3:00. A lot of hard work was put into this project, so overall, I'm very happy with the outcome of this run.
