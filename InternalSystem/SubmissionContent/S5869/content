	"This 6:58 run is an improvement of my previous TAS completed in 8:03 (http://tasvideos.org/5849S.html). New combo use, better routes, and better understanding of enemy AI allowed me to complete a much cleaner run.

	"With some more research on knockdown behavior for Adobo/Green Bolos - and some minor cleanups on new combo strats, I think it's possible to shave an additional ~20 seconds off Double Dragon TAS's

The boss is on a global timer after the first round of enemies dies - so there's no point in killing the two whip girls any faster, the boss will still come out at exact same time.
