	"Thank you for your submission. Unfortunately, this run doesn't differ itself from the published run enough to warrant publishing in a separate branch, so I'm afraid I will have to reject it for goal choice.

	"As for the lowest score add-on, changing the goal without changing the movie rarely accomplishes anything unless it's done for the purposes of adding clarity. We allow crazy and weird goals on this site, but when that happens, judgment is based on the resulting movie with the goals only being a mechanism to have the movie produced.
