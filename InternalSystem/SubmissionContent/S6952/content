Teddy bear acts like shield in battle and when it's broken when taking around 100 damage total. When teddy bear is destroyed then you use consumable item next to bear at the same time in battle, item you used will still remain and only bear will disappear from your inventory.

Anyway, My skip approach was 1) Set most left barricade to sprite #00, 2) Have enemy spawn at the top of screen top of screen as much as possible then spawn some left of screen for minimizing lags. 3) The leftmost barricade is swapped by 22nd object. Different walking path can change which object will occupy sprite number very frequently, I couldn't go for just shortest path possible. 841 frames saved due to mainly route change and better Onett skip, less menu RNG manipulations)

Old TAS did getting 2 colds strategy but it's much slower because only Urban zombie has infect cold move so you have to waste a turn just for that.  In this TAS, I used skip sandwich to heal infected character's HP so that message will appear. Someone has to be alive until reaching underground (or it can be said failing hole), cookie is needed to keep alive cold character.

	"Encountering Bionic kraken for Gutsy Bat, Ness's weapon. (steal probability is 1/128) It gives 100 Offence and 127 Guts. Guts is used for critical hit (it's called SMAAAASH!! in the game) formula, Guts/500. When ness equips that, critical rate becomes around 34% from 8%. Old TASes have equipped it before Giygas battle but octopuscal, Mother 2 speedrunner found equipping bat "during" battle was faster. In Giygas battle, Heavily Armed Pokey uses a very stinky gas on 1st turn and lowers party's offence. When ness equips already, his offence is lowered by 10 but if he doesn't, it becomes only 4. That difference is very important because it allows Ness to hit over 400 damage. You need to beat Pokey (HP 2000) then 2nd phase of Giygas (HP 2000). So there is no need to rely on other characters to compensate for small damage anymore. After finishing 2nd phase, Only Paula's pray works so I let Giygas do incomprehensive attack (Flash Ω) to faint Ness, which was a second faster than not doing. Nothing new was done after battle but you can enjoy super long credits then movie end. 1452 frames saved. (4815 frames ahead)

Naturally, for me, this was no exception. Having missed the previous publication, things like the Onett skip absolutely blindsided me, and the rest of the manipulation and routing in general was just astonishing to watch play out in front of me. There were times where I felt like if I blinked, I'd have completely missed half the game... Though, granted, even when you're watching intently, the TAS itself misses about 90% of the game just on principle.
