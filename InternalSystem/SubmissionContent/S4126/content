	" is one of the games from the second generation of the Pokémon games. Compared to the previous series, 
	[em 
		"Pokémon Red and Blue
	]em
	", many new features and gameplay changes were introduced. And it turned out that one of the features, storing the game corner coins in a coin case that is, would allow to beat Red in under an hour, while never defeating the Elite Four in the first place.

	"This is my second, way better attempt of using Coin Case glitches to beat the game; you can see my previous (absolutely failed) attempt here:

[p 
	"The run uses only two glitches: Pokémon cloning glitch and the Coin Case glitch. The Coin Case glitch is what the run is focusing on, since it allows for getting the Holy Grail of glitches - arbitrary code execution.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"On Pokémon Gold/Silver, there is a popular glitch involving opening the Coin Case after listening to Machop/Machamp's cry. Usually it just causes the game to restart in a weird color scheme - however, there is much more to it than expected. The Coin Case text script is improperly terminated, so the game tries to execute commands past the actual script, leading to arbitrary code execution. This text script error causes the game to jump to address $E112. By listening to specific cries, manipulating the party Pokémon list and by standing in specific locations on the map, it is possible to redirect that accidental jump to a useful location, giving me a possibility to run my own code by storing specific items into the PC box.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"So the goal of the run is to turn the Coin Case's bad habit of executing arbitrary code into our favor, by forcing it to:

	". We already have a possiblity to execute some code, by storing items into the PC box. Now, how to make the code do everything mentioned above? Since we can execute anything directly on the console/emulator, it's possible to write any part of memory. So everything can be done by just changing a couple memory addresses:
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" DA00 -> 03, DA01 -> 56: Will warp me to Mt. Silver after leaving the current building.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" D8A3 -> 00: Will make Red appear on Mt. Silver.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" DA22 -> 00: Will cause the game to think I don't have any Pokémon, allowing me to instantly win the battle with Red.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"To change those addresses, I created a simple "memory writer" program, which allows me to write a more complicated "memory writer" program, which finally writes the memory addresses I want.

				"Doing everything possible with just items is not a great idea, since we don't want going around the whole region just to get necessary items. A better solution is to make a simple program, which will write to a specified memory location, and jump to it afterwards. The first argument, controlled by the quantity of Potions, is the lower 4 bits of the byte I want to write. Quantity of Fresh Water controls the high 4 bits. Then the amount of X-Accuracies controls the least significant byte of the address to write, with the most significant one is always 0xDB. This allows me to write something more complicated to the (DB01-DB10) address range.
