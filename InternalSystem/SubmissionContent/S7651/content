	"Kingdom Crusade is short war style game where you play as the light or the dark (no functional difference between them but Dark seems to have better positioning overall from the start.) Battles are fought in real-time when you and an enemy occupy the same overworld square.

	"When not battling, you are also taking land for your side just by walking through empty lands. Capturing bigger areas revolves around a concept similar to Go, wherein you surround a bunch of enemy territory and capture it all at once. This includes castles as long as the opposing side isn't occupying said castle.

	"We set the settings to small world, expert CPU, and crank the handicap up to favor our side. This lets us start with 5 of the 6 castles and reduces the enemy army substantially. I hunted seeds for a while but this is the best I came up with since we can win the game only moving through 5 squares and never battling. We spawn a bowman right near the undefended castle and he takes it with alacrity.

[div class=p 
	"That's about it. The only other way to win is to wipe out the opponents. It isn't particularly hard to best them in battle but I never found a seed that favored this method as the enemies don't spawn right next to you so walking 5 squares to take a castle eclipses walking 3-4 squares and doing two fights.

	"Looks pretty good to me, I guess most of the optimization is just finding the best seed. The general strategy is about as good as it gets, a very peaceful takeover. Accepting!
