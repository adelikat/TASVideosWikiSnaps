	]b
	" Dragon Quest IX continues the Dragon Quest tradition of turn-based combat, with a few modern twists. The game allows players to have a cooperative wireless multiplayer experience with up to four players. Unlike the other games in the main series, Dragon Quest 9 is a 3rd person RPG in battles and there are no more random encounters. Instead the enemies are on a open world map and can chase you if they see you, very similar to Dragon Quest monster Joker.

			"Introduction:
		]b
		" After creating my character, there'll be a brief cutscene. An angelic character, Aquila, will accompany me from the outset. Aquila has been described as the Guardian of Angel Falls, and both of us are mystical characters known as Celestrians. After some chitchat back and forth, I will suddenly be thrust into a battle in order to protect a couple of innocent mortal townsfolk from harm. A Cruelcumber and two Slimes will assault them, and I'll be able to step in to make sure no harm comes to the citizens. This battle is very easy, simply attack, and Aquila will do the same automatically, after the battle, the Cruelcumber drops an antidotal herd (actually I should avoid this ;_;). Then townsfolk will be able to go about their business, and I will receive a sacred item called Benevolessence. This is the crystallized form of mortals' thankfulness for being protected by the Celestrians. Then I and Aquila can return to the Observatory, the mysterious, holy location from whence I came.

			"Introduction 2:
		]b
		" I go upstair and speak to Apus Major, he congratulates me on a job well done so far, but tells me that it's time to set off on my own, my apprenticeship with Aquila is now over, and he tells me to visit the Tree of Yggdrasil upstairs. I have to use the sacred item I carry with, Benevolessence, on the tree named Yggdrasil. I then go back downstairs to speak with Apus Major. Now I have to go back to the Protectorate, on the way down, I collect an item Seed of life which increases my max HP by 3 (very important on the first boss fight).

			"The Protectorate:
		]b
		" After regain control, I go to find a Keepsake Ring and deliver it to an old woman in the Church to receive a Benevolessence, then I go to the Stable and clear all 5 pieces of Horse Manure to receive 1 more Benevolessence. After I do this 2 jobs, nighttime will be summoned forth and Aquila will appear. After talking with him, I speak with a ghost and help him R.I.P and receive 1 more Benevolessence. Now I have 3 of them in total, time to go back to the Observatory.

			"The Unfortunate:

		" I go straight to the tree to offer all my Benevolessence, then follow a cutscene. The tree blooms, the fruit called the Fygg appears in 7. The celestial train known as the Starflight Express arrives to ferry the Celestrians to the Realm of the Almighty. However, before the Celestrians can board the train, the Observatory is attacked from below by a mysterious and powerful force. The force scatters the assembled angels and knocks the Fyggs, the Starflight Express, and myself down to the Protectorate...

			"Adventuring in Angel Falls:
		]b
		" After the cutscene, I'll find myself back in Angel Falls, but missing my trademark halo, and no longer glowing and floating. My class now is Minstrel, this is a good all-around class, but doesn't really stand out. After the conversation with Ivor, Hugo and Erinn, I'll regain my control. I go directly to the Mayor Litlun's house (which is Ivor's father) and witness a conversation, then I come back to Erinn's house to sleep. At the next morning, Ivor comes to ask me to escort him to the Mountain pass between Angel Falls and Stornway Castle, and I can’t say No. I next go to the Shop to buy 2 Chimera wings and 7 Medicinal herbs, then head out of the town. Avoid enemy encounters, I reach the Mountain pass and see the Starflight Express, nothing to do with she right now, I go to the right first to open a chest and find a Gold Ring (+DEF), then I go to the left to talk with Ivor again. Then comes conversations. “Soldiers from a location known as Stornway have arrived, and they are obviously being blocked from the other side of the rubble. They were sent by Stornway's sovereign, King Schott, to investigate a missing woman named Patty, who was apparently staying at the village's inn, but hasn't been heard from since she departed.” After regaining control, I open the Menu and use Seed of life, then use Chimera wing to go back to Angel Falls.

			"The Hexagon:
		]b
		" I go to the mayor’s house to deposit Ivor, then comes short conversations and Erinn wants me to find Patty but not asking. I then go out of the town and head to the Hexagon. After entering it, I read the sign and suddenly a ghost appears, I follow him to the statue and discover that there’s a button, I press it and door opens somewhere. Venturing inside, I get Leather Shield (+DEF) and Feather Fan (+ATK), equip them together with Gold Ring, I now ready to train level. Fighting with Firespirit is the best because this monster has low HP, ATK and DEF, all I need is to avoid it from casting spell. I also collect 210 Gold to buy thing later. Reaching level 4 is enough for the boss, I then find a fainted woman at the center of the circular room, and she’s the missing woman the soldiers from Stornway were asking about – Patty. Now the boss Hexagoon comes to fight. There’s nothing much to talk, just attack and heal, I manage to avoid 2 hits and don’t have to use any Medicinal herbs. After winning, I reach level 6 and earn 6 Skill points, I spend 4 points to learn Hot Lick, an useful spell to use later. After that I am transported outside automatically, then I use Chimera wing to go back to town.

			" Mysterious Patty:
		]b
		" I go to the Inn and see Patty speaking to Erinn. “Patty lets Erinn know that she's come to see the owner of this inn, Edwinn. Patty doesn't know that Edwinn had passed away two years ago, and his daughter now runs the inn. When Patty realizes that Erinn is Edwinn's daughter, she opens up to her about why she's in Angel Falls. Patty and Edwinn used to run the same inn. And that's the inn she is currently the proprietor of, in Stornway. It appears that Edwinn was quite the hit in his day. They apparently used to refer to Edwinn as the "Inncredible Inntertainer," referencing his uncanny ability to effectively run an inn. Erinn doesn't believe it, but Patty is persistent. She asks Erinn to come back to Stornway with her, so that she can run the inn there. Erinn refuses several times, and eventually scampers off to cook dinner for the guests currently at the inn. But Patty promises to be persistent.” And thereafter, I regain the control, I go to Erinn’s house and see a ghost infront of the house, I speak with him and know that he’s Erinn’s father. Suddenly comes a mysterious sprite-like creature, named Stella, she is in charge of the Starflight Express. Stella will now accompany me, but not as a party member, but rather as someone that watches over me. She promises that if I can finish Edwinn's unfinished business, she'll give me a ride back to the Observatory. I then talk with Edwinn again to know what is his unfinished business, then go to the location that he showed and find a trophy. I then show it to Erinn. Convinced of her father's legacy, Erinn agrees to accompany Patty back to Stornway. Then, Edwinn, with his earthly business attended to, agrees to disappear from the face of the planet. He thanks me for my hard work, and Stella is impressed too, at least initially. But when Edwinn disappears and I am unable to see the Benevolessence left behind by him, she begins to wonder whether I’m truly a Celestrian or not.

			"A Mechanical Failure:
		]b
		" Erinn has gone off to Stornway to follow in her father's footsteps, and now, I’m following her too. But first I have business with the Starflight. Stella opens the door for us and we go inside. But when Stella goes to start the mystical machine up, she finds that it's dead. Stella has come up with an idea: she hypothesizes that by helping more people and earning more Benevolessence, God will be on our side enough to help start the machine up. Once that's been resolved, I leave the train and continue to the path that earlier led to a bunch of rubble blocking the path. The rubble has now been moved, and I’m free to proceed out of the Mountain Pass. This will lead me to Stornway.

			"Recruiting partners:
		]b
		" When entering Stornway, I will force to come to Patty’s inn and witness a scene. After talking to Erinn, I get out and enter again to make the inn works, then I talk to Patty to recruit new partners. Because of weak level and attribute, I cannot deal much Physical Damage to enemies, even if I choose Warrior class and equip with good weapon, therefore I choose to recruit 3 Mages and named X, Y, Z. Each will have different duties later on. When I’m done with the recruiting, Patty teaches me the ability Egg On which raises the tension of my partner by 1 level, a very helpful ability.

			"Helping Stornway:
		]b
		" I get out the Inn and head north, I read the sign to know that help is directly requested from King Schott of Stornway to deal with the Wight Knight, I must read it in order to get inside the castle. I go to the shop to buy 4 Hairbands (+DEF and + MAG. ATK) and equip them to my characters. After get inside the castle, I approach the throne room, King Schott will engage me in conversation. I learn that the Princess feels extremely guilty about the Wight Knight and his plaguing of her kingdom. After all, the Wight Knight seems to be after her, and her alone, but her father will not let her sacrifice herself to the creature in order to appease him and have him leave the kingdom alone. King Schott himself cuts right to the point. He wants to hire me to go to Loch Storn and deal with the Wight Knight once and for all. A reward is waiting for me if I’m able to successfully do so. Of course I must agree. I leave Stornway and head north, but I’m not going to Loch Storn, instead I’m going to Zere first, and training my party on the way there. Fighting with Ragged Reaper is the best choice because this monster gives much experience than others. My new partners must reach level 4 to be able to survive the next boss fight. When done, I enter Zere and go to the inn to sleep to refill HP and MP. Then I go to the shop to buy 7 Chimera wings and use up all gold to buy Medicinal herbs. Then I use Chimera wing to fly to Stornway and head to Loch Storn from there (faster than going from Zere).

			"The Wight Knight:
		]b
		" After that there’ll be a short cutscene and the Wight Knight shows up, then comes the boss fight. This fight is not hard since I use Magical Attack and Medicinal herb to heal. After the fight my characters level up and earn skill points, with the main character I use all points to Sword skill, the others I save to use later, the boss drops an Iron Gauntlets (+DEF). I learn that the Wight Knight has been going after the wrong princess all along. He's looking for the Princess of Brigadoom, a woman named Mona. Apparently, the Wight Knight was awakened after the earthquake, and has been on the search for his princess ever since. The Wight Knight admits that he should have known Simona wasn't Mona, as she wasn't wearing Mona's telltale accessory, the Necklace of Brigadoom. Nonetheless, having admitted his mistake, the Wight Knight offers his apologies to the kingdom, and goes off on his way home. I then use Chimera wing to return to Stornway, I go to the inn to rest because it’s nighttime and I can’t go inside the castle at night, and I also need to refill HP and MP. After that I meet with the King. King Schott isn't impressed with my handling of the situation. The Wight Knight still lives, and it appears King Schott intends for me to see that he no longer walks the face of the planet... that is, if I want my reward. This decision upsets Princess Simona, and she quickly runs off to sob in privacy. When I regain control, I find Princess outside of the throne room, and she want to meet me in her bedroom :O. I then speak with the princess privately. The princess lets me know that one of her old nurses now lives in Zere. She used to sing a rhyme to the princess when the princess was young, and Brigadoom was mentioned in it. Then I get out and use Chimera wing to fly to Zere, I go into that nurse’s house and hear the rhyme, and learn that Brigadoom is at the North, when trying to get out of Zere, I run into the Wight Knight again. I find that he’s looking for the Brigadoom as well. I tell him where it is and we both go there.

			"The Brigadoom:
		]b
		" I go explore this doom, collect an item Gold Bracer (+DEF) on the way. When reaching the throne, I see a cutscene. A creature called Morag confronts the Wight Knight. It appears that, in the past, the Wight Knight was to confront Morag, which took him away from Princess Mona. Now, Morag seeks revenge, and curses the Wight Knight so that he can't move. In the Wight Knight's stead, I have to do battle with Morag. Thankfully, this battle is easy, since she always try to enrapture my partners, and won’t succeed because we’re both females :)) and thanks for the spell Crack, the damage will multiple when we hit the same attack in a row. After the fight, my characters level up and earn skill points, I spend point to Sword skill for the main character again (the purpose is to reach 13 points to learn Metal Slash), I use 8 skill points with the character Z to learn Wizard Ward (for the Armamentalist Quest later). After that, Princess Simona shows up, wearing Princess Mona's old necklace. In a trance, she dances with the Right Knight, and he's then sent off, forever happy that he got to see his love one last time. Hereafter, I speak with the princess to make her go back off to Stornway Castle, then I get out and use Chimera wing to fly to there as well.

Everyone is happy now, and they all feel sorry for the Wight Knight, who they misjudged all along. The king’s ready to give me my reward as promised. I go for it and get a Gold Rosary (+DEF and + more HP when heal), 1000 gold, Aggressence (values 750 gold), and a Tortoiseshell (values 150 gold, but I don’t have to use it in the rest of the TAS ;_;). Now Stella wants me to go back to the Starflight Express, but first, I go to the weapon shop and open the chest for Seed of Strength, and buy 2 Copper swords.

Though I helped out those in Stornway, the Benevolessence I earned wasn't enough to get the Starflight Express back in the air. Thus, I won't yet be able to return to the Observatory.  So I must continue in the Protectorate, I use Chimera wing to fly back to Stornway and head northeast to the checkpoint. Just head north and I reach Coffinwell.

I can’t get into his room so I need to talk to her wife, Catarrhina, first. She takes me there and then a conversation. The doctor has been pouring over old manuscripts that speak about the disease that once stalked the people of Coffinwell in generations past. Phlegming has discovered through his exhaustive research that what's plaguing Coffinwell is more akin to a curse than a disease. Apparently, a dungeon to the west of town was where the townsfolk previously sealed the source of the disease. The doctor is convinced that the earthquake is responsible for a fracturing of the seal that kept the curse at bay. With all of that information garnered, I return to the mayor's mansion. Upon speaking with Mayor Laria, he hands to me the Quarantomb Key. I return to Dr. Phlegming and hand over the key. Now that he's been effectively snared into helping the mayor out by the mayor guaranteeing that I will protect him, and we head to the tomb, but first I need to go to the inn and sleep to refill HP&MP. This Quarantomb has a monster Metal Slime that gives a lot of experience so this is a very good place to train level, so I train myself to lv14 and X-Y-Z to lv13. I also find Seed of skill which increases 2 more skill points. After turning on 2 switches, the door opens and I find the broken jar. Dr. Phlegming now patches it, but a monster named Ragin' Contagion appears and prevents him from doing that. So that my turn now, boss fight! This fight use the same strategy, Crack and heal, but it’s very annoying that the boss acts twice per turn and deals heavy damage.

I go to the inn to rest til night, then go back to the graveyard and meet Catarrhina’s spirit. She ask me to help cheering her husband up. I agree and come to Dr. Phlegming’s office. After speaking with him for a brief time, I’m able to convince him that Catarrhina is speaking through me. She wants Phlegming to visit with some of the people in town who were sick. She hopes that this will show him not only how important he was to saving so many lives, but how grateful folks in the town are to have him... even if he is a weirdo shut-in. There are four people in particular I need to visit. After that, Dr. Phlegming ask me to head back to his office. When we arrive there, the doctor tell me that he's glad he was able to speak to everyone, and to make Catarrhina happy one last time, and now she can R.I.P. The next morning, I find the town in a much happier mood. Stella says she sees Benevolessence everywhere, which is exactly what I need to get the Starflight Express moving once more.

Apus Major is praying to Yggdrasil when suddenly the Starflight Express shows up and deposits me back in the Observatory. Astonished not only at the fact that I’m alive, but that my halo and wings are missing, Apus Major brings me back to his throne room so everyone can speak. I fill Apus Major in on everything that happened. It appears that Apus Major dispatched Guardians to the Protectorate after the earthquake to not only look for the Fyggs, but to also find the source of the disturbance, but none has returned. Apus Major then instruct me to visit Yggdrasil and pray for my wings and halo back, I do so, and fall asleep, then I bear witness to a disturbing and vivid dream. It appears that two divine entities are battling over the fate of the mortals back in the Protectorate. One of these gods appears to want to destroy the world of the mortals, but the other is hell-bent on protecting it. When I awake, my wings and halo hasn’t come back yet, then I hear a mystery voice tells me that I am the chosen one and I need to collect all the Fyggs, then it open a way for me, a blue tree appears to land with the Starflight Express. I also learn ‘Zoom’, a spell that like Chimera wing. When Apus Major and his friends come, I tell him about my dream, then I use the Starflight Express to go to that blue tree.

There's nothing this mayor can do, and although this trio of people incessantly complain to him, he walks away. Then I talk to the mayor to ask for the Fygg (a shining fruit). He gives me some clues, then I go down to find more. After asking for information, I find that the fruit has been eaten by Abbot Jack and he’s nowhere to be found. I speak with the mayor again and he suggests that Abbot Jack may come to the Tower of Trades. Then he teaches me a party trick called ‘Bow’ to open the door there, I register it together with ‘Clap’ to use later. I head out using Zoom (faster than walking), but instead of going right to the Tower, I go down to the Port Llaffan first. I see a crowd at the beach, and when leaving, a scene happens: Jona, a red hair girl, springs into action, summoning forth a great creature of the sea, Lleviathan, and it feeds everyone with plentiful amounts of fish from the sea. Take it aside, I go to the shop to buy a Cloak of Evasion (+DEF and + EVA)and 4 Wellington Boots (+EDF). Then I zoom to Abbey and go to the Tower of Trades.

Bryson, the mayor's son, is excited about the prospect of adopting Jona, but Jona has her reservations. Jona tells him that she doesn't want to invoke Leviathan anymore. He shouldn't be feeding the entire town, and after all, something is certainly fishy about this entire situation, but the mayor won't hear any of it. He insists that Jona reconsider, and sends her off to go to sleep. Hereafter, Jona run into me, and offers to bring me back to her place. The hour is now late, and Jona says that I can sleep there. Then Stella briefly scold me for meddling in the affairs of this town before morning finally comes. I head back towards the mayor's home, and go to the backyard. I see Mayor Bryce's son, Bryson, near a locked gate. Apparently, Mayor Bryce has a hidden beach all to his own, and after Jona reiterated her desire to no longer summon forth Leviathan, Bryce took off with Jona towards the private beach. The gate leading westward was locked earlier, but now, thanks to Bryson, it unlocked. I go to that way and enter a cave, in this cave I find an Iron Kneecaps (+DEF) and a Blue Jeans (+DEF). Working my way up, I reach an outdoor location known as Cuddiedig Cliff. This is the private fishing spot used by the mayor. Here, the mayor is outright begging Jona to call Leviathan. But he doesn't want her to tell Leviathan to only bring fish. He remarks that there are all sorts of untold treasures under the sea, from pearls galore to the booty of ships long-since wrecked. Clearly, the mayor wants to adopt Jona so that he can abuse her powers for his own personal wealth, but Jona isn't only hesitant, but outright uninterested in doing Mayor Bryce's bidding. Suddenly, Lleviathan shows up. The mayor asks it to bring it fish and riches, but suddenly, it attacks, eating Jona in the process! It's time for me to get involved, boss fight. Lleviathan is a strong boss, his attack causes damage lager than my healing skill, he also has an powerful attack that causes damage to all of my party (but I manage to avoid this). Following the battle, everything will become lucid. This is the real Leviathan, but it's been possessed by none other than Dylan, Jona's deceased father. Dylan did indeed die out at sea when a storm suddenly hit his fishing vessel, but before he died, he saw a shining fruit, and then he found himself at one with Leviathan, the sea god. Knowing that he left Jona behind in the village to fend for herself, he delivered up fish to feed her and make sure she was taken care of. He never intended for things to get so out of control, or for her to be used by Mayor Bryce. Dylan then leaves both his daughter and Leviathan behind, with Bryson, Mayor Bryce's son, swearing to take care of Jona in his stead. I then obtain the 2nd Fygg.

After a brief time, the ship deposit me in a tiny settlement called Slurry Quay. I then buy 3 Fur hoods (+DEF) and open a chest for a Seed of Strength. I leave the quay and go to Dourbridge, at the brigde, I meet the woman's ghost again. She nearly stops me for being a Celestrian, but thinking that she's made an error, she keeps on walking. After that strange encounter, I go to the Lonely Plains, then I go to the Heights of Loneliness, this entire dungeon leading to Zere Rocks. After entering Zere Rock to register it, I get back to Lonely Plains and head south to go to Bloomingdale. When entering the town, I must visit the ship moored nearby. The old man guarding the dock tells me a bit about the boat, and that it's technically up for grabs at the moment. Then the guard at the entrance to the Bloome mansion will let me through. Inside the mansion, I go upstair to get 1500 gold, then, I return to the first floor and enter Marion’s room. There are two people trying their damndest to impress the rich young lass. I speak with her and ask her for her boat. At first, things seem really easy, she immediately agrees to give me the boat, but then suddenly, she accuses me of coming to take Marion away from her, shel scampers off to her room, and lock herself inside. I see a ghost briefly appear in her room before disappearing, and I can’t speak to Marion any further. So I get out and go to the house on the left, the old woman there sends me off to speak to the toymaker who lives in the house west of Bloomingdale's church. That man name is Randolph, and while he's now retired, he was at one time a talented toymaker. I ask him about Marion, he says that he once made her some toys. In fact, he's one of the few people Marion still trusts for some reason, and immediately offers to go to her mansion to check up on her. When we arrive there we find that Marion has gone missing, and a note sits on her bed. Apparently, some thieves kidnapped her for ransom, and took her to a cave north of town, waiting for their windfall. Randolph immediately takes off to let the town know what's befallen Marion. Suddenly a ghost appears, I contact with her and she leads me outside, to a gravestone. I find out that the ghost is the real Marion, the fake-one I met before is just a doll named Marionette, it comes to life because of the Fygg. Marion died because of sickness and she wanted her doll to live inplace of her own, and make a lot of friends as she never could. Knowing the truth, I zoom to Alltrades Abbey.

I then see a woman ghost, she is Batzorig’s mother, and she asks me to help finding a Bodura Grass for her son. This grass is a material of the drug that will reveal Sarantsatsral’s true form.
