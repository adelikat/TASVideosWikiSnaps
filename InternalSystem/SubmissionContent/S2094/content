	"	After Vinnie gets blown to pieces, Mike decides to go on a bloody and violent rampage, killing thousands of innocent and not so innocent people, while simultaneously taking the city for all it's worth in terms of cold, hard cash. Oh, and cars too. Lots of cars.

During this animation (look closely and you'll see the shell in the air next to Mike), you cannot fire, enter a car, or switch weapons. At quite a few points in the run, I don't immediately enter a car when I'm able to, or sometimes just run to another car that's positioned better. This is why.

This is fortunate because it's extremely hard to get a high wanted level after Portland, as most civilians take 2 hits with my car to die. It'd waste a lot of time to go back for a second pass. In Portland I tried to get the max possible wanted level possible without wasting time.
