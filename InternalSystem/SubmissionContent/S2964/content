	": Well, numerous ideas have come to me recently. I thought there might be a better way to slow down the speed in the fish scene in SMB 8-4, so I tested it on 2010-12-18, and it worked. I tried other ideas, too, some of them were extremely close. However, but none of them works.

	": OKay. I'll start with the level 4-2 for an example. The fastest way to move yourself to the right place is to enter the top floor of the bricks, but it is still 2 frames to the next 21 frame boundary. To increase the entertainment, I chose to go through the bottom of the floor.
