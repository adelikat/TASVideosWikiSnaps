	"This run improve the last one by nitsuja by using better executions, new route and mostly new glitches. As it predecessor damages are avoided, as they mostly slow down ecco, and which may give a nicer result to watch. At the same time, for entertainment purpose, a major glitch allowing to go through almost every wall using the fact that you can lock the camera at one position while moving ecco and that all element outsides the camera's view is not loaded, has been forbidden because of the possible extreme repetitiveness of a run using it in almost every level.

	"As explained in the previous comments many thing can be seen as mistake, useless or random action, but may not be because of the behavior of ecco. Indeed, more than the fact that ecco can go very fast in few frames but on the other hand has no way to slow down (except colliding into walls), ecco turn following a wide curve double by the fact that he turn only at precise frames. This mean that you may delay your input by few frames you will still turn at the exact same frame and position, which drastically reduce the number of possibilities. Added to this the fact that creatures behave differently depending on parameters like your position, speed or other things, executing a level in a perfect way is hardly conceivable.

	"(Last remark contrary at we may think, pressing C (acceleration button) at each frame is not optimal holding C for 11 frames.)
