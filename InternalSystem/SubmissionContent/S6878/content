	"Switching characters in SMB2 is obviously not like "switching characters" in this game, but I think the comparison still stands in a way. You're effectively stealing progress from Maria. This includes, but is not limited to, relic acquisition, character position, and game progress flags. For all intents and purposes, even if Maria's only purpose in the TAS is to get to a save point, a SIGNIFICANT portion of the game is still completed by her by virtue of her being considered to have all the relics and several important game flags preset. One could argue that "Save Richter" alone is at least half the game by itself. That

We could call it "Maria and Alucard any%", for example, but that would put it in the same category as Maria any%. We could call it "save glitch", but that would put it in contention with the PSX version's "game end glitch". We can't really call it anything else, because the intended goal from the beginning was to beat Alucard's scenario as fast as possible. Even if we managed to find an accurate descriptor for the run, I'd imagine it'd have so many modifiers that it'd end up as the title of the next Castlevania game. Castlevania: Opera of Specifically Beating Alucard's Scenario From Power-On With A Save Glitch That Isn't Arbitrary Code Execution That Steals Data From Maria But Is Also Slower Than Just Beating The Game With Maria.
