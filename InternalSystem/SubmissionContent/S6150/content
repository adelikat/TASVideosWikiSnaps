	"The game has at least 3 versions: the original Japanese release (J), the North American release (U) and the European release (E).
	$LF
	"Besides the language localizations, there's a notable difference in gameplay which makes the original Japanese release unique: 
	$LF
	"It takes much less EXP to LEVEL UP in this version than in other versions. 
	$LF
	"In fact, it's the later releases that increased the EXP requirements for all levels by 20%, which makes usual gaming harder.

[p

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Just as in many other games, spending less time in travelling is equal to faster outcome, in most cases.

	$LF
	"In making this run, 
	$LF

[p 
	"The PRNG of the game isn't copy-paste-friendly. 
	$LF
	"It is rather chaotic, 
	$LF

	$LF
	"which could be a bad thing, as sometimes there will be no clue at all on how to get things done.
