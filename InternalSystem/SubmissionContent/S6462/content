	"This is an improvement of about three and a half seconds over my previous movie of this game. This timesave is achieved primarily by using a different route through level 6. Namely, at 4:34 in the encode of the TAS linked below, I head down to the left as opposed to continuing to the right, which lets me reach the ledge seen at 4:38 about 2 seconds faster.

	"After doing this, I delayed a few frames before climbing the waterfall in order to manipulate RNG in my favor. The waterfall section here was also faster than in my original movie, as I was able to manipulate a platform to appear in the right position at 4:43 to skip having to climb up the platform on the left and to skip jumping and climbing up the platform to the right.

	"As a result of all of this, when I reached the boss, I happened to be at a point in his global timer when he threw a rock faster, which also made the boss fight faster.

	"All said and done, level 6 was the only level I changed to get this timesave. Everything prior to that was kept the same. As such, for any information about the process of TASing the first 5 levels of the game, please refer to the submission notes for my previous movie of the game. These potential improvements were discovered by me while TASing the Gameboy version of The Lion King, which has very similar mechanics and level layouts to this game. I hope you enjoy watching this TAS!
