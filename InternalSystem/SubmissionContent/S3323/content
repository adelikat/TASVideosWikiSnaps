	": This run does not meet our standard of optimsation. jlun2 has demonstrated that this run can be beaten by over 6 seconds in the first stage alone (this is less than three minutes into a twenty five minute run, including the lengthy opening). This is a considerable loss indeed. After watching both this run and the WIP alongside one another I am of the opinion that the difference in quality is greater than can be allowed, therefore I am rejecting this submission.
