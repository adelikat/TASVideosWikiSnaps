	"Mega Man III, known as Rockman World 3 (ロックマンワールド３) in Japan, is the third Mega Man game for Game Boy, released in December 1992. The game continues the quest of the protagonist, Mega Man, in a never-ending struggle with his long-time nemesis, Dr. Wily. As with previous Game Boy releases, the game incorporates gameplay elements and bosses from two sequential Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) games: Mega Man 3 and Mega Man 4.

[p 
	"The published movie appears to have a shorter time, but this is actually inaccurate: it uses a different, less accurate framerate (flat 60, as opposed to BizHawk's more accurate 59.7275005696058), and VBA's definition of a frame is different, counting multiple loading frames as only a single frame. Because of this, a lot of frames are "added" in loading screens in BizHawk compared to VBA.

		" Like the NES games is based on, this game waits until all the Robot Master explosion bubbles are off the screen before Megaman collects his weapon. So I try to end each fight with the robot as close to the center of the screen as possible without wasting time. In addition, the game also takes away your ability to control Megaman the instant the boss takes its last hit, so I have to get him into the center at the same time! Luckily, this game engine lets you keep drifting forward through the air after losing control, so I can abuse that by ending fights in the middle of a jump.

	" Now as for the order: Well, obviously, it's based on weapon effectiveness. Shadow Blade is nice in that it does decent damage to most things, even the other two bosses in the first ring. It also uses only half a unit of energy per shot, which gives me 38 shots without refilling. And I can aim it upward, and it travels fast with boomerang action, so it's pretty versatile. The main weakness is that I can't aim downward, but Search Snake is too slow and weak, and I won't get Screw Crusher until the last level. And Spark Shock just freezes things. So beyond that, Gemini Laser is basically the most useless weapon. It uses 2 units per shot, giving me only 10 shots, and it moves extremely slowly on Game Boy.
