	]a
	" The improvement comes from many 
	$LF
	"factors, which I will explain in these comments. But before I brief you about where the improvement comes from, let me introduce this game to 
	$LF
	"those of you who haven't played it.

		"Story of the game:
	]b
	" To quote the game's intro:  "The country is struggling against the cruel domination of the king. Their leader 
	$LF
	"and his comrades attempt to secretly land on the shore. But the king's military is waiting to attack them." So basically, you are some movement's 
	$LF
	"leader, and you mission is to (on your own, of course) kill the king, who is very cruel. Honesly, you could just skip the story, it's not really 
	$LF
	"important when watching this movie. Just remember that the military is the bad guys, and I'm the good guy. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"If you haven't played this game, I strongly recommend that you to read the following comments before watching the movie. It will help 
		$LF

		$LF
		"understand the movie a lot better.

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"I won't give detailed comments on each and every stage, since there really isn't that much to comment on, instead I'll give you some 
	$LF
	"general information about this run and the game itself.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"About lag:
	]b
	" One huge factor in this game is lag. This game lags 
	[b 
		"a lot
	]b
	", and i mean a lot. Whenever you kill an enemy, the game 
	$LF
	"lags for 2-4 frames or so. You'll notice a few places that lags in this run, but often it's so little lag that it isn't noticable, 
	$LF
	"but it's there. I tried hard to minimize lag in this run, but since I don't know how to use the memory viewer, I don't know how well 
	$LF
	"I did. In any case, it's not so much lag that it's annoying to watch the movie or anything, it's just a pain to make a TAS where you 
	$LF
	"know that every time you kill an enemy you will most likely loose a couple of frames. Because of this, I avoid killing enemies unless 
	$LF
	"it's faster to kill them than to let them go.  
	$LF
]div

]pre
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"About dying:
	]b
	" It only takes one hit to kill you in this game, so you want to avoid getting hit at all costs. Dying will make you 
	$LF
	"appear at the same place that you died, and you have infinite lives, you dying when playing this game on a console isn't a big deal, 
	$LF
	"but since it wastes time, I'm not doing it in this run, except for one place, which I will describe later on. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Luck manipulation:
	]b
	" It's possible to manipulate luck in this game, in that matter that you can sometimes change where 
	$LF
	"(and sometimes even if) an enemy appears on the screen. This often wastes time, because you often have to walk to the far right of 
	$LF
	"the screen of the screen to change where an enemy appears, which makes it faster just to let the enemy appear on the original place. 
	$LF
	"Luck manipulation is used a few times in the run, to save a little time here and there.     
	$LF

[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Weapon pickups:
	]b
	" The letters you sometimes see lying around on the ground are weapon pickups. Let me give a short explanation of 
	$LF
	"the 4 weapons I use in the run :
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	""Normal grenade": This is not a weapon pickup, instead it's your default weapon.  
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	""T-weapon (Shrapenel):" This is the most used weapon in this run. It fires a rocket that explodes into 3 machine fun bullets when it 
	$LF
	"hits something. This weapon is the strongest in the game, and is therefor the prefered weapon on bosses.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	""F-weapon (Flamethrower):" This weapon is really good on killing bigger groups of enemies. I use this weapon on bosses where you have 
	$LF
	"to kill a lot of soldiers, for example, on the submarine on level 3.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	""C-weapon (Complete destruction): This weapon sounds really cool, but isn't as useful as it sounds. It gives you a new kind of grenade, 
	$LF
	"that, when throwed, will kill all the enemies on the screen. Once you have used this once, it disappears and you go back to having normal 
	$LF
	"grenades again. This weapon probably sounds awesome, but the game lags a lot when you throw one of these grenades. Therefor, this weapon 
	$LF
	"is 
	$LF
	"only used once in the run, on the boss in the sewers, where I killed a lot of soldiers with it.  
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"You will also see a lot of other weapon pickups here and there, but you don't have to worry about what those do, since I don't use them 
	$LF
	"in my run.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"The tank:
	]b
	" On a lot of levels, you can find a tank that you can jump use. The tank is really good for two reasons: First, normal 
	$LF
	"machinegun bullets don't kill you when you're inside the tank. That's why I can ride through hordes of green soldiers when I'm in the tank. 
	$LF
	"And second, The tank has really good attack power, and is therefor great to use on bosses.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"When the tank gets hit, it starts beeping and blinking red, and eventually explodes. So after you get hit when you're in the tank, you have a 
	$LF
	"few seconds to act before it blows up.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"While on a bridge, you can't fire with the tank, without destroying the bridge itself. That's why I don't shoot down the sandbags on level 2 
	$LF
	"when I'm in the middle of a bridge, for example.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Hostages:
	]b
	" There are hostages here and there in the run. When you rescue one, by walking over them, you get +1000 points. If you kill one, 
	$LF
	"you get -500 points. Points are useless, since you can't see how many points you have, and they don't do anything.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"I noticed on level 2, that you need to pick up a certain amount of hostages when inside the tank, otherwise the tank will blow up for no 
	$LF
	"reason. I don't know how exactly this works, but I've only had this problem on level 2.

[ul 
	[li 
		"The boxes lying on the ground are mines. These blow up and kill me if I walk on them.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"On the level 1 boss, I kill the two hostages blocking the door, because it's faster than to pick them up. This makes me hit the boss a few frames earlier.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"On the level 2 boss, I move inside the boss with my tank, allowing me to fire at him faster. It doesn't matter for me that my tank blows up, I won't have it for the next level anyway.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Here's an important note. On the level 3 boss, I intentionally die to save time. By dying right before I move on, the following two minibosses, for some reason, take a lot less hits, allowing me to kill them faster. I saved about 6 seconds on this trick. And also, dying at the place that I died on didn't waste ny time at all, since the screen is stopped while the red soldier blows up.

	"That's about it, I hope you learned something from these comments. As closure, let me say that this game was fun to TAS, but it was also a real
