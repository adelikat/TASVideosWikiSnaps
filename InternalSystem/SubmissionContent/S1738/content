[p 
	"In my childhood I first met the game on some pirate cartridge. This game seemed to be world's difficult platformer because your character immediately died from any hit or wrong collision. Even though it was extremely hard, the gameplay still was awesome, so I kept conquering it, frequently asking myself why there's "LIFE gauge" at the bottom of screen, and what are those heart power-ups made for. Only after several years the truth has been revealled.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"During NES era KONAMI was frequently adding tricky anti-piracy protection into their games. In all four TMNT, TinyToon and some other games there's special procedure which verifies if there is copyright text on title screen. BTW, KONAMI has chosen rather unusual way to do it - they read VRAM contents (it's like watching what's on the screen).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"And when checksum don't match, this cruel procedure doesn't simply freeze the game (it would be too obvious for pirates to fix). Instead it sets one bit somewhere (in Bucky O'Hare it's x3B in RAM). Then, at some place the game's gonna be ruined. For example, in TMNT3 first Shredder restores his energy too fast, so it's impossible for player to defeat him - thus the game becomes unbeatable. In TMNT-Tournament Fighters final battle loops infinitely. And in Bucky O'Hare the game kills your character after any hit.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"What's more funny, today I find that pirate cartridge mentioned at many discussion forums on different languages. So I guess it's kinda worldwide case. I've heard that some hardcore players still managed to beat the game without touching anything. That sounds simply amazing, and I'd definitely want to look at such speedrun.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Meanwhile I made my tool-assisted speedrun where the situation is simulated by entering special password on title screen. After entering "HARD!", x3B is set to 01 manually, and the run begins.

	"The game's long and varying, it has tons of little tricks here and there. Most of these tricks are hard to repeat by simply copying button presses - you'll need to sync these with several in-game timers, and sometimes it's just impossible to copy a trick perfectly.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Here's an example. When you hold B button for long time, current character will begin charging his special movement. In fact the charging can start only when GlobalTimer is dividable by 4. Depending on a situation this can make you lose 0-3 frames where previous movie didn't lose - even if you copied its input precisely.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Plus, this game isn't hexedit-friendly because subpixel Y coordinate doesn't reset anywhere, and if you change it by remaking half of a level, chances are that all coming levels will desync. Still I managed to make several hexedits, because I don't feel like redoing everything. At least for now.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"What's really important here, each level has its coordinates of "exit". For example, if you're supposed to exit level at the bottom of screen, you won't exit it if your Y coordinate is higher than some hardcoded value. Thus, only if a sequence of levels have similar coordinates of finish line, you can zoom trough all of them until level counter comes to a level with different finish line or without exit at all (bosses room). Or until your dead character stops bumping finish line...
