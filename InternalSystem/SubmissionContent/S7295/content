	"Punch-Out!! for the Wii follows Little Mac on his quest to become the greatest of all time. It starts with him becoming Champion of the World, as seen in this TAS which is just the Contender fights. A full game TAS as for right now is not plausible, as 1. both Title Defense Von Kaiser and Title Defense Disco Kid require motion controls to gain access to the lefty star to match the TAS Time. As the lefty stars manipulate their patterns to be faster. Motion Controls are a huge pain to TAS with and will desync 10 times more than just the wii remote. Also, Last Stand is required to lose as fast as you can to the boxers that are presented to you in a full game run, and that is complete RNG. There is no way to manipulate this RNG via TAS means at the moment. Those two reasons are why I can't TAS a full game run, and the Last Stand reason is why I don't ever see a TAS of the full game in a Dolphin Movie file at least. I am planning to upload a segmented TAS of the Full Game at some point in the future.
