	"Jumping is fast in this game, so it is done as much as possible. When you jump you are locked into the arc and you can choose between a big jump or a small jump by whether you’re holding upright or just right. I tend to aim for big jumps because they also give a bigger horizontal speed boost.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Most levels are pretty close to tied with RTA in the platforming sections, because you can just plan out a specific chain of big jumps and small jumps and match it easily RTA. The jumps can be buffered before you hit the ground, so it is easy to chain them frame perfectly. The only hitch in that plan is the technical sections with lots of quick jumps and also the enemy RNG causing you to react on the fly.

	"I mentioned before that enemy patterns can be manipulated. This is a bit hard to do since it usually involves killing enemies to manipulate which object slots are available, but it was done in practice in some sections of the run, particularly when an enemy that would have spawned needed to be prevented from spawning.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The big RNG manipulation comes from the necklace item, which extends your weapon timer by doubling it. This necklace only does anything if you have less than 50 seconds remaining, so it is optimal to wait until you have just under 50 seconds left, then get a necklace asap to double it up to about 100 seconds which is the maximum. These randomly can drop from enemies, but only specific enemies that will drop an item. I believe the game keeps a kill count and only drops an item on a particular number of enemies killed, but I haven’t looked into it too far.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"In terms of manipulating the necklace, you can get different results even when killing the enemy on the same frame by varying your exact inputs leading up to the kill. I was able to use this to get necklaces without slowing down in most cases. I would have liked to keep the flame sword through the entire game, but I settled for the axe later on as I would have had to start losing time to manipulating it if I tried to chain the necklaces through the rest of the game.
