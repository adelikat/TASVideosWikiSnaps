	"There are two licensed ports of Double Dragon on the C64; one published by Ocean and the other by Melbourne House.  This run is the Ocean version.  Both ports are generally considered mediocre to poor quality ports.  From what I can find online, the Ocean ports seems to be the one with the slightly more positive reviews.  These generally revolve around increased combat attack options.  Unfortunately this port is one player only.  From what I understand, the other has the 2-player co-op option. Perhaps I'll look into a TAS of the Melbourne House port for comparison.
