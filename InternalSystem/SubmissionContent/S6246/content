		" Timing differences: Timing starts upon power-on, and I end on last input before credits roll. ("Jenna is waiting for us!" textbox by Mia) This is different from how the previous TAS'er timed his run. The reason I end timing at the credits screen is for a couple of reasons: It looks nicer, is less tedious to sit through (we've had enough cutscenes after 3 hours), is consistent with RTA timing end which can help people identify with the run, and the final inputs post-credits are trivial as described in the tasvideos rules. Another difference is that the previous TAS'er did not use a BIOS file in his TAS, which saves him a lot of time over the course of his run because he hard resets all over the place without repercussion. My TAS has a BIOS and therefor punishes hard resets accordingly, dis-incentivizing them and promoting more interesting solutions to random battles.

	[li 
		" BRN is the Battle Random Number, and this is what governs actions taken by enemies.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" These numbers can be manipulated quite easily and therefor the game isn't as random as it would seem at first glance. Casting Psynergy out of battle, cancelling attacks, clearing in-fight cutscenes on specific frames can all be used to manipulate the GRN. The BRN is much less volatile and instead only changes based on what spells are used and how many targets they have. This makes it highly predictable and easily exploited.

	" Glitches Used
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Retreat Glitch: When casting retreat with the use of a shoulder button shortcut while at or below 5 Psynergy Points (PP), the game will -think- Isaac went back to the first room, but it won't actually move him there. By then saving and resetting the game, Isaac will be moved to the first room, but keep his X,Y coordinates from the room he retreated out of. This allows us to cut out major portions of dungeons, because we can go out of bounds and enter doors that are usually not available until much later into a specific dungeon. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Retreat Warp: Instead of saving and resetting after activating the Retreat Glitch, you can also simply walk through specific doors that are now aligned with door numbers from the first room of the dungeon, which means you'll often be able to enter blocked off areas much faster than if you were to progress through the dungeon normally.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Instant Ladder Climb: By holding in the wrong direction on ladders for 13 frames, then holding the correct way on the 14th, you will instantly be moved to the top (or bottom) of the ladder you were trying to climb. For example: If you want to go up on a ladder, holding down for 13 frames then up on the 14th will activate this glitch.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Infinite Climb Glitch: Walking up to a ladder and holding up for 13 frames will initiate Isaac's animation to jump on the ladder, but the player can still give inputs for another frame. By pressing Start on the 14th frame, this will bring up the menu while on the ladder (something which is not normally possible). By then saving the game and resetting, the game will save our Z coordinate but think we're not actually on the ladder, instead it thinks we're on the ground. This elevated Z coordinate can help us interact with sprites faster than usual and skip some puzzles.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Tricks Used
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Sanctum Warp: Holding L and Start when loading a save file will take the player to the sanctum in the last town they visited. This can save a lot of time when done at the end of a long dungeon.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Soft Reset Buffer: When saving the game, the player can buffer a soft reset input to get out of the game faster than normal.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Attacks First manipulation: This is a battle status that grants Isaac's party one free turn of actions, without giving the enemies a chance to retaliate. It also gives a 100% chance to run from battle, which is often more useful than taking the free turn of attacks.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Djinn Strategy
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"While there are 28 Djinn in total, in this run we will only be getting 18 of them. 5 Venus Djinn, 4 Jupiter Djinn, 5 Mars Djinn, and 4 Mercury Djinn. This is because the most powerful Summons unlock at 4 Djinn of a particular element. That means we don't need to grab any more than that, as they would just add more menuing time without mattering at all in battle. The reason we get 1 extra Djinn for Venus and Mars elements is because the particular Djinn we grab are extremely overpowered and do actually matter.
