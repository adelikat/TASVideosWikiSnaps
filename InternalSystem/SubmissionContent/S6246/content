		" Timing differences: Timing starts upon power-on, and I end on last input before credits roll. ("Jenna is waiting for us!" textbox by Mia) This is different from how the previous TAS'er timed his run. The reason I end timing at the credits screen is for a couple of reasons: It looks nicer, is less tedious to sit through (we've had enough cutscenes after 3 hours), is consistent with RTA timing end which can help people identify with the run, and the final inputs post-credits are trivial as described in the tasvideos rules. Another difference is that the previous TAS'er did not use a BIOS file in his TAS, which saves him a lot of time over the course of his run because he hard resets all over the place without repercussion. My TAS has a BIOS and therefor punishes hard resets accordingly, dis-incentivizing them and promoting more interesting solutions to random battles.

The BRN is much less volatile and instead only changes based on what spells are used and how many targets they have. This makes it highly predictable and easily exploited.

	"Retreat Glitch: When casting retreat with the use of a shoulder button shortcut while at or below 5 Psynergy Points (PP), the game will -think- Isaac went back to the first room, but it won't actually move him there. By then saving and resetting the game, Isaac will be moved to the first room, but keep his X,Y coordinates from the room he retreated out of. This allows us to cut out major portions of dungeons, because we can go out of bounds and enter doors that are usually not available until much later into a specific dungeon.

	"Retreat Warp: Instead of saving and resetting after activating the Retreat Glitch, you can also simply walk through specific doors that are now aligned with door numbers from the first room of the dungeon, which means you'll often be able to enter blocked off areas much faster than if you were to progress through the dungeon normally.

By pressing Start on the 14th frame, this will bring up the menu while on the ladder (something which is not normally possible). By then saving the game and resetting, the game will save our Z coordinate but think we're not actually on the ladder, instead it thinks we're on the ground.
