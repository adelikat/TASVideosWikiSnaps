	"So the main reason why I am back on this game so early is due to a new method of getting the speed walking.  There's two ways I discovered that work.  One method is to start a dash while in the air, and have the dash meter run out before you start moving.  The other method is to do a dash in the air, then press the dash button again 2 frames later (or anywhere before you start the next dash).  Both methods put Buster into a state where he will halt as soon as he lands on the ground.  the way to get the fast dash is to slide for only one frame as soon as you land, and that causes Buster to walk with dash speed without using up any of his dash meter.  this state gets canceled out as soon as buster jumps or takes damage.  he can also run off a ledge with this without losing speed, but will lose this state once he lands.

	"since we cant damage enemies in our fast walk state, we have to chain some jumps and dashes to kill some rats.  I also found out for the 2nd room that if you do the same setup as the fast walk, but hold slide for 2 frames instead of one, you can make buster run for a bit before he eventually slows down.  I can use this to grab the gogo statue a bit faster.  Since I can get fast walk easily, I dont have to wait for the wolf to drop his key this time.

	"For Dizzy, nothing really changed other than me somehow getting him to eat the last piece of food earlier, saving a few frames.  Also this doesnt save time but I made buster become fast before the cut-scene started because it's funny to see him move that fast.

	"For the Train, the only major things that have changed is a polishing up on the playaround.  The scrolling glitch is the same as before, and I made a video that shows it's possible to take it further, however it's not possible to go any further unless the floor stopped being lava.

The other change was in the 3rd room where I realized I could bunny hop up to the platform where the old route went instead of waiting for the hammer to come around.  This also resulted in a smoother method around the scales.

This game really allowed for so much entertaining potential not just for speedrunning, but for playarounds as well.  I am blown away by the amount of support my old movie received, and I hope this new movie delivered even more smiles to people's faces.
