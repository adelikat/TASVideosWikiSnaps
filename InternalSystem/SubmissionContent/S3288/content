	"Hello again! The first run was cancelled due to lack of optimization. The second one was due to using the wrong frame rate, causing the space bar to not work properly. The third, and hopefully the correct one, aims to fix the errors present in the last run. It is an improvement of 1 second over a TAS that also uses the spacebar in

But in this case I think there was too much confusion to get a consensus and the game had a negative response anyway.  So I will dodge that issue completely and reject purely on game choice.
