Even I lost my game save (I had angry, that's why I'm still remember now), I just think I'm unlucky. Recently, I had seen FF7 can join debug room and make end game soon. I have think maybe that stage I was found is debug room. I have plan make corrupt game save, and it workd

	": The strategy used in this run does entirely consist in corrupting the save file by turning off the console while saving. The advantage is given by the fact that the player resulted as standing in the debug room, which is a game location that is not supposed to be accessible during normal play. From this room it's possible to make use of a hidden feature that allows to play any cutscene of the game, in this case the the best ending sequence.

	"For comfirming the validity of the glitch used, I've tried to reproduce it on real PlayStation. While I failed to trigger the cutscene menu, I was still able to access the debug room. You can watch a recording of the attempt

	"For what concerns entertainment, I have to note that the glitch is performed just by the precision of the reset command and some movements in order to avoid getting softlocked in the debug room, which isn't particular notable from an aesthetic point of view. For the rest, the movie is almost all cutscene, with barely any interactions.
