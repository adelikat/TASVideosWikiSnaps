	"This is a tool-assisted speedrun of Acko's Mach-Bike Race, a ROM Hack of PokÃ©mon Emerald, created by TeamAquasHideout. This hack was made for PokÃ©mon YouTuber ackolade, in order to help him out in practicing the Mach Bike's movement and mechanics in a series of difficult obstacle courses/mazes. The hack ends in a final battle against a Champion Archie fight featuring Mega Evolutions, Primals and Gen 5 and 6 PokÃ©mon.

	"There are 3 courses in this hack: Course 1 is based of the Cycling Road in Route 110. Course 2 is based of Route 119, and the Final Course is based of the Sky Pillar. If you bump into anything, you'll have to do the course from the beggining and try again.
	$LF
	"In Course 2 you unlock the Bullet Time mechanic, which allows you to slow down the game in order to make it sligthy easier to navigate through tricky sections. You can use it for a limited time though, so you have to be careful for when to use it... or at least it would've been if this was an RTA. But this is a TAS... so this feature is pretty much useless for us.

	"Now I don't know if this is because of how Bullet Time is programmed, or because the map is too big or what, but after obtaining Bullet Time, the game's framerate kind of tanks... A lag frame will appear every 4 frames. It further tanks if an NPC walks around in a puddle of water at the same time as you.

	"This fight starts out with Wailord. I sent out a somehow already Mega Evolved Swampert. Swampert once again showing it's the best starter in these games, lands a critical hit STAB Earthquake... And that's the only move we're using for the rest of the battle.
	$LF
	"Primal Kyogre is sent out next (again don't question it), and even with a crit, I couldn't OHKO it with Earthquake, so I have to make it a 2HKO. Kyogre misses Hydro Pump instead of landing it because I won't survive the next attack from Milotic which is coming up shortly. Greninja is sent out, and I land an EQ even when it sets off a Double Team. Milotic is next and I land a crit EQ to knock it out. The last 2 mons, Dragalge and Tirtouga are easily dealt with with super-effective EQ.
