	"Rad Racer 2 is a sequel of racing game Rad Racer made by Square (it also made the top games like Final Fantasy series, Chrono trigger).

	"Rad racer 2 have some change in gameplay. It have Power bar (charge it up to max, and start at maximum speed), and split time clock (sry, i am not good at english yet, i couldn't get the word). And about the music......it's actually better but less in number (in Rad racer there were 3, in Rad racer 2 only 2). That's all (sry..i am not good at writing reviews :P)

	"I tried to go at fastest times, avoiding collisions with other cars as much as possible (for exeption of some bumping to be saved on sharp corners). Also, sometimes i had problems with overtaking.....for example i was on side of the road, and in front of me there was opponent car. The only way to overtake him was going almost pixel to pixel between him, and offroad (barely avoided crash).
