	"Originally released as Mother 2 in Japan as the sequel to the popular Mother game, EarthBound, is the very nostalgic English version released in the US. Here we have four children leaving what family and friends they have behind to save the world from the evil power that is Giygas. The translation for Mother was never released in the US until much later after EarthBound, so the meaning from Mother 2: Giygas Strikes Back never was conveyed in this release. Giygas decided though that he patched all the glitches in the game, and we have to normally progress through the story to stop him unfortunaetly. Combining the psychic powers and effectiveness of weapons though, these kids are unstoppable.

They only learned about some glitches about a year later after they submitted and suggested them as improvements. This is hoping to make glitchless as it's own category for EarthBound TASing, and to give H&N more credit for what they had and knew at the time. In total this saved about 16 minutes over H&N's TAS.

		"The TAS took two months to make along with having to start the TAS over three times due to a crash that was happening repeatedly in late game. We later figured out that this crash was known and it is due to a sprite memory overflow. This is caused by chaining teleports too quickly because during teleports when a sprite goes off screen it is still stored in memory until about 10 frames after the teleport crash animation. If the total amount of loaded sprites exceedes 24, then the game will leak memory randomly. This causes the game to crash in random cutscenes and was apparent in H&N's TAS during their Giygas fight initially. I got a hold of Nitrodon and he gave me some Pro Action Replay (PAR) codes that monitor the sprite count stored in memory and prematurely crash the game if that number is ever exceeded rather than randomly crashing later. These codes did not affect the making of the TAS in anyway and were removed on completion. The TAS was replayed afterwards without them for validity.

	"I'm not in love with Earthbound and as a result this movie. I feel too much of the appeal of Earthbound is the cutscenes and the dialogue whereas the gameplay itself is fairly barebones. However, I do acknowledge that the game is well-liked and that the submission has its moments. I definitely can see why those that like Earthbound would like this movie, which reflected in the nearly unaminous positive reception from the audience. The main complaints were in regards to the movie using the same single character whenever the game asks the player to name something or someone but this does not impact the entertainment too greatly. It should be noted that taking the time to name characters something interesting would not be counted against a TAS. Additionally it was brought up that in the future an improvement might be made using Mother 2, the Japanese version of the game. It should be noted that according to the 
	[a class=intlink href=/MovieRules#JVsU

	" and 
	(__wikiLink|/1297M|1297M)

	(__wikiLink|/1297M|1297M)
