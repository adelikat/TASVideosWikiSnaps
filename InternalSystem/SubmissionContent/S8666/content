	"Bowman is a flash game where you have 2 bowmen and you fight to victory with shooting bow and arrows and to try to not die, and the game has 2 modes, VS human, and VS computer, which are similar to each other, but the difference is in VS human, you go up against your friends or pals, and in VS computer, you already get the jist of it, it's you versus the computer, and that's all I gotta say for the game, a very simple concept, but hard at the same time.
