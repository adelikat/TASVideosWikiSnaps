	"I'm not sure how many rooms left have not been TASed yet. So far, the only one that is currently impossible to TAS is "3つの装置の部屋からの脱出" which instantly gives you an "about item" flickering border even on the Wayback machine. There's only 13 total rooms in Flashpoint and I've saved a date in the Wayback machine to look at all or most of the rooms. Some don't have walkthroughs on YT already which is going to be time consuming. But, I don't think that it's a big deal considering how short these movies are.
