[div class=p 
	"-Scroll Glitch:  After you die the game looks for a valid location to respawn you.  The spinning poles in this stage are not considered valid locations and the platforms on screen are too far to the edges of the screen to be valid so P1 respawns in a junk location which causes the level position of the players to go backwards.  Pressing left as P1 deactivates the glitch and allows the screen to start scrolling forward.  Increasing the level position past a certain point activates an event and the next eligible event is the skeleton spawn - or at least that's what I think is happening
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-Since additional assets seem to be loaded the game is a little more laggy in this state.  We try and minimize this by shooting the homing weapon drop and destroy turrets but that's as much as we can do
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-Blue skeleton is vulnerable and inbounds.  Red skeleton is out of bounds until it does the jump up and hang from the ceiling attack.  Some time is lost for P1 missing a crush, but all in all 6 seconds are saved
