	"Hetfield90's Mega Man X 100% TAS in 33:48. It is 1329 frames (22.2 seconds) faster than the published run by gameplay improvement, and 400 actual frames (~10s) faster (due to emulator frame rate and lag emulation/load time accuracy disparities). Emulator used was Bizhawk 1.9.1.

]h3
[p 
	"There were two main inspirations which catalyzed this run: one of which came from a glitch (known as the Phantom Grab) discovered by Luiz "The Pride of Brazil, Slayer of Goku" Miguel, which allows you to replace objects inside of a boomerang by collecting another item with the boomerang on the same frame the new one spawns. This glitch was utilized to save a substantial amount of time and even changed the route to one which was previously thought to be impossible. Since this route is still far less than practical for real-time speed runs, I wanted to showcase it (as well as other optimizations that have been discovered by myself and other RTAers since Dezbeast's run was published) in a TAS.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The other came from FractalFusion and Rolanmen1's 100% TAS WIP, the movement of which I essentially copied exactly for the first 3 stages of this TAS (and even some of their downtime swag as well). When I saw their TAS WIP it was like art in motion to me, and it really got me thinking about what new things can be added to a 100% TAS.

	"Because the published run was made on Snes9x 1.43 (which saves a substantial amount of time over Bizhawk 1.9.1 in lag emulation/load times) and I wanted to know how much I improved upon the published TAS in actual gameplay (and in which places), I measured the the parameters of each section of gameplay in each TAS (to discount load time disparities) and counted lag frames to discount those as well. Of course, this undermines the fact that both TASes were made to achieve fastest completion time and reduce lag as much as possible (and that different parts of each TAS did a better job at reducing lag than the other), but I felt that knowing this extra information couldn't hurt. More info on what parameters I used to exclude load times and which frames were lag frames in each TAS can be found
