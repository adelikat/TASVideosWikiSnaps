		" I bought the Dog System(teleport) in a Secret Camp which near the main street during the middle game. In last movie I bought it in the fifth villages. Because of lack of money at that time, I had to take a detour and pick up money in the grass. And In order to buy this thing, I had to take a long time in the fifth villages because the place is not small. Now buy it in the Secret Camp, it is obviously saved time. Besides, an earthquake would have occurred near the Secret Camp and usually cannot be avoided. But I entered the Secret Camp before it, the earthquake was avoided.

		" In last movie, I had to take a long detour to buy panic shells. This time I found a substitute which called “dud”. Usually a dud is no use to do anything but in extreme case it will produce the effect of any kind of special shells. Although this probability is very small, panic shells can be replaced by dud by a heavy luck manipulations. The place I bought dud is also near the main street and it saved a lot of time.
