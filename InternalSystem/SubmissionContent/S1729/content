	"Disney's Aladdin is a semi-faithful adaptation of the movie, featuring most of the characters and the movie's original music. The story of Aladdin's adventure unfolds in between each level, usually with large colorful portraits of the characters as they speak.

	"The one main thing I tried to accomplish during this run was to not take damage. The only time in the game that I positively had to waste frames to avoid damage was during the last level when I'm falling down the long shaft with the rope. I cling to the rope momentarily to jump to the left to avoid the one fat dude below. It seemed like a shame to blow the whole "Takes no damage" thing for just one guy, and the frame loss is neglegible. Other than that, if you're wondering about stray sword swings, they are simply there to avoid damage, as Aladdin is invincible for a short period of time while swinging. You'll notice this mostly when I'm running past swinging ball and chains.

	"Most time between levels was saved due to either faster bonus game cancelling or skipping the entire bonus game entirely by not collecting any Genie heads during a level. In-level time saved was mostly due to more optimized movement with the following exceptions:

	"You need to chase down the Scarab to complete the level. The second time you are required to touch it, you usually have to go up and over the cliff and head back to the left to the cave it's in. Aladdin's Up+B sword swing goes through the wall, however, allowing me to "touch" the Scarab while on the other side of the cave and negate the need to double back.

	"The "Long Jump": While running, don't press anything for one frame, and then jump in the direction you want to go. I think this adds the X velocity of Aladdin's skidding-to-a-stop motion to the running motion, extending the jump. However, I could be completely wrong, as the trick doesn't always work in some areas.
