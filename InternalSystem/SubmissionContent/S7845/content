	"KUBO 2: L'Aventurier Courageux (English - KUBO 2: The Brave Adventurer) is the sequel to the NES homebrew game KUBO. It was made in 2019 by a French child and his supportive father. It's a short platformer set in a desert in which the cowboy turtle KUBO has to find his way out and retrieve the ruby at the end.
