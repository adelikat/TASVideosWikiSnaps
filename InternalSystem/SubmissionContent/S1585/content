	"The famous dokokashira run glitch is here. I'm no pokemon expert, but thanks to the game resources in the FAQ section. I was quickly able to establish how luck manipulation works and therefore obtain critical hit+oponent/enemy miss. I'd like to thank FractualFusion for showing the best route through the game, His demonstration run was a near perfect run, but I was able to obtain a better wild pokemon encounter battle and therefore get a time below 5 mins which I initally thought as being impossible. The run isn't particarly interesting in my eyes but its worth publishing as it comparable to the no exporation glitch in ALttP and much like it very well known and popular.
