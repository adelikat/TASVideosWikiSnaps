	"Note: The game database calls this game "Fong Shen Bang - Zhu Lu Zhi Zhan (Ch)", but this is incorrect. The game is called "封神榜" (Fēng shén bǎng) in the game itself, the instruction manual, and on the box. I don't know where the other title comes from, except the game database itself. The novel it's based on is called "封神演義" (Fēng shén yǎnyì), but it is also known as Fēng shén bǎng.

	": Ok...sorry for the dealy, but this was a bit to digest. The longer the TAS, the longer its going to take. During this time, I had to decide on how I was going to analyze this to make sure it was given the proper attention for judgment. I say this because, it was hard to find anything that I could use to compare it with. Yeah...there are people that run it but I can't tell how serious the run was...being between a speedrun or casual play. What I can tell you is...this TAS seems to go way beyond what a human can do...which is exactly what I needed to discovered. My guess is, that this run is at least twice as fast as the best efforts that I found as a compilation.

	"I apologize if some of the information I was seeking was in you your documentary sub-titles. I tend to read things and almost forget them shortly after. Doesn't matter though...this run appears to have enormous advantages over any human effort....mainly because of RNG manipulation.

	"If this run was on the border line of acceptance, I would definitely call this run out for a "baseline", as stated in the goal. I think you did far beyond that. Speaking of the goal, I'm removing it in favor of letting it stand as an any%...meaning, you easily achieved that baseline for others to go after.
