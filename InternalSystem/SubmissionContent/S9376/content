	": For context, Logan was recently banned for extremely poor behavior on Discord. He had been banned for the same reason prior to this, but he was unbanned about two weeks ago after promising to show good behavior. As you can see, that good behavior didn't last long. The account that submitted this isn't "a friend of Logan", it's Logan himself lying to circumvent his ban. While it is still true that solo submissions from banned users are not allowed at all for publication even when submitted by others, I've updated this submission from cancellation to outright rejection for being an unauthorized submission so that it does not get mistakenly reinstated should we ever choose to change that rule.
