		": Though Genisto claimed to have gained five frames on this boss fight before fadeout lag, he used an inconsistent measuring point (the after-boss sound effect) and in fact only gained three after setting the score to 0 to remove fadeout lag.  I only mention this because I am sure someone will be asking about it.
