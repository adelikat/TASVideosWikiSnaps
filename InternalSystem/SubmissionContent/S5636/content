		"Jungle Hunt
	]em
	" is an arcade game produced and released by Taito in 1982.  The original version of the game, 
	[em 
		"Jungle King
	]em
	",  was the subject of a lawsuit levied against Taito by the estate of Edgar Rice Burroughs for copyright infringement for using a likeness of the Tarzan character.  
	[em 
		"Jungle King
	]em
	" featured a long-haired feral man in a fur loincloth swinging from vine to vine in the jungle, and most damning of all, an unauthorized reproduction of actor Johnny Weissmuller's famous Tarzan yell.  As a result, the hero of the game was replaced with a stereotypical Victorian era "gentleman explorer", the vines were changed to ropes, and the Tarzan yell was replaced with a short tune.  On a technical note, 
	[em 
		"Jungle Hunt
	]em
	" is one of the first games to feature parallax scrolling.  And the music has a rousing jungle beat!  
	[em 
		"Jungle Hunt
	]em
	" was later adapted for the various home gaming platforms of the day, including the Commodore 64 and the Atari 2600.

	"Rope Wraparound:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"During a Rope Stage, it is possible for Jungle Hunter to wraparound to the right edge of the screen if he grabs a rope at the far left edge of the screen.  It is of no benefit to do so, and doing so generally causes a loss of Frames, but in certain situations it is possible to wraparound without penalty.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Faster Transition To River Stage:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"During a Rope Stage, when Jungle Hunter enters the "dive" posture, vertical movement is stopped for 5 Frames, and vertical momentum is lost.  It is possible for Jungle Hunter to avoid entering the "dive" posture before he lands in the water at the end of a Rope Stage.  This saves a minimum of 17 Frames.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Faster River Stage To Boulder Stage:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"During a River Stage, it is possible to briefly move beyond the left boundary of the playfield by using Knife, but Jungle Hunter is then quickly pushed back within the playfield boundary.  However, at the end of the Stage, Jungle Hunter can use Knife to move beyond the left boundary of the playfield and touch the edge of the shore before he is pushed back, thus triggering the transition to the next Stage.  This saves 8-11 Frames, depending on the current difficulty level.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Backward Jump:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"During a Jungle Princess Stage, turn Jungle Hunter to face the opposite direction.  Now press the joystick in the other direction while pressing the Jump button.  Jungle Hunter will jump in one direction while facing the opposite direction.

]p
[p 
	"This TAS completes 1 loop of each of the 4 difficulty levels.  Beyond the 4th loop, the game repeats the same loop at difficulty level 4.  The game's color palette indicates the current difficulty level.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"As a bonus, the input for this TAS also works with 
	[em 
		"Jungle King
	]em
	"!
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"During a River Stage, if Down or Up is pressed in combination with Left being pressed during the first several Frames of input, Jungle Hunter will be delayed by 1-3 Frames.  Wait until Jungle Hunter has full momentum before moving up or down in the water.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"During a River Stage, if Knife is used on the first Frame of input, Jungle Hunter will be pushed backward several pixels after the Knife animation has completed.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"During a River Stage, changing direction from diagonal to horizontal on certain Frames can cause Jungle Hunter to lose a few pixels of travel.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When Knife is used, Jungle Hunter will continue to move in the direction that the joystick had been pressed on the previous Frame.  Using Knife causes Jungle Hunter to instantaneously move 7 pixels to the left.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"During a River Stage, the playfield extends horizontally from X 111 to X 223 and vertically from Y 22 to Y 151.  Note that it is possible to briefly move beyond X 111 by using Knife, but Jungle Hunter is then quickly pushed back to X 111.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"During a River Stage, when a Crocodile's mouth is open, attacking the Crocodile's head kills Jungle Hunter.  Note that when a Crocodile's mouth is open, the Crocodile's body can still be safely attacked.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"During a jump, Jungle Hunter moves at a rate of 3 pixels per Frame.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"During a Super Jump, Jungle Hunter moves at a rate of 4 pixels per Frame.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"During a Rope Stage, pressing left on the joystick while pressing the button causes Jungle Hunter to jump farther.  The apex of such a jump is 4 pixels less than that of a normal jump, so it can cause a rope to be grabbed at a lower Y location.  Though a Super Jump does not jump quite as high as a normal jump, it is timed such that either type of jump would land on the ground on the same Frame.  Note that this only works when jumping from the tree branch to the first rope, or if the rope that Jungle Hunter is jumping from is swinging to the left.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If Jungle Hunter is on a rope that is swinging to the left, and the next rope is swinging to the right, it is possible to jump on a later Frame and still grab the rope on the same Frame, but at a higher Y location.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"It is possible for Jungle Hunter to jump to the last Rope above the water and then screen wrap to the right edge of the screen as he dives.  Though he lands on the jungle floor, he is unharmed.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If Jungle Hunter holds onto a rope for 10 swings, he is forced to fall.  This is to prevent an infinitely long game.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"During a Boulder Stage, a jump requires 64 Frames.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"During a Boulder Stage, Jungle Hunter may receive 50 points instead of 100 points for ducking under a Boulder.  This can be corrected by ducking at a different X location.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If Timer reaches 0, Game Over occurs, regardless of any lives a player may have remaining.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"After all 4 Stages have been completed, each unit of Timer remaining is worth 10-30 points, depending on the DIP switch setting.  This bonus can also be disabled entirely.  Timer is then set to 5,000.

The Monkey on Rope 10 will move to Rope 9 if Jungle Hunter delays for too long.  A Monkey will knock Jungle Hunter off of the Rope if he collides with it.  If Jungle Hunter lands within range of a Monkey, there is a 2 Frame window during which Jungle Hunter may safely jump again.  It is possible to grab the Rope either above or below a Monkey.  If Jungle Hunter also occupies the Rope, the Monkey can no longer move.  Note that a Monkey can not kill Jungle Hunter, he can only knock Jungle Hunter off of the Rope.  As such, it is possible for Jungle Hunter to be knocked off of Rope 10 but fall safely into the water, starting the next Stage.
