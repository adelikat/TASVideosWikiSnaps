	"Unfortunately, the libsnes core that bizhawk uses was updated between versions 1.12.1 and 1.12.2, which causes this movie to unsync. Basically, they changed way the lag frames are calculated, and although I initially thought I could just shift the inputs by a few frames (per level), it turns out this only works for about 2 levels before the optimized movement (see the movement section below) shifts by one frame, and that completely kills the run from then on. So I could not port this movie into later version because I would have had to redo the whole thing.

	"In normal movement, the character moves 2 pixels per frame. However, when moving diagonally, the movement speed alternates between 1 and 2 pixels every frame. We can abuse this to keep a constant 2 pixels per frame while still moving somewhat diagonally. This is used extensively throughout the run.

[div class=p 
	"Upon activating the shoes, the character gets 850 frames of doubled speed, which amounts to roughly 14 seconds. There are a few circumstances where this time can be extended. The timer that counts down from 850 pauses whenever the character gets hit, is in the recoil animation during a bazooka shot, or is in the middle of jumping. I sometimes use this to maximize the effectiveness of the speed shoes.

After this level I decided that I wouldn't wait more than 30~ frames to get the item I want, even though in theory I will still save time waiting longer. This can be considered a speed-entertainment tradeoff, since I figured it will be a boring run to spend significant amount of time waiting for the proper drop every time.
