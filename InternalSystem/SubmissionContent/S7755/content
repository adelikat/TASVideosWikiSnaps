	"Bookcase Jump is a sequence break in Glitzville that allows me to skip the majority of Chapter 3. Later in the chapter, there is a cutscene that occurs by entering Grubba's office through an air vent, setting the game's sequence to right before the chapter's boss fight. By denying Grubba's offer to sign up for the Glitzville tournament at the beginning of the chapter, Mario is able to move around Grubba's office freely. With that, I am able to make a precise jump up the bookcase, walk through and into the air vent, triggering the end of the chapter way earlier than intended, and effectively skipping all of the minor and major league battles, which saves about 30 minutes.
