	"It's really difficult to manage that the Level-End-Ennemies, didn't use there Jutsu attacks, at the most place, they would us them one frame after my attack, so I battled them many time to skip the most of there Jutsus. Problem is, I used many Jutsus too, at som place it seems that they wouldn't haven any affect, but they have! The next attacks of the annemis change, so that I could beate them faster.
