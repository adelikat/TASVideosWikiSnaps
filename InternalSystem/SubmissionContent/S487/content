	"Legacy of Wizard is a weird but funny game. When I started this I had no idea what game it was but it turned out to be funny!

	"My attempt is 15 minutes (!) faster than Marsh's attempt. This is because of better routes, thinking and luck manipulation.

	"You play as this family, including their pet, who shall retrieve four crowns and then slay the evil dragon.

[p 
	"Some words of the game and  my attempt.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This game is huge! Much bigger than I had expected. Every family member has it's own area and the areas has their own problems. For example Xemn's area is filled with blocks that needs to be pushed around, a bit like Lolo maybe.

	"In order to do everything  you need you must collect several items.
	$LF
	"I get the necessary items + a couple of others.
	$LF
	"Also, you can find items along the way, such as keys, food, speed scrolls and money. This is a bit annoying because I must collect some of these items to get anywhere. Another part that is annoying is that when you are low on something, say money, enemies will almost only drop money bags. This makes luck manipulation very hard but I tried to manipulate them as much as I could to get what I wanted. 
	$LF

[p 
	"This means I can't have speed scrolls all the time, even though I totally want too. But I think the run looks pretty fluent anyway.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Also I have to wait for the items to appear on screen, this is a bit annoying but it doesn't really matter. And the closer the enemies are to the bottom of the screen the faster items will appear. This is however not possible to manipulate all the time (only killing enemies at the bottom) because some enemien just refuse to drop a wanted item.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Sometimes I wait a bit longer to manipulate enemies to drop speed scrolls. I concider this totally worth it even though movement forward throughout the game suffers a bit. You'll see why ;)
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Hmmm. I think I made three mistakes that im not very happy with but the fluency don't suffer.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"First possible mistake that I know of is in Xemn's area. I might have pushed some blocks not optimal. When that came to my mind I was already in the girls area...
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Second: I don't think I actually need the "spike boots". But taking them and using them doesn't waste much time and they were actually pretty helpful where I used them.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Third: When I search for the sword I take a small detour to retrieve a crystal in order to teleport myself to the entrence of the dungeon. I could and I should have taken this when I passed there with Pochi, unfortunately I forgot that and discovered it when I had the sword but I couldn't teleport home.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Good thing is that I get a key without waiting for it this way.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Hmm. I also take some detours with the purple girl (mother maybe?) in order to obtain the magic key and to equip it. This is because I need much money to buy the jump boots. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Last thing that I can think of now is the boss fights. I tried to kill the bosses as fast as possible
	$LF
	"and I think I succeded. The forth boss however takes a bit more time. This is because if he hits he will instantly
	$LF
	"kill me. So I had to run away from him and then kill him. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"And I think that was it.
