	": While some of the strategies are nevertheless interesting, the movie doesn't do much other than expose flaws in the AI player. In that way, it is similar to chess TASes in technical merit, though it happens to be somewhat more entertaining due to the character of the game, but not by much.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Unfortunately, among those who know a bit about Go, it comes off as simplistic, and for those who don't, the significance of this movie is lost on them. Since there aren't any other strong cues of tool-assistance present, I'm rejecting the run.
