	"Too much needed nagging I went back and re-did the two

	"fights people thought were long and sped them up. Act 7 boss

	"(Try the boss yourself to see) as I pushed my luck attacking

	$LF

	"the secondary fire at all (Bullets) to kill things or play

	"him yourself before you judge how "quickly" it is to beat 
	$LF
	"him. The guys cheap, having WAY more life then you and he 
	$LF
	"knows it too. You saw in the video how when I was double as 
	$LF
	"agressive with the re-record it caused him to go into 
	$LF
	"beserker mode TWICE even before he went into block mode. 
	$LF
	"When you GET him into block mode you have to jab at air 
	$LF
	"often to keep him that way, otherwise he spreads his arms 
	$LF

]div
[div class=p 
	"As for the rocket boosting ALOT of the time I am giving my 
	$LF
	"guy time to fall/time to rest, because if you flip (which 
	$LF
	"you see after most boosts) too many times after you rocket, 
	$LF
	"your guy gets dizzy and stumbles for three seconds and eats 
	$LF
	"up time. This was the problem I had with the Egypt level, 
	$LF
	"and it took me about 100+ re-records just to get that FIRST 
	$LF
	"part down. A few boosts I can see that could be instant is 
	$LF
	"rocket attacks on the 2nd boss and Egypt mid boss. The 
	$LF
	"dragon you have to cut down to size because as he takes 
	$LF
	"damage he gets faster and faster, and you can only rocket 
	$LF
	"jab him once at a time before he goes into his flame thrower 
	$LF
	"(You saw how fast his body was when I hit him enough times 
	$LF
	"to cut it off completely from the grey skull, it was moving

	"Final boss, yeah I do swipe at air, but the game has bad 
	$LF
	"hit detection here. Those flameing skulls often are nowhere 
	$LF
	"near you and still hit you (Why I rocket boost through them 
	$LF
	"once because my sword woulden't hit them that one time) and 
	$LF
	"you have to rapid slice to keep them away. But if you want I 
	$LF

	"(EDIT) As for the low amount of re-records, I am a 
	$LF
	"professional videogame tournament player (I have the highest

	$LF
	"Fighter game (GO DONATELLO!) and second highest for

	"weeks on end to get it right ONLY to be told I coulden't 
	$LF
	"change my controller button posistions when I walked through 
	$LF
	"the door for the tournament. This is what cost me to go

[div class=p 
	"Also forgot something, with the rocket boost the meter 
	$LF
	"being "full" isn't really in sync with the ACTUAL charge 
	$LF
	"meter. If you boost the SECOND your boost bar starts 
	$LF
	"flashing it will de-charge, you have to give the boost at 
	$LF
	"least 2-3 flashs before you can rocket with it. Yes I know
