	"Unfortunately, this submission is sub-optimal and can be improved as early as the first boss fight, as demonstrated in 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=this example|href=/UserFiles/Info/638158505487141072)
	".  As a specific note, it can be seen in the encode of the submission that the first reflected weapon of the boss in round 1 hits the boss well after second weapon is thrown.  This delays the damage and the boss' invulnerability time enough that the second reflected weapon does not actually damage the boss which wastes further time and requires waiting for an additional (4th) weapon to be thrown.  The linked userfile improves the boss fight and gets to the next stage 54 frames earlier by fixing the noted delays.  There may be even more potential improvement if someone else wants to look deeper into this game; I did not test hitting the boss as early as possible and then doing the 2-hit attack pattern after, but this would be worth looking into.
