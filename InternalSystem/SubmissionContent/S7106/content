	"The Saturn version of the game largely plays the same as the Genesis version, but includes a training mode, a short documentary on Minnesota Fats, and a completely different plot in the story mode. In the Genesis version, the player takes the role of an unnamed rookie pool player seeking to challenge Minnesota Fats, and cutscenes are computer-animation. In the Saturn version, the player takes the role of Minnesota Fats himself, in his quest to challenge fictional pool hustlers from around the United States; live-action, full-motion videos (FMVs) are used for the cutscenes.

	$LF

[div class=p 
	"First, you want to make absolutely sure that you're not mashing buttons randomly at any point. You want to always find the first possible frame to do whatever it is you need to do. Even auto-firing a button can lose frames, so just keep trying things earlier and earlier until you can't possibly do it any earlier. This is time-consuming, but that's kind of the point of TASing: You have an infinite amount of time to optimize your submission, you should be using that infinite time to the best of your capability. Even if you only have 30 minutes a day to work on a run, the beauty of TASing is that you can just save your progress at the end of that 30 minutes and load it back up the next day, and you will eventually still make a proper, finished TAS if you keep it up. I often tell people that the greatest skill for a TASer to have is simply 
	[em 
		"patience
	]em
	". I've spent upwards of a year on a single run, others have spent 
	[em 
		"several
	]em
	" years working on a single run. Patience is a blessing. Use it wisely.

	"Second, you picked a complicated game to TAS. I respect that immensely, but I'd also advise against it in this particular case. Pool's a really tricky thing to optimize, it either requires knowledge of the game engine or an immense amount of patience to brute force every possible option to see not only if the strategies used are the 
	[em 
		"best
	]em
	" possible strategies, but also if they're being performed as efficiently as possible. While it's unlikely that I would actually reject a run for not using perfect strategies, it should be clear that different strategies were tested in the first place, and I don't exactly feel that coming from this run. 9-ball is likely fine (though I imagine the same thing can happen from a faster point on the board), 8-ball just has too many possible variants to be confident that there were multiple attempts at finding the best solution.
