[div class=p 
	[em 
		"Digimon Sapphire
	]em
	" is a pirate game developed by Vast Fame (creator of Zook Hero Z, Rockman DX3, among other things). As with other Vast Fame games, it actually is a legitimately good game, with nice visuals, a decent chiptune soundtrack and reasonably good gameplay. It's a fairly straightforward platformer, where you walk around, jump around, fire projectiles at and jump on enemies to progress through eight worlds consisting of three stages, with bosses awaiting you at the end of the second and third stage of each world.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The game has three playable characters: Agumon, Veemon and Guilmon, the respective partners of the main protagonists Tai/Taichi, Davis/Daisuke and Takato of Digimon Adventure, Digimon Adventure 02 and Digimon Tamers respectively. Each of them are completely identical aside from having different sprites and their attacks having different sprites (Agumon and Guilmon fire fireballs, Veemon a V-shaped projectile). In fact, it's possible to hex edit one input at the start of the run to change the selected character (without costing any time), and the run will still sync just the same. So character selection is really just preference. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Besides jumping and shooting, the Digimon have the ability to Digivolve temporarily into a larger, fully invincible Digimon. Oddly, all three playable Digimon Digivolve into WarGreymon. Unsurprisingly, the pirate game remains pretty loose with canon.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Another "feature" of the game is its hilariously terrible attempt at English dialogue before every bossfight. This dialogue is also the only thing resembling plot in this game, so...I have no clue what the plot of this game is. My headcanon just says Agumon/Veemon/Guilmon just kind of decided to go on a murderous killing spree one day, slaughtering absolutely everything in its path. Works for me.

	"In the only known version of this game that has a ROM dump, every time a stage is cleared the game will go to the credits instead of proceeding to the next stage normally. Normally, after the credits end, the game resets and it is possible to enter the next stage by selecting Continue. However, by resetting one frame after the stage is cleared and starts fading out, it is already possible to select Continue to go to the next stage. Thus, at the end of every stage (except the last) I reset as soon as the stage ends and allows me to continue on to the next stage. (This only saves time if the BIOS screen is skipped; otherwise, the reset would actually be slightly slower).

[div class=p 
	"A very convenient trick which allows me to reduce the majority of bosses to paste in mere seconds.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"How it works: most bosses spawn projectile objects of some kind to attack. Normally, when you hit them (either by jumping on them or hitting them with a projectile, like any normal enemy), the projectiles are "killed" just like other enemies, complete with dropping a pickup. However, for some reason, if the boss is invincible and its projectile is it, the projectile won't die but the boss will take 1 damage instead, bypassing the boss' own invincibility.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Thus, most bossfights come down to waiting until the boss fires a projectile, then whaling at it with dozens of hits at once, typically near-instantly killing the boss. The only real exception to this is Wormmon (2-3), as he is the only boss with no projectile attack whatsoever.

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The reason I digivolve is because of WarGreymon's property of free upwards movement through ceilings, which means that on the first vertical section, I can just plough upward while the camera can't catch up. After that, I continue the fun by 
	[em 
		"continuing
	]em
	" to go upward. As I showed earlier on in 1-1, when sprites go too high they overflow and appear onscreen again. (This is purely visual; an out-of-bounds sprite can in no way interact with other in-bounds sprites, even if they visually touch each other or overlap).
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"So, the way I keep moving up, I end up being in fact several screen-heights above where it looks I am. So for the next vertical section, I am not Digivolved anymore but can still freely move upward simply because I am so high above it all. (I do still have to move upward to force the camera to scroll upward, and I need the camera to be high enough in order to load and progress to the next section).
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"When the camera has scrolled up, I then have to fall down for the next part in order to end up next to the boss when I reach it. For this bossfight (15HP), I introduce another tactic which will be seen a lot later: taking damage at the start of the bossfight. I do this so that I can be inside the projectile the boss fires, so that I can then proceed to rapid-fire it with impunity.

The second property, which is the big one, is that it is the only boss that has no projectile attack at all. Which means I can't damage it at all through invincibility.
