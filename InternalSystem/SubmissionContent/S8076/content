	"This version of F-Zero is a sequel to the popular game released on the Super Nintendo, only this time, it was available only for download via the Satellaview hardware add-on. It features 5 new tracks, which were modified over time to become a finalized version...after a few weeks of releases in Japan. There are 4 new cars, which have varying capabilities...as with its predecessor. In following suit with the F-Zero franchise, this continues the same experience, utilizing mode 7 landscapes and the original game engine. Additionally, it showcases a much harder series, known as the "Ace League"...where a much higher challenge exist than ever before.

	"After my success of completing the first full TAS of F-Zero, I decided to continue that momentum and produce a movie for this sequel, which is heavily speed-ran by a smaller number of people in the F-Zero Community. Having learned a lot from the original, I was able to apply my understanding and immediately continue to produce a highly optimized run.

	"As with the previous game, this game was also BOTed. During the making of this TAS, I eventually started calling my main lua script F-Bot...for obvious reasons. Even with all my experiences and rewriting, there were still improvements to my BOT that helped make a difference. One of them, was actually figuring on how to make a multi-instance BOT to prevent me from having to spend around 3 months on each track. Even though it helped to speed the process up about 10.2 times faster, I actually used that extra speed to do more intense work. So, instead of 15 months total, it end up around 10 months where I spend anywhere between 1 to 2 months on each track. In one case, I spent 3 months on a situation that was extremely hard to figure out.
