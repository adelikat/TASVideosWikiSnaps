	"WARNING:  Those looking for running, jumping, and all-around butt-kicking shouldn't watch this movie!  This is a menu-based game like Dejavu, Uninvited, Shadowgate, etc., but its also the best one for the NES.  Also, if you haven't played the game I suggest playing it before watching the movie.  Its a lot of fun, and its not too hard (level 8 can get tedious, though).  There are a couple of mazes, and it has a fighting system based on rock-paper-scissors.  If you guess right at rock-paper-scissors, then you have to guess which way your opponent will look (not always random).  Also, almost every sentence in the game ends in an exclamation mark!  It adds to the fun!

	"As for this movie, I'm pretty sure I can shave off some frames from the Saladron fight, since I hadn't figured out the optimal way to fight at that time.  (the optimal way:  wait until the figures stop moving at the bottom of the screen, then press a direction for 2 frames, wait for 4 frames, then press a direction for 2-3 frames.)  I didn't want to redo the entire movie for 3 frames, however.  Maybe this game can use cut-and-paste like Bisqwit did for Rockman since the levels seem to be discreet.

	"There probably would have been fewer re-records if the menu didn't move at different speeds.  I'm not sure why, maybe it has lag?  But some menus move about twice as fast as others, and some menus let you start moving the curser earlier than others.

	"I used DTJAAAAMJS's walkthrough on gamefaqs, which is a really really good one.  I only had to do some very minor alterations to find the optimal route (if anyone finds a faster way please let me know!)
