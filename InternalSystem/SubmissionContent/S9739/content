	""Kim Possible 2: Drakken's Demise" is the second Game Boy Advance game based on the Disney Channel show "Kim Possible" (which I have not watched). The game is a 2D platformer where you mainly control Kim with the game being split up into 4 separate chapters each with their own story. I really like this game, it's surprisingly pretty solid. I am the current RTA WR holder and I already made an Any% TAS for this game (
	[a href=https://tasvideos.org/9471S rel=noopener external nofollow 
		"https://tasvideos.org/9471S
	]a
	"). I was able to beat the game in just 8 minutes by using an exploit which lets you carry over end level cutscenes into different levels and save files, allowing you to skip most of the game. However, this resulted in a very repetitive run, constantly doing the same exploit over and over again to skip to the end and avoiding a lot of what the game has to offer. Because of that, I wanted to make a TAS that actually plays through the game "normally" without skipping large chunks of the game. This is actually what my original Any% TAS was going to be until I found the cutscene storage glitch.

		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"I used the US version for this run. This is mainly because the US version has an exclusive exploit which I can best describe as "tutorial desyncs". If you pull up your gadgets menu on the same frame as hitting a tutorial, you can scroll through the gadgets menu while the timer for the tutorial plays out. This can be used to desync tutorials and it can save frames whenever it is used by cutting out lag frames. This does not work in other versions of the game which I find funny because this exploit only saves frames in the grand scheme of things while other, far bigger exploits were not fixed.
		$LF

	[li 
		"At the start of the game, Kim is faster on the ground than in the air so I try and stay on the ground as much as I can as well as minimise air time whenever possible. In order to jump with minimum height, you weirdly have to perfectly mash the jump button a handful of times. There are times where it is faster to get a quick burst of speed with the grappling hook which is an instance where jumping is preferable.
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				"Starting from world 2 however, you gain access to the handspring. The handspring makes you move faster and you move significantly faster in the air, although the jump does have a bit of startup. This shakes up movement from world 2 onwards.

	]li
	[li 
		"On ledges, you can either climb up, fall down or jump off the side of the ledge. Climbing up ledges is slow so ideally, you want to avoid climbing in a majority of situations. You can occasionally jump off the ledge to get up although this often does not work. The other way to avoid ledge climbing is to use the grappling hook to grab onto a wall/ceiling above you which can be used sometimes. There are numerous situations where you have to ledge climb although the ledge climb is invincible and has a hitbox, so it can go through enemies, which is useful/needed in areas.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"The main ways to get past enemies is to either gum them up or to use the spring kick. The spring kick is gained in world 2 and it is performed by pressing attack while handspringing. The spring kick deals 3x the amount of damage compared to all of your other attacks so it not only takes bigger enemies out in 1 hit but it also drains boss life bars much faster so it is often your attack of choice. The height of the spring kick can also be adjusted with the jump button so you can mash jump for example to land right after landing a hit. The spring kick is quite slow however so it is not always used.
		$LF

	[li 
		"Starting from world 3, you get the wall jump. Wall jumping is naturally needed to progress through the game but it is also very useful to climb up walls to skip sections.
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				"The game has a wall scale exploit. You normally cannot wall jump off the same wall more than once. However, if you start to wall jump away from a wall, turn back around to the wall and then use the grappling hook from the right distance, you can jump out of the grappling hook and then wall jump off the same wall again. This is naturally useful for various skips.

	"The way this game handles checkpoints is that when you die, the game respawns you where you last left off. However, there are numerous instances where the game does not update your checkpoints such as when you are in the air, standing on a ledge or while you have iframes from taking damage. This raises a question; what would happen if you die before the game could set a valid checkpoint? What ends up happening is that the game respawns you near the top left corner of the stage. This also sometimes results in you spawning above the level, Out of Bounds. Luckily for us, at the start of some levels, there is a 2 frame window where we can jump before the game can set a valid checkpoint. We can then jump again within a 2 frame window to once again avoid setting a checkpoint and from there, we can find a way to die and perform an upwarp. The exploit is only possible on certain levels and it is weirdly inconsistent (sometimes, your checkpoint will update anyway even with frame perfect jumping) but three levels it does work on are 2-2, 2-3 and 3-3 and in all of those levels, the upwarp is very useful. All three levels are designed in a way where you have to climb from the bottom to the top so upwarping is very valuable. Below, I have a crude image which roughly shows how upwarping affects the route in 2-2:
