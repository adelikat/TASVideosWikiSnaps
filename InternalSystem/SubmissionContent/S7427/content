	"MESHUGGAH did a great job with the published TAS, but in my quest to optimize/TAS games few people care about, I decided to take a crack at this one. His route manips a fight in the center and uses the dragon for the final fight. I route out that fight and take a different unit to the wizard.

	"The premise is the same, take all 5 power squares to win. During the first 3 turns we both are capturing the 3 squares in the center column. Here is where the route really differs. On my 4th turn, I move the Shapeshifter into range to attack but not be attacked by the Wizard. The Wizard is manipped to cast a spell on turn 5. That spell is imprison, which will either target a unit within his attack range or the strongest threat if nothing is in his range. Our strongest threat is the dragon, who is still sitting at home watching reruns of The Price is Right making this a wasted (and fast) turn.

[div class=p 
	"Turn 5, we attack the wizard with the Shapeshifter. True to its name it turns into whatever enemy it's fighting, so we become a wizard. The wizard can shoot the second shot faster than the dragon (80 frames vs 120) which mostly mitigates the time spent on the shifting animation. I shoot the first shot on frame 6 of the battle because I have to aim around the tombstones. This is unavoidable in this route, unless there's a way to manip the level layout to be more open without spending more than those 5 frames getting it to happen. Beyond that, I don't think there are any frames left to save on this route.
