	"This is a TAS of the game Star Wars for the NES. It completes the game in 9:46, an improvement on Walker Boh's published run by 502 frames (8.367 seconds). Walker Boh is listed as co-author because I reused the parts of his TAS where you have to shoot down tie fighters in the first-person view. Honestly, he did a much better job with those parts than I ever could have done.

	"Most of the improvement comes from not picking up the advanced blaster in the first level, and thus skipping most of the level. Some more frames were saved through minor movement optimizations, including a new damage boost glitch that allows the character to be knocked back at high speed. However, a few frames were also lost due to using the weaker blaster during boss fights.
