	"Inspired by all the Mortal Kombat TASes I saw recently, I wanted to try one of my own. Mortal Kombat II for GB is probably the best regarded of all the GB Mortal Kombats. It has challenge, good visuals and a responsive gameplay. The game doesn't suffer from lag, and while it's stripped down compared to the other MKII ports, it has a few surprises of its own...

	$LF

[p 
	"(I originally wondered whether it was be better to go to Smoke from here, or win the round and do a fatality which would make it seem that Liu Kang's head exploded all by itself from the sheer amazement. But since Liu is a good guy and people would probably nag about skipping the secret fight, I decided to go meet Smoke.)

There was a chance to create a friendly outcome for this fight as well, with cool poses and all, but I decided to go for the more comically brutal outcome.

	"About the glitches of this vid (more spoilers):
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Attacks done by keeping a button held down (like bicycle kick) often cancel out other attacks as you release them. This is used to create interesting situations throughout the run. Scorpion's teleport punch in air also cancels out your current attack.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"It's often impossible to hit your enemy after they are hit by special attacks. This is seen against Smoke, for example, when Liu Kang passes right through him after he was hit by a fireball.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Fatality prompts can be given while jumping or doing attacks, allowing many glitches to occur. Also, fatalities done to enemies who are in air at the time may also glitch up. Also, of one particular interest is Jax's fatality, which, if released in the middle of Gotcha Grab, causes the opponent to unleash his fatality at the same time as well for no reason (used against Reptile).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Mileena's teleport kick can land you out of bounds. Don't ask me how. By using scorpion's spear attack on your foe there and then, you pull him into the void with you. Fatalities while one or both fighters are out of bounds fail or work out with the characters invisible/displaced.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Slide attacks do no damage or even push the enemy around the playing field sometimes. Other specials can also have small hijinks in them... there still may exist glitches unknown to players.
