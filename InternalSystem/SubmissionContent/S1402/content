	"This is a TAS of the game Mission: Impossible for the Game Boy Color. In this game, you assume the role of Ethan Hunt in order to spy on enemies and thwart a generic "Evil guy tries to dominate the world" plan. The game was designed to be stealth-based like Metal Gear Solid, but as you will later see from this TAS, stealth is not high on my list of priorities.

	"Not much to say about this level. There are few enemies and they're mostly scattered throughout the map. This game is quite linear, which means you have to complete the objectives in the order they are presented before you can continue. When I run back to the building after receiving instructions at the statue, I can enter the building through the wall because of a programming error.

[div class=p 
	"This level is kind of annoying because the desert is filled with mines. When I come down after getting the explosives from the box, the reason I make a quick left strafe followed by a right strafe is so that I could avoid a mine, not because I was in danger of getting hit by the guy around the fence. Once inside the building, I walk straight into the enemy to follow to most direct path, that meant taking some damage. I couldn't take any more hits after this, so on the way out the building I abuse another programming error - the bullets don't travel much faster than I do, so I just dodge them.

]h3
[div class=p 
	"This is where the enemies first start to pose a major threat, but also where my character starts to show off some moves. Since the guy in the brown suit (an agent, as I call him) blocks off the alley, I do a running spin-kick to take him out. The spin-kick move is only available when I'm close to an enemy. On the way to the building, I dodge some bullets and take down some more agents with spin-kicks. An interesting thing occurs if I try to scale the wall one frame too early. My character will be shown changing uniforms and throwing the hook up, but then he abruptly changes uniforms and doesn't climb up.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Even though I'm on the top of the building, the game engine still considers it to be on the same height level as the ground, but with different colors. As such, when I jump over the gap between the buildings, the agent on the ground can still punch me to death. To avoid this, I jumped, and midway through the jump I strafed left so the agent couldn't reach me.
