	"If hit 1 frame later,boss would fly out.So using 300+300 2H to hit it is right.

	"The last boss has 8000 HP,1H can hit 10.The 2H in MS5 is not the same as 4,so 2 bullets for one shoot.So 300 can take 3000. 3000+3000+2000=8000.

	"Before the elephant.I use pistal to hit it so that I can get the right numbers of 2H.
	$LF
	"But it must be with full bullets.

	"I just watched it many times and finally compared the frames so that I can kill the boss successfully.
