	" by Alyosha, who thought it would be a good idea to apply a bot to the infamous last boss fight in this game.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"The final boss fight consists of 4 floting element heads that come and go on a 2D plane, attacking the protagonist. It is particularly difficult to optimize manually, given the butterfly effect-like every decision you make has. I ran the bot on an exceptionally large exploration database while constraining the hero to stay put (he cannot run). And it did find a better solution.

	"This movie contains only changes to the aforementioned fight (for a longer description of the rest of the game, see 
	(__wikiLink|href=/2777M|implicitdisplaytext=2777M)
	", and its 315 frame faster solution introduces a seemingly new concept: multi-fire. So it seems you can hack the game into firing multiple times before the previous projectiles leave the screen (if this was known but not used, disregard this paragraph).

[div class=p 
	"Q: Why not bot the rest of the game?
	$LF
	"A: While the bot has achieved success on many 1.5D games (Castlevania, Ninja Gaiden, PoP), where the hero mainly traverses the level horizontally and ocassionaly jumps on a platform, this game is proper 2D. This means that the paths here can have dominant X, Y or diagonal directions. This makes the exploration space much bigger. Although I believe it could be still successful in saving a bunch more frames, it would be a months-long project and I'd like to take a break from juggernaut projects for now (burnout).

[div class=p 
	"Q: Can the final fight be improved?
	$LF
	"A: Yes, of course. I had to cripple the hero into not being able to run in order to avoid him from pursuing one of the heads and falling to oblivion. If anyone wants to manually optimize this fight making use of the multi-shot and being able to run, then there's a real chance to improve it. But then again, in 5/10 years I believe we'll have powerful enough systems to approach a pretty much perfect solution.

If it's true that everything up to the final boss was done by Aglar and Randil (it's non-trivial to tell since they had a bunch of WIPs, the most optimal of them being unfinished), then the authorship of this movie looks correct, because inputs for the final boss fight in this run are
