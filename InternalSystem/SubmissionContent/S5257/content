	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Qualify on first try and foul subsequent attempts to save time. It is actually faster to slow down and make a tiny jump than it is to run straight over the line.

	"  (Kinda)
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Down is held for the duration of the race to make the swimmer perform the breaststroke (Michael Phelps mode?) instead of swimming freestyle.  I suppose since the opponent insists on using the freestyle stroke, the event name is at least somewhat accurate.

		"Clay Pigeon Shooting
	]b
	"  (Different mechanics from the original, as you call for each clay and have to aim your shots.)
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Launch points of the clays are manipulated to save time.  All clays are hit as missing any clays after meeting the qualifying mark results in a longer video. The launch position/direction of the clay pigeons is heavily RNG dependant, so some manipulation is done in an attempt to get the most favorable spawns.

		"Hammer Throw
	]b
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"The glitched throw to get the 92+ meter distance is used to qualify on the first attempt as it is faster than a normal qualifying throw.  Fouls are performed on the subsequent attempts, as fouling is faster than the glitched throw. It is possible to throw as far as 83m 04 with a regular throw, but it is much slower.

	"The roundhouse kick was the strongest attack I could find.  The lowest number of hits I could get to win the match was two.  Thanks to some beneficial RNG, in the preliminary fight the opponent stands immediately after the first knockdown.  A second knockdown follows shortly.

	"Set height to minimum qualifying and meet on the first attempt.  Foul all three attempts at the next height to speed onward. It is actually possible to clear as high as 6m 62, but since there is an upper limit on your starting height it takes many attempts to get it that high.

		"Archery
	]b
	"  (Different game mechanic than in the original. Targets are stationary and varying distance.)
	[br

	$LF
	"Once qualifying score is attained, allowing the arrows to fall short takes less time than hitting the target. The wind direction is highly RNG dependant, so some manipulation is done to get favorable wind directions. You'll notice we even drop one of the arrows before we've met the qualification requirements because a later one gives us a more favorable wind.

	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Jumps are performed as close to the hurdle as possible to clear the water. Interestingly, during the finals race, the human/TAS runner moves so fast that the CPU runners randomly glitch by running straight through every few hurdles to keep up. It is also possible to jump off the tops of the hurdles (steeples?) but the resulting time is the same.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"I was able to improve what was originally submitted by 
	[b 
		"DrD2k9
	]b
	" by around 7 seconds. Most of the improvement came from a quicker method of fouling out during the triple jump. I had done a wip of this several years back, but it aimed for max scores (which is where some of that info recorded here comes from). With the lack of entertainment and unclear goal I never submitted it. Thanks to 
	[b 
		"DrD2k9
	]b
	" for jumping right in and putting together a serious submission. Also for the discussions and collaboration on this submission.

	"Conclusion
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The TAS input concludes by skipping the final offer of exhibition events.  The end-game cut scene is rather long.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"One more note: How many golds that are won during the finals competitions has a slight impact on the end-game cinematic.  If a few are won, the athletes will hold one hand out with some medals and smile during the press conference.  If more golds are won, they will hold out both hands full of medals and have huge cheesy grins during the press conference.
