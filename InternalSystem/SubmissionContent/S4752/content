	"Ys: The Vanished Omens is normally a game about exploring the world, defeating bosses, collecting items and experience and saving the world. Thanks to how broken the mirror inside Pim's shop is, however, Adol decides he doesn't want to bother with any of that pesky exploring business, and instead warps himself to the end of his journey.

	"I have been running this game RTA for some time now, using the same route as the TAS this is obsoleted by. I discovered by pure coincidence that certain vertical scrolls allow the credits warp to be triggered without entering the in-game menu. I wanted to see if this would save any time, and the result is this TAS, which saves 21 frames over the previous by CoolKirby.

	"All of the overworld portion takes place inside Minea Village. Where the previous TAS scrolled vertically so that the bottom pixel visible is the bottom pixel of the middle set of buildings, the new setup requires that you instead go 8 pixels lower. This costs a total of 16 frames of additional movement. The horizontal scroll remains the same.

	"The main time save in this TAS comes from not having to enter the menu. This saves 37 frames.

	"The menus are identical to CoolKirby's TAS. The mirror is bought, then buying it again is attempted 3 times. Leaving the shop at this point triggers the credits warp.
