	"An interactive fiction video game based on the comedic science fiction series 
	$LF
	"of the same name. It was designed by series creator Douglas Adams and 
	$LF
	"Infocom's Steve Meretzky, and was first released in 1984* for the Apple II, 
	$LF
	"Macintosh, Commodore 64, CP/M, MS-DOS, Amiga, Atari 8-bit family and Atari ST.
	$LF
	"The game loosely mirrors a portion of the series' plot, representing most of 
	$LF
	"the events in the first book. As with other Infocom games (see: Zork series) 
	$LF
	"the Hitchhiker's Guide is a text adventure game, where the player solves a 
	$LF
	"number of puzzles to complete various objectives to win the game. The player 
	$LF
	"has a limited variety of commands that they can enter to observe, move about, 
	$LF
	"and interact with the game's world, such as "look", "inventory", "north" (to 
	$LF
	"move north) "take screwdriver", or "put robe on hook". 
	$LF
	$LF
	"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy gained a reputation for its difficult 
	$LF
	"puzzles. The most notorious involved getting a Babel Fish out of a dispenser 
	$LF
	"in the hold of the Vogon ship. This tricky puzzle appears early in the game 
	$LF
	"and requires the player to use a variety of obscure items in a very specific 
	$LF
	"fashion as to create a Rube Goldberg-like chain of events, and had to be 
	$LF
	""solved" within a limited number of turns. Failure to "solve" the Babel Fish 
	$LF
	"puzzle did not kill the player, but rendered the remainder of the game 
	$LF
	"unwinnable. That particular puzzle became so notorious for its difficulty that
	$LF
	"Infocom wound up selling T-shirts bearing the legend, "I got the Babel Fish!".

	"As with any text entry game, minimizing the number of letters typed is 
	$LF
	"critical. Much of this run was finding smaller words for saying things (e.g. 
	$LF
	""don" and "doff" instead of "put on" and "take off", or using Mr. Prosser's 
	$LF
	"first name) and when nouns could be omitted. This made it critical that the 
	$LF
	"awl was the tool to be chosen at the end of the game, and the player had to 
	$LF
	"visit the War Chamber last so that the awl was in the inventory. Each text

Even if you slow things down you still have to either magically know what's going on, or just read all the elaborate auteur eloquence, savoring the exquisite arthouse masterpiece that is being poured onto your bemused mind. Isn't that beautiful? Maybe it was, back when this game was released, when text quest genre was everything you needed to be entertained by a computer game. But overwhelming majority of games we TAS involves gameplay that can be actually seen, and if you don't have to read at all to understand the brilliance of the work in question, the better. I could have said millions of words describing why this game is so good or bad, and why the tier it gets fits it perfectly, but let's leave the rhetoric to true connoisseurs and simply accept this movie to Vault.
