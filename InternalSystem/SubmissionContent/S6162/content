	"Now, while a few people who are familiar with the game enjoyed it, the movie is completely unwatchable as it is. Even if you slow things down you still have to either magically know what's going on, or just read all the elaborate auteur eloquence, savoring the exquisite arthouse masterpiece that is being poured onto your bemused mind. Isn't that beautiful? Maybe it was, back when this game was released, when text quest genre was everything you needed to be entertained by a computer game. But overwhelming majority of games we TAS involves gameplay that can be actually seen, and if you don't have to read at all to understand the brilliance of the work in question, the better. I could have said millions of words describing why this game is so good or bad, and why the tier it gets fits it perfectly, but let's leave the rhetoric to true connoisseurs and simply accept this movie to Vault.
