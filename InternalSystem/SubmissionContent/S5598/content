If a different order of filling homes resulted in a more beneficial starting position of cars for the next level, a faster time over multiple levels may be possible even though the first of them may not be faster by itself.

		"From discussion on another game, I found out that BizHawk has different PAL and NTSC settings.  It defaults to PAL. The original submission was using PAL settings.  The current encode (and hopefully soon the .bk2 file) are the NTSC settings.  I could not determine which version of the game this cartridge dump is (it may be an all-region version).

	"The only changes necessary to convert to NTSC from PAL and resync the input was moving the starting input and one other 1-frame deletion (to avoid a death).  Otherwise the videos are the same inputs and visually identical game-play.  The settings change simply speeds up the game slightly and improves the overall time of the run by roughly 40 seconds.  I did not perceive any video or audio distortions from the change to region settings other that the slightly faster tempo.
