		"Ultima - Runes of Virtue
	]b
	" is an action game created for the Game Boy and released originally Dec 1991 in Japan, and April 1992 in the US. It takes one of the story elements from Ultima 4, Quest of the Avatar, that being collecting a Rune for each of the eight Virtues of Avatarhood, and expands it into the full quest of this smaller game. This portable, fast-paced action game makes a Zelda-like out of Ultima 4's wRPG gameplay (or the jRPG gameplay of Ultima 4's awesome NES port.) This game has everything I love about the classic monochrome Game Boy paradigm, being a solid pick-up-and-go arcade presentation that can be fun for twenty minutes or a long drive. It also features a powerful scripting system--flipping a lever or stepping on a switch won't always just open a door, sometimes they'll spawn monsters, or move items around, or just completely alter the level you're in! The game levels are incredibly dynamic, creating an incredible amount of unique puzzles inbetween fits of rat-stabbing and skeleton-bashing, and I honestly recommend the game. It makes excellent TAS material, too, as it can create fast-paced and precise gameplay that separates it from the slower, more deliberate gameplay a real player would use. The game is *very* difficult--so difficult, that gaming magazines rated the game kinda poorly just on that alone. Good thing there's now a TAS to show off what it looks like to not lose at the game, I guess!

The difficulty setting only affects what happens when you die, and, since there's no useful deathwarping available in any mode, it makes no difference which the TAS chooses, but I chose Hard anyway as a matter of TASing standard. Setting a name only affects the high score table, which to me seems completely worthless but whatever. Character, however, now there's a choice that completely matters!

His bow, while weak, allows him to prepare damage to enemies from a distance from the get-go, which also helps. His main weakness is he starts with only 4HP, and taking damage to save time is a huge part of this TAS, so juggling this weak point is always something to keep in mind.

There are shops where you can trade money for items or weapons, like if you want Mariah to have a Bow like Iolo to help out at the beginning or some such thing. In the test run, I hopped into Johann's on the final island to pick up some explosive Oil to skip a puzzle in the final dungeon, but in this final run I was able to locate exactly enough Oil in the other dungeons to do the same skip, meaning I finish the game without entering a single NPC home other than Lord British's castle. Every character starts with an Ankh that provides unlimited, immediate teleportation back to Lord British, and we use it at the end of almost every dungeon as soon as its Rune is found. There are eight Runes, and eight dungeons. Hop to it!

	"See, whenever you collect a Rune, your character gains a level in the stats that match the combination of the Three Principles (Truth, Love, and Courage) that that Rune's Virtue is made up of. Truth increases MP, Courage increases HP, and Love increases Dex, meaning movement speed. By collecting the Runes made up at least partially of Love, (meaning Compassion, Justice, Sacrifice, and Spirituality,) you can move much more quickly through the other dungeons to ultimately save TAS time. There is one catch, however, and that's the catch that ruined my test run:
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Stats have a maximum! Iolo reaches maximum movement speed after collecting three Runes of Love. The fourth one will not increase his movement speed at all. In the test run, I had collected the Rune of Spirituality fifth, which had no effect on my speed, and had locked me into doing the final dungeon early, with lower HP and MP stats. Re-ordering the path from the beginning was necessary, and here is what I came up with:

	"Six rooms in and we're already meeting a puzzle that shows off the game's scripting: One lever will turn the six X's into pushable Boulders, and the other lever will turn Boulders into Transporter Pads. You're meant to create Boulders, slot them into holes in the wall, and then turn them all in to Transporters so you can collect treasure and a key to exit the room. It's a simple application that eases the player into understanding the level of power that switches and buttons can hold later on in the game.
	[br

	"The final level is another big puzzle, with three barriers you have to open at the same time, but can only do so using secret buttons that can be reached behind secret walls. The Rune is guarded by two Reapers, who can take 9 arrows from the Bow before being defeated. Collecting a Rune instantly refills your HP and MP and ups your stats. Just beyond the Reapers is a ladder that takes the player straight out of the dungeon, but we use the Ankh instead to save time. Leaving on foot can allow the player to take a key from one dungeon to another, but usually for the TAS it's just faster to Ankh out. There is one exception that I'll point out later, though!

The player only has direct access to two sources of fireballs: throwable Oil bottles that are consumed on use, and this Wand. It uses a portion of an MP, and does more damage than Iolo's basic Bow, but the fireballs travel very slowly, so it's not used for a lot of combat during the TAS if it's not done at melee range.

	"Right at the start of this dungeon, this run uses a quirk of the engine to destroy a Skeleton instantly. You know how in DOOM you can insta-gib an enemy if you teleport directly where they are standing? That applies here, too: Taking an Arrow Transporter and landing on an enemy can immediately destroy it, even one that's usually invincible. In this same room, we also pick up a Food from a chest. Foods and Potions, when used in the inventory screen, refill your HP and MP, respectively. Finding sources of Food that don't take long to collect is very useful in allowing us to take damage and survive, and since we have to jump into the menu to equip different items more and more frequently as the game goes on, it doesn't take much time to heal at convenient moments.
	[br

	$LF
	"Soon after, the run does some unintended manipulations of Hammers. We duck into a sideroom that has a Hammer and Barrel puzzle that rewards the player with a Boomerang, a throwing weapon that we don't need. We can sneak away with one of the Hammers, though--when consumed, a Hammer can be used to destroy a Barrel, and by bringing an unused Hammer deeper into the dungeon, we can do the steps of a later Hammer puzzle out of order to save time.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Cheating that puzzle also uses an unintended quirk of the game engine: The game only saves the status of the previous room you were in, so if you go back, things stayed the same. Once you enter a third room, however, that first room is deleted, and the second room's status is saved in its place. In this case, we enter a room with a Barrel puzzle and solve it using the Hammer we brought earlier, and then collect this room's Hammer as you can only hold one at a time. We then go two rooms deeper into the dungeon to reset this room to stock state, and then we come *back* to solve the second half of the puzzle from a different angle. Normally you have to go through three other rooms to come back to this room on the east side, but doing it this way allows us to solve the puzzle without going through the full second and third rooms at all, saving time.

	"Evading enemies is a big problem in this dungeon in general--multiple places have Ghosts that don't always want to take the route I want them to take, causing me to have to rewind and do other rooms in different ways that cause enemies to change their RNG rolls, so hopefully a future enemy moves down instead of left, for example. I'm just whining, some of these were seriously irritating.

	"Another enemy that needs manipulating starts to appear here: Wisps. These little balls of light fire Lightning Bolts at you, and can warp all around the room at instantaneous speed.

	[br

	$LF
	"A few rooms later, we pick up the Magic Rope. This item, costing 1MP per use, allows you to walk over one tile of water by making a magic bridge. Magic items use a full MP per use and magic weapons only use about a third of that, so we have to be much more intentional with our uses of the magic items. There are occasional moments where I skip a possible Magic Rope usage because I would not have enough MP uses for later in the dungeons, and using up a Potion wouldn't be quite an option. Also, FYI, using an item always has a wait delay before you can use it again, and this shows the worst with the Magic Rope. Sometimes there's an awkward pause before I can make another bridge, and that's just unavoidable really.
	[br

	"Soon after using bridges to get passed some Rats, I press a switch without even stepping on it. Anytime you can't step on a switch because something has been placed on it, it acts as a lever instead, and you "press" the button without stepping onto the square at all. This is rarely a useful fact, but here, I manipulate a Bat to fly over a Button at the time I go to step on it, which saves time from having to step on and off the Button at all.

In other words, these creatures are here simply to troll us, and we cannot kill them. All the player can do is try to get around and through them without trying to talk to them.

And every time you cross the swampy corridor, more rats get spawned, nibbling at your ankles and getting in your way, draining your HP and MP over and over. Gloves are off now, not kidding.

	"A few rooms later is another standout room. The reapers surround a pair of buttons, one of which spawns a barrel when pressed, the other spawns Sea Monsters. The Sea Monsters can blast fire at webs blocking Boulders in your path, but they can't reach the lake on the left without your help. Once you let them clear your path to the northeast of the room, there is a lever that turns all Barrels in the room into water tiles. In other words, in this room you have to create enough Barrels and move them into position so that, once you flip the switch, the Sea Monsters are able to sail to the left side, and then breathe fire on the web over there, allowing you to get by and out to the next level. Very clever puzzles in this game, seriously!

The free HP/MP refill from collecting the Rune is very useful, because now we have to continue crawling up out of the dungeon from here! Thankfully, the final few rooms are actually easier to traverse. Once we're on the surface again, we have the option of unlocking travel back and forth to the mainland, in case you need to get back to the final dungeon easily at this point, but the TAS won't need that, we're going straight in.

The intended solution is to take a series of Arrow Transporters around the room--you can't move off the Arrows once you're on them, but you can fire a weapon. Take three loops on the Transporters, fire your Arrows at the right time, and you can destroy the Webs from behind, allowing you to walk through just fine. What I discovered, however, is that by using the throwing mechanic of the Oils and the slow firing speed of the Fireball Wand, you can actually destroy the webs from the front, ducking in and out of the corridor, turning Boulders back into Webs just in time for fireballs to pop 'em!

	"The only other thing to say about Ultima-Runes of Virtue is that there is another game mode that can be completed: The 2P Dungeon! This game has a two-player mode, utilizing the Game Boy's Multi-link Cable, to allow two heroes to challenge together a completely unique dungeon, designed for two people working in tandem to complete. I have tested, and Bizhawk's Multi-disk Bundler tool works perfectly for this mode, so TASing this special dungeon is also possible. I don't currently have any plans to do this, but that they did this at all is really cool.

	"Massive thanks to TascoDLX for making me aware of this. The final dungeon is on a separate continent from main play, however the game allows you to take a boat back in case you need to restock. This unlocks the boat for quick travel back to the continent as well. Turns out that the boat is always there, if you know exactly where to cast your Magic Rope. What this means is that you can Ankh out of the dungeon Pride as soon as you collect its Rune and cheat across using the boat instead of completing the back half of the dungeon. This skip alone saved me around 2 minutes, and I wish I had done more research before starting the run! This does mean I end up having one fewer Oil than in the original submission, which forces one of the rooms in the Abyss to be solved in a more intended manner, however I still was able to use one Oil to clear out webs faster than normal.

	"Once you collect a rune, the game does a brief "You got the triforce!!" animation. You walk up to the Rune, you pause, you hold the Rune aloft and shimmer in victory, you pause again, and then you walk away. Well, turns out, that during the two pauses and only during those two pauses, you can press any button to skip the pause and cut immediately to the next piece of the animation. It's lenient, too--once you see the character almost ready to pick up the Rune, just hold down the A button until the whole animation is done, and you'll have cut out 108 frames of waiting altogether. Multiple out for 8 Runes and this alone saved 14.4 seconds.

[div class=p 
	"I tried even more new ideas and strategies to cut down time in unintended ways, but only one made a difference. In the Abyss, there is a room where I lured a sentient Boulder into killing an otherwise-invincible Warlock so I could sneak by to the room's exit sooner. Well, the intended path through this room included finding and using a Heart Key, and I thought, y'know, there's a room a few doors down that takes an incredibly long time just to grab a Heart Key, what if I half-solve this room and bring its Key through the shortcut with me? Unfortunately, the game prevents you from carrying two of any one kind of Key at the same time, so solving future rooms becomes awkward--unlocking the Heart Door early, and then solving the rest of the room to get its Heart Key to bring that one down another floor, etc. etc. But even with all these extra steps, skipping the room with dozens of Arrow Transporters ended up shaving off 1,022 frames.

	"Otherwise, I improved or tightened up nearly every other room in the run, and the savings just kept adding up over time. The run will probably LOOK the same, but the numbers don't lie, there's a lot of improvement over my original submission. The only other thing I have to add is a video of a unique strategy I came up with for one of the Abyss rooms--namely, the one that spawns infinite Rats. I planned out a route that allowed me to kill every rat I had to spawn before any of them could step onto a spawn button and make more, cutting out all the lag those creatures would have caused!
	(youtube|v=https://youtu.be/j3QYefq2l28)
	". This technique ended up being about 100 frames slower than just blitzing through, rats and all, so it had to be cut from the run. I was pretty happy with my precision to make it possible, though, so I saved this vid just for posterity.

	":  The most current WR speedrun for this game is a full ten minutes slower than this tas despite using almost the same routing.  This tas does everything as fast as possible and bypasses unneeded items and shops.  While I had a difficult time understanding the labyrinthine mazes the author was able to blast through them at times even with a single heart left.  Also impressive that the author decided to improve their previous WIP by about two full minutes from seven years ago.
