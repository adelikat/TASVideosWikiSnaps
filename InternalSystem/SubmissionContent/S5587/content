	"E Mo Dao (惡魔島) aka Devil Island aka Devil Land aka Alcatraz Island aka Forget Everything You Know About TASing, is a GBC bootleg game by Vast Fame.

	"The game is basically a port of the NES game Getsu Fuuma Den, but with graphics changed in order to make it similar to a Castelvania game. The pseudo-3D levels were omitted entirely. The sound engine is taken from Mega Man V, while the musics are original compositions by Yishen Liao.

	(__wikiLink|/984M|984M)
	" and 
	(__wikiLink|/2285M|2285M)
	". So I've researched for a method to gain control during the demoplay in order to start with later stages already unlocked. And at some point I found a way, a very lame one.

	"There are four different demoplays. The first two feature use of the pause menu. If you press any key while the pause menu is open, the game will unlock control and start treating the demo like if it was an actual play. Luckly, every demoplay feature all items unlocked, so this means you can access to any level, including the final boss stage.

	"Discovered by Mothrayas. While on the overworld, you can press Select at any time for quicksaving the game. Since it is possible to do this even while the player is walking in between tiles, it is possible to save with the player's position on the spot of a level entrance. Then, after rebooting the console you will end up standing on the level entrance, but without actually entering it. Then you can just continue walking past that point. This must be done twice, because every level has two entrances. This can't be done with levels that have the other entrance past unwalkable overworld tiles.

	"This game's engine is incredibly broken and makes little sense. The invicibility times between hits to the final boss are always different, and it looks like they can't be manipulated, except with lag management. But here goes the problem: the emulator doesn't detect lag at all, because of how messed is input polling and VBlank in this game. After doing some tests with lsnes, I've seen that sometime the game does poll inputs twice during a frame, and skip during the following one. The game does often slow down for a frame or some more, and there is no conclusive reason that causes it: for example, it often happens during landing or when attacking, but not always, while sometimes can get worse. So, in order to kill the boss as fast as possible, I've used trial and error. I think I've done a good job, but I really can't be sure to have optimized it to perfection.
