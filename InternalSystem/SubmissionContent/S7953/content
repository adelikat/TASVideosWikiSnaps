	"With the ban on triviality lifted I felt like it would be a good time to let these Home Alone games shine. Since we end time on final input in the TAS, we can optimize a bit, nail down the bare minimum of things we need to do to win the game, and let it run out for the rest of the 40 minutes.

	"We make use of various glitches/bad AI pathing/etc through these runs to get our objective done very quickly. In this version we have to drive to the modern house where we drift into position to enter it as fast as possible. Once inside we make use of a floor clip that gets us out of bounds behind a pneumatic tube and the bandits try forever to catch us but they can't.

	"While it may be boring to watch the game play itself out without anything really happening on the screen for dozens of minutes, I felt it was still worth making TASes for these to see just how quickly they could be "completed."
