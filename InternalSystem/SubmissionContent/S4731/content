	": Hello, Gay.  This run looks well-optimized, and had nice usage of zipping.  I can tell in the thread that you put extra effort into further optimizations, and even went ahead and completed the extra level.  All other questions concerning possible improvements seem to be answered, too.  Accepting for Vault!
