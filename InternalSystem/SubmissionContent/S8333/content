	"NOTE: My bad. I just now looked at the feedback on my earlier rejected TAS submissions. Here's one without me fooling around and trying my best during the run. Also I saved 2 versions of this run. The one I submitted, I stopped the TAS on the very last screen where it says "Game over for now." I have another version where I stopped the TAS right after attacking the last person. Let me know if you'd rather have that one as the submission. Didn't know if I needed to stop on the final screen or not. Thanks.

	" I'm sorry once again to bring this up, but I have studied the first minute of your game-play and have already found 56 frames of improvement. This does not include the "prompt" errors that I found earlier. After seeing how your inputs look, I can only determine that this problem comes from recording  with a controller. Using the "TASTudio" editor is going to be your best way to solve these optimization errors. I would suggest holding off on any more submissions, until you have gotten familiar with how to use this tool.
