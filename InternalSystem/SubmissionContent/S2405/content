	"(I don't speak english) This game is similar to the Master System, but has significant differences. The Game Gear version has a better gameplay.

	": This movie has brought up an issue that I figured would present itself sometime, namely the "This game is better on system X vs. system Y" argument. It is my position that each submitted run should be judged on its own merits, and not compared to a run that does not exist yet. In this case, were this movie to be published and later be challenged by a run using the SMS ROM, we could discuss the pros/cons of each and make an informed decision. However, there is not a published movie of this game yet, so I am rendering this decision based solely on the merits of this run.

	"My decision is to reject this movie for these reasons: There have been a couple suggestions for level time improvements posted in the thread thus far, specifically Bridge 1 and Scrap Brain 2. I am also slightly confused by the goal choice regarding fastest time and ignores bonus effects. If the author were to aim for the best in-game timer, he should not have stopped prior to the end of the level to prevent the signpost from spinning. However, if he's aiming for real-time, this can easily be improved in Bridge 2 due to horrible management of lag, which makes that level look particularly bad. I think this is certainly a game worthy of publication, but this run simply has too many flaws in it to be accepted.
