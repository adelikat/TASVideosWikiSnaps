	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Sonic found a robot called Emerl that feeds with Chaos Emeralds, in a matter of time, he found out that the robot can learn it's opponent movements and use it, being totally customizable to put movements of every character, the more fights it gets, the more movements it can learn, sadly, it can only learn one movement per battle. When he learns every single attack in the whole game, you can customize him to be an ultimate weapon of destruction, being the most hard character to beat in the whole game.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This game has 2 kind of movements, Normal Attacks and Special Attacks. Normal Attakcs are all kind of simple attacks. Special Attacks are those wich are asigned to the R Button, each character has 6 different Special Attacks, but can only use 2, these are choosed from the very beginning of the battle and after a character gets KOed.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Above the Health Meter, there is an Overdrive metter, it increases by blocking attacks, getting hit and by meditating. When it's full, when the character use an Special Attack it can KO the enemy instantly, thus depleting the Overdrive meter. If a character blocks an Overdrived Special Attack, the character gets it's Overdrive meter full.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Also, each character can instantly block one of the 2 Special Attack of each opponent, I think that this is determined each time a character die.

[p 
	"I did 2 fights, in wich I used different character to make it less repetitive.

[p 
	"About Configuration:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I Choosed Emerald Beach and Battle Highway because these have the best music of the game.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Reduced the Characters Interval to 5 secs (minimun), this means that everytime a character gets KOed, it has a limit of 5 secs to choose it's special movement to re-appear in the battle.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Increased the COMs difficulty to what the game calls "Super Powerful"

	"-First Fight-

[p 
	"KO Battle: 15 KOs (First Character to get 15 KOs Wins)
	$LF

[p 
	"Sonic vs Tails, Knuckles and Amy
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I choosed Sonic because of his good speed, he is one of the weakest characters, but his speed allows him to make good combos to KO opponents.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Tails a little stronger than Sonic but slower. Knuckles is the powerhouse, being realy slow, but incredibly powerfull. Amy is the fastest of the three and the second on power, she, can easily KO because of how powerfull she is using hammer attacks.

[p 
	"Timed Battle: 5 Mins (Character to get the biggest KO Count at the end wins)

	"Shadow vs Emerl, Emerl and Emerl
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I choosed Shadow because of his great speed, power and coolness, he is faster than Sonic and stronger than Knuckles.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Emerl has all the strongest attack he can get, only one can be the most difficult enemy to deal with, and not to mention that I fought against 3. And they are nearly always blocking attacks, making it difficult to actualy being able to hit them.
