	"Sonic found a robot called Emerl that feeds with Chaos Emeralds, in a matter of time, he found out that the robot can learn it's opponent movements and use it, being totally customizable to put movements of every character, the more fights it gets, the more movements it can learn, sadly, it can only learn one movement per battle. When he learns every single attack in the whole game, you can customize him to be an ultimate weapon of destruction, being the most hard character to beat in the whole game.

[div class=p 
	"This game has 2 kind of movements, Normal Attacks and Special Attacks. Normal Attakcs are all kind of simple attacks. Special Attacks are those wich are asigned to the R Button, each character has 6 different Special Attacks, but can only use 2, these are choosed from the very beginning of the battle and after a character gets KOed.

	"Above the Health Meter, there is an Overdrive metter, it increases by blocking attacks, getting hit and by meditating. When it's full, when the character use an Special Attack it can KO the enemy instantly, thus depleting the Overdrive meter. If a character blocks an Overdrived Special Attack, the character gets it's Overdrive meter full.

	"Also, each character can instantly block one of the 2 Special Attack of each opponent, I think that this is determined each time a character die.
