	": Hello, perfectacle.  First off, to address whether this run is publishable, a precedent has been previously set in allowing certain (key word) non-trivial card games into 
	[a class=intlink href=/2860M 
		"the
	]a
	" 
	[a class=intlink href=/2451M 
		"Vault
	]a
	". Furthermore, this 
	[a class=intlink href=/HomePages/Nach/HistoryOfGamesAndRelevanceHere 
		"sub-page
	]a
	" by Nach (scroll to the bottom) outlines a reasoned argument for card games going beyond the scope of triviality in compared to general board games (which are, currently, banned).  To sum that up: This run qualifies for Vault-tier publication.

	"Now for the run itself: To make clear, this 100% branch requires that every ranked opponent is met and defeated.  This requires a minimum amount of points to be obtained against each opponent before one is able to advance on to the next player.  The minimal points requirement is important, as it addresses an objection made in the thread of why auto-wins aren't used in every game (i.e. auto-wins simply don't generate enough points to speedily advance onward).  
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Upon closer examination as well, there is a remarkable amount of strategy evident in setting up multipliers with previous victories (some even set up using auto-wins) in order to obtain much higher point payouts in the next round (the 3rd 6th, and 9th opponents immediately come to mind).  In addition, there is obvious luck manipulation being used in ensuring that opponents always make inferior moves designed to increase your score.  
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"So all in all, I've determined this to be a technically impressive run, despite the low thread participation and voter entertainment score.
