	"This glitch takes advantage of the fact the locked door will not allow you to pass.  By taking a hit near it, it can eject you into the wall and appear at the top of the screen.  The resulting graphical glitches can be manipulated to descend down screen where normally it is impossible to do so.  As a result I can go directly to the boss fight, without getting the key, remote control, and using gizmo duck.
