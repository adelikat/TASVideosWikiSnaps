	$LF
	"because I found this new glitch at gamefaqs. The one they 
	$LF
	"call "flying". Using this saved me a couple of seconds. What 
	$LF
	"saved me time later on was better fighting with robots. I 
	$LF
	"didn´t fight 3 simultaniously this time because they caused 
	$LF
	"lag. Also I killed 2 more robots then last time so I could
