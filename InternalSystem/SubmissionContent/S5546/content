However, with the existence of a WIP file from another author, a comparison needs to be done between the two to see which is the faster movie. An issue with comparing between these two movies is that they're both on different versions of the game (maTO using US version, with mtbRc using the JP version). At different points between the two movie files, the file which is ahead changes. I've chosen to split it based on boss fight finish up to the last completed portion of the WIP from mtbRc.
