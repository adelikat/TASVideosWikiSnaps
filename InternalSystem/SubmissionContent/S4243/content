	"Drawing his gun faster allowed me to change the strategy of this stage a little. Samsara mentioned something about his Sprite Overload trick, and how it would save time if one was able to figure out how to do it consistently. Well, you'll see it used a lot more in this run, but to tell you the truth, I also don't know what triggers it. Sometimes I have to shoot seven bullets, but there are rare occasions where just one bullet is enough to cancel Garth's falling animation.

I was trying to keep the same approach using the skid trick to slide on the floor for a few frames, but then I noticed that the speed of Wayne was not decreasing. So, there are no more trade offs in this run, sorry about that. But don't despair; Wayne's animations are quite funny, and I think that you won't miss the trade offs so much. Oh, I saved the best for last, so keep watching, please.
