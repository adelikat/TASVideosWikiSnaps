	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/LeHulk

	"'s WR.  The tricks just blow me away, especially all the wall avoidance's and "just ending up somewhere unexpected". I know the submitter talked about this submission being a temporary stepping stone, until something better is made...but honestly, I can't see anything to improve on (mainly because I'm not the one that figured the deep mechanics out). Being more than 7 minutes faster than the RTA WR, it gets my approval.
