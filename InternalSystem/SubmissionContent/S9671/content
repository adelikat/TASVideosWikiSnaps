A "Chief Minion" will be available in every level and is the only Minion who can pick up the collectable and exit. If the Chief Minion is defeated, whether it be by an enemy or hazard, he is defeated and the level has to be restarted. As the game progresses, more and more level elements get introduced, including different types of Minions which can be used for different purposes. You might think that because the Minions move on their own, the TAS wouldn't be much different than a standard playthrough, but I got a few tricks up my sleeve.

	"Luckily, there are two polarity pads at the start of the level: on the floor and on the ceiling. I drop the Gravity Minion down and make him bump into the Chief Minion. While the Gravity Minion walks upside-down to the other polarity pad, I start the Electrical Minion, who bumps into the drawbridge and makes his way to the spark wire below. The Gravity Minion hits the second polarity pad and then lands next to the button needed to access the right half of the level.

We actually don't need the Gravity Minion anymore, so I let him touch a spike pit and waddle around on his own at the start. The right side of the level has the collectable and another spark wire, so all we need to do is to get both Minions safely across. As they head back, I let the Electrical Minion climb up and walk past the inlet, opening the door.

		"Ok, so the old strat involved letting the other Minions walk into some bombs as the Chief Minion exits the level so that they respawn and touch some bombs that are close to their spawn points, but I'm looking for improvements while writing these notes and I just...??????? I was trying to see if I could make it so they both hit a bomb immediately after the Chief Minion leaves but I somehow made the Gravity Minion turn the Electrical Minion around??? This ended up saving me 47 frames. Magic.

I start moving the Gravity Minion early, since it's in the Chief Minion's way. The Gravity Minion reaches the exit and respawns to its starting location and follows the Chief Minion to the exit.

I need the Chief Minion to enter to tube at the right to get the collectable, so I make the rightmost Electrical Minion go to the top-right tube, which brings him to a spark wire on the left. The other Electrical Minion is redirected left and down to get to another spark wire. After both Electrical Minions walk past the inlet, I make them go back to the spark wire, since it's faster. Some blocker stalls are added to prevent the Minions from bouncing on top of each other.

	"This game was on my radar for the longest time, but I never got around to playing it fully. Glad to have TASed it though. This game is pretty neat and I loved trying to find unintended solutions for some of these levels. The graphics and music are nice, too. As someone who unironically loves these little yellow guys, I'm really glad that this game exists. TASing this was a nice experience. Sorry for the Minion gifs btw, I just couldn't resist. :-)

If it is, I'll have enough cheese to last my entire life! Sure hope some guy with an orange jumpsuit and a piranha gun doesn't get in the way. - Walgrey

	": A quirky little puzzle game involving the cast of Despicable Me, including everybody's favourites (?), The Minions! Much like Lemmings, the game's goal is to escape each level while also grabbing some required object. It seems like it suffices for the main minion to escape to beat each level. However, here the author makes a quick escape with all minions before the end timer runs out, saving additional frames.
