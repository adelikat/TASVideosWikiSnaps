	" About the Game
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Skitchin' is a real gem of a game released in 1994, way back when EA didn't completely suck.  It is the spiritual successor to the Road Rash series.  The goal of the game is to rollerblade to the finish line, grabbing cars to boost your speed (the titular "skitching"), performing tricks, and knocking over other racers with various weapons.  In this tool-assisted speedrun, very few cars are skitched and the other racers are ignored.  Gameplay is actually fairly nuanced in ways I don't care to describe here, but I highly recommend playing this game through, *cough*, legal means so you can experience it for yourself.  Skitchin' isn't a great game, but I would say it's a hell of a lot more fun than it ought to be.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The first thing you'll notice about it is that it's dripping with '90s "'tude", similar to Comix Zone in that regard.  I think they purposefully played it up, so I find it rather charming.  There is a lot of humor (both intentional and unintentional) to be found if you keep your eyes peeled, and I've devoted a section at the bottom of this page to a taste of what this game holds.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This is my first TAS.  I've always had a soft spot for this game and I was a little surprised to see no one had so much as attempted a run of it.  Even thirteen years ago, I wanted to make maps of all the levels so that I would know where to find the best weapons.  Everything just fell in place: I suddenly had a lot of free time on my hands, I liked the game, it was fairly short and linear, there was no speedrun for it, and the game was entertaining enough to watch.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There are 12 levels in this game.  I play 11 of them and complete 6 of them, warping out of 5 of them.  The only level you will not see is San Francisco (and I can attest you aren't missing much-- it's difficult and boring).

	" Route Planning
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Ah, route planning.  The bane of any speedrunner.  The prospect of route planning killed my Cool Spot TAS idea before it even got off the ground.  Fortunately, Skitchin' is fairly linear, so it's relatively easy to plan.  Emphasis on "relatively".  I still put in a lot of effort optimizing routes.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Long-term Route Planning
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Planning for the long-term was by far the easiest.  By performing tricks into certain billboards, you can warp to different levels.  I scoured the game for these billboards and was able to produce a map of all the warps.  From this, I determined the fastest path to New York.  As you'll see from the video, this is (numbers in parentheses indicate the level number):

]p
[h4 
	" Nitro Planning
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Scattered throughout the levels are canisters of nitro, which look like cans of spray paint.  Nitros boost your speed and are crucial to this run as using just two of them can accelerate you to maximum speed.  Determining when each nitro should be used is extremely nontrivial.  Sometimes the best strategy is to use a nitro right away, sometimes it should be stocked away for a future level.  For almost every nitro (especially as the game progressed), I spent a lot of time determining whether I should pick it up and when I should use it.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"To assist in planning, I wrote a short program in Matlab to crudely simulate the playthrough of a level.  Given an initial state (position and velocity) and a goal position, this program output the number of frames until that point is reached for specified times using nitros.  While the program isn't perfect, I found that the ideal timing for using nitros is fairly generous (usually to within plus-or-minus 30 frames), so I'm quite confident I used every nitro when it would do the most good.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" In-level Route Planning
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"As far as route planning goes, this had the greatest variety of difficulty.  For some levels, it was only a matter of finding the next ramp or nitro and then jumping to it.  For parts of some levels, it was a strenuous process of trial and error in an effort to avoid obstacles or set myself up for a better position down the road.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Techniques
	$LF
]h3
[h4 
	" Up+B+C Jumping
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"By far the most implemented technique in this run-- it's performed dozens of times in every level I don't warp out of.  This is a semi-secret technique that isn't described in the game's manual, but is still well-known.  By holding Up+B+C, you perform an extra high jump, kicking your legs to one side to indicate you've performed it correctly.  Although this leg kick is identical to one of the tricks you can perform, the jump does not award you any money.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"While performing this jump, your velocity components (both forward and lateral) are maintained.  Since you decelerate rapidly on pavement and very rapidly in grass, it pays to perform this jump as much as possible.  Upon landing, your lateral speed remains locked until a particular frame, at which point you can either perform another Up+B+C jump (generally preserving your lateral speed) or simply take control of the character again.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This jump cannot be performed while climbing a steep hill (you fall down before your legs straighten).  It also cannot be performed while a nitro is selected (you will instead use the nitro).
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" (Conventional) Jumping
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"A poor man's Up+B+C jump.  By simply pressing Up, the character performs a short jump.  This jump generally takes you about 3/4 the distance of an Up+B+C jump, also preserving your velocity components.  One advantage to this jump is that you can alter your lateral speed as soon as your feet touch the ground.  This makes it ideal for finessing tricky areas where an Up+B+C jump would "lock in" to a particular lateral velocity.  It can also be useful for "closing gaps" between short-term goals when an Up+B+C jump would carry you too far.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Like the Up+B+C jump, this cannot be performed while climbing a steep hill, although I've found that it can be performed on steeper hills than the Up+B+C jump.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Tricks
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"It literally pays to perform tricks in this game, but that's not why I do them.  Doing tricks gives you a small boost in speed.  This can be most clearly seen in the first level, Vancouver, where I pull away from a pursuing car just by performing a trick.  The maximum speed in Skitchin' is 125 units and a typical stunt will add eight to ten units to your current speed.  There are tons of ramps and other opportunities for tricks throughout the game, so it's very easy to increase and maintain your speed.  I also try to demonstrate as much variety as possible in the tricks I perform so that the speedrun is less monotonous.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Tricks Off of Opponents
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"This is just a special case of a regular trick.  If an opposing racer falls down, you can perform a trick off of his poor, battered body.  I'm only able to do this once at the start of Miami, but future speedrunners should be aware of this technique.  If you can luck manipulate other racers into falling down, I imagine a lot of time can be shaved off of the run.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Speed Canceling
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Speed limit ramps are always on the right-hand side of the road.  To get to them without spending too much time on the grass, you must hold Right, but in doing so, you build up lateral momentum that might carry you into the grass when you land.  By holding C when you reach any ramp, this lateral speed decreases by one unit per frame, straightening your trajectory.  This is extremely useful for speed limit ramps that show up just before the road turns to the right.  I only discovered this technique while running Chicago, so there are many times when I could have used it but wasn't aware of it.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Item Duplication
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"When I picked up a nitro in Vancouver Bonus, I was surprised to find that the game awarded me two nitros.  I tried to replicate this glitch, but to no avail.  From what I can tell, it requires very precise initial conditions.  Duplicating that nitro didn't save much time, but I've left it in as an invitation to more savvy speedrunners to figure out how it's done and obliterate my record.  I can't imagine how much time would be saved with twice as many nitros available as this run.
	$LF
]p
[h3 
	" Individual Level Comments
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"While there isn't a whole lot to say, I have provided comments on every level.  My specific comments are indexed according to the in-game timer.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" WARNING Screen
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"You're normally forced to look at the WARNING screen for about ten seconds.  However, if you input B-A-Down-A-Start-Start (BADASS), this skips the screen and allows you to enter cheats in the password menu.  I enter the code as quickly as I can.  It does not affect gameplay.

]h4
[p 
	"When I started this speedrun, my Lua script was pretty rudimentary.  As such, Vancouver is just a teensy bit sloppy.  If you look at the input, you'll notice I hold Up+B+C a lot instead of pressing it at particular frames.  Perhaps I'm just obsessive compulsive, but it looks crude to me.  Just ignore this level.  It gets better.

		"00:06 - I tried to manipulate the first car into being as fast as possible, though I'm not sure if it paid off.  My reasoning was that if I'm going as fast as possible, then I will hit ramps more often, allowing me to go even faster, allowing me to hit more ramps, and so on.  I accelerate to manipulate the car's speed, then skate into the grass so I can skitch it as early as possible.

	"After Vancouver, Toronto, and Miami, if you complete the course quickly enough, you are awarded with a bonus level that you must speed through as quickly as possible to earn money.  These three bonus levels are identical.  While the other two just waste time, Vancouver's bonus gives me an opportunity to pick up some nitros.  This level features the last skitching of the entire speedrun.

	"I tried to make this TAS as fast as possible, but it isn't perfect.  The two biggest changes I would make would be running into more things at the ends of levels, thus allowing me to get out of Miami's bonus stage sooner, and using two nitros at the start of Detroit.  In addition to that, there are tiny optimizations to be made along the existing route-- using nitros or jumping at slightly different times, changing your trajectory sooner, and other miscellaneous changes.  Finally, there are some techniques that I only picked up on as I played, so they aren't implemented in earlier levels.  I estimate that by further optimizing the current route (assuming no tradeoffs with the luck that I had), roughly ten seconds could be saved.  I'm confident my route is optimal, but I estimate that if there is a better route through each stage, no more than about thirty additional seconds could be saved.  That sounds like a lot, but I'm trying to be generous with my estimates.  If you think you can do better, by all means, give it a shot.  I think you'll find it quite difficult to improve.

It saves seven seconds on Toronto Bonus plus three seconds on Miami Bonus because it would only take seven hits to destroy your skates.  It costs about six seconds in Detroit (according to my Matlab program) and about three additional seconds to buy new skates.  The amount of time saved may differ substantially from this estimate, mostly depending on how much time is lost in Detroit.

	"Notes to encoders: The movie should end at or around frame 63600 when the TV snow wipes to black.  The credits that follow are shown at the start of the game (though you can include them if you really want).  Also, be sure to disable "PSG High Quality" under the sound menu-- it does funky things to Vancouver's music and probably doesn't help the other tracks in the game.  Having it disabled sounds better and more authentic.
