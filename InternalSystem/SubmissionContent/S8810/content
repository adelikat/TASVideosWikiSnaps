[div class=p 
	"At parts where there are different blocks opposite each other that go up a bit like a ladder, I found that there was a very specific way to jump here. For every jump you do, you need to make sure it reaches the next block, otherwise it's suboptimal. We try to minimise how long we jump for so that every jump reaches the next block but doesn't quite land on them. This is a handful of frames faster than the old strategy, where I didn't chain the jumps like this.

[div class=p 
	"In Level 141, while fixing inputs on my Main Game TAS, I accidentally discovered that by timing your jumps very precisely, it's possible to clip through the floor and get hit by one of the lower flames, which is about 3/4 of a second faster than climbing and accelerating to reach the flame at the top left corner, and about 2 seconds faster than my original strategy which was to just jump down to the lower flames.

[div class=p 
	"This is used in Level 147 to reach the flame in the top left corner, a flame that was previously thought to be out of reach. As soon as the level starts, we hold A and R for 2 frames, then on the 3rd frame, we let go of R and start holding L instead. This shifts the character's Y position just enough so that we can jump 2 blocks instead of just 1, thus making it possible to reach said flame.
