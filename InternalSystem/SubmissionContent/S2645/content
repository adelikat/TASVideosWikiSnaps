	"After successfully rescuing all of the elder Dragons, Spyro is taking a vacation to Dragon Shores--at least that's where thinks he's going. A dinosaur-riding sorcerer, known as Ripto, has invaded the world of Avalar, and is wreaking havoc on its citizens with his magic. Spyro must travel through the world of Avalar and undo the damage done by Ripto... but vacation are more important for him, so he just want to beat Ripto to reach the Dragon Shores, Avalar problems are not his problems.
