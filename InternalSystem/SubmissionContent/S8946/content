	"First off...It seems you are not noticing the comments from any judge at the end of your submission. So I'm going to post this as well in the discussion thread. But I'm wondering if that will be seen either. You have posted only twice, since your arrival (at this current moment).

		"The Bicycle kick is certainly a powerful move, but it seems to be slightly behind...due to having a longer striking move. This makes the round last a tiny big longer. Seems that it would be faster to end off on a quicker move that will not take much completion time.

		"Your character choice MAY be a problem.  There are some issues that I see at the end. where you have to delay, in order to affect the AI of your opponent. The WR uses Shang Tsung, where the use of the Triple Flaming Skull attack to deal damage from afar to get around this.

		""Flawless Victory". This is a mistake. If you watch the WR, the player takes damage at some point (usually in the first moment of the fight) to receive damage. This is the key to keeping the fight going fast and stop the time it takes to display the notification of your "Damage-less" round.

	[li 
		""Bonus Round". This is another mistake...and the biggest issue I see. This round is achieved by using low kicks only, which is what the bicycle attack does. If you  had changed your strategy on the fight before the "?" round, you would have been able to skip this. This article explains it:
