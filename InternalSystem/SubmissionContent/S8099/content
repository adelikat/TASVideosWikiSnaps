	"This is a TAS of the NES post of Terra Cresta, which is a vertically scrolling shooter game originally released for the arcade in 1985. It defeats the big bad boss about 31 seconds faster than the current RTA record held by lackattack. The game keeps going after that but doesn't bring anything new that is TAS-worthy. The speedrun community ends the runs there as well.

		$LF

	[li 
		" Many enemies always appear in a specific position, but others will depend on the player's position. The most common way this happens is: if the player is in the left half of the screen, enemies will appear on the right, and vice-versa. Sometimes there are three possible outcomes (if the player is on the left, center or right). There is something similar relating to the player's vertical position. Enemies are most often manipulated to appear as close to the player as possible, and at the top of the screen (because we can't easily or always attack backwards). The decision also has to consider lag implications of some enemy formations.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" There are some checkpoints in the game, which are not marked. Sometimes, the respawning position is further ahead in the level than the checkpoint is, which makes deathwarping an efficient way to save time in what is mostly an autoscroller. The player loses all their upgrades when dying, but they are not that important in this game (at least for a TAS).

		" Having all upgrades and collecting one more of them will turn the player into some kind of invincible phoenix. This makes the game easier for human players, but this does not matter at all here. Since it loses nor saves times, I let it happen here for entertainment.
