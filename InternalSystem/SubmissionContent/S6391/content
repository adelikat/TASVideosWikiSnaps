	"You are a knight charged to save the four kingdoms of the world, except normal weapons are ineffective against the monsters. Instead, you must use your sword to strike a glowing orb called the Trialight like a pinball around the screen. The Trialight is used to destroy enemies and obstacles as you make your way through dungeons.

	"The goal of the game is collect the four elemental crystals to unlock the path to the final boss. Each temple where the crystal is located requires a specific character to be unlocked beforehand, and you must use that character for that temple. This TAS takes advantage of a programming error that allows you play as the required characters without ever needing to actually unlock them. On the very first frame of the character select screen you can pick any character before it blocks the characters you haven't unlocked yet. BUT, this only works after you have unlocked your first new Striker. I go to the fire kingdom as soon as possible and unlock the bird-like striker since he has the fastest movement. I'm then able to skip the character unlock stages in both the Earth and Water kingdoms.

	"The trialight will only follow a rough approximation of pinball physics. The RNG and your current position have a great deal of influence over how the ball will act once it hits a wall or enemy. And the RNG changes with every action.

	"The special character you're supposed to unlock is the only one that can open the gate in the first section of the temple level (for all kingdoms). So I just make sure the trialight is as close as possible to the barrier for the mermaid striker when she catches up. This is the only check the game makes to ensure you're using the right character.

	"Since you only get one frame in the character select screen to choose a locked character I need to make sure my pointer is only one spot away from the required striker when I enter the temple level of this kingdom. This is why I don't have both 1P and 2P as the bird striker for the first stage. (Which you're also not supposed to be able to have both players be the same striker, but we've already proven that the character select screen isn't very robust)
