	"The goal of the game is collect the four elemental crystals to unlock the path to the final boss. Each temple where the crystal is located requires a specific character to be unlocked beforehand, and you must use that character for that temple. This TAS takes advantage of a programming error that allows you play as the required characters without ever needing to actually unlock them. On the very first frame of the character select screen you can pick any character before it blocks the characters you haven't unlocked yet. BUT, this only works after you have unlocked your first new Striker. I go to the fire kingdom as soon as possible and unlock the bird-like striker since he has the fastest movement. I'm then able to skip the character unlock stages in both the Earth and Water kingdoms.

You make it look easy, while it most definitely is not. Branchless is correct for this run because 2-player is faster and the content is the same between 1- and 2-player.
