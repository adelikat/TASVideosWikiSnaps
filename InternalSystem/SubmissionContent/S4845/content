	"This is a 6 second improvement over my previous TAS (without ending input early). The reason I didn't ended it was because I focused on beating the game on RTA timing, which means that the time ends once I land the final hit on Koffing, thus doing more input.

	"Most of the improvements come from the early landing trick and further optimization, meaning there's not so much to talk about. I found out you can do a pixel boost in walls, which saves few frames, and the pokeballs now have much more uses than expected.

	"Regarding the "improvement" in the thread: how to end a movie is a stylistical choice. Earliest input end may be preferred by some, but is definitely not required, especially if it actually makes the final boss battle (and game end) slower. The way this run does it, clearing the game as fast as possible and ending input on the last boss hit, is a perfectly valid way of ending the run. Do not call the short-input route an "improvement" or "fix".
