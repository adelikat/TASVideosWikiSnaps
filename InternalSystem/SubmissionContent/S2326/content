	[a class=intlink href=/2311S 
		"here
	]a
	") i completed richter speedrun using the optimal route
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"Noone realy excepted that outcome, but well, here it is! Richter beating maria :p
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"The main reason is obviously the unskipable dialogue you get when you rescue maria, and also the reset needed to select her
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"It was originaly tought maria would beat richter regardless, this is why the first submission was more oriented on entertainement than pure speed (stage3/4 been more interresting than stage3'/4')
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"This run use a few cool tactics to save time, the main time savers are (abuse off) the key subweapon and the flipback
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"The key subweapon is obtainable in stage2, this is why i dont go by stage2', the key damage output is twice of the whip, it cost zero heart to use, the item crush (select button) is also "free of charge" (altought its completly useless)
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"Also, on most bosses of the games, the key is not "nerfed", a regular axe does same output than key (16 damage), but most bosses have some kind of "protection" that reduce damage, the key was probably overlooked in most cases and do full potential (6 hit and boss is dead in most cases)
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"Unless proven wrong, stage2' route is slower due to using regular subweapon and needing to collect hearts all over the way
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"Obviously the key was just meant to be used to open doors (maria & the other girl in stage7), not to be a weapon, i use item crush a few time for entertainement coz on first submission i was told its bad not to use it, in stage6 it does roll the boss rng pattern i dont use it just for style (note that the youtube encode will show more key crush than the real movie does
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"The flipback save time over walking, i dont know exactly how many pixels, i think it doesnt realy matter, but just in the first stage - first room i remember i saved several seconds over walking, so its common agreement that walking is wrong for speed purposes
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"The idea is generaly to cancel your current flipback as fast as possible, so you try to make the shortest flipback possible, to cancel the "landing" kneeling effect you need to use an attack
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"The key was a great help over the flipback, first of all it doesnt make sound, so basicly i didnt ruined the audio experience of game by having a constant flipback+whip in the whole movie, only stage1/2/7 use whip, stage3'/4'/5/6 use key for flipback
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"The real reasont the key was technicaly superior for flipback is the pattern been much more simple and not realy impacted by hitting something on your way since its realy short range
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"I will try to define more precisly how the "loops" for flipback are working later on
