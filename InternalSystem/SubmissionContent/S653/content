		" I skip getting the air dash upgrade because it takes about 20 seconds to pick up and I didn't think it would save enough time to make up for it, despite allowing extra jump height and mid-air dashing. And I'm now pretty sure I was right about it being faster to skip it; I didn't notice more than 5 or 10 seconds of time lost from not having it. It would've made a lot of things easier, but most of them not necessarily faster.
