	"Here is my new "fixed" version of the 1 player pacifist run.  I die on the tanks rather than kill them.  This costs me 509 frames plus at least 150 more in the level 5 & 6 boss fights (since I no longer had a spread gun).  This version is 409 frames slower than my previous version though.  This is from a few minor optimizations, better luck in level 6, and better boss fights in the final level.

	"Also I was more consistent in regards to the spiked walls in level 7.  None were even damaged except those that were required.

(That is, you need to wait 44 frames at the flames instead.)
