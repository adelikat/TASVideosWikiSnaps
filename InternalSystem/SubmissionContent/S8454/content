	"Switching the left switch to position A increases the game speed. Switching the right switch to position A gives an additional game speed increase and makes those multicolored meteor-missiles home in on the player. Both switches were set to position A for this TAS, thus playing on the hardest difficulty.

	"There's literally nothing much to do while waiting to bomb the 8 missile silos. There is no lag to reduce and attempts at entertainment are super limited due to the slow, sluggish movement of the player ship. The only thing of note is we don't shoot down any enemy spacecraft, instead we lure 3 out of 4 to crash into the sides of the trench which is kind of funny.

	"Unlike the TAS for the Intellivision version, we cannot drop the last bomb from the top of the screen. Due to the Atari 2600 controller's limitation of only having one fire button, bullets can only be fired when outside the trench and bombs can only be dropped when the player is inside the trench. Therefore, the earliest we can end input is dropping the final bomb from the top of the trench.
