	"I originally didn't think GBA mode offered an advantage, but entrpntr pointed out in the game thread that changing the palette can change the RNG (since it takes extra cycles to do so.) Using this I was able to achieve a delay of 10 frames, identical to what can be achieved in GBC mode without GBA set.

	"I did some testing, and it turns out that where you change it, and how long you hold down the buttons to change it doesn't matter. You can change it at the end of the BIOS and delay BIOS end, but that didn't result in short overall times in my testing. You can also just hold down a button during the BIOS that doesn't change palette to change RNG, but I didn't get good results this way. I didn't test exhaustively though. I changed the palette to grey scale so it would still look decent.
