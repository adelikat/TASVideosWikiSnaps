	"Galf is a traditional third generation golf game, most closely resembling NES golf in its gameplay, mechanics, and UI. However, unlike NES Golf, Galf only contains 9 holes, as opposed to NES Golf's 18. Even stranger, the Switch version of the game only has 8 holes, leaving the 9th hole to be an NES exclusive.

	"As most of you likely know, the goal of golf is to get your ball into the cup at the end of each hole (marked by a flag on the map). The bar on the bottom controls both the power and accuracy of the shots. Landing in the pink area of the bar will give you the best accuracy, however sometimes you'll see me intentionally miss this. This is because the direction the ball was heading in was not in line with the hole, so by missing the pink area, I'm adding curve I wouldn't be able to have otherwise. Having accuracy left of the pink area will cause the ball to curve right, and having accuracy right of the pink bar will cause the ball to curve left.

Execution looks as good as it can be for this game, especially with the introduction of the HIO on hole 9. Accapting to Vaalt.
