I spent every night, hoping it was all done...only to find some new technique that made it faster. I restarted this TAS 6 times, and the final outcome is 14.5 seconds faster than the first run-through that I made.

	": As a fan of the Jumpman series, this game was interesting to look at; especially considering the added mechanic of moving girders/ladders.  Nothing in this looks obviously sub-optimal; and while I'd love to scrutinize this for other routing possibilities, I simply don't have the time to currently.  Maybe someday I'll come back and work this game on my own.  For now, Accepting.
