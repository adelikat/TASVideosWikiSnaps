	"Display settings: Fractional scaling 125% (This is specifically mentioned because the game opens at a scale-dependent window size, in case this affects the way mouse input values affect the game. The 100% mode doesn't seem to affect this when I tried it, but frustratingly, I tried to encode in higher-def with 3840x2160 200%, and that breaks all the clicks. This means it will require a redo of the entire TAS. Mouse relative mode does do something, but it doesn't change how it uses my existing input values, just how they are recorded (certain frames are marked as mouse relative when recorded with that checked), and they are still in whole pixels. Hopefully, LibTAS will add feature(s) for this at some point. I mean couldn't you just double them?)

This is not a gameplay issue, but rather an audio issue. Otherwise, no other issues have been found to affect anything else about this TAS.
