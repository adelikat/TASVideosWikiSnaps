	"I could stop sounds, but there is music only in the intro anyway, so I let it be. This is a very silent TAS, maybe one of the most silent TASes ever. Since the game is so silent, I recommend this song on the background while you watch the run:

	"The ball has velocity and angle. There are 64 different angles and 15 different velocities. That gives only 64 x 15 = 960 possibilities for each shot. Oh, but for the first shot, there are 3 starting positions that can be chosen from, so the first shot has 3 x 960 = 2880 possibilities. Still, should be easy to make perfect, if you have the patience or bottience to test all shots. Most of the courses can be done with one shot, anyway. This TAS uses manual flame advance fingering and some hominid neural networks.

[p 
	"Funnily, the possible values for the power of the shot are supposed to be 32, 64, 96, 128, 160, 192, 224 and 255. But when you slide back from the max value, 32 is subtracted each step, so you get additional "secret" power values: 223, 191, 159, 127, 95, 63 and 31. The difference compared to the normal values is so small that this would easily go unnoticed without RAM watch.
