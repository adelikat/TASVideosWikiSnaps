	"Umihara Kawase has many possibilities. It is difficult to optimize, but that is not why the rerecord count is so high, it is more because the sheer number of ways of doing a level, finding them and tweaking them to see which is the best. I can only hope I have found the best way of doing each level, but it would naive to think so.
