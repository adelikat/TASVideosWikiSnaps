	"Another World (a.k.a. Out of this World) is an adventure game designed and coded by Eric Chahi. It features Lester, a young scientist and Ferrari owner that, after a failed experiment, ends up in an Alien planet where everything tries to kill him. This is one of my first childhood experiences with a game that 'feels like a movie' and was my favourite for a long time. This movie solved the DOS port of the game, which is, arguably, the best port of all: it is fluent and sound is excellent.

		"NEW-RAW

	", an Another World bytecode interpreter / virtual machine that enables re-recording features that I need to run JaffarPlus on. It took some work to connect it to the bot, but in the end it provided a good emulation.

	"I had some problems working in this movie. First, even if I had an almost perfect emulator for the game, I could never solve the issue of RNG. The game has, as far as I know, two sources of RNG: time and inputs. Although inputs can be easily manipulated by the bot, timing is almost impossible to control in a PC. Any differences in loading times (hard disk latency and such) would yield different effects in the game. To make matters worse, almost everything is RNG-dependent. Enemy (slug) placement, behavior, gun accuracy, reaction times, etc. There are but a few sections of the game that are not RNG dependent. This situation forced me to manually fix many desyncs from the solutions the bot gave me.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Despite RNG, I was finally able to finish the TAS on Friday. However at this point I realized I had forgotten to activate the sound (yes, that happened). Not even that, but the proper way to activate it is through a setup binary that would not run correctly on PCem. Thankfully 
	[a href=https://tasvideos.org/Users/Profile/slamo rel=noopener external nofollow 
		"slamo

	" helped me get the sound problem resolved: simply adding the argument 's' would activate the sound. 
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"After spending a whole Saturday re-syncing the movie (sound added many desyncs, as expected). Almost at the end of resync, I found that playing straight from the Floppy disk crashes after the tank stage. I entered dispair. After recovering sanity, I decided had to add an installation step to play the entire game from hard disk and started re-syncing the entire movie again. There went Sunday.

	"In spite of the problems I had working and the fact this game stole my hard-earned weekend, watching this movie for the first time made me really happy and compensated all the suffering. That's why I love this hobby.
