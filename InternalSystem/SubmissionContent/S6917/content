	"Q-Bert 3 came from the concept of the classic arcade game. Even though this game is classified as a puzzle, it had action qualities as well.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"The object of the game is to change the color of each cube to the designated color, noted at the top of the screen. As the game progresses, the coloring patterns change.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"During the quest of completing each screen, enemy avoidance is necessary to stay alive. The basic concept of identifying enemies, would be to note their color...which Q-bert 3 veers a bit from. Basically, Purple and Red (Coily, the purple snake, Ugg and Wrong way are bad...with the exception of red fruit. With Q-bert 3, the addition of new enemies include non-purple/red enemies...such as the Frog (which follows you around slowly), Pipes (which shoots tiny red balls) , Hats (which bounce back and forward in a defined/static pattern), and purple kisses (which move around in a defined pattern and then drop off of the cubes).

		" Parity: A lot of times, Q*bert must hop on a float disc to be moved around to reset the hopping pattern to offset the coloring in a way that would allow the colors to sync up for completion. In this TAS, parity was carefully planned to eliminate time.

		" Lag Reduction: These levels had a lot more activity, in regards to enemies, which forced me to heavily experiment with strategies and routes. 
		$LF

	[li 
		" Strategies: Dying (falling off the grid, or running into select enemies), use of freeze balls (sometimes avoiding them), planning for Slick/Sam to color in cubes, and use of escape disks.
		$LF

	[li 
		" Routing: The increase of size and activity produced tons of options and made for a lot of chaos to figure out. Reducing the time, with these in consideration, came down to utilizing deaths mostly or creative timing of escape disks. In some cases, running into enemies to clear paths and reset my plan prevailed.
