	"So I finally plucked up the courage to tackle this game once again, this time implementing a ceiling clip in the final level (which I admittedly knew about but couldn't recreate for the life of me no matter how much I tried). Due to the framerule system this game has, I was unable to improve the first 7 levels but the ceiling clip and the lucky layout of the last level allowed 45 frames to be saved of the

	"The special ability the frog has to make this game unique is the ability to blow bubbles that can then be moved up and down or side-to-side, though this also makes the frog move left and right. Bubbles will spawn directly beneath the frog if up or down are held and A can also be pressed to jump on it. Holding both results in a cycle of blowing and jumping on a bubble that travels up directly underneath the frog then popping it and this repeats, effectively giving us full control of the frog as we have a way to get infinite height. While there is a cooldown between blowing bubbles, it can be made shorter by being a certain distance from a wall to pop it faster so the next one can be generated earlier (the best example is in level 4).

	"As I previously said, the game also uses a 13 frame framerule system (RAM address 0x0653) so the frog will only pose and end the level every 13th frame, making improvements in levels 1-7 highly unlikely.

	"The final level makes full use of the fact the bubble pushes the frog into walls, with it going fully through 1 block thick walls. With some careful positioning, it can clip through the first ceiling and luckily pass through the spikes which was one of the biggest setbacks when I first made this TAS. We are also able to end input surprisingly early because of a second bubble blown after getting through the first ceiling that also pushes the frog through the ending platform. It also only worked if the frog was at least a certain distance to the right so this is the earliest it (should) can end. The frame the second bubble was blown was also a little finnicky but it all worked out in the end, I guess, and I'm finally happy with a TAS of Frog - how unexpected
