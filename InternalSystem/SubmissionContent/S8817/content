That title goes to my good friend

	": I used to play a lot of "Text Adventure" games on the Commodore. Well, these kind of games can be hard to judge...mainly because of the right item collection and routing needed to make it faster. But, the things that I remember from these games are the short cut commands, such as "N" for North and short phrases to perform actions. They are being used here. I also compared to this to a human run, not for speed purposes, but to see if the adventure was following the same story line. It appears to be so, with minor differences in short cut commands.
