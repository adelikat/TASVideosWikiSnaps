	"This is the warpless version of the run (ie. doesn't use 
	$LF
	"bugs for shortcuts) and a major improvement to my previous 
	$LF
	"run. The improvements include:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"- No autofire. Instead, use precise single shots.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"- Concentrate in collecting tone (kind of exp), not stars. 
	$LF
	"Made a huge difference. (OTOH, I regretted not getting at 
	$LF
	"least "power up" for the final boss... it would have made 
	$LF
	"things easier.)
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"- More efficient boss battles. No shots are wasted (ie. 
	$LF
	"every shot makes damage) and they are timed much better. 
	$LF
	"Also looks and feels better.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"- Several shortcuts I missed in my previous run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Does not abuse luck like the previous run (at least not 
	$LF
	"intentionally). In some places takes damage to speed up.

[ul 
	[li 
		" Hmm... at the mountains in the beginning, why don't you jump over two pits with 1 jump? Don't say you couldn't do it...
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" When you picked Grappling, I think the sound effect played 1 note longer than in my movie
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" When you first jumped over the river, your jumping path wasn't exactly optimal. You went too much forward and sideways instead of using diagonal movement to its full potential.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" In this movie, you seem to kill many enemies worth only 0-1 tonepoints that take many hits to die. In the beginning, there are lots of 0-1 tonepoint enemies that die easier than those. Wasting of time... For example, the green dragons that die with four hits, give 0 tone points - the eight-hit ones give 1 tone points.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" When returning, you didn't jump over the river. Why? Don't say you couldn't do it.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" In the spider, it's hard to tell whether you were optimal because it doesn't blink...
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Dorago was battled and destroyed perfectly!
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" When returning from Dorago, you remembered to jump over the river twice, although you had some excess vertical&horizontal movements, just like the first time.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Very good shortcut at the mountains.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Killing one extra snail. Very good.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" At the boss of the tower, it didn't look perfect to me. It seems like you could have done more hits in shorter time.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" When going to the rock/ice place, you didn't jump over the river but you used the rope instead. Isn't it slower?
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Very good collecting of tiny extra tonepoints at the short scene before the rock/ice place.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" You killed 4 robots - 19 tone points each, without wasting much time. Very good. Relatively so much better than in the cave.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Killing of the boss of the rock/ice place was ok.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" You did a couple of extra jumps in the last fortress. Looks like you didn't plan well.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" You didn't kill Dorago's shadow. Did you test whether it would have sped up the killing of Ligar? (Dorago gives lots of tone points!)
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" At Ligar, I'm not sure whether you fought optimally. It seems to me like you didn't benefit from the fact that the projectiles go to whereyou stand when they appear.
		$LF

	[li 
		" You were left with 2 health points. You should/could have used them somewhere for benefit, like you did for 1.

		" I tried jumping over the two gaps more than 50 times and didn't succeed, I don't understand why. Then I decided that the perhaps 1 extra frame it takes to jump twice is not worth the trouble in a 20+ minutes video.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" I don't know about the grappling. I did it several times to take it, go back and jump to the door as optimally as possible.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" It might be that jumping over the river might have been done 0.1 seconds faster, but since it's so difficult in the first place, I was not unhappy with succeeding in it almost optimally. (I'm certainly not going to remake the entire run just to save this possible 0.1 seconds.)
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" I made sure that every kill gives me tone points, and each one of them made a big difference. I did not waste time killing 0-tonepoint monsters (I do kill a couple of them in the run, but only in places where it does not cost any time at all; basically they were just in the way and it was easier to kill them than to dodge them). I specifically checked after each kill that I had gained tone points (if I didn't, I undid and skipped that kill). Getting all those tone points made a huge difference: For example, I made the run from the beginning to beating the forest boss in (iirc) 4:45, while in my previous run this time was 5:11. All those individual tone points made it possible to kill the forest boss that much faster. Also thanks to all the tone points I was able to kill the dorago boss in 25 seconds, which was an awesome performance compared to 1:20 in the previous run (of course a significant part of killing it faster was the better timing of the hits, but I tested an earlier version of the run and having approximately the same amount of tone points as in my v3 run still required more than 1 minute to kill dorago). One good thing was that the more tone points I got, the easier it was to get more. So all in all: Even single tone points make a huge difference, even if it means wasting 0.1 seconds to get them. (By the way, the flying monsters in the cave gave quite a lot of points, which is why I spent so much time killing them.)

	[li 
		" I swear it's not possible to jump over the river when returning from the forest level. Moreover, and I can't explain why, I swear it's not possible to jump the river the second time (after the snails etc). The second time I tried it at least 100 times (probably a lot more) and IT'S NOT POSSIBLE. I swear. I will believe it is possible only if I see it. I can't explain why it's not possible, but I swear it's not.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" For some reason in the spider boss it did not get hit while crouching. I had to stand up for each hit. (I wonder if it has to do something with the powerup spell...)
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" The boss at the tower was quite difficult because of the fireballs. I regret not having the powerup spell because it made it even more difficult. Having the powerup might actually have allowed to make more hits.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" I don't understand what extra jumps matter in the last fortress. In the overhead levels jumping does not slow down.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" I did not kill dorago's shadow because it took so much time, even with the extra tone I had. I decided that it was way too much time (I already had 1020 tone points at that time).
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" I actually used the fact that the direction of the Ligar's projectiles go where you are at the time. Sometimes I just had to run away so that the projectiles would go there (no, I did not do this before trying several tens of times to dodge the projectiles closer to Ligar; I hate those projectiles). Powerup may have made it easier...
