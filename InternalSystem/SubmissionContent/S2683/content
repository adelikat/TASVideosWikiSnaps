	" to much of the 'Shining' series. Almost all of the enemies and bosses are from a previous 'Shining' game. This is the reason I love this game, as I get to revisit favorite bosses from previous 'Shining' titles. A great deal of time and effort went into this run, so I hope you enjoy it.

	"The Archer was selected for his range. Since we require quite a bit of enemy killing, it pays off to not have to walk the entire way towards an enemy to kill it. While the Archer starts with a low attack power, every level gained is spent on attack power, negating the character choice.

	"The layout of each level of the Dungeons are fixed, as far as the physical layout and the enemy spawn points. The player's start location is either fixed, or chosen randomly from 2 points. Additionally, whether or not a chest or monument will appear in a fixed location is also random. These placements are determined for all floors once you enter a dungeon, hence, they need to manipulated en masse.

[p 
	"Each level in a dungeon requires the killing of either a single 'level-boss' enemy, or all enemies in the level, with the majority of levels requiring the former. However, the game engine is limited to only having 5 enemies spawned, as well as 2 enemy-types spawned. Thus, to get the 'level-boss' to spawn, it requires no more than 4 enemies of a single type be currently spawned. This requires that I kill many enemies on the way to boss spawn points. 
	$LF
	"When it doesn't interfere with monument manipulation, I try and manipulate the player start point to be the one closest to the level-boss spawn point, which means less killing of other enemies. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Additionally, multiple enemies may spawn from a single point, which means I must kill an enemy, and wait for the next to spawn, or else it will spawn behind me. This gives rise to the single glitch I found. If you kill an enemy the first frame it spawns, you don't have to wait for it to go through its death animation for the next to spawn. This especially important for 3 stacked enemies. You'll occasionally see or hear an attack hit nothing, or critical stars appear over nothing. This is the glitch in action.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"A big part of this run was the ability to manipulate the occurrence of monuments. As noted previously, all monuments are placed at the start of the dungeon.  With luck manipulation, I make all but 4 monuments that are possible appear within the game. Often, an entire dungeon will randomly produce no monuments. Thus, the 2-6 I see per dungeon is extremely rare. It is also difficult when a monument is on the first floor, as I need to manipulate it to be the correct monument as well. This is the reason for the notable delay entering level 5. Subsequent levels can be manipulated at the previous level's staircase. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There are a 10 possible monument types. The majority used in this run are Monuments of Power. Each monument doubles my base attack rate. Up to 3 monument powers are stackable at once, which means for some parts of the run, I have 8x attack. With a critical, I do 16x my normal damage! Needless to say, this was 'monumental' to increasing the speed of the run.

[p 
	"You'll see a large number of criticals during this run, displayed by additional stars next to attacks. Each critical was painstakingly manipulated by hand. I can't express how much time was spent, especially in the later part of the run, where 60-90% of attacks result in misses. This was a 'critical' part of making the run faster and more entertaining.
