	"When Tompa and I first found the original Warp (Hold the bonus one), I started to try understand the trick and checked every possible exit and eventually found that warping to Torchlight was the best warp.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"However I did see that there were many other exits that simply crashed even though it should warp to other stages (one that would be possible if it didn't crash was Necky's Revenge., the last boss before the last boss). I discussed and got some help from Deign and he found a certain adress that changed to 255 causing the game to crash.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"I tried a long time getting the Necky's Revenge exit without the crash value but I later found out that the value that changed the bonus exit is actually supposed the X-position of the barrel you're holding relative to Donkey/Diddy and is a signed 2-byte and the second byte was the one which made it crash so I eventually gave up on that.
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	"Later on, I experimented around and manually poking in what object I was holding and tried warping on the first bonus in Temple Tempest and did

		"this glitch
	]a
	" that allows you to die twice in the same bonus (by getting hit at a certain frame, making the fade out delayed) and warps you to the first stage. But however, when I did the bonus warp glitch, I got warped to other exits than normally. I tried a long time finding an adress that pointed to those exits but none existed and it took a long time until I realized that somehow the game interpreted the exit value as a signed value and took -15 as 15 and allowing for warps to many other stages. One of those stages were Manic Mincers.
	$LF
	"I was very excited and tried very hard and a long time trying to find a way to hold air on that stage by having two active characters at once and bringing different animals to the stage but had no luck. So I looked through every bonus in the game to see what other bonuses one can get hit on early and the only other one was the second bonus on Temple Tempest which you can't even warp on. So I got pretty depressed that it wouldn't work but didn't give up and later found out that the glitch works by exiting a bonus twice, so I immediately checked through every bonus with a DK-barrel and only found one on Orang-Utan-Gang (there is one in Millstone Mayhem and one in Vulture Culture, none of them work for the warp though). My idea was to do the split-up trick inside the bonus and exiting the bonus the same time. I tested it and it worked. But I later found out that Donkey didn't jump long enough to be able to get to that bonus while at the same time holding air and I tried a long time trying to come up with some good idea but wasn't able to. I eventually came up with the idea to try to hold a barrel with an animal and eventually found a way (a very difficult way by having barrel with exact position and grabbing it and mounting an animal the same time) but later Tompa and I found an easier way by just rolling on a steel keg and jump off it while under an animal.

	"The original bonus warp glitch is done by first doing the hold air glitch which will make your game believe you are holding Sprite ID#x even though it has already been destroyed, allowing you to 'hold' the bonus. Whenever you will throw your object, certain values these objects have will be changed. When you are holding a bonus opening, the adress that is supposed to be the X-position of the barrel relative to your character is instead the exit ID value which will allow you to warp to different other exits. However, as the X-position value is a 2-byte signed value, it will crash on negative values (due to second adress will be 255).
	$LF
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"However, when you exit a warp with two characters at once (either by doing the Delayed fade out death or doing split-up in a bonus with a DK-barrel) it will then (I have no idea why) interpret the exit value as a signed value and interpret 250, for example, as 5. This allows us to warp to many other exits otherwise not possible.
	$LF
	"The only place where this is possible, is that specific bonus on Orang-utan-gang and the only way for Donkey to get there while holding air, is with expresso.

	"Enter an already finished level, throw a DK barrel (Must have one Kong only) and press start+select before it hits the ground. Then you enter a level, get hit and have the monkey fall down a pit. If you die above solid ground, Donkey/Diddy will freeze and you have to reset the game. when you have done that correctly, enter any level and break a DK barrel. You'll now be able to control both monkeys simultaneously, instead of one following the other. The game will focus on the monkey that came out from the barrel and it's only him that can die from enemies, enter/exit bonuses/levels etc.

	"This was probably the most annoying one to work with. The beginning with the Klumps is very hard to get perfected. One reason is that you often get lag when killing enemies, so being slightly slower may result in you hitting the enemy a frame later, but as you don't get any lag you may be ahead afterwards. I knew it would be possible to avoid the lag with the klumps, so I tried many many combinations of rolling before until I managed to do it.
