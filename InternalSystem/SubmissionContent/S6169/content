	"In 1990, an Arcade game called “Chiki Chiki Boys” was released by Capcom for arcades in Japan. This game received ports for various systems, including the (in my opinion) very under-appreciated PC-Engine CD-ROM. Most of these ports went with the ‘murricanized name “Mega Twins” - there's a boob joke in there somewhere that I'm not clever enough to make. But the good ol' Sega Megasis decided to call it by it's original, and much more awkward name, “Chiki Chiki Boys”. I look forward to the publisher's, most likely, more succinct and better worded game description.

This remains constant regardless of your luck stat, but what does change is the chance of a x2 bonus on the coin pickup. This basically means that if, say an enemy drops a 500 coin, you can manipulate a 1000 drop and x2 that drop, you end up with a 2000 coin pickup instead of the standard 500. Simple math, right?

The MAB-C stat remains static based on the name you choose. The range of sword swings before you can crit an enemy is 3-9. Problem is, the higher your luck, the more swings to get a crit. Because coin luck is very important for minimizing grinding to buy magic orbs and you can swing the sword extremely fast in a TAS environment to where the extra swings aren’t an issue, I go for a name that allows for max luck (31) but high MAB-C (9).

For the third zip line I hold onto it for 6 extra frames while moving right, this not only sets up both the x2 on the 500 and 100 coins, holding onto the last zip line for a few extra frames puts the twin in a position to fall past the platform below and grab the orb off-screen.You may notice that I won’t need this orb for the boss fight coming up, but by grabbing it I can save having to grab another 1200 coins when buying orbs.

Each head is typically invulnerable right before certain attacks, as well as for a long time after said attack (for instance every egg attack keeps the dragon invulnerable for the longest time).

The reason why this group is important is that after killing the first two fish, the third one will always drop a 500 coin. As mentioned before, a higher value coin can be manipulated out of any enemy. As such I need to manipulate a 1000 coin out of the third fish and dupe it to grab a 2000 coin haul very quickly. In order to get any randomly spawning enemies to spawn I have to keep track of when the twin enters a given section of the stage; what enemies are on screen or alive when you hit certain parts of the stage. This also applies to the little spike balls floating around as well.

In this case, attacking with the sword once was able to bait him into jumping which happened to make boss easy to optimize. One thing of note is that the blue crab to the left of this fight will spawn a pearl that will bounce into the clam on the right of the screen. You can keep this pearl from spawning is attacking the blue crab so it can never get a chance to throw the pearl. The reason this is important is if the pearl gets into the clam the death animation takes longer to complete.

To go back to the manipulated spawning from earlier, killing the first purple fish when I do (for some reason) de-spawned one that was going to spawn in my way during the next section. Maybe it puts an extra object on screen to the right? I don’t know, I found this by accident when testing out different strats for this section and found killing the first purple fish helped. De-spawning an extra fish also helped with lag at the spike plate section, which is pretty laggy as it is.

Because of this I don’t want the shark to charge forward at all, which means hitting the shark with the typhoons as soon as its AI is activated so that the shark doesn’t have the chance to move.

The dragon, on the other hand, pretty much has to be concealed. Again, not really sure why this works.

The top of the pillar is a coin cache but I also have to attack in a way that gets rid of any fish in the twin’s way, de-spawns any fish that will be in the way (or will cause more lag).

The pattern you want him to go into is one where he does a full jump to the left as he does here. In most cases, you may have to delay a frame or two to hit him on an optimal frame to get him to jump. The dancing at the beginning as well as holding up against the left wall baits him into a pattern where throwing a bomb on the first available frame will yield the needed result. This jump is important because the game wants you to melee fight this boss, as such, its I-frames are fairly short.

	"I stop moving right as the screen begins its auto-scrolling to set up Vlad’s pattern, much like the dancing before skeleton fencer. Same with hanging out at the left wall before he shows up. Unfortunately dancing lead him to waddle back and forth without being open to attacks. So by standing still he tries to jump at the twin, leaving him open. Like most bosses, I have to bomb on a specific frame to get him open again. I wait to bomb the last time as that actually ends the stage much faster.

	"You see, the boxers are set to fly upwards a set height and as soon as they hit the ground the coins and scroll burst out. The closer he is to the ground, the less time it takes for the boxers to hit the ground. There are some extra frames needed to allow Vlad to jump down farther, but the boxers fall much slower than Vlad. The final bomb is frame-perfect in order to save the most time. Bombing the frame before or after will cause the shorts to hit the ground one frame later. Bombing at the first frame available while Vlad is still on the ceiling loses about 40 frames. This is sort of an inversion of the strat used on the bean guy in 4-1.

	"The scorpion is fully melee attacked as this ended up being the fastest path. The new sword ends up doing about 750 HP of damage normally and around 1,500 with a crit. This is where overall it ends up saving over 300 frames to grab the necessary coins to buy the 3rd sword. The movement after the fight is for, you guessed it, manipulating one enemy in the next screen. Before the first zip line a spiked pillar can spawn right in front of it. By standing where I am at the fade out, FOR SOME REASON, the pillar doesn’t spawn there. I also have to kill the boss on the right frame as well. For some reason one or the other won’t work, you can kill the scorpion on the same frame but without the dancing the pillar will still spawn in the way.

	"One thing of note is that when you are on a zip line, while holding forward to where you hit the end of the zip line, you have exactly one frame where the twin is technically “standing”. Because of this, you have exactly one frame to jump upward off of the zip line. Being able to do this keeps the twin’s speed at 2 p/f and avoids his much slower falling animation.

	"Once the twin reaches the pickaxe guy, I simply use three bombs on the first form, but for the second half I choose to finish off the boss with melee attacks on the second form. This is because the second phase has much shorter invulnerability times, and thus is faster to defeat in this manner.

So once I reach close to the top, I have to wait for the screen to scroll a bit before I can jump up. Funny, enough, by the time I reach the top, I have to wait for the screen to scroll for the stage to end.

Another thank you goes to JohnUK89 for his write up on speedrun.com that was very helpful to the making of this TAS, as well as a thank you to the entire RTA community running this game. I wanna give a huge thanks to r57shell as their research and advice was absolutely necessary to completing this TAS and making it as good as it is. As well as a thank you to everyone that contributed to the forum thread for this game. I couldn’t have done it without all of you!

The good ending doesn't cost an time, you just keep slashing the throne of the final boss during the dialog and then grab the key. There were no posts in the thread, but gameplay looked quite nice, so I'm accepting this to Moons.
