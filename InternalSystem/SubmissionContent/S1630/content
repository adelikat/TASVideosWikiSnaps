[p 
	"This is now 124 frames faster than my first improvement to the glitched Maxim run (which has now had 5 submissions; by now he's pleading with ninja puppy eyes to have a longer run with him made.) I received a random Instant Message from a friend who said he had beaten my run by 18 frames. I investigated how he did this, and prepared to redo this run thinking I would barely be able to make sub 26 seconds. I saved some small frames here and there which kept me going. However, randomly sitting working at Camp near no computers, I came up with 2 ideas in the warp route that could theoretically improve a lot of time. When I got home, both ideas proved to be accurate, and significant time savers. The number of frames just kept adding up and up and up.

I tried dashing at the start and then sliding, so that pixel wise I was better going over the small slope near the entrance, and gained 1 frame. However, inside the castle I lost 4 frames because of this. I have not gotten anywhere near as close to saving any frames while getting a 100% perfect alignment for the whip launch.

[p 
	"In the Sky Walkway, I managed to skip one entire room transition, and skipped the whole "fall down past the wall". As soon as I left being stuck in the wall, I did a spiral jump, and then held down+right to exit the spiral jump animation and get a nice diagonal down boost (this move also led to another save at the end of the warp; it was this very discovery, although my friend did not know how it worked, which led to the initial 18 frame improvement that got me started on this.)

	"Different strategy; I dashed then jumped up and did a dive kick, then slashed the sword (for no reason other than to manipulate luck and move me into a good position) and then did the mirage attack. So no shuriken glitch this time; although in one way I tested that ended on 1462 I had a gorgeous shuriken glitch that nailed 3-4 critical hits. It was a thing of beauty. Once again, the move was done with just enough oomph to kill the ugly hodgepodge of flesh.
