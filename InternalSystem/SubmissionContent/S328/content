	"Finally, a run for KSS is done.  I apologise for the movie 
	$LF
	"length, but in order to play the whole game through 
	$LF
	"(excluding two minigames and the infamous Arena), you have 
	$LF
	"to go through the initially 4 modes (which are fairly quick) 
	$LF
	"and then the unlockable 2 modes (which are the slower runs).  
	$LF
	"Here is a quick synopsis of things in general:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Spring Breeze:
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Fairly basic run.  I use cutter whenever I can and I avoid 
	$LF
	"helpers at all times.  For the record, bomb/paint/mic are 
	$LF
	"insanely powerful, yet are too slow to be of any use to a 
	$LF
	"speed run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Gourmet Race:
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"I hate this game mode so much.  It is as fast as I could 
	$LF
	"seem to make it, but I know its fairly improvable.  I 
	$LF
	"obviously skip lots of food to save time.  This game mode 
	$LF
	"would make for some nice single-segment competition on the 
	$LF
	"site.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Dyna-Blade:
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Another fairly basic run through.  I try to focus on only 
	$LF
	"using cutter because it has the best speed to damage ratios 
	$LF
	"for its availability.  I'm forced to use a helper here, and 
	$LF
	"it's painfully clear that the helper is almost useless 
	$LF
	"outside of wheel form.  For any reference: when I trade off 
	$LF
	"the hammer for the wings, it is for busting down the left 
	$LF
	"wall and grabbing the super candy, which helps me rush past 
	$LF
	"a lot of said level.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Revenge of the Metaknight:
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Everyone loves the play by play that the Halberd's crew 
	$LF
	"gives for this.  I focused on using yo-yo power this time 
	$LF
	"because it's available off the bat and makes for some fun 
	$LF
	"times.  I try to use the wheelie rider whenever possible, so 
	$LF
	"you'll see that a lot.  I know that killing Heavy Lobster 
	$LF
	"actually loses some time (seeing as you usually can't kill 
	$LF
	"him and the hit/death sequences slow you down), but I know 
	$LF
	"that killing him twice is much more entertaining than only 
	$LF
	"once.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Great Cave Offensive:
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"A simple run through.  I avoid all treasure, which I've 
	$LF
	"never done before.  Jet is used in the mine cart areas 
	$LF
	"because it's obviously faster.  I was pleased with the boss 
	$LF
	"fights in this.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Milkyway Wishes:
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"This is my least favorite game mode.  You can't grab any 
	$LF
	"powers you want; you have to 'find' their source and then 
	$LF
	"you can use them whenever.  To be fair, I could have grabbed 
	$LF
	"the Copy power, made a helper, had it nab a hammer or jet 
	$LF
	"for me, and then consume him, but the timing would have been 
	$LF
	"slower, despite the slower boss fights.  I randomized a 
	$LF
	"hammer in the RPG fight eventually, which sped that fight 
	$LF
	"and the Marx fights up immensely.
