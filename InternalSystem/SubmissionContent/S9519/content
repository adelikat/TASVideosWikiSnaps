	"Famidash is a homebrew NES demake of the 2013 PC/mobile game Geometry Dash. Released in 2024, version 1.1 demakes the first 13 levels of the game (as well as 7 community levels). This TAS improves the

	" by 201 frames by swapping the final level with Clutterfunk, which has a long ending that doesn't require input, allowing input to be ended early. Two of those frames were saved during menuing after Cant Let Go, although I'm not really sure how. 6 frames are lost altogether in order to do the different level route, compared to doing them all in order.

	"To add to this, I also spent a good amount of time trying to find various "swag routes", a term Geometry Dash players use to describe unintended jumps in levels. This sometimes leads to me humorously jumping on the edges of spike blocks, flying in straight lines, gluing the UFO to the ceiling, and just generally going places youâ€™re not supposed to go. One really interesting moment in this run is near the middle of Electroman Adventures (62350f), where I use the mini UFO to skip a ship portal. It doesn't save any time, but it's a cool find.

It's possible that v1.2 may obsolete this run for being the version with more available content (assumign all the content of this run is also in v1.2).  It's also possible we may keep both versions.  I'll have to discuss this more with other staff.
