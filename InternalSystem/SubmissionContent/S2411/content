	"This game is a soccer / hockey game. It's main objective (only objective I guess) is to get the puck through your opponents goal (first to 3 goals wins). You play as one of 4 sanrio characters Keroppi, Tabo, Pokopon and Hangyodon (I chose Hangyodon, because he is a badass fish monster). It is a fun little game to play, and I hope that people enjoy watching it. This TAS plays through the initial game up to the credits, after the credits the maps repeat with harder enemies (I may TAS those later, but I can't see it being too much different than this submission).
