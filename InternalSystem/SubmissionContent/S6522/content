	"This TAS completes the minigame "Puzzle Pick-Up" from the game Wii Party, in which three puzzle pieces are displayed at the top of the screen, and you must search through a sea of jumbled pieces to find one that fits with a piece displayed at the top. This TAS goes for speed, which also means a high score.

	"Puzzle Pick-Up is not humanly possible to "complete" with a single player, and more than likely impossible even with 4 players. The developers never intended for anyone to match all puzzle pieces (one reason this is believed, is the in-game timer still counts down once "Finish" appears, unlike most other minigames, in which the timer stops.). This TAS shows not only that all pieces can be picked up, but they can be picked up by one player, and even with 6 seconds still remaining on the clock. Score wise, a 39 is the best possible score (always the same amount of 1 point and 2 point pieces), but in regards to time, the minigame could be completed a bit faster with the use of multiple players.
