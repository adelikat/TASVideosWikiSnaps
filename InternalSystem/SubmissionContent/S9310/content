This was back in the day when I saw mesmerized about the content and had no clue on how to program. So everything in these issues piqued my interest and got me where I am today.

	"As with my other CG submissions, the task of optimizing this game is no different. I first had to figure out how to end this game properly. It was not as straight forward as I thought it would be. Below are some items that I had to focus on, in order to get the optimization where it is.

		"Because of the "Hidden" shale objects, I had to write a lua script that would highlight these objects on the screen. They look exactly like dirt, but would harm the drill bit when touched. Because they were a duplicate of the dirt graphic, I just change their color to show up on the screen. This helped me to identify a route. A lot of times, I saw things in the way that would have slowed the run down. Once I found a good route, I proceeded to TAS the entire game through.

		"Experiment with the order of oil pumping. Why is this important? Well, to avoid the hidden and random devils that can show up. By changing the order of my pumping, they would appear in different places or not at all. If you are able to put the drill in the spot where a devil would exist, you can prevent it from showing up as well.
