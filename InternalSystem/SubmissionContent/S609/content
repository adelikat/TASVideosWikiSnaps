	"This is an improvement by 35 seconds, atleast according to the time that was used with Famtasia in my old run (when delivering the final blow to Ligar). I still use the European version of the game since the USA version doesn't allow you to jump over the river.

	"Yes, I could have avoided this mix up with the version by choosing PAL-emulation when I started recording. I didn't however because when I learned about this I was already pretty far in the game. But I don't see this as all bad because now (atleast I think) it's slightly faster because of the emulation and also the time is easier(?) to compare with my old run.

[div class=p 
	"Here is a collection of the tricks used: 
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		" Floating through walls: This is performed by jumping towards the edge of a wall and hit (slightly below) the edge. If done correctly you will be in the wall and can manouver through it. 
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[div class=p 
	"Use: The first non-jumpabale wall you come across, where the first rope in the game is. Thanks to Bisqwit who pointed out this from the beginning, I only changed it a bit. 
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		" Flying: This allows Rygar to slowly float downwards, to what should a certain death, to any hole. The thing is, when doing this you can fall through the bottom of the screen without dying and end up at the top of the screen. This is performed by rapidly hit the B-button when walking off an edge. You sort of must have a turbo-function to do this. It's pretty easy to perform though. 
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[div class=p 
	"Use: I use it to reach the door to Garloz (The overworld-view) really fast. Also to hover downwards at various places in the game. Thanks to some guy at gamefaqs for this. 
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		" Air walk: This is my own-invented glitch. This is used to reach the unreachable places of Lapis in the beginning of the game without the crossbow and that thing that allows you to attach yourself to roapes. Anytime you walk off a cliff/platform you normally should be falling too certain death. If, however, you duck at this moment you reset the gravity of Rygar and you can walk another few pixels before starting to fall. Duck again and repeat. 
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[div class=p 
	"Use: To reach whatever you want, in this version to bypass various areas that would have taken longer time without it. 
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		" Falling through floors: I knew about this glitch earlier but I didn't use it like this then. The trick is pretty simple. Whenever you start to fall you can toss out your grappling hook and try to reach something. Normally this is not possible because you can't really get under ledges without using other tricks. Anyways, if your grappling hook attaches to something you can safely fall through the floor and end up at the top of the screen. This is abused to do some cool stuff and to save some frames here and there.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[div class=p 
	"Well, that was the tricks involved in this warpless-version. I have also discovered several other glitches like endless rope-climbing, glitch up Garloz and jump through certain doors (results in glitched-up places).

[div class=p 
	"Some other notes. The randomness in this game is weird and really hard to manipulate. This is not a problem really because of the length of the movie. This is because now (compared to the warp-version) I can slay much more enemies and therefore increase my chanses of getting items that I want. However, I used "Attack & Assail" against the enemy just before the boss in the Tower of Garba. This is because I can't afford to not kill him because he gives me a good 60-70 tone points. After this I need to collect 3 more star-icons to be able to use "Attack & Assail" on Ligar aswell. This resulted in some minor lag on my way to Lapis. Unfortunately I found no way to bypass this but it's only for a small amount of time.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Also, tone points works as experience sort of. This means the more I kill the stronger I become. Therefore I have to take minor "detours" and kill enemies. For example I turn around quite often to kill enemies. It could be done without this but then the bossfights would have been MUCH longer.
