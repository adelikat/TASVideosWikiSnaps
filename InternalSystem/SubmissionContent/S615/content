	""Bubsy in Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind" is a platformer in which Bubsy is on a quest to defeat the Woolies. This bobcat, who can die by simply touching a flying egg with his toes, must go through 16 chapters, each 3 introducing a new theme and ending with a boss.

		" Levels are big and often have multiple paths, each with multiple ways to pass them (when to run, jump, etc.), so figuring out which is best often requires a lot of experimentation (and actually finding the paths), but can save many seconds at the end. While I did try to pick the best and think I did good, there might still be better ones I missed in some levels.
