	" for Crystal’s save glitch branch, EZGames69 reached out to me for obsoleting the Gold TAS. After a few weeks, we got together this TAS, which on face value is 6 seconds faster. However, it should be noted that the previous TAS is very old, and was run on an emulator that performed much faster due to inaccurate emulation (ie 60 FPS instead of ~59.7275 FPS, reduced lag, etc etc). So the difference between them is actually far greater (around 2 minutes).

While it’s a bit slower going through Falkner, it quickly makes up for it with Russel, the Slowpoke Well, and Bugsy, due to its high base special attack stat, and learning Ember. To note, Cyndaquil will evolve into Quilava when it reaches level 14, which is earlier than Totodile’s evolution (which doesn’t occur until level 18), aiding it further.

	"There are some movement quirks I learned of when making this TAS. Unlike Gen 1, A presses do not lag the game (most of the time, they can sometimes cause a single frame of lag with large amounts of NPCs). A presses also do not affect RNG in most cases, with the exception being that they can be used to offset a subframe random call when loading in a random NPC. This is used occasionally, as it usually results in no frame cost, and even if it causes a frame of lag, it’s still only 1 frame, which is overall minor in the scope of manipulating no encounters. However, if there are no NPCs around, then another trick can be used. On the frame that the game actually checks input for movement, we can simply not give it an input, delaying movement by 2 frames. If we are also beside a wall, we could also give it an input to “bonk” on the wall, then resume normal input, which again results in a 2 frame delay. These sort of delays are often used in caves where there are no NPCs around, and different movement through the cave will not affect RNG. Another quirk is a “turnframe.” Simply, if the player is in a “motionless” state, turning will take 8 frames. Whenever possible, this is avoided. Of course, extra steps to just avoid a turn frame is not a good idea, as 1 step takes 16 frames (or 8 frames with the bike).

They cause another textbox to appear, which does cost a bit of time. Of course, another turn takes far longer. Although, even then, PP must be a consideration. When a move runs out of PP, the move cannot be used until it is replenished. There are some forced heals, along with a house that quickly heals your party, but aside from them, it is very slow to restore PP, mostly due to how laggy Gen 2 menus are and the amount of time it takes to heal at a Pokemon Center.

	"There is a bit of randomness involved with the overall damage, called a “damage roll.” Simply, every attack will have 85%-100% damage overall. This is done by rolling a number between 217 and 255, then dividing that number by 255, then multiplying the result to the damage value. Due to rounding, max damage is only obtained with a 255 roll (1/39 chance), although luckily this is mostly only needed early game.

It’s then just OHKO’ing all of Red’s Pokemon, thus concluding Kanto, and the entire game.

	"An interesting note for console verification, on the first attempt (which had no RTC offset), the TAS desynced at Misty’s fight. This desync was reproducible with offsets 2 to 29, so -16 was chosen to be the RTC offset for the TAS. Turns out that was the only desync, after adjusting the RTC and redoing the TAS, it just worked. Sometimes drift could be awful in the case of MrWint's Crystal TAS, but sometimes RTC is nice and won’t drift much like in this case.

Which I absolutely recommend anyone needing breakpoints to please just use lua, the “debugger” is buggy as hell, once crashing Bizhawk, with breakpoints set with it sometimes just suddenly stop working, and there is no way to specify a bank or register condition to break on (which I suppose to be fair, lua can’t specify banks directly either, I simply just use the game’s variable for banking, which isn’t a good solution overall, but I digress), along with being a pain to just toggle (assuming it doesn’t just disable itself anyways).

My opinion is that Gold/Silver vs Crystal are different enough games for warranting separate branches, at least for the glitchless goal. Also, making cross-game obsoletion is an exception, not the norm, and should be done carefully (except for ROM hacks).
