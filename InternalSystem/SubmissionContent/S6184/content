	"After working with Lord Tom and Tompa on the NES Super Mario Bros. 3 TAS, I wanted a change of pace, so I decided to create a TAS of SMAS:SMB3. In this game, you can use left+right to quickly accelerate from a standing position, and it allows Mario to run at a speed of 64 (even though it shows 66 in memory). This is faster than the regular speed of 56 when Mario has P-Speed. After quite a bit of work, I was able to beat the time of the NES TAS. This leads me to think that this version may be faster for warpless and 100% categories too, but I'm probably not going to worry about these.

	"I use the Japanese version due to having fewer delays with text boxes and at the title screen. I did not use the SMA4 version because it has, in my opinion, more annoying sound effects, and it is impossible to get 99+ lives from the autoscrollers (because they are shortened). This TAS, however, gets 99+ lives magnificently! Since I have heard that some people are working on SMA4 TASes, I think this run demonstrates tricks that could be incorporated into their runs.

	"Level finishes are timed to get the shortest HB movements. However, there is something unique to this game called the 2-frame framerule. When you complete each level or enter pipes to reach different rooms, you return to the world map in a two frame window. To clarify, if you find an improvement of one frame, you may or may not need to save another frame to reach the next two frame window. There is a point in which this two frame framerule can be manipulated, which is described in my level-by-level comments.

It is important to build up enough speed before grabbing the mushroom so that Mario can clear the pit after the power-up animation. Had I finished only one frame window slower, I would've had to waste several frames in 1-2 to get the proper HB movements.

	"Finding the best way to grab the leaf was somewhat challenging. I tried a few different ideas, such as clipping straight into the block, getting ejected up, and jumping for the leaf. I also tried using the type of leaf grab that was seen on the latest NES SMB3 TAS. Neither of these were fastest, however. While it looks like I get pushed left and don't grab the leaf to the farthest right of the powerup at possible, this leaf grab builds up acceleration faster, ultimately saving a couple of frames over those other options.

	"In this level, I gather lives through extended aerial sequences. In retrospect, I could've possibly finished the level with 95 or 96 lives, but I am satisfied nonetheless. In this level, I delay entry by one frame so I can manipulate the two frame window to give me the optimal Boomerang Bro pattern earlier. By doing this, I did not have to waste any time elsewhere to manipulate the Boomerang Bro pattern. If I had not delayed the level entry by one frame, I would've ultimately had to lose 8 frames to manipulate the Boomerang Bro. Unlike the NES version, the optimal Boomerang Bro pattern that you want is when it moves forward and delays throwing the boomerang. With this pattern, Mario can tail-swipe the Boomerang Bro before the boomerang is thrown, thus spawning the treasure chest earlier.

	"Left+right is quite powerful. In the NES TAS, you enter the thwomp room and have to perform a walljump. With left+right, however, you merely need to jump after entering the thwomp room. This eliminates the need to perform a walljump, saving lots of time. A few frames are lost to manipulate the Bowser routine to perform the drop glitch. Bowser can take three to six hops before making his first big jump, and to perform the drop glitch, Bowser needs to have a six hop pattern. Since the Bowser pattern depends on what frame the fight begins on, we have to lose a few frames. By killing Bowser just as he makes his sixth hop, Bowser jumps much lower upon being defeated, saving several frames.

For example, when working on this TAS, I noticed that I got an extra lag frame when entering 1-T, but I could not quite decipher the reason. It may be some cyclical phenomenon that may or may not be related to the score display. RNG does not change during lag frames, so any lag frames that are saved will count towards an improvement.
