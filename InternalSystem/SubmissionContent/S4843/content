	"Do you like dogs that run at abnormal speeds? How about kids that get sent on dangerous adventures in B-movie reference-filled zones? What about a toaster that shoots lasers? Well this has exactly what you want all wrapped into one game, Secret of Evermore. Traverse multiple eras in search of a way back home and meet some fantastic characters along the way. Secret of Evermore is the US answer to Secret of Mana, which is where most of it's inspiration comes from for combat mechanics, animation style, and general feel/tone of the game. Evermore also sports a fantastic soundtrack.
