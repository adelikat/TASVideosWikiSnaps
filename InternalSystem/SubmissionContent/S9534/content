	(__wikiLink|href=/6463M|implicitdisplaytext=6463M)
	", so I won't expand much on the technical analysis. However, the choice of goal deserves some discussion. Here the author submits this as "Pacifist, Normal Mode", but I reckon there is little normal in using a code (AXEARMOR) that grants you an in-game item (the Axe Armor) from the beginning. Hence, "pacifist, uses code AXEARMOR" is a more precise description of the goal.
