	"RKS(RosenKreuzStilette) is a doujin (同人) game clones megaman with girls,inherits all the features of megaman,such like boss selection,getting weapon from defeated boss and refighting bosses.The stages reuse many areas in MM1-MM6,and the bosses has the same features from megaman.You will find it very familiar as a megaman game while enjoying.Also,RKS is a profession in this game,a person who owns “magic” is called RKS.We can also call the game Blades of the Rose Cross.

[p 
	"As a doujin game of megaman,RKS becomes a well-known game thanks to its beautiful pictures,wonderful controlling and background music.There are two playable characters,Spiritia and Grolla. They are both able to use more powerful weapons below half of healthy.
	$LF

[ul 
	[li 
		"Spiritia,who is like classic megaman,just can slide,charge shot and get boss’s weapons,plus item 1&2 from MM2.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Grolla,who is more like megaman Zero,she can dash,wall jump and charge her sword,but won’t get other weapons and items.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"Spiritia is the default character,you can use her without doing anything,if you want to switch them,you can use a code before game start menu.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The game has “story” mode and “arcade” mode to play,their difference is just whether display dialogues or not.You can also choose “prologue” to play the game from the very beginning,witch includes opening stage,or select “game start”,to skip opening stage.The difficulty of this game is also hard as megaman.

	"Ground is covered by heavy snow and being smooth,if you continue to slide can be a little faster.Next zone is built with blue and green blocks like Flashman in MM2,they are not smooth,but you should care about the lasers witch kill you by a hit.This is a classic area reuses Quickman in MM2,too.The last zone,it is snowing,for changing RNG value very often,I also pick up a health tank when I out of previous zone.After entering boss’ room,I jump for avoiding force action and moving close to Fruedia.She never opens her eyes (the battle won’t start before she opens her eyes) until you stand on the ground more than 2 frames.The battle starts,I manipulate her to use triangle attack in order to keep her appearing and defeat her quick with charge shot.

Liebes Strum can’t be used while sliding,so I stand up on a frame and launch it,it is also the boss’ weak weapon.Manipulate luck with useless shot for dropping MP capsule at the right place,due to the last zone requires item “eins” a lot.Thanks to full-screen attack of Liebes Strum,boss fight redo very few and easily.I also get a item “zwei” as item 2 in MM2.

Can you see some corns?This is also a classic area from Super Mario,and they are collectable just like playing Mario.After that a robot throws me a skull tank,it will explode when you touch it,what a surprise gift!There are many hidden ways can access to connected places,I found one for saving time.The last zone,is a long conveyor belt and a lot of enemies beside,I don’t need to do anything but proceed.The Zornes Bombe charging shot,produces full of time bombs on all the floors,they explode just like Bombman with fire.
