	"I found a new warp that take the kiwi from 2-4 to 4-4 saving a lot of time and skipping all the boring underwater levels.

	"I use a the flying ability as max as posible(i never get tired of laughing of that) and to use a ceiling glitch that allow the kiwi to go through the floors when is out of the screen improving a lot the final stages.

	"In the stage 5-1 had to slow down the jumping to evade a premature ceiling glitch
