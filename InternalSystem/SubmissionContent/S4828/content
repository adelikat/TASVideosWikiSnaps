The Oob's clips were a nice addition as well, including the quickly-paced boss fights.  With that stated, the run itself is quite limited in entertainment value, as it mostly consists of quickly running from one darkened area into another (although, again, it does have its moments, scattered about).  Nonetheless, outstanding job on finishing this one!
