	"The front character is the one who has the special weapon that can kill the dragon. Avoiding damage takes lots of time so a hero needs to be switched to the front, so that the important character does not die. At the final room it takes 100 frames to switch to the character who can kill the dragon, so now we have the master plan: In order to avoid switching the position back to the front we must do something else, namely, the most important strategy is to switch the position of the characters and manipulate RNG so that the front members die just before we reach the end. It looks really nice when the correct character switch happens automatically just before the final battle begins.

	"There may be a faster solution, if you try all combinations of dodging attacks and taking damage. I got the optimal health outcome and made no pointless delays, so it is unlikely that a massive timesave can be done without a big route change or a glitch. I did not test all spells at all locations, so there are probably glitches everywhere. I did the whole run four times to finally get the correct health management, but the run could be done a thousand times to save some frames.
