	"This TAS uses the Memory Corruption glitch discovered by Biospark in 2018. It lets us skip about a third of the game, right after aquiring powerbombs. To know how it works, please see this video:

	"Something that wasn't documented in the submission notes was exactly how the memory corruption works. Thankfully, the submission does link to the person who discovered the glitch, Biospark, where the video description explains how the glitch works and why about half of the game is played normally for the power bombs. With all of that technical information at hand I can confidently say this is incredibly well done and well researched.
