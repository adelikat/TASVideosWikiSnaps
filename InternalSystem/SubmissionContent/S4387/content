	"No it’s not the 100% update of the PSX version I was working on. I’m still stuck there; a handle to open one of the trapdoors is missing. So I decided to watch some Oddworld videos to see if there’s a new trick, or at least something to motivate me to search for the cause of the glitch. The first video I watched was exactly the TAS of Oddworld Adventures, by Applepieman. Reading his comments something got my attention on Stage 3-4; “Now for some reason I didn't have to activate the chimes to open the door, so hurray time saved.” Little did he know, but he already used that trick on Stage 2-3 (Door 4). So I went to investigate the relation between those two open doors. To my surprise, I found it right on Stage 1; it was the Pause Trick! The rest is what you’re about to see on this run, a few optimizations here and there and I managed to shave 5879 frames off of the published run. As always, I hope you enjoy the run and see you very soon.
