Due to the time spent getting to the 1st bonus chest, play had to be optimized for in game clock which added real time, for instance more frequently equipping grenades to run faster and swapping to faster weapons.  This also meant minimal playaround time, as the final kills were executed on the last possible frame.  The real time added was significant as shown by the fact that this run is 15:06.47 long compared to 13:44.33 for my 411770 point run.

	"Native aspect ratio is roughly 4:3, letterboxed to roughly 16:9.  Please crop out the letterboxing if encoded.

	"I recommend TASVideos encode use default textures, this would be consistent with all my other RE4 Mercenaries publications and would differentiate it from my encode with high res textures on Youtube.
