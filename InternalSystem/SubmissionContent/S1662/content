	"Here's a brief explanation of the bugs used:
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Left+right bug
	$LF
	"If you double-tap left+right, the character gets a glitchy animation and can die. The death is usually used to reduce lag, but it is once used to death-warp. Also, if the character is carrying the other character, he can throw him through walls.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Bunny-hop kick glitch
	$LF
	"When jumping and kicking, you do a high-damage flying kick. However, if you kick just before hitting the ground, the character bounces, allowing several flying kicks to be delivered in a row. An offshoot of this is the trash-can trick, where you kick someone and a trashcan simultaneously, dealing double damage.
