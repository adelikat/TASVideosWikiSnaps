	[em 
		"Integral

	", the 1999 Japanese re-release of 
	[em 
		"Metal Gear Solid

Watch as theenglishman sneaks, shoots, punches and investigates his way past the world leaderboards, all just to see a low-resolution piece of concept art from a game that came out twelve years ago.

While PSXjin correctly emulates this when playing back the input file, the reverb is lost when doing an audio encode.  I hope it doesn't sound too weird. Perhaps the official encode could do some post-processing work on the audio to make it reverb properly.

	$LF
]h2
[p 
	[em 
		"Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions
	]em
	" is a series of 300 extra missions which serve as extended tutorials, obstacle courses, challenge maps, setpieces and other interesting if gimmicky scenarios, such as solving a murder mystery, knocking down guards like dominoes or destroying a UFO. As a reward for completing all the missions, you got a sneak peak at some concept art of Metal Gear RAY from the then-upcoming 
	[em 
		"Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty
	]em
	".
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Virtual reality and the 
	[em 
		"Metal Gear
	]em
	" franchise have a very interesting history.  In this series, VR serves as a substitute for combat experience, allowing trainees to learn how to use weapons and participate in advanced combat scenarios without having to actually be on the battlefield, kind of like the 
	[a class=extlink href=http://matrix.wikia.com/wiki/Agent_training_program  rel=nofollow 
		" training programs
	]a
	" in 
	[em 
		"The Matrix
	]em
	".  The concept of artificial or digital training serving as a poor man’s replacement for combat experience (particularly where child soldiers are concerned) has been a running theme in the series, at once condoning and condemning the argument that violent video games can corrupt young minds.  And like anything in 
	[em 
		"Metal Gear
	]em
	", 
	[a class=extlink href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqayJfcb1PU&t=15311  rel=nofollow 
		" the message can get a little heavy-handed
	]a
	".
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The genome soldiers you fight in 
	[em 
		"Metal Gear Solid
	]em
	" were trained through a VR program which, in addition to flawed cloning, justified their lack of intelligence.  In 
	[em 
		"Metal Gear Solid 2
	]em
	", Raiden, who represents the player in its extended metaphor of cookie-cutter sequels, was given VR Training in what is heavily implied to be the first game’s VR Missions (yeah, there’s no fourth wall in this series either).  
	[em 
		"Metal Gear Solid 4
	]em
	" introduced a shiny new replacement to VR called the SOP (
	[em 
		"'Sons Of the Patriots
	]em
	"') System, which allowed users to share vision and other senses with the rest of their squad, but would break down from shell-shock and hysteria if their SOP deactivated.  With the fall of the Patriots (and SOP) at the end of 
	[em 
		"MGS4
	]em
	", VR came back, more invasive than ever, in 
	[em 
		"Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance
	]em
	", where virtual scenarios were implanted directly into children’s brains before giving them cyborg bodies.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Gameplay-wise, the initial release of 
	[em 
		"Metal Gear Solid
	]em
	" featured ten VR Missions as a sort of tutorial, which were reused as Sneaking Mode No Weapon Practice Mode 01-10 in the expanded version. The 290 extra missions were included in the PlayStation re-release of 
	[em 
		"MGS1
	]em
	", called 
	[em 
		"Metal Gear Solid: Integral
	]em
	".  Although 
	[em 
		"Integral
	]em
	" served as the basis for the worldwide 2000 PC port, the PlayStation version was never released outside of Japan; instead, the extra missions were sold as a standalone title, called 
	[em 
		"Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions
	]em
	" in North America and 
	[em 
		"Metal Gear Solid: Special Missions
	]em
	" in Europe. 
	[em 
		"Special Missions
	]em
	" is by far inferior, as it not only runs at 50Hz but includes a bizarre copy protection gimmick which forces you to insert a copy of the first disc of the vanilla 
	[em 
		"Metal Gear Solid
	]em
	" before you could play it.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Konami also hosted a leaderboard on its official website, where users could submit their own times and scores and compare them to the developers'.  This was heavily expanded on in 
	[em 
		"Metal Gear Solid 2
	]em
	"’s re-release, 
	[em 
		"Substance
	]em
	", and I do mean heavily; in addition to 511 unique missions, an experimental passcode-based online leaderboard, and a complicated scoring system,

		" a full (speedy) playthrough of all 511 missions takes almost eight hours

	".  The Game Boy Colour spinoff 
	[em 
		"Metal Gear: Ghost Babel
	]em
	" had basic VR tutorial challenges, while 
	[em 
		"Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker
	]em
	" had Extra Ops missions, which worked the same way as in 
	[em 
		"MGS2
	]em
	" but, as a prequel, lacked the VR gimmick.  As an extension of 
	[em 
		"MGS2
	]em
	"'s experimental leaderboard system, 
	[em 
		"Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance
	]em
	" featured 20 VR missions with online leaderboards, 5 extra missions for both DLC spin-off campaigns, and another 30 as DLC.

[p 
	"For those of you who complained that my 1:05:42 any% run of 
	[em 
		"Metal Gear Solid
	]em
	" didn't have enough action, this is my gift to you.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This run uses the NTSC version of VR Missions for two main reasons: as mentioned above, the PAL version has some major flaws; and for some reason, the (as of this writing) current version of PSXjin is incapable of running either disc of the Japanese 
	[em 
		"Integral
	]em
	" version without crashing.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This run is also a start-from-scratch 100% run.  My initial plan was to do all the Practice Mode missions "off-screen" in a verification movie, and then load the submission file through the first movie's SRAM.  However, PSXjin has trouble supporting SRAM with the 
	[em 
		"VR Missions
	]em
	" ISO; movies can be recorded, but will crash when played back.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This run is a first for me in many respects.  It’s the first run I’ve made with analog controls; it’s the first run whose progress I streamed over twitch.tv; and it’s also the first run that I’ve done where an on-screen timer is present for most of it, which provided excellent incentive to save every frame I could.

[p 
	"Okay so it’s not exactly a trick or glitch, but the “Clock Prevents-Bringing-The-PlayStation-To-Its-Knees Mechanic” doesn’t quite roll off the tongue.  As mentioned above, some missions award the player Ammo Bonuses which subtract a certain amount of time per bullet remaining.  For the purposes of maintaining weapon balance, some of these values can be really strange, such as ⅓ of a second (not 0.33..., ⅓) per SOCOM bullet or, my personal favourite, 0.07 seconds for every 
	[em 
		"two
	]em
	" FAMAS bullets.  When you hit the goal, the game runs a math check to make sure it can subtract the ammo bonus from the final time without having a remainder in milliseconds (0.001 seconds), since the clock only counts in centiseconds (0.01 seconds).  If it can’t, it will add or subtract a few centiseconds until it can safely apply the ammo bonus without killing the game engine.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This can sometimes be manipulated, but it’s rarely worth it.  For instance, in Weapon Mode SOCOM 01, shooting one extra bullet can net you a pre-ammo bonus final time of 3.72 (as opposed to 3.74 in my run), but the overall time would be slower since you’re losing an entire bullet’s worth of ammo bonus to save such a pithy amount of time.
	$LF

After releasing Square for the first time on the 46 minute angle, you then swing the analog stick towards your next enemy as far as it can go while still getting a six-frame kill on the first enemy (how much is dependent on the distance between yourself and your targets, as well as the distance between the two targets).

	"The RNG for Snake’s positioning is incredibly stupid, and can only be manipulated by restarting multiple times.  There are three possible spots where Snake can spawn: near the staircase on the left, directly in front of the goal, or patrolling with a guard on the right.  The last one is unwinnable, since killing anyone other than Snake will result in a game over, while the second one is about a second slower due to Snake’s long death animation.

This run was hard enough to put together as it is, and the scope of MGS2's missions is humongous: compare MGS1's 188 ranked (i.e. not Practice Mode or gimmick) missions to MGS2's 511, all of which are unique and scored individually.
