	"While the game itself may be cat-astrophically bad, the run was as well. Haha, just kitten. The run was great, I didn't even feel the need to paws it and do something else, which is how most people react to Bubsy. I didn't even tabby over to another window, my eyes were as claws to the screen as possible the entire time. My ears, on the other hand, suf-furred greatly. An unfurtunate loss, to be sure, but I'll be fine. At least meow I can claim disability. I'll let this run glide on over to Moons, as the audience seemed to yowl with delight over it.
