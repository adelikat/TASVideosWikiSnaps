	"Bubsy 3D, A speedrun was shown to me from Awful Games Done Quick and it seemed up my alley after already doing other awful games such as Superman 64! So of course I was ready to take on this challenge!

	"Wall climbing is the only major trick in this game, basically standing at almost any degree of slope and pressing up against the mountains as if you were strafing, you can climb out of bounds and basically skip the entirety of the game.

	"Propeller Trick: Glide on top of a propeller while being pinned under a platform, this will shoot you high up in the air and allow you to get across the level quicker in certain areas.

	"Movement: Think of Bubsy like he's a race car. When he picks up speed, it takes time to turn. And when he is slow, this car ain't movin very fast.

	"Jumping: Delayed. Holding 'Triangle' allows you to glide, slows you down but is helpful to get you farther to those ledges.

	"Shooting: Only when you hold down the aim/fire button while near/hitting an atom. Somehow doesn't work when you land on top of the atom.

	"While the game itself may be cat-astrophically bad, the run was as well. Haha, just kitten. The run was great, I didn't even feel the need to paws it and do something else, which is how most people react to Bubsy. I didn't even tabby over to another window, my eyes were as claws to the screen as possible the entire time. My ears, on the other hand, suf-furred greatly. An unfurtunate loss, to be sure, but I'll be fine. At least meow I can claim disability. I'll let this run glide on over to Moons, as the audience seemed to yowl with delight over it.
