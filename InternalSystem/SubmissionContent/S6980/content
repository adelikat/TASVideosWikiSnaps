On his quest to advance in the Shaman Tournament and defeat Zeke, Yoh and his friends run into a man named Magister, who plans on resurrecting the demon king Mephias. With the help of his friends and their Guardian Ghosts, Yoh must stop Magister at all costs.

The game manages to rise above its license and give really fun gameplay, with beautiful sprite work and backgrounds. The gameplay is fluid and fair, although a little on the hard side.

While he stays in place I use my first Michael to deal damage but also get knocked back. The knock back gives me enough height for one more sword attack on this jump. The second Michael is done at the very end to finish him off, marking the end of the game!
