	"Hi! I remember when i submitted a run on this game before. A long time ago when me and my friend "KameZa" had a common username. Didn't go so well back at that time....Anyway! I have improved the old record with 6 seconds. I'ts funnier to watch, (I think you'll agree) when you see this. I'm not taking any spinach (and I hope you'll forgive me for that) cause it did take too long when you'll eat that is my opinion. Anyway I'm killing the birds at least at level 3! Hope you think thats enough! Enough with empty words from me. Have fun!
