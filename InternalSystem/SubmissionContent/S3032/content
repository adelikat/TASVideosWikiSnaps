I also obtained the "PEARL NECKLACE" but didn't use them. I took damage twice in this level to preserve ammo. I also obtained the "GUN" which I used to knock out a fat guy and 2 chefs. The fat guy must be KOed or he'll grab and kill you. The chefs block my path, and jumping over them is slower, so they must also be KOed.
