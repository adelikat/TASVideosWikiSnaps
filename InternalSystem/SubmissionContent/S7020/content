	"Tower of Doom was originally set to be the third AD&D title on the Intellivision with the working title "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Tower of Mystery". The game was only half complete when Mattel Electronics folded in 1984. INTV Corp resumed work on the game in 1986. Not wanting to pay for a renewed D&D license, the game was released under the new name, "Tower of Doom".

	": Good optimization. The movie is rather repetitive and lacking in any sound. Also the audience feedback says it's not very entertaining. Since the talk about whether other runs on different difficulties or with different characters can also be Vault worthy, it doesn't have any bearing on the fate of this submission so I'm accepting this to Vault.

	"As for whether a Novice run would be acceptable: based off of what I can find regarding difficulty levels, my gut says that they are difficulty levels rather than separate modes. It's possible that you can say the set map makes enough differences, but for me, that comes down to whether or not you know the map ahead of time, which doesn't really make that much difference in a TAS where you can cut out any wandering. I'm not going to say it's unacceptable, though. I invite you to make a post about it in the Ask a Judge thread.
