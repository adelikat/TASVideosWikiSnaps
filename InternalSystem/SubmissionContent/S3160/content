	"Final Fantasy VIII needs no introduction. One of the three epic tales on the Playstation from Squaresoft, it is the first Final Fantasy to focus on a love story. This time, my eternal protagonist Z is an emo teenager forced to save the entire spectrum of time, instead of writing awful poetry. With the help of a broken junction system and a bit o' luck manipulation, he takes down 4 discs in record time.

Now, in a segemented speedrun, this can be less valuable, as saving and resetting resets the danger value. However, since you never save and load in a TAS, it is far more important. It is not always necessary to stutter-walk, and I created a lua script to tell me when to stutter-walk and when to just run. If people want, I'll create a separate post explaining all of it better.

This allows her to get a second turn before his ATB fills again, preventing Ifrit from saying his 50% health statement "Not bad for humans". Also, she needs Crisis Limit 4 for her Limit Break to do enough damage. Finally, I fight the 4 enemy battle, and pick up 3 cards, 2 bombs and a vampire bat. I need to fight this battle to gain 4 AP, or else the Eloverett Battle's AP will go to waste.

In previous runs, I'd have to manipulate both G-Soldiers to have 85 HP, however, with Water on Str, Z can kill the higher HP one. I manipulate the single G-Soldier battles to have 85 HP, as Z needs to deal damage to himself, to get into Limit Break range.  I use the Anacoundar battle to drop the final card so I can have a full hand. Note that the 10 AP gained is just enough to learn both Boost and finish off Card, which allows me to switch to Str-J and Card Mod.

This barely keeps Wedge alive, and thus I wait until Z's ATB is full again, before finishing him with Selphie.  This allows me to Renzouken Elvorett twice, before he is able ever to attack. Unfortunately, X-ATM092 has too much HP, so I have to use Rough Divide so I am able to run. I use the Dollet Bar trick, as it saves well over 15 seconds.

The scene were you wait for the test results is one of the single most painful waits in the game - nothing can be done to make it faster - it takes a fixed amount of time, no matter what. After the SeeD party, Quisty takes you aside to the "secret place" i.e. make-out central, with the hopes of getting some. However, before that, she gives a tutorial on Status-Atk-J. This is important, because only in a Final Fantasy game would have a make-out session preempted by a tutorial. Quisty and Z make it to the 'secret place', and proceed to babble instead of kiss. That will teach her to tutorialize! In the Granaldo battle, I use Z to manipulate Granaldo into not attacking, which is why I delay Renzouken until right before Shiva. It saves 1-2 seconds using Renzouken right before, as that causes all enemies to die at the same time. Finally, after a good nights rest, I pick up the Quisty card from the cafeteria. This card battle is far more difficult than the Zell

The first Laguana dream sequence really does nothing for the game plot, other than building a connection between Squall's father and Rinoa's mother, which almost makes the rest of the relationship seem like incest.

In the Deling battle, I use action queuing to prevent any talking after the fake president transforms into the ugly thing.

Also, less dialog occurs if you don't fight in the infirmary. OilBoyles die quickly to shotgun rounds. The NORG battle uses action queuing to prevent his dialog after he opens up. I skip Leviathan, because he has no abilities worthwhile. Also, after NORG, I have Enc-None, which means no more random encounters to run from!

Anyway, once I'm inside Galbadia Garden, I finish of Seifer with Criticals, and finish off Edea with Irvine's Shot, using action queuing.
