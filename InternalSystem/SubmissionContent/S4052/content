[div class=p 
	"This game uses two RNGs. First RNG is very similar to the one used in Ruby/Sapphire, and basically determines almost every luck-based event on this game. Its formula can be obtained from 
	[a class=extlink href=http://www.smogon.com/ingame/rng/pid_iv_creation#what_is_a_pid rel=nofollow 
		"smogon
	]a
	". However, this game additionally uses a second RNG that is used to determine wild encounters.
	$LF
	"This second RNG (formula is: val <- val*0x41C64E6D + 0x3039 ) only advances if you step in grass, cave, water, etc. So this means that it’s not possible to avoid wild encounters during the whole run.

	$LF
]h3
[div class=p 
	"At the start of the game, RNG goes forward at two per frame in battle, and one per frame outside a battle. This means it’s possible to switch the parity of the RNG by delaying one frame before starting a battle, but it’s not possible to control this parity later, meaning you would be forced to skip some RNG values that you may have want to use (a RNG that determines a critical hit earlier, for example).
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"However, after entering on a Pokemon Center for the first time (I do on Cerulean City), it advances twice outside a battle and three per frame in battle except when changing the move selection of a Pokemon (the RNG advances twice in this case). This means you have a much better control of the RNG cycles, and you get a good luck manipulation quicker. Because of this, Route 3 was probably one of the hardest parts to luck manipulate. Also, because of how RNG cycles works, if waiting is needed for a certain event to happen, it is better to wait during a battle than outside.

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Critical hits are determined just after the “X used Y!” message, and right after, damage percentage is determined (from 85% to 100%). There’s a chance of 1/16 to get a critical hit, 1/16 to get a max damage hit, and 1/256 to get a critical max damage hit, which is necessary sometimes on this run. (And obviously quite hard to luck manipulate).
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Side effects were needed too (lowering speed with Bubble, or paralyzing with Secret Power). Chances of paralyzing with Secret Power and making opponent not attack is 3/40 while lowering speed with bubble is 1/10. The main problem of manipulating this is when more than one rare event needs to be manipulated together (for example, critical hit, then making the opponent to miss, then making the opponent to use a certain attack). The chances of getting that right is too low, and waiting is usually needed. If it is still not possible to get it fast enough, there is still an alternative: opening the help menu screen.

[div class=p 
	"When it is not possible to control the parity of the RNG (beginning of the run), or you need to hit a Critical Max Damage and you do not want to wait for too long or any other rare events, it is also possible to open the help menu screen for luck manipulation. When the help menu screen is opened, RNG advances one per frame before getting to a Pokemon Center, and two per frame after entering, meaning it is another way to control RNG parity (even before entering on a Pokemon Center). Another use of this is that if help menu is opened between Critical hit determination and damage percentage determination, you can control those two events separately, making it easier to luck manipulate (this also works to any other event that normally would happen together but you need to control them separately to get a faster luck manipulation).
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"There are two inconveniences of this, obvious ones; it makes the battle look worse (I personally do not find very clean to see how help screen is opened on a battle), and it forces you to waste some frames. So this trick is used on this run when it is really necessary to use it. I tried to use it as few times as possible.

	" Wild encounter manipulation
	$LF
]h3
[div class=p 
	"Unlike previous generations, and Ruby/Sapphire, wild encounters work differently, and they are determined with a new RNG. As explained before, this RNG only advances when doing a step over something that could generate a wild encounter, so it is not possible to avoid getting them. Well, there is only one possibility to avoid them, which is using Repels, so I need some of them during the run. However, it is still possible to luck manipulate to get the lowest possible number of wild encounters. Since I can buy Repels on Pewter City, I luck manipulated the number of wild encounters until that city.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Wild encounter manipulation was probably the hardest thing I did on this TAS, and I run some simulator search programs to help me with this. First of all, the seed of this RNG is generated just after the Charizard screen clears in the intro. It is known which address generates the seed, but it is not known how it exactly generates it. So I used a brute-force search script in VBA to find the seed, which gave me the seed I wanted after waiting for only 8 frames. The script used around 20000 rerecords to find the optimal seed as soon as possible (the 50000 rerecords left were done by hand). The help menu noise at the very beginning is intended and completely necessary to get the perfect seed as soon as possible. I know there are 65536 possible seeds you can get, so I just made a quick program to know how many encounters each seed would give me until Pewter City. The search had the following results:

[div class=p 
	"This estimation was done with grass encounter ratio (If top half of this RNG mod 1600 is less than 343, you get an encounter). Since getting 2 encounters is fine (I need to catch Rattata and Pidgey as HM slaves), I used the seed the search recommended me. Only 1 of those 23 seeds with 2 encounters works for this run, since I need to get the 2 encounters on Route 1. (Getting 2nd encounter in Viridian Forest or getting an encounter before getting Oak's Parcel would not work, and only 1 of those 23 encounters gave me what I wanted). On a side note, there are 3472 seeds that would give you no encounters until Viridian City. This is the rarest even in the TAS, since the chances of getting the perfect seed is 1/65536. It is not necessary to say that getting this with just waiting 8 frames is a good result.

After that, I could check if I could get a Squirtle with good stats with that seed without having to wait too much. At first, I wasn’t doing this search with RNG Reporter, but since I didn’t want to keep inserting seeds on that program, I created a lua script that would already tell me if a good Squirtle is feasible or not. Also, it wouldn’t give me data about my seed, but it would give me data about some other seeds I could easily find from the previous search. This really saved me time searching what I want.

Well, it is different on this game, since MID text loses one frame each time you talk to somebody no matter what you do.

	"Another thing to mention is it sounds as if I hit Prof. Oak just before going and choose my first Pokemon, and I hit the table too just before battling Gary (his actual name is "U"). Yeah, I actually hit those for one frame; it saves time to do this rather than turning as fast as possible (A comparison vid can be found
