[p 
	"Pokémon Gold is a turn-based move game where stats
	$LF
	"(Level, HP, Attack, Defense, Speed, Special Attack, Special Defense),
	$LF
	"types, and type class (physical, special) are important. Unlike in Red/Blue, where
	$LF
	"emphasis was on the special class, Gold/Silver emphasizes the physical class. That's
	$LF
	"one of the reasons I chose Geodude/Graveler to be the choice Pokémon. As well, there
	$LF
	"are many items, such as TMs and HMs to teach moves, event-specific items, held items
	$LF
	"that influence battle (e.g. an item that gives you a chance to strike first even if slower),
	$LF
	"and the bike. Some of these items are necessary to complete the game.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"These are the main differences of Gold/Silver compared to Red/Blue:
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" Special is split into special attack and special defense.

		$LF

	[li 
		" Attacks that are labeled “100% accuracy under unmodified Accuracy/Evade stats” really are in GSC, unlike in RBY where they have a 1/256 chance of missing.

[p 
	"As you will probably notice, the game introduces a factor called “gender”, but

[p 
	"The differences between Gold and Silver are minimal. The most significant difference is the legendary that you can catch, which is ignored by this run. Crystal has a few more significant differences, but all these versions are closely related.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Unlike the corresponding run in Red/Blue, which is a comparatively “hard” game to run,
	$LF
	"Gold/Silver is a comparatively “easy” game to run. Thus, while the run in RB matches up type
	$LF
	"weaknesses and gets critical hits, this run does not do nearly as much. When things get really
	$LF
	"easy, I even try to avoid type weaknesses and critical hits since their messages waste time.
	$LF
	"With this in mind, it is clear that RB has a more interesting run although this run does
	$LF
	"not lack strategy. Most of the strategy involves luck manipulation.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Luck manipulation is a huge factor in this game. It affects damage variation, critical hits,
	$LF
	"first-turn attack, hit accuracy if not 100%, the Magnitude attack,
	$LF
	"opponents' attacks (to some degree), opposing trainers' Pokémon order (to some degree),

	"physical types Fighting, Steel, Ground, and the special types Ice, Water, Grass

	]br
	$LF
	"Each Pokémon can only possess 4 moves. New moves must replace old ones.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"Each move has a limited number of PP. If PP runs out, it can't be used until PP is
	$LF
	"restored. Each use of a move costs 1 PP. Rollout is slightly different (see below).
	[br

	$LF
	"An attack has damage variation ranging from 217/255 times max damage to max damage (in other
	$LF
	"words, R/255 times max damage, where R is a random number between 217 and 255). Since the
	$LF
	"game uses integer division, max damage occurs rarely (only if R is 255).
	$LF
	"Any move that is the same type as a Pokémon's type gets a 1.5x bonus.

	$LF
	"If a badge is earned from a gym, moves of that gym's type get a 1.125x bonus.

	$LF
	"Some held items give moves of a type a 1.1x bonus (I decided it's not worth it).

	"Type matchups:

[p 
	"Rage is Totodile's second move, learned at L7. 20 power, Normal type, with a

	$LF
	"multiplier increases by 1.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Tackle is Geodude's first move. 35 power, Normal type.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Mud-Slap is Geodude's second move, learned by TM. 20 power, Ground type, ability to lower
	$LF
	"(opponent's) accuracy. Used only to dispatch fellow Geodudes.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Rock Throw is Geodude's third move, learned at L11. 50 power, Rock type. Useful for
	$LF
	"the second gym, and the most powerful Rock move that Geodude can learn (it can't learn Rock Slide without breeding or trading).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Magnitude is Geodude's fourth move, learned at L16. A random magnitude number between
	$LF
	"4 and 10 is selected (the farther from 7 the number is, the less chance of getting it).
	$LF
	"Magnitude 8 is 90 power, Magnitude 9 is 110 power, and Magnitude 10 is 150 power. Magnitude
	$LF
	"is a Ground-typed move. This is the lucky powerhouse move that drew me to Geodude's use.
	$LF
	"Except for Bug, Grass, and Flying Pokémon, Magnitude could knock out just about every Pokémon,
	$LF
	"especially with critical hit (which is extremely difficult to get with a high magnitude number).
	$LF
	"The drawback to Magnitude is that Bug and Grass are resistant to Ground and Flying is immune.
	$LF
	"Magnitude also takes 1 second more than other moves to state the magnitude number.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Rollout is Geodude's fifth move, learned by TM. 30 power, Rock type, with a
	$LF
	"multiplier attached. First use of the move is 1x and every successive use, up to
	$LF
	"5 consecutive uses, doubles the multiplier. Missing, fainting, being unable to
	$LF
	"attack, or using Rollout 5 times ends the streak. The are two strange things. First,
	$LF
	"Geodude is forced to keep attacking during the streak; you don't gain control
	$LF
	"until it's over. On the up-side, the battle menu is skipped, saving about 20 frames per use.
	$LF
	"Second, a whole streak counts only 1 PP of Rollout. Geodude/Graveler can learn
	$LF
	"Rollout naturally at L34, but doesn't in this run because it learns by TM.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Strength is Geodude's sixth move, learned by HM. 80 power, Normal type. Important since
	$LF
	"it is normal-effective against most Pokémon.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Earthquake is Geodude's seventh move, learned at L41. 100 power, Ground type.
	$LF
	"I replace Magnitude with this because it's easier to get 100-power critical hits
	$LF
	"with Earthquake, and it doesn't take 1 second more per use.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There are other moves but I don't learn or use them.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Yes, I only use Physical-typed moves in this run. Note that Rock and Ground fit together nicely. Bug and Flying, which are resistant and immune (respectively) to Ground, are weak to Rock. Only Grass remains the problem.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Note that Geodude's Rock/Ground typing and low specials makes it OHKO bait to Water, Grass, and Ice Pokémon with 100%-accuracy moves such as Water Gun (Water), Surf (Water), Petal Dance (Grass), and Aurora Beam (Ice). Getting the jump on these Pokémon is critical to survival.

Why would Red want Pikachu on his team? Even though I can OHKO it, I don't, simply because otherwise I won't be able to knock out Red's other Pokémon before they knock me out.

Indeed, Psychic is the only thing Espeon will use here.

	"Making a Pokémon TAS was a different experience when compared to making a TAS for an action game like 
	[a class=intlink href=/417M 
		"Mega Man X2
	]a
	". Though RPGs do not score nearly as much in the entertainment column as action games (for the purposes of a TAS), they hold their place in terms of luck-manipulation. Since RPGs are often very long and have many different strategies, they are some of the most improvable games. Regardless of what the game is, let's hope competition remains healthy.

		"DV (traditionally standing for “Deter Value” also known as “Diversification Value” or “Individual Value”... it doesn't seem to have an official name). It is a 4-bit number (from 0-15) that corresponds to the Pokémon “genes” and affect how strong each stat can become.

	$LF
	"The higher the DV, the better the stat is. When I say, for example, a “Pokémon has DVs F0E1” or “a L5 F0E1 Pokémon”, it means the Attack DV is F (15), Defense DV is 0, Speed DV is E (14), and Special DV (both SpAtk and SpDef) is 1.
