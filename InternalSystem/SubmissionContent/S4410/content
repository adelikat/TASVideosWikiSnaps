	"Oddworld: Munchs Oddysee tells the story of Munch, a frog-like creature, fighting to prevent its kind to become extinct. But he is not alone is his quest; Abe, the Mudokon, will lend him a helpful hand.

	"It's hard to say what the future of emulation, and TAS in general will bring, but for now, this is the last one of the "TASable" Oddworld games to have a complete TAS. If it's accepted, I'll be glad to have contributed with another run to the site, and even though it's not a really popular game, I hope you enjoy it.

	"Unlike other Oddworld titles, Munch's Oddysee does not have that many glitches, but the ones it have are pretty destructive. The Up+Down glitch, found by AKheon is used through out the game.
	$LF

[h4 
	" Up+Down Glitch
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"By pressing Up+Down+Right, Up+Down+Left or Down+Right+Left you'll be placed at the top of any wall in the game. No, it's not possible to use Up+Right+Left. There are also places where the glitch simply won't work at all, I'll point them out as I get there.

	" Wall Zip
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The Up+Down glitch have an interesting property; it zips Abe or Munch up and backwards at a very high speed. By jumping one frame before the zip occurs, it's possible to make this effect last longer.

	"The Up+Down won’t work on stages with fixed cameras. That’s why ten Spooces are collected to open a door on the second part. The third part is pretty straight forward, just glitch your way to the gate and the stage is complete.

	"If you watched my first WIP, you probably noticed that this stage was completely redone. It was to include the zip up walls on the first part, the rest is still the same though. You may find it weird to open a door and then pass through the wall, but Fuzzles won't go to the next area if a door is closed.

	"Another stage redone to include time savers. Too bad the Mudokons doesn't have enough time to kill the Slig this time. As you can see here, it's not possible to skip some of the cut scenes.

	"Did you see that gate Munch just used to finish the first area? In case you're wondering why I didn't pass through the wall with Abe, let me tell you; some doors, teleporters or devices only work with its intended character. Big time saved on the last area; although you must pull those two levers at the same time to finish the stage, Munch will trigger it if he goes through that door.

	"I made a huge mistake in my first WIP; starting from this stage Abe and Munch must reach the end of the stage to complete it. I was playing all those stages twice, but once I reached Battle of Steel, and saw that Munch can't jump over one of those ledges, I realized that Abe can carry him. How silly!

[h3 
	" Shoot!Shoot!
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This stage is long, too long. And now that I'm playing it just once it's a lot faster. By the way, sometimes the end of the stage can be triggered while Abe is carrying Munch, but there is one stage where they must be side by side to finish it.

	" Glukkon
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This is the only stage with the Expresso drink, so better use it as it makes Abe's speed go from the oscillating one~two to amazing three pixels per frame. Although there's no ending pad in this stage, the Glukkon will not appear unless Abe and Munch get to his room.

[p 
	"One of the most complex stages of the game, man it's hard to memorize where each of these travelling wells would take you. It's also another one of those stages where only the Mudokons can trigger the ending, making it a lot more painful to play.

[p 
	"Even though you must carry three Mudokons to the end of this stage, it's quite an easy stage. It's also pretty short so no big deal here, but the Chant Circle took a bit of tinkering to use only two "you help me out here" commands.
	$LF

[h3 
	" Independently
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This stage is pretty weird; going through the same door will lead Abe and Munch to completely different places, sometimes to a black screen with no return. Also, the Ending Pad is character sensitive, that's why I'm playing with them separately.
	$LF

[h3 
	" Sneaking!
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Abe can't get to where Munch is at the start of this stage. Fortunately, they meet at the most complex part, so it's not much of a problem. You may already noticed it, but Abe will drop anything he's carrying when he gets down the walls. It would be nice if he could keep carrying it, oh well.
	$LF

	" Battle of Steel
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Here, right at the start of the stage is the reason to redo so many stages; that high ledge. Yeah, I never played this game to the end, and as you may know, I usually make my runs in "one shot", planning along the way. I think it's time to reconsider this behavior. Oh, this is the only stage where the Up+Down glitch won't work to bypass a switch. Also, it can only be completed with Abe and Munch standing side by side on the Ending Pad.

[p 
	"The objective here is pretty simple; go to the second floor, collect a Spooce Shrub and possess the Glockstar. Well, that's it. A few more button presses and mission complete, thank you for watching. Now it's time to go back to Abe's Oddysee, see you there soon enough.

	"AKheon, for suggesting the game as my next handheld project. Also, for the Up+Down glitch which made it possible to skip so much of the game.
