	"Like in almost every other wrasslin' game, we can win by ring outs faster than by pinning anyone. The mechanics here are a little different from the other games though. We aim to get the opponent out of the ring ASAP which is best done in the lower right corner. We sprint over there, exit the ring, and position ourselves to where we won't lose any frames when the opponent exits which is based on their position. This starts our count. The opponent count starts when they exit of course, so there's usually 2s between our count and theirs.

	"As long as we can successfully break the count once, victory is in the bag. It varies fight to fight but in general we want to leave them as far away as possible when we re-enter at 9 to have them not make it back in but we also utilize delay strats (kiting/blocking Ho Kogan) forced animation strats (making Warrior duck to avoid a dropkick that's nowhere near him) and the fact that the count doesn't break until you land in the ring, so we have a couple close calls for *dramatic effect* and *entertainment* purposes.
