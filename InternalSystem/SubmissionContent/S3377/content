[p 
	"In Crash Bandicoot XS (Huge Adventure for American) Uka Uka has been upset with Doctor Neo Cortex failure once again but Cortex promices to change that so he srinks the world with his "Planetary Minimizer". Aku Aku informs Crash and Coco on what has happened and tells them to find in veries places in the world the 20 crystals (in other crash series it's 25 crystals). Once done this reverses the effects of this ray.

	"The change in this run compared to the last one I did was using slide-spin (instead of slides), underwater levels keep hitting A then at certain points and at straight lines hit B to speedup faster. Frame-advance (instead of only tassing), use more savestates (rerecords), get damage abuse ONLY in Air Levels and last but not least keep getting invincibility but also avoid large batches of TNT together or NITRO as it will slow down Crash.

	": I'm not entirely sure why this run got so much negative feedback. However, it appears that the majority of the feedback was that this run is simply not optimal enough. Additionally, even given a more optimized run, the amount of flying levels (fixed speed scrolling) are pretty boring, and I have to agree. Rejecting as a sub-quality movie, but game choice may also be an issue with future movies.
