	"In this mode, Robin mostly gets attacked by guards, but wolves, rats and snakes are not uncommon enemies. Robin can use several different weapons to defend himself in this mode, but I stick to the sword. If Robin, or someone in Robin's band, uses a Red Potion or drinks Healing Water, Robin's walking speed is greatly increased. Robin's walking speed is also affected by the amount of equipment he is carrying (That's why I drop items I don't need rather than putting them in my backpack).
