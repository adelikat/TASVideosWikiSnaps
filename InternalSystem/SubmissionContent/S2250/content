	"Tetris spawned a whole new genre, the "manipulate falling stuff" puzzle game, including other classics such as Puyo Puyo and Columns. Among them all, Dr. Mario is probably the 2nd most well-known and most popular of them, only next to Tetris itself.

	"The game mechanics are nothing like Tetris. At the beginning of the game, the bottle is filled with floating "viruses" of 3 different colors, arranged randomly so that no three of the same color viruses coincide horizontally or vertically. The higher the level number, the more viruses appear. From there, you are given a series of capsules, each containing a combination of 2 colors, and you must manipulate them to clear the viruses. Form a row or column of 4 or more of the same color, and it vanishes, clearing any pill-half or virus involved. The level ends when all viruses are clear, and you can rack up lots of points by forming complex combos or chains. Pills will drop faster on a harder skill level, and the drop speed increases every 10 pills. Back up the pills to the top center of the bottle, and you die.
