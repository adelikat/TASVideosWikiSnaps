	" was a cheap plug and play system featuring a compilation of what I like to call "demastered" Intellivision games, and was actually licensed by Intellivision themselves. I don't know why they decided to go this route instead of just re-releasing some of the originals like they did later with the Intellivision Flashback. Too expensive at the time? Anyway, the system consists of some stripped-down NES hardware, otherwise known as "Famiclone" or "NES-on-a-chip", all contained within the controller. Many of the games in this collection are believed to have been made by Nice Code Software.

	"I'm not gonna sugarcoat it... this is the worst game of them all. The game is clearly unfinished. The adventure select screen is just smoke and mirrors, and from what I can tell, there's only one level. There are no addresses in RAM that stand out as a level counter, each stage transition says "Welcome to the Tower of Doom", and I even beat this game's one stage 32 times—the maximum number of stages for one adventure in the original game—just to see if the game ended at some point. But no, this one level will keep looping over and over again, though different enemies and items may load in due to RNG. Thus, I believe this TAS satisfies the completion criteria for looping games.

	"Well I also can't believe I'm saying this game also has "movement tech". The game seems to prefer that the player moves along some predetermined grid. At particular misalignment distances from the grid, you can move in a direction parallel to the axis you're misaligned with, and you can get your character to "snap" to the grid axis, which when done correctly, can teleport the player several units of distance forward very quickly. This was used everywhere in just this one level.

Well, this is certainly not the case, because it was published and that's that.I even looked at the publication for the Intellivision, and it is certainly shorter.  I don't have much to say about it though, except that it matches what I have seen from the other platform.
