The only new thing here is that I positioned Daffy closer to where he stands in the score screen. The score does not start counting down until he is in his spot, so getting him as close as possible to that spot is important

I use the skeleton guy to give me a speed boost like before, but I was able to trigger it from the front, rather than jump over him and wait to hit me from behind. I also had a better Fight with the Mummy, and I did a much better job of the room with the rising lava. I still had to get the invincible though.
