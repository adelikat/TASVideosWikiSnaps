	"Yet another warp run for SMB2u. The strategy for the entire run is pretty much the same as Phil. I took different paths just so everyone could actually see that I was doing something different. This movie was VERY hard to make. Phil did an excellent job manipulating the game to do what he wanted. I went through and found frames I didn't think where there. I spent a very long time on this run. I hope that if I am beaten, that it's not by the number of frames I was able to find, hehe. Anyway, here's the rundown:
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"1-1: -0[0.000s] - unless someone can beat it faster then 2 or 3 frames, birdo will shoot the egg at teh same time within a few frames.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"1-2: -6[0.100s] - I found some very mysterious frames, 4 came from teh carpet ride. I tried for a VERY long time to get this one...the other two were mysteriously from birdo.

[div class=p 
	"6-1: -5[0.083s] - Most of these frames were from the sand digging area. How I managed to squeeze out these guys...I thought that sand area was perfect when I first started.

[div class=p

]div
[div class=p 
	"7-2: -3[0.050s] - I managed to gain one pixel, and when going for the birdo with the key, I manage to start my forward momentum 2 frames faster. I also saved two frames on the last bird head thing, but when I finished wart I was knocked down a frame.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"All in all I saved 19 frames, or 0.317s. This time save was also just enough to make the submission time round down instead of rounding up like Phils'. (previous run is 07:54 and the new one is 07:53)
