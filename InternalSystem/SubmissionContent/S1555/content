	"This is my second run on this site, which I've been working for a little bit over a month. It is obviously much longer than my last movie (4 min). I will honestly say that I had never played this game before I decided to run it, though I had played other Kirby games which I liked. As the game was on the "List of ideas", I gave it a shot and I think it turned out nicely in the end.

[p 
	"In the game there are 6 different abilities to copy. The game consists of 7 worlds, the first three containing 3 stages. The ones coming after that increment the number of stages by one for each world. After all the stages in a world are complete, there will be a boss fight to proceed to the next world. After you’ve beaten the boss you can at any time to go back to the boss room to play a bonus game. If you fail them you have to restart the game to redo.
	$LF
	"Also throughout the game there are 7 hidden Rainbow Pieces. There is one in each world, and are mostly not hidden very well. Though the Rainbow Pieces are protected by a barrier, and the barrier can only be broken with a special power, which differs from piece to piece.
