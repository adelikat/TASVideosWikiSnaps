While this is probably not normally problem with vanilla Mega Man 5 where it's only really used for two fights, this hack heavily uses the new Gravity Hold's gravity switching effect. I'm talking hundreds of uses and thus hundreds of extra flashes of white to the screen. While I'm not normally bothered by some flashing, this submission game me some eye strain. Thankfully,
