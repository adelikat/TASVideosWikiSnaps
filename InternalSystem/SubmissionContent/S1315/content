	"The adventures of Captain Comic is a simple platformer. You play as Captain Comic, a man in a spacesuit, carrying a lasergun. The goal in the game is to collect the "Crown 
	$LF
	"of the Ages",the "Mystical gems of Lascorbanos" and the "Thousand Coins of Tenure". The game is not as linear as you might think, there are actually quite many routes you could take to beat the 
	$LF
	"game, but the route used in this movie is the fastest one.
