	"Hello, this is my first TAS of an entire game. I chose this game because it was an easy and simple game to Tas. The hardest part of the game might possibly be the Monster Movie Set level. It has 2 sections where there are 4-5 doors to chose from. Entering the wrong door will result in you having to do that section again. I purposely slowed down before going to the area with the doors so that I can mainuplate the first door to allow me to proceed. I took damage once on every stage to save time.  I also tried to make the boss battles entertaining.
