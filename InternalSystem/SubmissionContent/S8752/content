	"The only glitch I could find was the ability for some characters to use grounded supers in the air, which both doesn't apply to Deathscythe as the glitch doesn't apply to them and isn't quite significant enough to label this as glitchless. Fastest completion is already assumed for branchless submissions. Thus I decided that the branch for this is unnecessary and removed it. I also truncated the input down to the last one needed to start the ending sequence as the additional inputs past that weren't needed to advance the text to better reflect the TAS time of this submission.
