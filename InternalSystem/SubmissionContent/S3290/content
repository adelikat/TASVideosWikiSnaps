	"Kept the Taun-Taun as long as possible because it had a faster run. Picked up the light saber. Skipped other force powers because they were too far off the path.

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The big strategy decision here was to grab the force power that improves blaster power, but skip the one that improves light saber power. The force is a much greater improvement to the blaster, and the light saber upgrade is much further off the path. You can fight and subsequently control the AT-ST's as intended, but it turns out not to be necessary. There are some beams that you can damage by normal means, or jump over. There are also some damaged areas that are meant to be instant death. They really do 128 damage (out of 255 health), but it takes a frame to die after the damage is applied. As long as you jump on the first possible frame you never actually die. The blaster force power makes quick work of the bosses.

	"Other mass dammage obstacles suffer the same programming error as the dammaged areas in level 3. This includes the vertical beams, which are meant to be passed with the help of R2-D2, or an AT-ST. Additionaly if you jump the frame before you run into them you pass through while taking no dammage. This skips a bunch of the level since the AT-ST is quite far away. It may seem that I go out of my way to take out an extra bounty hunter boss, but the path back to the left through the beams is invisibly blocked by the boss battle. The blaster force power makes quick work of the bosses.
