	"This Tool Assisted Speedrun was created for two reasons. One was to see how fast this could be done, and the other was to test FCEUX's built in TAS editor. This run uses a couple of basic strategies.

[p 
	"This isn't a very interesting strat, but it is used to maximise optimization. The name "A" takes 4 inputs to select, as does the name "G". Most other names, if not all other names, will take 5 or more frames to input.
