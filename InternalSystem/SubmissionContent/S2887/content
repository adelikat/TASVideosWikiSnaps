	": First of all, I liked how both Sonic and Knuckles were used in this movie. It seems to me a rather interesting concept, one which could be entertaining.
	$LF

[p 
	"However, I would like to analyze "Aims for fastest time" with "have more entertainment", which appear to conflict with each other:
	$LF

[h4 id=Aimsforfastesttime
 
	" Aims for fastest time
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Yes, you say "Aims for fastest time". But everyone knows that this movie does not care to aim for fastest time. In order to aim for fastest time properly, it is necessary to do research. For example, http://tasvideos.org/2169S.html has times for Sonic which are lower than those here for both Sonic and Knuckles, without considering the stage glitches. One must actively seek to beat those times, not just play.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Now even when aiming for fastest time, it may be possible to fit in something entertaining. However, I think this game mode is so short that entertainment and fastest time conflict each other.
	$LF
]p
[h4 id=Entertainment
 
	" Entertainment
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"If you are going for entertainment, why does Sonic stop and do nothing in two stages? Certainly, it's not something I would call entertaining. I'd prefer mostly that Sonic and Knuckles are going together, side-by-side as if one person was controlling both of them at the same time. It doesn't always have to be that way, and it's very hard to do, but that to me would be most impressive. Also, it can still be fast, just not fastest time.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In conclusion, I'm rejecting the run. However, if you did a run that focused on entertainment, I'd say it is good to be accepted. If it weren't for the two stages where Sonic did nothing, I could have accepted this run.
