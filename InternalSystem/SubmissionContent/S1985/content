	"8 Eyes is a Castlevania clone, and probably the best known game made by the obscure NES game company Taxan.  It features two characters, the human Orin and his falcon Cutrus, in either 1 or 2 player mode.  Cutrus can attack enemies, hit switches, collect items, and generally do all sorts of useful things.  The game also allows you to attack levels in whatever order you like, and much like the Mega Man games, there's a certain sequence that makes the bosses easier.  Having the correct sword for each level gives double damage against each boss.  Orin can also find and use several Castlevania-esque items, such as a dagger or boomerang, or the ice ball, which freezes opponents (including bosses).  Unlike Castlevania, you can switch between all collected weapons freely.

	"2 player mode allows for substantially more control of Cutrus, though he's still a little temperamental.  He takes a while to recover after his dive attack, and he follows a swooping cycle when flying normally that you can't entirely eliminate.  It can sometimes be very hard to get him quickly and reliably from point A to point B.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Screen transitions follow Orin, so TAS strategy involves using Cutrus as an advance scout to remove obstacles from Orin's path.  Orin is a little more nimble than he looks, but he delays a bit when jumping or landing.  In general, attacking is faster than jumping, which is faster than taking a hit.  Attacking twice is slower than jumping.  Taking a hit when walking on stairs costs 0 to 2 frames, depending on position, so getting to the stairs is key in many situations.  Also, taking a hit doesn't always have the same frame cost, it depends on damage dealt and which direction you get pushed.  So the optimal delay, if one is necessary, sometimes depends on the enemy.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"It's often possible to walk through enemies by damaging them at the right time with Cutrus and going through their hit box during the invulnerability.  This doesn't work for all enemies, and Cutrus can't always get to enemies fast enough because of the screen layout.  I occasionally use Cutrus to get Orin far enough into the hit box so that when he takes a hit it pushes him forward rather than back.  Another technique is distraction.  Sending Cutrus towards an enemy can make them attempt to attack him, allowing me to manipulate their position for when Orin arrives.  Sometimes I can get them out of the way entirely. There are some good examples of this in Egypt, the second level.  Cutrus can also soften up or kill enemies before Orin arrives.

	"In rooms where you exit via a door instead of off the screen, the game will wait for Cutrus to return to Orin's shoulder before starting the screen-change routine.  It's very important to have Cutrus on Orin's shoulder when he reaches the door so as to avoid the very long delay that this would otherwise cause.  If he's right next to Orin but not rested on the shoulder it will cost at least 4 frames.  You'll see me get Cutrus in proper position in every room except one, where it simply wasn't possible because of the switch location.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"In addition, the doors do not remain open for very long after hitting the switch, so you have to hit it when Orin is relatively close to the door.  This extra timing element makes some rooms much harder.  You'll often see me use items, rather than Cutrus, to hit the switches.

There's an infinite room that requires exits to be used in a certain order, much like the forest room in Legend of Zelda.  Note how I run Cutrus off the right side of the screen when approaching the boss: this causes the boss to attack the left wall instead of throwing axes at me as I walk to him.

Hopefully I dominate them all well enough that it's still interesting.  The bosses' damage window is 32 frames, and there are a couple of them on which I don't lose even so much as 1 frame between the first hit and last.  A few others I only lose 5 or 10 frames from taking a couple of hits when necessary.

Not all of them are in convenient locations, but a few are.  I thought this level would be harder to optimize than it was, but all the refills mean I don't have to worry much about when to use items, and the delay before the doors open means that my location after winning each fight isn't important.  Note also that despite appearances I can only use the ice ball 4 times per refill, not 5.  A full bar is 9 and change power, not 10.  Inconvenient, particularly on the teleporting boss, who I'm not able to kill before he teleports once.
