[div class=p 
	"A Start-to-end run of Mr. Nutz for the SNES. Aims for a time as low as possible. Coins are avoided whenever possible to keep down the time spent in score-screens. Health and lives are collected, it positively affects the displayed 'skill' score. Acorns (ammo) are collected if no time is lost. No ingame warps or passwords were used. Damage is taken to save time or to display tricks without losing time. Choices for killing or avoiding enemies were purely on a basis of entertainment value. I enjoyed making this (my first) TAS.
