	" is a very entertaining game. In this game, the player will explore each stage, which contains different boss rooms. After beating a boss, a ghost will appear on the screen, in which you catch into a box trap. One ghost is 1000 dollars. (Maybe it will escape.) After all stages are completed, the final stage will appear on the map. The player should enter that room to beat it. And after completing each level, you will get some money, in which you can buy some items and weapons to help you.

	"There are 5 levels, in the beginning. After completing them, an earthquake happens. Then the player will enter the final level. Previous bosses are brought back to life and you have to beat them, again. After that, you will meet the final big boss...

	"I always play Super Mario Bros. and Contra. I got to know this game due to my cousin, since he has a real Genesis. During the Spring Festival in 2009, we played Contra - Hard Corps for a very long time. Felt boring... So we wanted to play another game. He said he wanted to play a ghost catching game. There are 2 games. One is this game. Its Chinese name is very funny, so we chose this game. During his gameplay, I found that it's so funny. So I remembered it. To be honest, I can't complete this game on a real console. @.*
