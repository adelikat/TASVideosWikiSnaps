	"Well, the idea of rescuing bad game choices fascinates me, and I like finding worthwhile TAS material from the strangest of places. This is one pretty strange place, I guess. I just saw that this game had potential, especially close to the finale when you get the skill of... running. Yes, you have to wait until the end of the game to learn how to run. Anyway. Perhaps even unnaturally enthusiastic about the prospect of TASing a Barbie game, my critical senses shut down for a moment and I forgave the fact that most of the game is actually nothing but very banal platforming through unchallenging, contrived levels. The game was nice looking and sounding, and I even found a few cool glitches from it. And just like that, I was sold...

	"Basically, most of the gameplay in a TAS of this game is slow-paced and repetitive. It takes about 24 minutes to reach the last worlds and only then do things take a big turn towards the interesting. Now, this isn't to say that all of the level design in this game is poor, or that there is absolutely no TAS worthy material in the first worlds of the game. It's just that aside from a few TAS-only strategies, it's... just... not... worth it. As much as I'd like to believe otherwise. So I made a new version of the run that uses a password to skip the repetitive parts of the game and get directly to the world from which you get the running skill.

	"This game was first published on GBA and only later on DS. I picked up the DS version for this run because of a few factors: first, I wanted to try to TAS using DeSmuME. Second, the DS version of the game has a new level early on and new fire obstacles here and there that you have to blow out... although that doesn't show here at all since this is the abridged version of the run. Third, shuffling between seven skills is arduous to do in real time with only one button on GBA. DS has the stylus menu for this, helping matters, not to mention the menu also allows a few light glitches during the run. Fourth, DS has a far better music quality, which is nice because the game has quite good music.
