	"This was a strange way to play a game back then. This difficulty of this game, was to navigate a corridor until you couldn't go any further. the further you got, the better your ranking would be. Since I was never good at getting far (due to horrible mechanics and collision detection), I only saw that TASing would help me to see the end of this game. I was surprised to find that this game had an odd way of ending...going until the corridor is too narrow for a ship to pass. Usually, at this point, you would achieve the best ranking of "Han Solo". Well, I finally have seen it and proven that this game is not a continuous scrolling game, as the goal is to find out your piloting skills.

	"During the TASing of this game, I found that RNG changes occurred in a similar fashion as other BASIC written games. Like a few others, the RND command was used to alter the "seed" and provided a new course for me to traverse. I so happened, that my first attempt was the best...as I was able to travel the further than any other seed. In my experimentation, I tried multiple seeds before I finally gave up.
