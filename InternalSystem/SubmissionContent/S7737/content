	"The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX is a rerelease of Link's Awakening for the Gameboy. The GBC remaster adds color and a new dungeon, with various improvements and a string of glitch patches, but not enough apparently. Link's Awakening breaks the Zelda model by not having Zelda, Hyrule, or Ganon as the main villain, but it ended up being one of my favorite games. Link is trapped in a dream world and has to collect 8 instruments to wake up the Wind Fish, but nightmares serving as bosses and the final boss try to stop him, Link must wake the Wind Fish to escape himself.

UDLR with items returns out of bounds directional state parameters for items, sometimes useful, unfortunately we only have 5 useable combinations rather than 256, some of which would be very useful if possible. An ugly side effect is losing 1/2 or all of Link's sprite during some UDLR actions, I try not to do this if an alternative is available.

		" There are 16 subpixels per pixel, with standard walking being 16 subpixels/frame, so 16. Diagonal walking is 12 speed in each direction, but jumping allows for diagonal straining without losing forward speed, but diagonal jump inputs will start at 13 each direction and increase 1 per frame, which is only used where necessary. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 4 pixels before a corner allow for a pixel boost when strained into diagonally, termed "corner boost," this is used to boost or save a pixel when subpixels wrap around. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" You can zip 2 pixels at a vertical screen transition when clipped fully into a wall, just strain diagonally into a wall and if X subpixels don't roll over you get the boost, also abused heavily. 2D sections have a similar zip to upwarp inside a wall to the ledge above.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Dashing is 32 speed without UDLR, costs 31 frames to charge up, and saves a considerable amount of time and used wherever the menuing is worth it, superdashing especially.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Superdashing uses UDLR combos to get 4 useful dash combinations, there's no down-left combo. Jumping during a superdash can give a very long/fast jump, all Roc's feather jumps last 31 frames. The DLR dash that goes UL quickly can clip through open corners and above fences/warps, used where faster.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Damage boosts give 20 speed in both directions optimally, depending on enemy interest position. This lasts about 15 frames but can be extended with a neutral Roc's feather jump, straining to keep speed. Say you press L or R with 20 X-speed, it will decrement to 19 so I avoid doing that where neseccary. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Shield boosts give 18 speed and have similar restrictions, I use UDLR to shield boost from unusual distances and orientations to enemies. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Bomb explosion boosts give an insane 40 speed, 2.5x multiplier, though I only get several opportunities to exploit them.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Swimming is affected by subpixels too. When pressing A to boost you can hold diagonal without losing subpixels until reaching speed 12, but can't go above 12 holding diagonally, during a boost it goes up to 16 before slowing down. Without the boost the cap is 6 holding diagonally with 8 holding cardinal directions. I only strain diagonally when boosting to not lose subpixels, but pure diagonal movement requires diagonal obviously.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Aquaslide is when entering water with an UDLR directional state, this gives incredible speed in a few combinations which I abuse during swimming sections, the swimming sprite is messed up when this occurs as well but returns to normal.
		$LF

[ul 
	[li 
		" Superjumps are when Link uses a ledge wall from the lower side to get an unintended "leap," which disables collision until he lands. This can be done clipped or subpixel-perfect unclipped, which is very common in this run. During superjumps you can sword-clink enemies or shield-boost off of them to redirect momentum perpendicular to the original jump, allowing for sequence breaks and dungeon shortcuts. I also use the sword to change directional state midair to shield-boost from afar, in 2 places.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Sprite overflow takes advantage of the 16 sprite limit, they are oriented in vertical columns in work ram giving a maximum of 16. I use the shovel to dig rupees and hearts to fill slots, each with 12.5% spawn chance, they are not low priority sprites so Owl cutscenes of considerable length even on JP are blocked from loading where faster. In dungeons I have no ability to dig so using UDLR and optimal regrabs I can spawn 10 or more bombs quickly and use arrows if necessary, to sprite cap King Moblin or instruments if necessary, bombs being important to not waste of course.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Bomb trigger takes advantage of flawed bomb-arrow code to unconditionally set sprite entity in slot 0 to entity state 1, which often initiates cutscenes without the need for the intended interaction. Bomb triggers are used where faster than normally talking to entities, or when I don't have the intended items, such as trade sequence items or witch hut toadstool. This sometimes requires extra steps to get the intended entity into index 0, hence why I kill 2 moblins in the woods at the start to bomb trigger Tarin.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Mushroom superdash is used to clip below walls when transitioning up. The mushroom used during a screen transition cancels 1 frame of post transition movement, so I end up 2-3 pixels below the border, a superdash with good suxpixels clips lower and into walls with ease, so I can shortcut a lot of places.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Bracelet telegrab is using UDLR combos to grab pots, bushes, and rocks from multiple tiles away, sadly only works with DLR for quick grabs from 3 tiles to the left, and UDLR for grabs from 2 tiles above, saving a few seconds over the run.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Instrument cutscene skip ICS was found by RTA runners, LADX patched the cutscene skip that GB Link's Awakening had, but simultaneous mushroom, ocarina, and instrument collection allows for an early save and quit that skips most of the waiting, this was only viable to do on Catfish, Face Shrine, and Eagle's. For whatever reason, the frog song is ~50 frames faster than ballad with ICS, and Mambo's just prevents obtaining the instrument.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Heart piece text skip uses item equip or S&Q menu to block the first text box, only worth doing item equip since the text skip is overall slower but brings the cost of menuing to only ~20 frames, rather than 100. On 4th heart pieces where there's 2 text boxes it's worth doing the skip regardless of item equips, I routed 1 heart level up to the fishing game to avoid this slow text.

Sword is grabbed with an UD shield hitbox, skipping owl cutscene. I save and quit (S&Q) for a fast warp to Mabe Village.

A frame perfect shield flick causes 2 rupees to be added instead of one, another flawed logic glitch. 10 are needed to pay for bombs. I steal the bow from shopkeep, then reenter and get killed, stealing is required for a photograph anyways but paying for the shovel would costs several minutes. After reentering I grab bombs and select to buy them, they're added to inventory but a fast save and quit allows me to keep the rupees. This is repeated for another 10 free bombs. On the third bombs I simply pay for them, the S&Q menu counts as paying for them without text, only faster here.

I kill 2 moblins with a swordslash damage boost, fastest kill possible, and bomb trigger Tarin the psychedelic shroom addict the same frame I transition, so I skip his text and avoid the troll screen.

I shield the enemies into holes, still faster than shooting with arrows which costs an additional menu. In the underground UDLR works from anywhere on screen, use it to boost across gaps. The Roc's feather is added instantly due to empty slot, then I use a superjump to get to the next seashell and S&Q.

I use the log cave to shortcut into the cemetery cave, palettes match so it is allowed. I bomb trigger the witch to give me powder without a toadstool, and item equip to text skip. I get the heart piece and manip a bunch of rupees, duping them when I can. This heart would be too slow to text skip. I go to the photoshop, if I had bowwow a dumb owl cutscene would be present here. I go to the moblin cave, manip 4 50% chance hearts and start bomb spamming as soon as possible, hence why I have a lot of bombs. King Moblin was unloaded, this saved around 6s.

I use superjumps to go through in reverse order, superjump off of the Hinox, then use UDLR arrows to shoot boo-buddies off screen to spawn the bracelet chest. I use telegrabs to save time on each pot, and grab the 20 rupee chest. Farming these rupees on overworld for less than 140 frames is infeasible. I now get to nightmare key room then bomb spam, manip an arrow from stalfos, and shoot 2 arrows. Unloading the instrument is necessary less you are locked in the room and can't superjump out. I kill the genie with a clipped throw and bomb spam, collect the heart and finish.

The bomb throwing is actually manipulating RNG of the counter which I couldn't do earlier, I got the ~96 increments to have only 3 failed RNG calls, which was the best luck I could get after hours of attempts, a sophisticated brute forcer might do better but to expand possible outcomes you'd have to wait additional 4 framerules for new seed each time. I get the L2 sword with swag throws, then equip feather. The jump saved 1 frame. I dash jump to Catfish Maw, can't Jesus jump with flipper in inventory so water cave is necessary. I use the right facing direction and kill the helmasaur that way, while damage boosting. In 2D section each jump saves a pixel, sword slashes lose 1 so I don't slash. I do perfect movement and spawn the key, but with boomerang and pixel perfect setup you can make it transition with you, then the hookshot occupies its slow and you get the hookshot early that way, without 4 Stalfos battles taking over 90s. I then RNG manip hearts and rupees, and Stalfos to not be dumb, then get a heart so I can spawn L2 beams and use UDLR to glitch a sword beam on screen permanently. I then use a Stalfos for a superjump without collecting items I made, and escape the room, unloading the instrument was neseccary, I also bomb trigger the Slime Eel to spawn quicker. I do the first 4 hits then fall in pit, the effect pushes Link up and I transition the fight into the instrument room, skipping some walking. I finish the fight then do ICS.

		" Inside I do a text skip, then superjump off of the spike trap into the L2 shield room, skipping a key. I hit the crystal with L2 beams, get the L2 shield, then go do the pillars. Pillars are routed so they're all slot 0, had to kill a Zol for that. I use a superjump on the last on and get into the last pillar room faster than any%, while getting a zip. I go to floor 3 and do the goomba surf and get across. The Eagle can't be text skipped, and the first pass on screen Y-position is based on RNG and frame count, so spending some time in the menu and a little extra to rearrange was faster overall. After the first hit you can hit him below screen 5 times to finish fight faster. I hookshot it to get it sooner, then ICS for the last time.

I superdash clip up to the last capacity upgrade cave and upgrade powder, losing the mushroom so I can't ICS anymore. I then superdash clip to the turtle rock, then sprite unload dragon thing, manipping a moblin arrow and boomerang for a sprite. I dash clip up to the top entrance, and get the last heart piece with boomerang and text skip. I then head to back entrance.

I use Blaino with a careful lineup to superjump back into the main area, then head over and superjump into the Hothead bossroad. I text skip then manip Hothead starting position. I get the minimum of 6 hits while keeping him in the center 4x4 area, or else he wouldn't go to phase 2. Then 2 last hits and a frame perfect text skip that's a 50% chance of softlocking. I then get heart piece and instrument.

		" I take the optimal route to Wind Egg, mambo warp was 3s slower. I bomb trigger the egg, faster than ocarina. Owl is unskippable. I take the optimal pattern through the egg maze. Early bomb trigger skips the fight intro, no music unfortunately. The blob is killed without powder with precise sword stabs. Agahnim is bomb triggered to avoid morphing several times, saving 140f each time. Damage had to be took so the knockback would put him very close to X=$50 and Y=$30, to minimize morph traveling. Moldorm is bomb triggered then a slash and 6 stabs kills him. Ganon takes 6 dashes, and one slash for Landmola. The Dethyl phase is bomb triggered and he just dies instantly. One last swag bomb then it's a minute of text mashing before credits.

The RTA speedrun community definitely learnt almost everything of this game over the decades, I found a few things that where TAS only UDLR inputs but nothing major or helpful for them.

	" was very helpful since a lot of variables were already documented there, it helped when I needed to know entity behavior or framecount dependent phenomena, just to increase my understanding of the game and make it more of a science rather than guessing. Bizhawk and BGB with the debuggers helped, debugging or tracelogging to understand entities and RNG more thoroughly.
