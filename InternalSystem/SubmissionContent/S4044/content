The trick to the fight is to abuse the L+R trick and getting hit quickly enough, sometimes in the air if possible. Needless to say, you cant abuse damage boost and invulnerability here because with the low health it's game over. But the gauntlet allow me to kill the 1st form in 8 hit. This way I'm can get 2 hit on the mecha dragon at double power.
