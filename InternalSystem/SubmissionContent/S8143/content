	"In the fourth generation of consoles, it was not common to have games in Portuguese among the Mega Drive games, even localizations of the games for Brazil were rare. In this scenario, a few Brazilian games were released for the console. One of them was Show do MilhÃ£o, based on the SBT auditorium television program of the same name, it is a question and answer game (Quiz).

		"More distressingly, I found that questions can be RNG manipulated. Depending on when either the game is started or when an answer is locked in after selecting it, a different question can be loaded. Different questions apparently have different loading times so even if the answer to the next question is less than ideal, just getting a faster loading question would save time overall.

With another pass with those techniques in mind, I can see a future submission by you that's acceptable. For now, I'm rejecting this submission for optimization.
