	"Well, according from 
	[a class=extlink href=https://tcrf.net/Wonder_Boy_in_Monster_Land_(Sega_Master_System) rel=nofollow 
		"TCRF
	]a
	", the Master System version of Monster Land has a region switch that changes the game's title and language when played on a Japanese system. The same holds true for its Japanese counterpart, Monster World, when played on a western system, but instead of having the final English version of the game, it features an earlier version of the localization with a slightly different title (Super Wonder Boy: Monster Land).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The early English version (dubbed Version 1.0) differs from the final version (Version 1.1) by having a different script and being much closer to 
	$LF
	"the Japanese version in terms of difficulty. Specifically, enemy bosses have more health in both the Japanese version and the early English version, 
	$LF
	"than in the final English release.
