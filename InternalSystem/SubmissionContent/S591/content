		" Glitch: managed to get into the lab entry room guarded by purple tentacle before the early cutscene that occurs there. This does not allow me to get by purple tentacle though, because the room doesn't change (which is the key to the enemy-freezing glitch.) What it did enable, though, is that Ed would respond to the doorbell's ring. Normally when the time is too close to the arrival of the package, Ed ignores a kid ringing the bell.

	[li 
		" Glitch: used Ed's response to the doorbell to freeze purple tentacle. In case you are unfamiliar with the glitch, here's a brief outline. First enter a room containing someone unfriendly. Either switch kids or have a cutscene occur before being captured. After switching back to the first kid, the unfriendly person/tentacle will be frozen. (An exception is the green tentacle at the stairs.) The 'New Kid' command is disabled in the lab entry precisely because of this glitch, but the programmers seemingly forgot that cutscenes also make the glitch work.
