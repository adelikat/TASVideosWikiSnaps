	"Author's comments about the run: I'm Sonic Adventure 2 speedrunner. I recently started to learn TAS, and I've got an idea to work on the game I really liked to play many years ago.
	$LF
	"There was a Tool-Assisted Speedrun made by Meesbaker in 2014, but the only TAS tool he used was savestates. Unfortunately, his run was unacceptable for TASvideos because of innacurate emulation, so, I wanted to make a new one.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Generally, my timesave over the previous run came from using frame-advance and rerouting each level myself. Every shot in my run is perfect/max-damage, unless it would cost time to do so. In total I saved 4 minutes and 36 seconds over the previous run, which is very significant because I lost ~17 seconds on load times for each level (which is over 7 minutes for the entire run) due to more accurate emulation.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"1. Half health glitch. To activate this glitch, you must change the pig health in the Multiplayer options to half before entering Single Player mode. This glitch does not affect the the health of vehicles, artillery and shelters. This glitch only works on the PAL version of the game. It generally makes the run a lot faster.
	$LF
]p
[pre 
	$LF
]pre
[p 
	"2. Disabled voices. The pigs' voices are active by default, which leads to delay before every attack. You can disable it in the menu during any level.
	$LF
]p
[pre 
	$LF
]pre
[p 
	"3. RNG manipulation. This is the hardest part of optimization. In TAS conditions, you can make your units act super fast, but the AI may respond differently. It's very tricky because literally everything has an effect on the AI's decision on what to do during his turns. Generally - I moved my units to specific positions, or sometimes I can hold X during the AI's turn to change its targeting.
	$LF
	"Long story short: the AI has 2 options on what to do during each of his turns. You get the first option if you press nothing, or you get the second option if you hold X during the AI's turn. It can change the AI's walking route, aiming and it even can make the AI not attack you (By using "Hide" option for Snipers). If neither of those 2 options are good for you, you need to play differently on this mission (Or even have different ranks/promotions because the amount of health in your team affects AI behaviour).
	$LF
	"Fun fact - you can even manipulate the way that the anti-P mine will blow up by just walking differently at the end of your turn. I explain it below on the Glacier Guns mission.
	$LF
]p
[pre 
	$LF
]pre
[p 
	"4. Death animation cancel. Normally, after decreasing a unit's health to 0 or lower, you get an extra death animation. This animation can take different amounts of time, but it's generally at least 3 seconds long. You can prevent it if you make a unit drown, land in a minefield or deal a massive amount of damage to blow the unit up instantly.
	$LF
]p
[pre 
	$LF
]pre
[p 
	"5. Wall Climbs. Occasionally it is possible to climb up slippery slopes which you shouldn't usually be able to climb, this is is done by walking towards a wall at an angle allowing you to climb the adjacent slope.
	$LF
]p
[pre 
	$LF
]pre
[p 
	"6. One-mine explosion on pillbox. You can make anti-P mine (Or regular mines too? Never tested it.) blow up even if you use only one of them on a pillbox (Or potentially other artillery too). If you lay a mine on a slope it hovers in the air which makes it detonate, so you can attack somebody else on the same turn. This saves a turn on Glacier Guns.

I know that it's possible to make him hide instead of walk, but I wasn't able to get it. I'm not sure why, but I tried different ways. The reason might be a different promotion strategy (I didn't upgrade my Scout), but it never worked with my current squad.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"On my first turn I used the bazooka instead of mortar because I had to spend some time to protect my unit from the Sniper's shot (he ignores all buildings for some reason), so I had time to charge my shot. The bazooka itself can't kill them because they have 45 HP now, and the max damage for bazooka is 40, but I forced the AI into a minefield.

I want to mention that this is first place I got a softlock when I shot too fast and made him fall into the water with more than 1 HP left.

	"On my first turn I used a jetpack to grab the unique "Anti-P Mine", then used a trick to blow up the left pillbox. Usually, a single mine won't detonate, but placing one from the slope makes it hover in the air, which makes it blow up after my turn. After this, I used a cluster grenade to destroy another pillbox, placing my Commando in a very visible spot so that the AI can focus on him.

	"Sixth turn: There are two 100 HP pillboxes and one poisoned Gunner left, so the only option for this turn was destroying a pillbox. The only weapon I have for this is the Anti-P Mine. There are no slopes by the last 2 pillboxes, so I just set two mines under the closest one, making sure it will not just destroy it, but also kill the unit inside. You can manipulate it by walking to different spots after you place the second mine. It can work on the first turn too, but I needed to put my Commando in a visible spot for the AI.

	"Last 2 turns: I used combined mortar and airburst shots to deal enough damage to destroy the last pillbox and the unit inside. Airburst shots are done in mortar style because I need to keep the Gunner on the same spot after the first explosion, then it dealt more damage and sent him into the water.
