		" Golden Fox - The fastest accelerating vehicle on the circuit.

	[li 
		" Blue Falcon - The second fastest accelerating vehicle on the circuit, with a little more top speed than the Golden Fox.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Wild Goose - The third fastest accelerating vehicle, with higher top speed than the blue Falcon.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Fire Stingray (Car of Choice for this TAS) - The slowest accelerating vehicle, with the highest top speed of the available cars for racing.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Brown Cars - Also known as CPU RNG obstacles. These cars can be of massive aggravation and costly of lap times. Usually, they cost anywhere from 1/4 of frame to 2 frames to avoid them. In one situation, 6 frames were lost... but recovered by re-TASing earlier parts to avoid RNG for that terrible situation.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Super Jet - On the completion of each lap, the driver is reward a super jet, which when used...moves the car from its capped speed to 562 as the highest. It cycles from 562 to 478 for 4.25 seconds.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Brake Tapping - Refers to a technique, for when super jets are used, to gain greater speed by manually cycling the speed back up to 562 as fast as possible. This is done by braking at a certain speed to eliminate the lower part of the super jet speed cycle so that your car is running at speeds on the top end more. The result, is about 4 frames cut per lap.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Blast Tapping - Refers to when the accelerator is released to allow your car to make tighter turns. This coincides with a slippage value and prevents it from reaching the maximum value. Basically, it keeps your car stuck to the ground and prevents you from loosing traction and thus keeping your speed up.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Wall Tapping - This is a term that I came up with, that is used to help cycle the super jet speed correctly so that the timing is fixed to maximize the use for when traversing dirt of borders.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Practice Mode - The game offers a player the ability to race a single track. This usually is accompanied by the selection of an opponent. The choice of your opponent can determine greater speeds...in most cases, Golden Fox is used to get the highest speed boost and used most often.
		$LF
	]li

So far, the only  full Grand Prix TAS available was submission 5576. During the making of this, I still can see the reason why this never happened before. During the past 2 months of TASing, there were times again that I wanted to give up. The idea of cleaning up and optimizing was so painful that I had to walk away...only this time, it was easier to deal with.
	$LF
	"It is worth noting that the WR found on http://fzerocentral.org are all IGT related. Some are from practice rounds, while some are from Grand Prix runs. Understand that practice mode runs, where the Golden Fox is used for speed bumping, it impossible to beat on the first lap with and Grand Prix.
