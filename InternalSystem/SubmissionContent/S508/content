	"I bought the Red Potion and Shiny Stone at the beginning of the game because I planned on getting the two treasure chests that would have 350 Gold each instead of the item.  One in Phillips Castle and one in Gold Cave.  But as you can see I wound up not getting either one, or buying anything, or using the Shiny Stone.  So that's a half second I can save in v2.

	"I also made a mistake in the desert and allowed myself to go into the lava cave with low health.  The second long pauses are to regenerate health.  That's about 3 seconds that can be saved.  Plus another 2-4 for the path through the lava cave the first time.  I can save perhaps 3 by not switching to the three way fireball.  And another 3 by not switching to the fireball, because I don't need it.  Though for the lava cave I'll probably need the wind cutter.  But if I can find a way around that it's another 3 seconds or so.
