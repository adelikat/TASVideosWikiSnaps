	"Flying through Bagdad on your magic carpet, you're suddenly accosted by some rug-riding evil genies bent on knocking you offâ€”literally and figuratively. Your only defense is to knock them off first, and this takes some tricky maneuvering. First, you must trap each genie in a bottle. Then collect the bottles before the genies have chance to escape. If you fail to collect bottle in time, the lid opens and your battle resumes.

	"To any one judging this, the article is WRONG. On page 61, the Commodore 64 difference are described...since it was originally written for the VIC-20. In the article, it states that Wave 14, is where we finally see the dreaded "Purple Genie". Well, this is not true...the purple genie comes out on Wave 13. At this point...completing this wave exhausts all unique content and thus ends the need to proceed further. Additionally, the max number of enemy genies are reached at Wave 13.

Usually, you get a huge "bounce-back", which wastes time. I eventually found that controlling RNG helped out in this regard.
