	"Sonic 3 & Knuckles (also known as S3&K) is one of the most popular Sonic games of all time. It is held in high regards as one of the best Sonic games by most people who have played it because of the story, gameplay, music, and level design. Sonic 3 & Knuckles is the result of plugging your Sonic the Hedgehog 3 cartridge and your Sonic & Knuckles cartridge together using Lock-On Technology. A quick little history lesson: Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles were initially supposed to be released as one game, but due to deadlines the game had to be split into two. The first half of the game is known as Sonic 3 Standalone (or Sonic 3A), and was released on February 2nd, 1994. Sonic & Knuckles would be released later in the year on October 18th, 1994, which brought with it Lock-On Technology, which can be used with other Sega Genesis games:

	"This restriction is what is usually called the "No Left or Right Challenge" or "beating the game without pressing left or right." The goal of the run is to beat the game while pressing left or right on the d-pad as few times as possible. Seeing as this is a 2D platformer, this seems near impossible, since you need to press left and right to... well, move left and right. However, we can use the other movement options presented to us to get around! Since Sonic and Tails aren't very diverse in their movesets, Knuckles is the best option for us to use. Now it is time to discuss the strategies I use throughout the run.

[div class=p 
	"In most cases, gliding into a wall will allow you to climb up or down on it. Jumping off will turn you in the opposite direction of where you were facing. But if there is no wall that can be climbed nearby, use a ledge! If you stand near the edge of a platform, Knuckles will go into his balancing animation as he desperately holds on for dear life. However, it's not just a neat little animation. It also causes you to face the same direction as the ledge. This can be abused by landing right on the left edge of a platform to be able to turn left. If you end up facing left by the very left edge of the screen, you can glide against the left boundary to be able to turn right. This is not the case for the right side, however in certain cases, performing a frame perfect glide into a boss right next to the right boundary by abusing invulnerability frames can allow you to turn left without having to press left! But if there is no boss or enemy nearby that you can glide into, then you're stuck and have to die. You can sometimes also turn around on a slope by gliding right before landing on the ground. There is a variant of this with steep slopes that you can't normally ascend, where when you glide on specific points, it will automatically turn you around on the slope, allowing you to jump in the opposite direction. Sideways springs will change which direction you are facing as well. There is a trick when you're either stuck against a wall to the left that you cannot climb or if you want to save time, where if you glide within a few-frame window of landing, the game will automatically turn you to face right.

	"A trick known as "object phasing" is used quite a lot in order to save time in the run. Object phasing is done by standing somewhere with the object you want to phase through just offscreen, hitting the side of said object with a high amount of speed (the most simple method is with a 6-tap spindash), and then performing two 1-tap spindashes in quick succession. If done correctly, you will pass right through the object while it's offscreen. Objects that are offscreen are usually intangible and can be passed through as if they do not exist. Jumping at the right time when phasing through certain objects like moving platforms can also cause you to clip through collision, like through the floor or into a wall. This is more useful in a normal speedrun setting, however it can also be useful here in order to save time, like in Carnival Night.

While you are riding the fans, you cannot perform any actions besides moving left and right. And there is no other route past this, meaning we have to press left to get off of the fans... not! The trick I perform is, from what I have gathered by messing around with it, a very precise trick, involving landing on a specific part of the wall, jumping from a pixel perfect position, and gliding for exactly one frame within a one frame window. With good positioning, this will give me the speed necessary to just BARELY make it past the ledge! Hitting the side of the ledge, missing the frame perfect glide, jumping from the incorrect position, having glided onto the wrong part of the wall, or just having bad subpixels will all result in you being stuck against the wall still being carried by the fans. All you can do then is wait for the timer to run out.

On the way to the boss, there is an eye in the wall that needs to be killed to open a door... to the left. Seeing as we enter the area facing right, it seems like we can just grab the wall and turn around that way. But unfortunately, the wall cannot be grabbed or climbed on, leaving us to our inevitable fate. However, we can still get past this area without needing to press left! Remember when I mentioned that you can turn around against the right edge of the screen using a boss or enemy? We can apply this same concept here using the eye in the wall. After getting the first hit in, I jump into the eye during its invulnerability frames, and do a frame perfect glide into the eye. This gets the second hit in, AND forces me to turn left. Now I can get the third hit in, and proceed on to the boss. This can also be done with the third hit, meaning you can have two chances at doing it. However, it is a very tight window, and missing it will result in you being stuck against the wall and being crushed to death. After making it past that section, I jump onto the steep slope, and by gliding on a very specific point on the slope, it will force me to face right! This allows me to get into the boss room without needing to press right.

This allows me to object phase through the barrel, however now we have to perform a frame-perfect jump and a glide immediately afterwards. This allows us to get past the barrel without having to wait for it to go up enough to spindash underneath, saving several frames. If we don't do the jump perfectly, we'll either get pushed back to the left of the barrel, or we'll get crushed and die.

		" Instead of climbing onto the edge and getting stuck, we want to climb as high as we possibly can, then glide towards the other wall to the left. Once landing, we need to glide back to the ledge. If you have the proper position, then instead of grabbing the wall, you will land on the ledge. Stopping your glide as soon as you land will allow you to balance on the ledge. Now that we are balancing, we can perform a full jump, and glide at the very peak of our jump towards the button. If we grab the wall, we can jump and quickly glide to either slide on the ledge or grab the wall, and we can carry onwards! This strategy is more forgiving than the other two, mostly because there is only one spot where you can really get stuck, therefore the trick is easy to retry over and over again.
