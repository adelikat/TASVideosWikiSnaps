	"This is a far better port than I initially gave it credit for. It's a bit odd working with this because the player sprite is drawn on one frame and then all of the enemies are drawn on the other. On a CRT I imagine the flickering wouldn't be as bad but it's a bit disconcerting trying to TAS this when you can't see yourself literally half the time (this also causes problems when attempting to upload encodes to YouTube). Having said that, I am extremely impressed what the game developers accomplished on such a limited platform.

	"Potential improvements:  I did what I could to manipulate spawn positions but it's always possible that additional fiddling could get them in better locations.  There are a few speed and entertainment trade-offs but I tried to keep it to a minimum to focus on speed in case this is destined for the vault.

	", this version also gets harder after the wave where this TAS ends. The hardest it can get is when all enemies in a wave are shadow lords (blue), which is around wave 40. Vault rules tell us to play until such point. Moreover, for a run going to Vault, "1 player" branch slower than "2 players" isn't acceptable.

		"The Joust wave listing

	" tells after wave 42 it's no longer any harder. So even though the only thing an optimal TAS could consist of is insta-kills, Vault rules are Vault rules. Thankfully, we don't need to beat all 100 waves (this game actually starts looping only after wave 60).
