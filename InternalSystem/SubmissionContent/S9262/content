	"I originally had planned to TAS all of Yominokagura's escape rooms until I realized that there were many visual errors with the numbered and colored combination locks that were unavoidable and needed to escape the rooms. However, the visual errors only occurred when I was pairing libTAS with Ruffle. The visual errors didn't occur when using Ruffle demo or the exact same Ruffle nightly build I'm using for this submission.
