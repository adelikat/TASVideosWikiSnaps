	"Gradius 2 is the third series of Gradius. It introduces the plane of Viper that will fight your way to save the world. There are four Types of weapon that you're gonna choose. Hopely, your goal is to fight your way in space by going into the cell and defeat the brain. This run is 22 seconds faster than my previous run that is not published movie and Ouzo's run by 98 seconds without rerecords in Speedrun competition in Gradius II Survival Thread.
