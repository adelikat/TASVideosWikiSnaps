	"Hey Arnold! The Movie is, surprisingly, a licensed game about Hey Arnold. To everyone's surprise, it's playable, and to everyone's even greater surprise, it has nice controls, smooth gameplay and good music. Scheck buys up most of the neighborhood where Arnold lives so he can build a mall, and Arnold and Gerald have to find a document that declares the entire area a national monument before the bulldozers start tearing everything up.

Jumping doens't waste time in itself (it is as fast as running) but, upon landing, you will have

Horizontal clipping is the fact of doing a jump high enough on a one side platform (a platform which can be accessed from the sides or below, but is solid above). Jumping just high enough will simply push you up. Inversly, this can be used to clip in staircases: doing a pixel-perfect jump to hit the side of a one-way platform (which is what stairs are made as) and clipping through the staircase. This can be also done in reverse to clip up into stairs instead of clipping out.

	"But this is a little different: I start with an hyperjump up to the platform. This skips the first set of levels. Another hyperjump is used to get up to the second wooden platform, saving another jump. Afterwards, the third hyperjump is done on the blue platform above the switch to get up to the last blue platform, after doing a last hyperjump to get up to the door. The lastest is the hardest because it's a frame perfect clip on top of being a frame perfect hyperjump.

	"Finally, the sixth and last screen is a barrel-heavy staircase! Looks familiar? I get on the third step and execute the first hyperjump, barely clipping up. The second clip is the hardest by far, but it's also an upwarp: I get hit and get clipped up at the same frame. Because of that, the game thinks we're stuck against a wall, and tries to clip us upward; this momentum is conserved for our next jump, going up insanely fast and saving an hyperjump! Finally, the last two hyperjumps are done on the third and second step, and we're done with this staircase.

These normal attacks are either throwing a paper plane (which is incredibly slow) or stomping. Luck was manipulated to force Scheck to stomp often, and otherwhise, it's just a waiting game.

I liked your style of movement throughout, and how you strove to incorporate rhythm and choreography during the boss fights.  Stage 4-2 was also notable in its much shorter length, (good work on the bruteforcing used!).  Nice job!
