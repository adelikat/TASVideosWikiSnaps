	"Thankfully, it took me a few months to finish. Thinking back to when I first started rockman exile a few months ago, I took the wrong route and didn't know anything about Delay scroll. so it wasn't until after I finished that I realized I wasn't much faster than 27:21, which discouraged me. However, Cui's route and Delay rolling let me regain my confidence, and let me begin to understand and learn Delay scroll. Even though I am not very good at Delay scroll, I can debug it in a short time.Of course, I also got in touch with Shinryuu from Youtube, his WIP made me learn a lot, like crash man's Delay scroll, and chose another channel to use Item 2; wood man saves item 1 and uses delay down scroll; In Bubble Man Level, I saved more lag than Shinryuu while using item 2. I am very grateful to Shinryuu for this.

	"Unfortunately, on normal difficulty, if you choose Metal Man as the last level and beat the boss as quickly as possible, Castle 1 will suffer a one frame lag, which will cause enemies to appear on the screen and make it impossible to move through the first few screens quickly. It bothered me so much that not long ago I even thought of giving up. Fortunately, I still found a solution, which was to have Metalman change the direction of his accelerator zone once during the battle, which solved the subsequent Castle 1 frame lag. So, for this frame lag, I had to give up over 30 frames.

	"In Castle 1, Cui recommended a Delay down scroll to me, which saved me another 100 + frames in this level. Meanwhile, I watched Shinryuu's Youtube video and successfully debugged the mechanical dragon's Delay scroll. This may sound common, but it is a milestone of my own for me, I think I have gone from a beginner to a qualified taser.

	"Finally, in fact, near the completion of Cui and I found a lot of places to further improve, but I plan to stop here. I do not know how many times I have redone this hack, and I estimate that the number of rerecordings is close to 100,000. At least now I have felt low energy, I want to do something else, let this work remain imperfect! After all, life isn't perfect, XD
