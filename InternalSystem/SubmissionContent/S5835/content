[div class=p 
	"The North American release of this game plays much like a standard game of American Football with both offense and defensive play during a set time frame; winner being the team with highest score when the time runs out.  Four difficulty levels are available to choose from at the beginning of the game.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The Japanese version, however, has a completely different goal.  This version is high score based; more like the arcade release.  Score increases with progress down the field, touchdowns, kicked PATs, and remaining time on the clock when the touchdown is scored.  Another major difference is no option to select difficulty at the beginning; the game moves through the 4 difficulties as its normal progression to the hardest level (Super Bowl).  Each difficulty level involves a first and second half.  Scoring a touchdown ends the half and moves to the next. As each half ends as soon as a touchdown is scored, the game can be progressed through without regard for the time on the clock.
