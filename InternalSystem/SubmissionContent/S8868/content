	"Fantasy World Dizzy is the third core game in the Dizzy series. While Dizzy and Daisy were taking a stroll, the Evil King's trolls ambushed them. Daisy was sent to Wizard Weird's Tallest Tower, while Dizzy was dragged away and thrown into the deepest, darkest, dankest of the King's Dungeons in the bowels of Fantasy World. 25 years later, the game was remade by The Oliver Twins for the NES as Mystery World Dizzy.

	"The run is performed on the Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48K. Fantasy World Dizzy synchronises its game engine to the screen's refresh rate, and therefore generally runs marginally (~0.1%) faster on 48K than on 128K versions. However, 128K versions of the Spectrum run their Z80 processor at a slightly higher clock rate, and the +2A and +3 also have some improvements in memory access speeds; this means that menuing and room transitions should be faster on these models.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"But for some reason this isn't the case - 128K versions of the game actually lose a frame with each room transition, each time the menu is opened or closed, and each time a dialogue option appears or disappears. In addition, the death jingle must finish playing before continuing after a death; as the 48K version does not have music, this makes deathwarps much faster on 48K models. In total, using the 48K Spectrum saves approximately 20 seconds over other models, so this run uses the 48K Spectrum.

	"Dizzy moves horizontally at four pixels per frame, whether on the ground or in the air. While standing or walking on ground, he can stop and turn around instantly, but he cannot be controlled in the air. A jump can only be performed while standing or walking on ground; this pushes Dizzy upwards at a fixed velocity and sends him into a roll. He cannot be controlled while rolling and will continue rolling until he is both on the ground and on his feet.

[div class=p 
	"Dizzy can pick up and drop items, and the game revolves around his using this ability to solve puzzles. By pressing the menu button, the inventory will open. If an item is within Dizzy's reach, he will also pick it up. Dizzy can initially hold two items at a time, and picking up a third item will cause Dizzy to automatically drop the first. Selecting an item in the inventory will make Dizzy use or drop it. The menu can only be opened while standing still, and items do not act under physics; once dropped, they are stationary and do not move until picked up again.

	"If an item is dropped within its designated use area, the item will (usually) disappear and some interaction will occur (e.g. opening a bridge). In addition, some items have no purpose and exist as red herrings. There are three special items in the game that are used differently:
	$LF
	"1. The bag permanently increases the number of items Dizzy can hold to four. It's possible to complete the game without picking it up, but being able to carry more items saves a lot of time revisiting areas.
	$LF
	"2. The large round hole. If you have the bag and pick up the hole, you then have a hole in your bag, so everything falls out of it. This is a joke item that nevertheless can be useful to quickly remove junk items from your inventory, but we don't need it in the route we take.

This means we can get access to the right side of the map immediately, grabbing the bag to increase our item limit, saving a lot of backtracking. This could be done every time we need to cross this screen, but waiting for the cycles to line up again is slower than getting some sleeping potion.

	"Dizzy is one of my favourite 80s/90s videogame series, and Fantasy World Dizzy is the game that set the standard future games would follow, with the introduction of the Yolkfolk, more emphasis on dialogue, and a menu and inventory system that would go practically unchanged for the next few games. The series is reaching peak Dizzy at this point, with many claiming this as the best Dizzy game; personally I think Magicland Dizzy improved on this even more, but it's a great game regardless.
