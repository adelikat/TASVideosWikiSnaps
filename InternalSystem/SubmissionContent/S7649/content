So, the web zip and web swing button is shared - if you tap it (specifically, 5 frames or less), you zip to a marked point, and if you hold it, you web swing. However, if you're holding the button for those initial 5 frames, the game is storing where your zip point is, and even if you pass a wall in that time, the game will still zip you to that point when you release the button. The goal is to press the zip button and walk around a corner at the same time, so Spider-Man goes through the wall to get to the point. Then just cancel the web zip by attacking as you pass through the wall, and voila!

[div class=p

During those 5 frames, if you start attacking before the web zip actually comes out, and keep holding the web zip button, Spider-Man won't web zip to the point until you're done attacking. This allows you to cover as much ground as you want by just attacking repeatedly, then web zip afterward, making it incredibly easy to get out of bounds.

Disabling the fog removes the rather abrasive glow when out of bounds, and it's not entirely inaccurate to do so, as the 3DS version lacks most fog. I don't think this affects the movie's ability to sync, either.
