This is the fastest way to enter the Area 5, otherwise i had to travel through the pipes to another section of Area 1 and finally to the Area 5, losing time.

Space Jump is needed to do this Glitch since there is no wall to perform the screen manip, doing the double jump at the very top of a ceiling pushes you to the right side.

This game requires you to beat the game with some Keys to unlock the Best Ending but this run literally didn't take any Key, so that's why the game shows you the Bad Ending defeating Bowser, but not rescuing the Princess.

[div class=p
