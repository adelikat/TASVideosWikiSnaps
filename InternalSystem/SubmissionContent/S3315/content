		"By jumping backwards into any object Mario can move closer to the right side of the screen without scrolling..Mixing this with the turning around faster trick (pressing left/right one frame) can bring maximum distance so that the first gap will not disappear. As we all know, if you land on a shell that is flying in mid-air within the two rows of blocks at the bottom of the screen, a glitch will take place: The shell will be stopped from moving and will just behave as if it was on the ground. It will even walk through the floor if it is set up in a certain way. So we can place the shell into the gap and it will walk through the groud so that we can use it to get through here.

	"In general, for any warped vs. unwarped run, two branches make sense as there's usually significant differences between the two in items collected that modify how the levels are played out. People also want to know the fastest possible record, as well as the fastest record for doing everything.
	$LF

[p 
	"This run includes everything the warped run has, leaving little for the warped run itself to show off. As to the first detail, the only significant item SMB offers in warped vs. unwarped is the fireflower. Since the fireflower cannot be used in a B-less run, the difference in items doesn't exist. As for the second, people to my knowledge have not been interested in any records for beating the game B-less. The only thing I've seen people wonder in terms of beating the game B-less is if it could be done at all or not. This run answers that question very well, and demonstrates every single level in the game can be beaten B-less. Therefore, I am accepting this as an obsoletion of the warped B-less run.
