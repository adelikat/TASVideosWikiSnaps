Hexcite: The Shapes of Victory is a GBC version of said board game, which includes a Practice Mode, with fifty games about to finish that you need to get victory in, similar to

	": Even though the environment here is a board game, the Practice Mode is just a set of puzzles with certain solutions. Gameplay does not look very entertaining, but it's still a typical puzzle game speedrun where precision makes it clearly superior to a human playthrough. Just like with chess problems, solving those re-defined puzzles is not a board game in itself, even though in actual Hexcite play those scenarios may occur. So this movie doesn't count as
