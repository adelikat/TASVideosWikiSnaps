				" This is the first maze question of the game, which is a common theme for this game. The maze questions work off a "checkpoint" system, what I mean by that is that there are points you have to pass in order to grab the key, if you don't pass these points, touching the key will make you lose a life and it will reset the question, this was probably implemented to prevent cheating. For this question, you have to pass through the bifurcation to successfully get the key.

								" This is another maze question, and in this case, the checkpoint is an area next to the vanish bottle. The "issue" I mentioned in my Impossible Quiz Book TAS is that when you collect the vanish bottle, libTAS will crash, which made me believe that it was impossible, but I discovered that you didn't need to collect the bottle in order to progress, but I still collect it anyways >:)

	"I've already mentioned better rubbing on questions 52 and 104 and better luck in question 91, and maybe there's a better variant on question 17, but besides that, I can't think of many improvements. That is if you don't consider increasing the framerate, which would make many questions, most notably the rubbing questions, significantly faster, for example: In the RTA WR, Benbenq99 completes question 104 in just 4 seconds, mostly due to a higher mouse refresh rate (the mouse's refresh rate for this game in libTAS is just 24 frames per second). However, from my understanding, you can't increase the framerate arbitrarily if it doesn't generate new tricks, which is why I was able to do it for Book 1 but not here.
