[p 
	"Most of the improvements made this time round can be attributed to better, more precise playing in the first few levels of the game, as well as quicker movement using shoulder bash.

[p 
	"Major route changes are credited to XYZ, who reminded me to use the Powerfist to end stage 2-2, and also discovered the glitch used on the Mortus.

I'm using the same version of Gens that I have used since June 2006... if this movie is not compatible with that version, well, tough luck. I have not been informed about new emulator versions that are not sync-compatible with the old versions, nor provided with patches... Moving along.
