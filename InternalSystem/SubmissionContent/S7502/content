I have to go on the lower path after camera goes by the first purple curtain so that the game can load the next chunk necessary for me to proceed. So instead of going up the B-Doings, I instead butt bounce on the bumper car enemy to land on the platform and skip the hammers by using some precise jumps. A lot of the platforms in this level are meant to be spinning but due to the massive jumps and not hitting certain switches, they don't spin at all.

I also have to dodge the fireball attacks in phase one because getting hit at any point in the fight will cause Toc-Man to laugh which is only bad for phase one. The cutscene before the percent screen is skippable but for a faster TAS timing, no inputs are placed after the last rev-roll is charged, plus, it would've killed me if I didn't show the final cutscene which in my opinion, is unintentionally funny. There are credits in the game but it's found in the options menu on the title screen and doesn't play after beating the main game which is a bit bizarre but oh well!
