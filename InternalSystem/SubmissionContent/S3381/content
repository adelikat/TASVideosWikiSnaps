[p 
	"This game, the fifth game in the X series, is about a giant space colony that's about to drop down on Earth, and you need to collect 4 pieces (from the first four Mavericks) of a giant laser cannon, which can be used to blow it up. Usually, it fails and you need to get 4 pieces (from the final four Mavericks) from a space shuttle to use that instead. Here, though, the laser blows it up in one shot without any pieces collected. (Which, in real time, has a 1/16 chance of occurring). This instantly unlocks the final stages, which are therefore the only stages needed for completion. Of course, this being an X game, expect loads of instant death spikes, wall jumping, dashing and challenging bosses, and Sigma as the final boss.

[ul 
	[li 
		"Slash Dash Cancel (SDC): First hit of a triple jab (which doesn't activate invincibility) can be cancelled with a dash, which can be cancelled into another slash. Repeat for lots of damage.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Turnaround SDC: By turning around while doing the first hit of a triple jab, Zero will automatically do the second slash in the other direction. It's faster than normal SDC, provided it's actually possible to hit with it.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Lowering ranks to save time: Boss levels in this game determine the bosses' health, and these are (partially) determined by your rank, so lowering your rank intentionally makes some boss battles shorter. These include Rangda Bangda W, X and Sigma's first form.
		$LF
	]li

[p 
	"Because of this, Zero ends up with a SA rank instead of the published run's GA rank.
