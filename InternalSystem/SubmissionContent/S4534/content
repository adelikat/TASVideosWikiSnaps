	"In this TAS I complete the entire game without using 2 of the most common glitches that speedrunners use.  I don't use the orb or cloud.  Look them up on google if you have no idea what they are.  Okay so...  this TAS features:  new and original strategies (which may or may not be time saving) such as in Donut Plains 1 I fly but grab my fire flower to stop me from flying much faster than just stopping the flying animation.  It also features 6/5 and 1/1 in order to run and swim faster.  I'm pretty sure I only failed a tiny bit in DS1 but other than that I am happy with this TAS.
