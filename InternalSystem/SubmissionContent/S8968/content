	"Rampart came out in 1990, being one of the first tower defense games, maybe ever. The game follows a loop of 3 phases - build -> place cannons -> battle -> build, so on and so forth. If you fail to surround a castle with your walls, you are defeated. The game's multiplayer is where it really shines, where the single player has largely been ignored due to its rather extreme difficulty.

If you insert another coin, you can restart the current level, except your cannons are stronger. And if you die again, you can get your cannons even stronger (but any death beyond that will not benefit you).

	"Aside from that, the game is pretty straightforward. The main strategy is to try and hit "critical mass" as soon as possible. This means surrounding all possible castles and placing as many cannons as possible (surrounding your home castle gives you 2, any other castle gives 1). Eventually, you will massively overpower the enemy forces and make major progress toward the current level's completion. Also, a cannon is reloaded once its ball hits something, so having more cannons is better, to ensure you can basically always fire.

This is most notable in the final stage, where there are only 2 castles, and both are close to the edges. There was a build phase where I intentionally didn't surround a castle even though I could have - because if I did, a fireball ship would have destroyed the ground, rendering BOTH castles unable to be saved, therefore making me lose, no matter what.

The audio and video of the GBC version is downright awful though, so I abandoned it to start this TAS instead."

Since submissions must be done on stable BizHawk releases only, this movie cannot be processed at the moment. Accepting it in the first place was my fault since I also used a dev version of Bizhawk to reproduce it, unknowing it would desync on the stable version.
