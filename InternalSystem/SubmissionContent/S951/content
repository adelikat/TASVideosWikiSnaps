	"You will notice that I die a few times in the run. This is because when you die, you get all ammo for your weapons back. And especially "shield" needs new ammo now and then because you only have one charge   per life. To put things short, it's simply faster to die at some places and get all your ammo back, than to keep going without any ammo for certain weapons.
