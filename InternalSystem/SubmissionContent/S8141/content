	""Arctic" is the only ARPG (Active Rail Playing Game) in the world. It puts a heavy strain on your brain.
	$LF
	"This game is developed by Artdink, and it resembles a bit the company's famous train simulator game, "A-ressha de ikou".
	$LF
	"This game was never released outside Japan.

	"The game objective is putting all the yellow/blue balls into corresponding colored seats.
	$LF
	"When a stage starts, all the balls are shot. In stages, there are many railway switch points, and you can switch all the yellow/blue points at once. And, you can shoot all the balls in yellow/blue seats at once.
	$LF
	"However, if a yellow/blue ball collides with a red ball, it results in a failure.

	"In this movie, I often sacrificed in-game time to save frames. (In-game time is measured from when you shoot balls for the first time)
	$LF
	"Especially, sometimes you can save frames by deliberately beating a stage a bit slower. I guess it is related with the music fadeout process.
	$LF
	"Sometimes you can delay beating a stage by switching points. But it seems that this manipulation can only be done in laggy stages.

[div class=p 
	"Generally, to achieve the fastest rapid fire input, you have to insert blank frames in between button presses. But, in this game, you can skip these blank frames by pressing unrelated buttons simultaneously. For example, (A, A+Up) is considered as two successive A input.
