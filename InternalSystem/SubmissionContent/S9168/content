	"Flushed Away is a game based on the 2006 Aardman/Dreamworks animated movie of the same name. The DS version of the game is a 2.5D platformer where you play as Roddy and Rita with the game loosely following the plot of the movie. I am a big fan of the movie, I think it is a incredibly underrated movie and flat out one of the best movies in Aardman's and Dreamwork's catalogue. I can't say the same about this game however. It is a janky platformer with frustrating controls and bizarre mechanics which make the game rather unenjoyable casually. The game is rather short though and luckily for us, the game's jank does lead to some fun movement.

		"I used the European version of the game for this TAS (specifically the UK version). The US and UK versions are identical, I just had the UK version available, hence why I used it. Other European versions have a language select at the beginning of the game which is not ideal to say the least. The Japanese Version (with its beautiful title: SIMPLE DS series Vol.17 The Nezumi no Action Game: Mouse-Town Roddy to Rita no Daibouken) is unfortunately slower. It has a title screen not present in the other versions and text transitions are slower than in English. It's a shame because I absolutely would have TASed the Japanese version if it wasn't slower. 
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"In this game, you can naturally walk, jump and attack. Both Roddy and Rita have a double jump. For basic movement, you often want to avoid jumping unless it is necessary. This is because your ground jump has quite a bit of windup where you stay still until you jump off the ground. Because of this, we often avoid jumping or we opt to walk off platforms to jump when we can as that avoids the jump startup. 
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				"Bizarrely, if you jump off of boxes, it skips the jump startup animation for some reason. This can be taken advantage of in a few areas.

		]ul
	]li
	[li 
		"You have two types of attacks: a ground attack (Roddy points his sword forwards, Rita does a little kick) and an air attack (a butt stomp). The ground attack is only really used in bosses. The air attack makes you plummet down and you can bounce off enemies and boxes. This can be utilised in a handful of areas. The bounce you get is also quite high which can be useful in a few areas.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Roddy has a dash move. Pressing the X button will make Roddy dash forwards where he amusingly yells "Tally Ho" (which is what I will be calling the dash from this point onwards). You can then press another button during the Tally Ho to cancel it into a roll which covers more distance, goes through enemies and breaks big boxes. Tally Hos make Roddy move a lot faster than when walking which is naturally very beneficial. The downside however is that once Roddy has ran far enough, he will get tired and he will completely stop for a while to catch his breath. This pretty much completely mitigates the timesave Tally Hos would otherwise have. Because of this, we have to carefully place Tally Hos in order to get the most distance out of them without getting tired (you can extend with a roll as late as 59 frames after inputting a Tally Ho which is heavily utilised). There are instances where Tally Hos can be cancelled which will be explained later.

		"Momentum Storage
	]b
	$LF
	"Momentum Storage is a technique where the player can maintain their horizontal speed for an extended period of time, which is paired with Tally cancels in order to allow the player to maintain a very high speed for a long period of time. Moving in the air slows the player down which is very noticeable when performing Tally cancels. The player quickly runs off an edge but then slows back down to their normal speed. This can be avoided however by simply not holding any directions on the D pad when running off ledges. This allows the player to keep their high horizontal speed from Tally cancels. Not only this but if you jump as soon as you land (while still holding neutral), you will still have that high horizontal speed once you jump off the ground and this can be chained indefinitely. Momentum Storage is extremely useful as it allows the player to maintain their Tally Ho speed while jumping without needing to Tally Ho, allowing the player to platform at great speeds and not have to worry about getting tired. Tally Hos are still ideal for speed when they can be used as the player does have to go through their lengthy jump startup but momentum storage is applicable in areas where Tally Hos are not and it is still significantly faster than just walking.

	"And that is my TAS for the DS version of Flushed Away. I just barely got a sub 14 which was extremely neat (the run is a 13:27 with RTA timing). The game has a lot of downtime but I hope the high points of the run were still fun to watch. I am happy with how this run turned out. There is still potential for more time to be saved, certain areas could have faster strats and better RNG could exist in places too (mainly the final battle). A dramatic theoretical timesave would be finding a way to skip collecting the map to the Water Plant and just immediately playing the Water Plant. If possible, that could save up to 2 and a half minutes although it might not be possible and if it is, it would cut out one of the more entertaining parts of the run. Regardless, I am definitely satisfied with how the run turned out and I am super satisfied with cutting the sub 14 so close.
