	"(1) If you were to pick up this game the hardest difficulty would be 'hard', however, after completing the game once 'Nightmare' difficulty is unlocked. Since i don't have the luxury of unlocking 'Nightmare' difficulty i use a password at the main menu to unlock it.

	"(2) I DO take damage to save time to an extent, however, i am playing on Nigtmare difficulty. The enemies and bosses are much more difficult than at hard mode and most noticably Spiderman can only take TWO hits before death. So effectively i can only take damage to save time once. Due to health pick-ups i can do it about three times. However, due to this reason the majority of this movie must be avoiding damage.
