	": Looking though this submission the main sticking point was exactly how legitimate this select button method to remove 3 million and get health.  Specifically whether this was a leftover debug function or an intentional mechanic from the developers.  Several points have pushed it to just being a part of the game.  Particularly that it is not abusable in game to trivialize gameplay, and that the developers actually have an achievable bad ending with $0 seemingly designed for this. So with those points in mind going to accept this as part of intended gameplay.
