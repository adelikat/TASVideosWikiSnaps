[div class=p 
	"1. Jump at the last frame before the monk appeared after each BOSS fighting will gave protagonist a acceleration at the begining of next scene, it will save 1 frame.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"2. There are 5 kinds of shoes in the game. These speed are: Initial shoes: x1 y1, $50 shoes: x1.5 y1, $80 shoes：x1.5 y1.5, $180 shoes：x2,y1.5, $380 shoes：x2,y2. $180 shoes are enough and buying shoes at a store can waste a lot of time so we didn’t buy $380 shoes, it’s an improvement of the old TAS.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"3. The using times of some props can be accumulated, such as glove and invisible cloak. But the flying shoes are exception.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"4. We can buy Sub Weapons in stores, or we can get them by killing some enemies. But all of these two ways will waste some time. If we kill a BOSS form enemy, It flashes longer when it dies than a normal enmey, and the props appear slower, so it's not a good choice. We can kill 2 enemies in the same screen, this allows us to spend once time get 2 props.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"5. When the flying shoes disappear, a hidden lag will appear. This lag is fixed and cannot be changed by buttons.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"6. After we buy the $180 shoes, our odd jumps will slow down 1 frame, even number of jumps will not be affected.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"7. When we attack with knife, it slows down our speed.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"8. The speed after touch the enemy is 2, but the initial speed of the first 2 frame is 0, so touching enemies will save time before we buy $180 shoes and waste time after we buy it.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"9. Try to control the amount of blood at the lowest level when we beat each stage. This will shorten the settling time of customs clearance. Consider the previous trick, we should touch enemy more times before we buy $180 shoes, and after buy it we should touch less.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"10. The X axis speed of the fireball is 3, it’s quick than any shoes.
	$LF

[div class=p
