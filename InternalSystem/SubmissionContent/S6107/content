	"I and aiqiyou improve 
	(__wikiLink|2209M|J.Y & Max12187566's movie)
	" 9761 frames, mainly using knife + glove produced infinite damage glitch and improve part of the route to save a lot of time, while improving many details are also reflected.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Secondly, Sub Weapon's damage is same as your Main weapon, so we also can second kill everything with Main weapon when we have knife+glove. Through this technique, we also saved some time.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"fcxiaopengyou is responsible for most of the movie production and processing TAS technical details, such as saving frames and processing randomness. aiqiyou keeps RTA WR of this game and responsible for the overall route, such as using and obtaining of props.

[h3 
	" Tricks and strategies
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"1. Jump at the last frame before the monk appeared after each BOSS fighting will gave protagonist a acceleration at the begining of next scene, it will save 1 frame.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"2. There are 5 kinds of shoes in the game. These speed are: Initial shoes: x1 y1, $50 shoes: x1.5 y1, $80 shoes：x1.5 y1.5, $180 shoes：x2,y1.5, $380 shoes：x2,y2. $180 shoes are enough and buying shoes at a store can waste a lot of time so we didn’t buy $380 shoes, it’s an improvement of the old TAS.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"3. The using times of some props can be accumulated, such as glove and invisible cloak. But the flying shoes are exception.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"4. We can buy Sub Weapons in stores, or we can get them by killing some enemies. But all of these two ways will waste some time. If we kill a BOSS form enemy, It flashes longer when it dies than a normal enmey, and the props appear slower, so it's not a good choice. We can kill 2 enemies in the same screen, this allows us to spend once time get 2 props.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"5. When the flying shoes disappear, a hidden lag will appear. This lag is fixed and cannot be changed by buttons.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"6. After we buy the $180 shoes, our odd jumps will slow down 1 frame, even number of jumps will not be affected.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"7. When we attack with knife, it slows down our speed.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"8. The speed after touch the enemy is 2, but the initial speed of the first 2 frame is 0, so touching enemies will save time before we buy $180 shoes and waste time after we buy it.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"9. Try to control the amount of blood at the lowest level when we beat each stage. This will shorten the settling time of customs clearance. Consider the previous trick, we should touch enemy more times before we buy $180 shoes, and after buy it we should touch less.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"10. The X axis speed of the fireball is 3, it’s quick than any shoes.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"11. We will not reduce the usage count of gloves if we injured when we stab the knife.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"12. Flying shoes only reduce the usage count when landing.

	"Stage 1:
	$LF
	"Wait for the first purse to get $45, kill a snake to get $6, buy $50 shoes, X axis speed turn to 1.5, touch the remaining snake to save time, BOSS fighting is optimized and the maximization of coins is maintained. Stage 1 was slow because of waiting money and shopping.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Stage 2:
	$LF
	"Skip the upgrade weapon BOSS and optimize the details of the springboard. Despite killing a few more enemies and waiting for money, but the overall time began to grow faster. Buy $180 shoes to make X axis speed to maximum value, it provides faster acceleration for the entire game process. Spend more time kill this BOSS because we didn't upgrade our weapon. Consume more blood by using special skills to touch bats. We kept two drops of blood here, so that we could control the blood volume to the lowest level in the following stages.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Stage 3:
	$LF
	"On the way up the ladder we killed a cloth puppet to get 10 gloves. We can use knife+gloves glitch second kill anything.
	$LF

[p 
	"Stage 4:
	$LF
	"The protagonist does not need to wait for the mobile platform with a faster speed, saved some time in the ditch. When we kill the crocodile, touch the bubbles it spits out, there is no consumption of gloves here. Get a lightning this stage to prepare for next stage. Kill this BOSS after its attack, using this technique, only 4 coins will appear, this will save time to get coins.

	$LF
	"No need to waste time getting lightning, optimize the details of entering the well. Skip the upgrade weapon BOSS.

	"Stage 9:
	$LF
	"With the help of flying shoes, we do not need to contact magma. Used glitch to pass the first scene quick. Don’t need to buy $380 shoes. Use fireball to kill BOSS faster.
