Now let's count the votes in actual posts, where people use to provide their take in a reliable way. 2 "yes" votes and 1 "meh". Doesn't look like people really got excited by this run. Lack of feedback is also a proof that it's not that entertaining to the audience.

	"And the gameplay kinda proves that: even though it has insane frame windows that can only be handles on a TAS level, and crazy point calculation system that can also only be routed precisely in a TAS, this boils down to optimization problems. And the impression from this gameplay is that it looks simplistic: you just have to pin the opponent's hand, that's all. Some comic take is there, but it doesn't change how narrow the range of actions is. And this game also loops the opponents for a few times, so once you see the first loop, you've basically seen all the gameplay has to offer entertainment-wise.

But even though the count can not be infinite, or capped in a way similar to 999,999, where it either stops in some games or overflows in others, there's no designed limit where you could say "I collected all the points this game has to offer".

[p 
	"There's no fullness here, no count that would be equal to 100%. The score that gets calculated in such absurdly esoteric ways that it makes it impossible to prove that the score achieved in a given run is indeed maximal. The possibilities to test are endless, and even though it would require an overkilling amount of resources to do an exhaustive search, it would still be only "maxing out the score", not full completion.

[p 
	"Sonic-type situation means that the player has to reach the end of the level as fast as possible, regardless of how many points the game will give, and ignoring the time the score tally will take. That allows the players to have a fair optimization competition, because the in-game time reflects the completion speed perfectly, and the real time fails at that due to the score tally. The level is still being completed faster and faster.

[p 
	"In this game, as the author admitted, ignoring the score tally doesn't give as much benefit, just a few frames, that can be easily lost if you wait too much. But what's more important, all the opponents that are different in this run are in fact defeated slower than in the
