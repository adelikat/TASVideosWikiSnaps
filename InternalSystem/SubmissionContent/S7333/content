	"Hello, there! This is my third submission and I think it's a good one. It has an interesting enough route, and nobody's done it before, so I might as well. Let me explain one trick used in the run to get out of bounds and skip a ton of stuff so it is less confusing for you. At one point in the run, you will see the game be saved, then exited, then reentered. When you get back in, it has a frame where he is on a different screen but then puts you back where you left. If you pull up the item menu on that frame and take out a skateboard, you can go out of bounds and take a massive shortcut to the space section. Feel free to give me a message if it's a little confusing. Usually, the run starts after the choosing the savegame and ends after the credits appear. Because of the sequence break though, it softlocks you in an endless conversation. Because you still defeat the brickster though, the timer ends when the text appears that says, "Hey Pepper, look what I found! It's a space shuttle piece!" My recording goes until it shows the space shuttle piece. Anyway, I hope this tas amuses you!

It's very close, but I think it still needs a bit of polish before it's acceptable. Apart from what was listed in the post, I found that the OoB movement could be significantly and easily improved with a more direct path. You spend about two seconds here moving around trees that you could simply just skate through, and there are several moments where you get caught up and stop moving while outside of the screen that could have been avoided with a little extra attention paid to movement here.

	"The idea of TASing is that you have the ability to try every possible idea as they come up. Assume that anything is possible and try everything you can think of to confirm or deny that. Simple mistakes such as movement, particularly movement that costs several seconds over the course of an already short run, should not be made.

	"I think another good pass at this could definitely get it accepted, though. Just keep the notes of that post and this judgement: Pay more attention to your movement at all times, test every button when menuing, keep trying things until you've exhausted yourself of all possibilities... And then, heck it, start trying the impossibilities as well until they're all out.

	"Also, I'd like to just correct part of the submission text: This sequence break does result in the ending sequence and credits being played. The softlock happens after the credits, which are skipped in this submission. The credits being skipped is not mentioned in the submission text at all, and as such there is an implication that the sequence break leads directly to the softlock with nothing in-between. For your next submission, please elaborate further on these kinds of things. It's entirely possible that a Judge could have mistakenly rejected this run for failing to complete the game, simply because the submission text misrepresents how it ended.
