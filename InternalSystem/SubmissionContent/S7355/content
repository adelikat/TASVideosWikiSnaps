	"Tiny Toon Adventures is a platforming game where pressing left+right allows you to move much faster then intended. This run is a small improvement in the third boss fight, but also loses frames to RNG and emulation differences in other places. Even though it looks like only a small improvement of only 2 frames, beneath the surface the emulation is much different compared to the original run. In fact nearly all of the edge cases related to DMC timing were found while working with this game. I'm really glad I was able to find enough frames to submit this so a console verified run of it can be published.
