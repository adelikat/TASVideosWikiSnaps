	": This game seems to be an optimization challenge. Since you have improved this movie over your last submission, I'm viewing it as a successful submission. There is something that I want you to consider though...I would suggest spending a lot more time towards studying and experimenting for future improvements, if you plan on submitting again. We are currently experiencing the highest volume in the history of this site and it is taxing on our staff to take repeated submissions so closely together. Please take this into consideration...since the publishers are stretched thin as it is.
