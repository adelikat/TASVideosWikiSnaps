	"The boss fight is split up into cycles where the dragon attacks from 4 different angles. We can only hit the dragon when he's coming from the right side of the screen. We can jump once every 40 frames, which gives us enough time to get 4 hits in before he goes somewhere else. Each cycle takes a painstakingly long 1,103 frames, as well as a further 88 frames when we spawn at first. The dragon has 11 hit points, and 4x3=12, so we can kill him on the 3rd hit of the 3rd cycle. Input ends on frame 3974 when we jump for the 11th and final attack.
