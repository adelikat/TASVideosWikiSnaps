	"We started by branching off an 11 Exit fewest A or B presses TAS that j1h7e7 made (
	[a class=extlink href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS2uZfFdETE rel=nofollow 
		"link here

	"The TASing process was mostly easy, but there were two moments where we got stuck temporarily: Vanilla Dome 2 normal exit (I found it too hard to do, and j1h7e7 was hard-pressed to find time to do it), and Donut Ghost House secret exit (Bruno looked into the viability of using a slope clip here, but forgot to report back to us). Other than that, there were a few moments where we all forgot what the strat for a level was, until one of us had an "epiphany", so to speak, where they remembered.

	"Overall, TASing it was an overall enjoyable experience, though it had its lows.

	"After 5 months of on and off work, we're proud it's finally done (or at least, I am. j1h7e7 has been absent lately and probably doesn't even know it's finished yet).

	"However, the fact that it is over five hours long, is quite dull to watch even with the supercut encode (which already cuts out half of the total rutime), and does not even aim for time means that the movie really has no place on this site as a movie publication. It can certainly find its niche in the Super Mario World community, but not here. As such, rejecting.
