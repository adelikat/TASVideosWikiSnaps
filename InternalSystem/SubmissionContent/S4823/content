[p 
	"Q: How much input was done by each author?
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"A: I did the majority of the input, while Tompa did a few improvements, in particular the beginning of the reactor and a bit in the rancor pit. He didn't want credit though, so it's just me I guess.

[p 
	"Q: Easy Mode is for scrub noobs!
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"A: Fine, do a run in the other difficulty modes and see how much fun you have. Easy Mode is the fastest mode there is, so I chose that.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Q: The last 5 minutes are booooooooooooorinnnnnnnnng
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"A: I like to view the last five minutes as an accumulation of the previous 2 games. This is the final SSW game, so an epic spaceship thingy is perfect for that.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Q: Is this optimized?
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"A: I'd say it's as good as it's going to get for right now. These games are extremely laggy and random, and I did the best I could. Those 138,000 rerecords aren't lying, it's really that difficult to optimize this game.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Second off: The difficulty discussion. Easy was picked here because it would make a faster run through the use of more damage boosts, more tricks and glitches, slightly faster boss fights and shorten some levels. Two such levels are the Speeder Chase, where you have to kill twice as many enemies (20 compared to 10) in Jedi mode before you can finish the level, and the Falcon Shooting Stage, 28 Ties VS 12. Neither one of these make the run more enjoyable or more challenging, it only makes it longer. The
