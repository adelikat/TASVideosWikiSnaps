	"The game takes place in an urban city called Metro City. As the story unfolds, the city's local superhero named Vortex is outnumbered by gangs and killed. With the city's protector murdered, the crime grows rapidly. Soon enough the city's crimelords start fighting over control of the city, until a villain named Sutekh takes control, combining all the gangs into one. With the city completely overrun by Sutekh and the other crimelords, it is soon devoured in crime. A vigilante named Nightshade decides to step up and take the law into his own hands, vowing to rid Metro City of crime.

	"Several improvements have been made; some major, some minor (only garnering a few frames). The really major change is to the route. The rat boss is taken out last now, and i die shortly afterwards to avoid a lot of backtracking. In fact, when compared to the first release, it's about a 1200 frame improvement when death is used as a shortcut (the route from the sewers to the stairs up to the street).

	"The fights are all slightly better, though the Goliath fights still eat up the majority of the movie. I pick up even less items this time so the final rating is 55%.
