	"Tomba! is one of those overlooked games you probably never heard of, and after seeing it, leaves you wondering why you never played it. The main plot is that our hero Tomba is on a quest to find his grandfather's gold bracelet, which was stolen by some evil nasty pigs! Yeah, that is the amazing plot. It's a 2,5D-platformer where you can jump between different depths of the screen! Awesome!!

	"So the game starts! The first quest is to raid the mailbox of the Mansion (Try to remember this mansion, okay?) and then set off to the right! The game freezes almost instantly as Charlie, the monkey, escapes from me. What a little coc... eh, right. I land on the first pig because I have to, and then moves on. The strange way of getting over the green springy thingy is, as ugly as it looks, optimal. Some more talking with the guy with a hat, who must have run around the entire world as he left to the left and appears to the right. Anyway, further on! I had to break the bubbles to get to the platform, and once I get up there I use the Furious Tornado to get rid of the Mist (Yeah, you guys are starting to see where this game is going). I trend past the evil flowers and break the largest egg in the history of mankind, to find a tiny bird, small enough to get stomped by Tomba. I pick it up (Yep, that is how Tomba picks stuff up) and then proceed to the next room where a huge ape is bullying me, then bribes me with me Bananas, and sends me back on the tortoise ._. Not beaten by this, Tomba advances back to the left, further than one can expect, and catches up with Charlie. He's pissed because of the color of my hair, so I give him Bananas. He teaches me an ability which was worth the trip back. Bananas = Animal Dash! Figure out that equation. After getting the most useful ability ever, I progress with the story by breaking more eggs, climbing a mountain, slapping a bird and reaching an old man! He's a 100 years old. That's, really old. The video is unskipable, unfortunately. After puking up the birds and mugging the man, I run away, as fast as I can, and pick up a set of totally gay Charity Wings. I return to the man, hoping that his senility has made him forget that I just stole the key and leap up the rope faster than a slow wind, into the not-so-awesome Dwarf Forest.

	"New location! Awesome. I jump across the bridge because that is the safest way to cross bridges, then I find the first Dwarf. Oh dear, he is talking and I can't understand a word! Sucks. After the first pretty giant Dwarf flees from me, I carefully ambush the second one, jump on him, forces his head into my crotch and learns a few words of Dwarfish (Most likely "GET OFF OF ME!!" and "RAPE!"), a technique which is horrifyingly close to the one I used to learn German a couple of years back. This process is repeated as I cross the entire forest, and I eventually reach the village. Wasn't The Village a lame ass horror movie? Anyway, all of the dwarfs throw you off in a pre-set direction, which sucks. I progress through the village and reach the Dwarf Elder, who I am not allowed to talk to, because I need to rescue all of the dwarfs lost in the forest. I double back across the village and enters the deep forest, where I find dwarfs in balls. Lulz. I touch their balls to rescue them. Giggles. Ok a serious matter here, I do not fully know how the "Escape dwarf getting happy for being saved"-trick works, but I don't do it where it doesn't work. That's as easy as that. I also find a kid far into the forest and picks him up on my back. I find it hilarious that he cries all the time. I pick up the purple, awesomely hot Jumping Pants which increases my running speed by like 1px/frame and sets a different speed pattern while jumping. I go back to the village and leave the kid because I need the space on my back for later. Once again, out into the middle of nowhere, Tomba enters the forest and makes his way through the balls and spikes, and finally into the cabin where there's a... dog? Wait, what? Oh well, I rescue yet another one of them horrible dwarfs and makes it back out. I climb high in the trees and grabs the doggie and then returns to my quest in beating pigs/saving dwarfs. I get some Charity Wings and then saves the final dwarfs and return to the village with my new dog friend. Next up, the Dwarves want to thank me. And I don't like it. This sequence is unskipable, and the text boxes can not be skipped. Even if you remove them as soon as possible, the Dwarf still stands there and blows Tomba's invisible co... uhm, yeah lots of talking and one of them wants to shake my hand. Jeez. I leave the doggie and name him Baron and gets sent out on a quest to find Healing Herbs for him. Awesome. On to the Elder who actually is helpful and gives me a Pig Bag! Holy shit! That is the best gift ever. Anyhose, progress has to be made so I flee from the village and enter the 100 Flower Forest in search for the princess. What? This isn't SMW? Damn.

	"Here, I need to teach an actor to act. Oh yeah! I go and pick up the Happy Mushroom, and then fall and grab a ledge and pull myself up. Doing this disables the otherwise forced laughing sequence for 1 jump. I then glitch myself up (LAUGH AT THE GLITCH) and grab the next ledge and then do the jump to the chest. Breaking it open removes the forced laugh entirely. This was 21 frames faster than taking the laugh, glitching and then normally jumping to the chest. Awesome. I go to the actor Dwarf and LOL him in the face, and then he says "Teach me to cry :<" so I double back and pick up the saddest mushroom at the end of the forest, and with it comes a Healing Mushroom. With great sadness comes great cures! Anywho, back to the actor, cry a bit, make him move, go back, laugh again (This time, the glitch wouldn't have saved time), and move on to the next awesome area.
