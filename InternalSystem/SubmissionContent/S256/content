	"There are also some random factors in the game. I don´t know really how to manipulate them from the start but I figured out how to change them while playing. Most noticable is in the Casino where I have to press on something 8 times to change the outcome of the slot machine. I also had encounters with the mugger, the bum and the hooker. I manipulated them away and you can here some clicking sounds when I do that. Nothing that changes the speed of it, but I didn´t miss any clicks even if it sounds like it ;)
