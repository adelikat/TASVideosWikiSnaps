	""Batman - Return of The Joker" is the sequel of the first Batman game for NES and consists of 13 levels and 5 bosses. This game differs from the first Batman game in many aspects, i.e - they have added a slide movement similar to the one in the Mega Man series, it now also have autoscrolling levels and there are no longer any close combat weapon, just guns. The graphics in the first game is good but here it's even better, could in fact be the best on NES.

	"The game itself does not give you much information about the plot so I'm not sure about it at all. Apparently Joker some how survived the fall in the first game and is back to cause Batman more trouble, that's all I now for sure. This thin plot could perhaps be explained by the fact that the first game was based on the movie with the same name and thus the developers already had their story. This game is not based on a movie and thus they did not bother with a concrete story, perhaps.

However, if you are a very few pixels away from a small gap (not larger than Batman basically) and slide, Batman will just ignore it and be brought safely to the other side of it. This is because Batmans x-coordinate is moved forward as the slide starts and thus skips the pixels where the gap is.
