	"About the game
	$LF
]h2
[p 
	""Batman - Return of The Joker" is the sequel of the first Batman game for NES and consists of 13 levels and 5 bosses. This game differs from the first Batman game in many aspects, i.e - they have added a slide movement similar to the one in the Mega Man series, it now also have autoscrolling levels and there are no longer any close combat weapon, just guns. The graphics in the first game is good but here it's even better, could in fact be the best on NES.

	"Game plot
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The game itself does not give you much information about the plot so I'm not sure about it at all. Apparently Joker some how survived the fall in the first game and is back to cause Batman more trouble, that's all I now for sure. This thin plot could perhaps be explained by the fact that the first game was based on the movie with the same name and thus the developers already had their story. This game is not based on a movie and thus they did not bother with a concrete story, perhaps.

	"Weapons

	"I only use two the weapons for good things, except 6 shots with the normal weapon right at the beginning, so I only explain these.

[p 
	"Each shot fires two bullets which goes in waves through the air. Very powerful, especially in a TAS since you can fire in 30 hz. However there can only be 14 bullets (7 shots) on the screen at the same time so it's most useful when you're close to an enemy.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Fires one big bullet that explodes when it hits a wall or enemy, these exploding pieces can hurt enemies too. Will come in good use at two bosses as you will see.

	"About the run

	"I decided to skip the no damage rule and Batman now takes as much damage as he (or I) want.

[h4 
	" Slide-over-small-gap-glitch:
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"You can't normally walk or slide over gaps, I guess that's why they're there. However, if you are a very few pixels away from a small gap (not larger than Batman basically) and slide, Batman will just ignore it and be brought safely to the other side of it. This is because Batmans x-coordinate is moved forward as the slide starts and thus skips the pixels where the gap is.

[h4 
	" Bounce-after-an-edge-trick
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"If you slide of an edge, hold a-button and the opposit direction your facing, then after some frames hit the other direction - you will do a small bounce and if a platform is not very far away you can save your life. In the run I also included the b-button in this process to turn faster.
