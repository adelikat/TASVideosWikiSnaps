	"Please describe the making of the movie. What was hard? Why would anyone like the result? The movie was pretty tough to make because of the Pizza Eating Contest after every other level, I had to get lucky and restart like 500 times just on the Contest's because I was trying to get the computer to pick 1-3 pizzas at a time.  If he got a 5 or a 6, I would put Pepper or Sauce on his pizza to take away his points.  Very lucky with the 1 pizza turns.
