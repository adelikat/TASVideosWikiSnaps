	"Dragon Quest 5 Tenku no Hanayome (ドラゴンクエスト5天空の花嫁) is one of the most popular games in Japan, though it is not so famous in other countries. In this game, the life of a man is described -- his adventurous childhood, tragic adolescence, joyful marriage and travel to beat the evil with his family. Illustrations designed by Akira Toriyama, who is famous for Dragonball and Chrono Trigger, also make the story so fantastic.

So you must use Patty's Bar. When you remove a person there, the data of the removed character will be replaced by the data of the next person. By the way, seeing the rocks at the Nightmare Towers makes 0x0B's character ID increase by 0x80. So sliding this data to 0x08 character's ID will take you to the ending.
