	"This TAS was made as a direct celebration of the release of libTAS 1.4.3 which now supports ruffle. There are three levels of priorities in optimizing this game. First is the number of shots. With every extra shot, the enemy also gets a turn so we would lose about 30 seconds or more. Second is the manner in which we kill the enemy. We want to knock them into water rather than draining their HP as the latter has a drain animation which is cute and funny but wastes time. Third priority is of course the shots themselves, the angle they take for the fastest travel time etc. I am quite happy with how it turned out and happy to present years of routing in display (including the strat in level 10 that my dad accidentally found when I was a kid).
