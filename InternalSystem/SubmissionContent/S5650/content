I beat the existing non-TAS world record (36:16, not counting all the time not spent by different timing rules for RTA) by over 12 minutes!

[p 
	[em 
		"Sabrina the Teenage Witch: Potion Commotion
	]em
	" was released in 2002. It is based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_the_Teenage_Witch_(TV_series) this sitcom, which is itself based on the Archie Comics spinoff series of the same name (which began in 1962).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In the game's plot, several dramatic things happen with Hilda and Zelda (characters that never show up in gameplay) messing up their spells and making some sort of catastrophe that Sabrina has to fix, each catastrophe defining one of the worlds. There are four worlds in the game, each containing 4 levels and 1 potion minigame at the end. You have to go into each world and collect 4 ingredients to later mix up (in the potion minigame) so that you can cure Hilda or Zelda's mistaken spell and set everything right again. Along the way, you unlock spells (there are 6 total) that help you in future parts of your journey. Salem, a sarcastic talking cat character, is there to help explain things to you along the way. There are animate objects (enemies), which should (according to the plot) be inanimate but aren't because of the erroneous spells you're trying to ultimately fix, along the way that can hurt you if you touch them, but there are obviously ways around that.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There are 3 types of levels in this game. There are 2 regular levels to which I have nothing to say here. There is one autoscroller level.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The fourth level in each world is ALWAYS the handicap level. They give you some handicap, to which you have to find (a) certain key(s) to unlock that handicap and complete the level.

	"For the purposes of this run, I have 3 hearts only. If enough minigames are beaten, however, health can increase, and you can end up having up to 5 hearts AFAIK.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There is no death count in this game. When you "die", you really just teleport back to the beginning of that room, restoring all health and crystal balls. IMO, in casual play, dying is even better than not dying in some cases. There are 2 instances in this game where we use death to save time; once in School 1, and the next in Slicery 4.

[h3 id=Spells
 
	" Spells
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Spells are what were perhaps intended to be the main attraction of kids to this game. Each spell has a unique capability, and they each take up a certain amount of your crystal balls (shown in the HUD in the top center of the screen). In the run, we start out with 10 crystal balls, and we get up to 25 at the end of the run (10, 15, 20, and 25 respectively). The completion of minigames "increases your power", which really means that they let you have more crystal balls. In-level minigames are never completed in the run because they would waste a significant amount of time, but the potion minigames give you 5 extra crystal balls each in the HUD. You can collect crystal balls in the levels if you're running low (which sometimes I had to route for).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Spells can only be used with their respective activators, which are certain objects in the game. If you use a spell without its activator, it's a dud; you get a pineapple instead of a spell. So in that sense, spells are extremely limited.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There are a total of 6 spells in this game, gradually unlocked throughout the game. Each spell is defined by its number, and that number represents how many crystal balls you will use each time you use the spell. What they are and what they do are listed here:
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		" 3 - Unlocked in House 1 (first level) - What I sometimes call "the sleep spell", because Salem describes it as putting an object to sleep. Really what it does is make enemies disappear. They only disappear until you leave the room though; if you come back to that room, they'll reappear.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 4 - Unlocked in House 3 (third level) - The "vine spell". When you use it with a pot, it grows a vine, which you need to use to bounce up to higher locations.

	]li
	[li 
		" 5 - Unlocked in School 1 (fifth level) - The "wall spell". You enter a white, beat-up wall, you can use the spell to make it go away and let you through it.
		$LF

	[li 
		" 6 - Unlocked in School 3 (seventh level) - The "berry spell". It's a batch of berries. You use them as elevators to get to platforms that are otherwise unreachable.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 7 - Unlocked in Tree 1 (ninth level) - The "broom spell"; even though you're not actually using a broom. It's only used to fly (VERY SLOWLY) through some maze-like areas in the game that you simply wouldn't be able to get through otherwise. It is activated only at a spotlight, and you are also forced to fly the entire time until you hit another spotlight.

[p 
	"You might see that the forcefield in the autoscrollers that moves towards you acts as a wall; most of the time. However, when the character is pushed through the forcefield by the wall, this causes them to likely die (start over at the beginning of that room).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The character ONLY dies though if they touch the complete side of the screen even beyond the forcefield. Therefore, a TASer can abuse the forcefield by walking inside of it for entertainment.
	$LF
]p
[h3 id=Ceilingjumpglitch
 
	" Ceiling jump glitch
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This is actually a major glitch, because the use of this glitch saves massive tons of time in several parts of the run, and skips major portions of levels that the developers clearly didn't want you to skip at all. Keep in mind that there are not a whole lot of platforms with ceilings in the game. In fact, most floored platforms do not have adjacent ceilings. Do not get confused by this when watching.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"So how does it work? Why does it happen? Well, whenever you start falling from the edge of something, there are 3 frames when you're still running, even though you're getting off that platform, before you actually start falling. Because you're still running while you're falling during these 3 frames, you can therefore jump during that fall.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"So what does this have to do with ceilings? Well, every time you hit a ceiling from below (and are moving; it USUALLY doesn't work when you hit it while still), you start this SAME falling sequence, which allows you to use those 3-ish frames to jump while under the ceiling.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Now that alone allows you to jump while UNDER the ceiling, which I do in the run sometimes too, but what about when I use the ceiling to jump again beside it, making me able to jump twice the normal height because of it? Well, that's simple. You just jump away from the corner.
	$LF

	"Why the game developers allowed any of this to happen I don't know, but THANK you developers for this glitch which in all saves a massive amount of time for a TAS.

[h3 id=Jumpingforfinalitems
 
	" Jumping for final items
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"I never really figured out why, but just running up to a final item and activating the animation is slower than jumping at certain times before collecting it. I suppose this may be that the jumps after collecting items are slightly faster than running? I'm not even sure. I couldn't tell any difference, but the frames speak for themselves.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Please note that jumping for final items, in many cases, believe it or not, can also be used as landing skips (see below) beyond just their general speed timesave. They can also be used to jump in a manner that avoids extremely awkward jumps and falls through stuff, such as how I did it in House 2 (that was also a landing skip).

	" Ladder usage to save time
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Sometimes it may be unclear to the viewer why I go out of my way to grab ladders in some cases. This is because grabbing a ladder and immediately jumping from it in a direction, in TASing terms, is slightly faster than just jumping and skipping past the ladder. This is because you teleport from the side to the center when getting on the ladder for that frame.

[h3 id=Landingskip
 
	" Landing skip
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Every time you land from any jump or fall it wastes a few frames. There are several ways to avoid time wastes from landing in only certain situations, which, in each case, can save just a few frames.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"One common way I do this is, if there are two enemies needed to be jumped that are very close to one another, I jump one enemy and use the 3 spell after landing from that first jump to save 1 frame, rather than having to do the second jump and have another landing. Other common ways to skip landings include hitting Salem's text before landing, activating any spell you would not need to move for before landing, or going into a door before the landing animation.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Certain landing skips are so insignificant (the 1-frame ones especially) that sometimes they don't EVEN save time. If you look hard enough you'll notice that in some parts of the run I don't even use them, because in those instances that frame may not count for anything overall for whatever reason. However, sometimes I even go as far as to take damage just to save 1 frame. Pffft, I love that!

[p 
	"In general, if taking damage is necessary (which it is in a lot of the run), you'll notice that I jump or am in midair every time such damage is taken. This is because if you take damage while on the ground, there is a REALLY long knockdown sequence that occurs, which you never see in the run, but I'm just telling you; it's there!

[h3 id=TurboBglitch/extendedrun-fallglitch
 
	" Turbo B glitch/extended run-fall glitch
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This is a MAJOR GLITCH too in that it allows you to extend the amount of time you run/walk while falling, thus allowing you to jump in midair while falling for any amount of frames. This glitch isn't really all that useful throughout most levels of the game, other than for entertainment, EXCEPT for in Slicery 4 (the last level). It's kind of surprising to me that such a major glitch really only has usage potential in one level, but it's better than nothing I guess. :P Slicery 4 is so badly broken; it's a perfect ending to this game! I found this glitch after just turboing the B button when bored, and was like HOLY SHIT when I saw what it could do.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"So how does it work? Why does it happen? Well, whenever you start falling from the edge of something, there are 3 frames when you're still running, even though you're getting off that platform, before you actually start falling. Because you're still running while you're falling during these 3 frames, you can therefore jump during that fall.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"To extend on that, if you're running in midair before falling, when you let go of B (thus start walking), then hold B again to start running, the 3 frames reset themselves because you started walking. Because of this, in Slicery 4, I tend to run for 3 frames then walk for 1 frame, since that's the fastest method of doing it. In other situations when the horizontal speed doesn't really matter, I just turboed the B button.

]h3
[p 
	"This is a minor glitch that can be done in many different ways depending on the situation (the specific methods will be mentioned in the stage-by-stage commentary). When either the last paper for a spell or the ingredient is collected, then a victory animation USUALLY plays, which saves some time if that animation is skipped in most cases. All animation skips involve for the player to be in midair while collecting the item; when the player hits the ground (assuming it can't be skipped), the animation plays. The animation will definitely play if you just walk up to it, which I don't ever do in this TAS as it wastes time (see Jumping for final items).

Most of the splash screens and stuff can just be skipped by pressing A through the lag frames.

This is probably because the developers very specifically wanted those patterns to stay there. If the patterns broke in this case, a glitch would happen where the player may never get back up if they accidentally fell down from the elevators after that. The absence of this trick is a rare case, though, so I thought I should mention it.
