	(__wikiLink|href=/7561S|implicitdisplaytext=7561S)

		" 39 frames (f) saved by bouncing off a ghost in the garden and collecting a $500 bill instead of collecting the one in Pugsley's room. It should be noted that the route taken in Pugsley's room in the previous submission was nonoptimal. Grabbing the $500 bill in the garden is still 14f faster than the optimal solution in Pugsley's room.

		" 6f saved in the red bone room by adding an additional jump on the lower bone platforms, which triggered additional movement of the bone platform above (it only moves when on screen)

	[li 
		" 1f saved in the red bone room from triggering the death earlier. This was an oversight in the previous submission.

	[li 
		" 6f saved in the blue bone room from the same additional jump as in the red bone room
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 2f saved on the first visit in the Hallway. Due to route changes during the making of the previous TAS, the first frame of movement was at some point right. This stuck and was never corrected, even though the route since several iterations back has been to go left on the first visit in the Hallway.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 1f lost in the screen transition to outside the tree. Lag frames during screen transitions can generally be minimized by adding e.g. a small jump before them (seemingly random jumps shortly before some of the room transitions in the movie are most of the time done for this reason). But I've battled with this particular transition in previous (non-published) iterations of this TAS without success. Same this time. None of the time-neutral actions I played around with before this transition made any difference.

	[li 
		" 1f saved from jumping on different branches up to the tree entrance.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 1f lost inside the tree. Because of the frame saved outside the tree, I had one additional frame of invulnerability, which meant starting to take damage one frame later. I didn't find a way to make up for this and had to wait an additional frame to take an additional damage.

	[li 
		" 1f from squeezing out a frame from the screen transition from the hallway to the kitchen. This was an oversight in the previous submission.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" 1f saved in the kitchen by using the one frame time window for movement between the screen transition and the splash screen appearing. The previous submission had misaligned inputs and therefore did not use the available frame for movement.
