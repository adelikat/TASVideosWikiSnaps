	"I'm unsatisfied that the arrow zipping dosen't work.Only great work are boss refight skip and arrow screen scrolling.Seems the hack's author fixed the arrow zipping wall cilp.Second,the hack level's layout is pretty complex and too much detour way.In the life bar perspective,each robot's damage is 3,excpet crystal man.Crystal man's damage is 4 as you pick dragon kick(aka charge kick).I pick the gradius shield when you reached the robot battle.That can get 1 hit early.One of difficult is crystal man's fighting pattern.You can't do that in the mid-air with dragon kick,only one way just wait him down and hit him.
