	"This level is one of the easiest and forgiving stages in Karnov.  They offer multiple Shoes and have many random triggers for drops.  I activate a hidden trigger to get the first Shoes possible which lasts to the very end.  In this level you can also see two glitches used in almost every level, the L+R bug that causes fast fall, and using the Shoes immediately after jumping to get double the jump height after use.  A bomb is not necessary until the final level to bust open a shortcut.  Ladders however get quite a bit of use throughout the run. Picking up a second Shoes for the next level as well is a pattern repeated as much as possible since the Shoes double your speed.  At the end of the level it is often necessary to dodge the shots from the boss or enemies for a short time since you are vulnerable and liable to die even after beating the boss.

The bottom path has this arena with bats that locks you in until you kill them all and that wastes time.  To take the upper path here I build a tower by breaking pieces of these large tower like enemies.  At the end of the stage the Shoes runs out, but using the Shoes would prevent its use in the following level.

However finding and using the double jump height glitch with the Shoes allows Karnov to jump onto the log and gives me some room to work in the following section.  I jump again on the last pixel possible to just make the Diving Helmet pickup.  After that is an odd portion where I need to use a Ladder to get the Shoes and while ascending hit a hidden trigger at a specific time so it turns into a Boomerang.  Over the next area the path forks with a hidden underground path and an upper path. The upper path has a Shoes and Fireball pickup that can be gotten quickly with the double jump height bug.  Without that bug the bottom path is faster. The Boomerang pickup can be retrieved again if you catch it after using it so I activate it before picking up a hidden Boomerang.

	"There is a T-Rex and they have high health alongside some very punishing mechanics where they will punish you for hitting them by retaliating with a semi-homing fireball each time you hit them.  The Boomerang is by far the best weapon to kill them.  However, the real boss is Ghidra right behind the T-Rex and if they are allowed to get off shots near you it is mostly impossible to recover due to the shots exploding like shrapnel. However, Boomerangs are also the best option for all bosses and Ghidra is no exception. This is one of the only stages where the falling map piece is picked up without walking needed after the pause while it is falling.

Also an odd thing I noticed is that I think the enemy is bugged in this level since it did not seem able to harm Karnov, but it can in Stage 8.

	"Using the jump height bug with the Shoes allows quick procurement of an additional pair of Shoes and another Fireball.  Notice that using a Fireball right before getting another pickup still gives 30 shots, but we can then use the new pickup on a different level.  The volcano section is a little tricky since it requires waiting and only tends to go off when you get near. After that the path forks in three directions, up, middle, and down.  The upper portion requires Wings but those are only walking speed and the items up there do not justify the time loss.  The middle path might have been faster if there was a faster way to get a Mask, but it ends up being slightly slower than the down path. The down path has a section that allows use for a Trolley which it is too slow to get, and in addition using the Shoes and simply running down the sloping path doubles the speed of the Shoes even for 4 pixels per frame which makes beating the down path even more difficult.  The boss is a scorpion woman that becomes vulnerable when on the ground and Fireballs finish her quickly.

	"The main route here is to make sure to keep up speed and slowdown management.  The seaweed for whatever reason have these shots that actually are destroy-able and I think those are what cause 99% of the slowdown on the level. Timing the level, I was able to shave off nearly five whole seconds on this already short stage by removing the slowdown.  The Diving Helmet is like the Shoes and it gives you 2x speed in water.  The Shoes are not usable in the water and its effect is not either. Halfway I take the upper path to get another Shoes and another Diving Helmet.  This path avoids the down path which while offering several potentially excellent items and a random hidden item there is a lot of lag.  Note that jumping up is faster than using a Ladder even with the Shoes.  The bosses at the end are two T-Rexes and without the Boomerang this is almost a showstopper in casual play due to how aggressive their counter homing hits alongside the birds diving at you from above.

	"This scene playing normally is insane without the right items.  The main problem is there is this tower you need to climb, but at each step the boss of stage 1 appears and will start bouncing after you the entire stage.  By the time you reach the top of the tower you have around 6 or 7 bosses bouncing after you.  The two intended ways to deal with this is to get one of the three hidden Wing items or get a Bomb and use it to bomb the bottom of the tower which avoids climbing it. Alternatively you could use Shoes and climb for your life, and then use a Wing at the top to then fly right and down. Note that that location is only one of three spots in the game you can use the Wing.  Here I use the double height jump bug and bypass several levels of the tower, climb to the top and then jump right.

The trick here is to try and get past them quickly which was easier said than done.  Going this route allows us to hit a hidden trigger to get a Fireball item used to great effect in the following level.  After that there are two scorpion women bosses which go down quickly enough.

	"The pyramid stage really benefits from having the Fireballs right from the start since there are long streams of bandits and multiple towers. The pyramid has three entrances, the bottom and middle both have a door, and the top has an entrance you can fall down through but all lead to the same place.  The Pharoah's room has a Ghidra you need to kill that triggers a piece of the floor to open up.  Interestingly you can use a ladder and go up on a ledge and have a mummy appear that I guess is the Pharoah.  Would be nice to know if there is some benefit for that to happen though.  For the hole that appears here I use the unusual characteristic of the L+R fall bug to fall fast, but where the jump according to the game is still happening so after I let go of L+R the rest of the jump happens.  This residual jump is enough to bypass the T-Rex below.  There are some steps afterward with some boulder traps and there is just enough of the Shoes left to get past the last trap instead of having to wait.  Then use a couple Fireballs to the face of the boss Ghidra and the scene is done.  This scene is pretty notable for being nearly barren as far as items go with only some normal shot powerups and a Fireball item right at the boss.

	"Final Scene is long so here I get the Shoes right above then take a death. Upon restart I keep all the items in addition to the new Shoes.  Using the double jump height bug I get the other Shoes. The Shoes are used later in the scene, and that extra speed ends up being about a second and half faster overall.  There are some floating demons at the start which are manipulated or killed to get out of the way to get to the ladder quickly.  On the second floor moving right immediately is faster even though there are two of the scene one bosses.  While it is possible to skip one of them by jumping once you exit the ladder it is a bit slower.  After escaping up the ladder there is an obstacle course of the stone men.  Liberal use of the L+R fast fall and Fireballs clears a path. After clearing the next gap jumping up is faster than using the ladder here.  There is a shortcut wall which opens with a Bomb and it saves a significant amount of time. Using the jump height bug again with the Shoes a ladder is skipped.  At the end of the walkway there is a hidden entrance into the final boss once you touch the ground right before the area next to where the hidden door opens.  Once you enter halfway into the area all powerups and effects are removed.  Wait a bit for the first attack to finish and then point blank use the pellet attacks and he is finished. Want to finish on the closest to the last possible input right before he dies.  No sniping and waiting for things to end.

	"Note: The final boss can be hit with the Boomerang early if you jump up and use it at the right spot, but far from insuring a fast kill it instead underflows the boss health. Thankfully for the casual player this is not a fatal mistake since once he teleports his health goes back to the normal 10 instead of near 250 health.   What I mean by underflow is that his health will dip below 0 and then start counting down from the new value. So the boomerang does 16 health from his 10, and instead of ending up dead, he is instead alive with 250 health.  Although the boomerang can hit multiple times it is not enough to bring him to 0 and unknown whether that would even "properly" kill him at that point. So we have to wait for him to teleport and take him down the normal way.

	"Note: There is a clip glitch possible here right outside the hidden door if you use L+R right on the vertical ledge right before the door. This clips you through the floor, but is detrimental.
