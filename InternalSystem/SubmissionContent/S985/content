	"At stage 3, since this is the longest stage, it's where I've gain the most time. I skipped 1 Chin. FODA had suggested me to skip 2 Chin but it is better to skip only one. But thanks to him for the idea. It's here that I started to use combo of one punch and 2 kicks against Chin's and Abobo's to have more points as well as to be faster. I've used knives more wisely compared to my precedent run. Obtain better randomness for stalagtites (Not much better but still).

	"Apparently, there's some randomness for moving platform. I have tested many things and wasn't able to get what I, luckily, made in my precedent run. So I've lost ~0.5 seconds there. The main problem, the only way to manipulate them also change randomness for stalagtites. It will require days and days of testing.
