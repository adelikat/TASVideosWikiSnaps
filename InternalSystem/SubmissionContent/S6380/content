		"The Mysterious Murasame Castle
	]em
	", also known as its original Japanese release title 
	[em 
		"Nazo no Murasamejou
	]em
	", is a Famicom Disk System game developed by Nintendo EAD and published in 1986, only two months after 
	[em 
		"The Legend of Zelda
	]em
	" which it bears some similarities to. Unlike that game, however, Murasame originally only was released in Japan and did not spawn any further games or a franchise. The game has seen some re-releases over time, including being released in the West in 2014 for the 3DS Virtual Console, and Takamaru has been making cameo appearances in a few other games, including multiple 
	[em 
		"Super Smash Bros.
	]em
	" games.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Gameplay is comparable to that of The Legend of Zelda, with Takamaru being controlled from an overhead perspective, traversing through screens, slicing through enemies, and shooting projectiles. Compared to Zelda, Murasame is focused more on action than on exploring - stages are traversed in a linear progression, and while the environments contain some variety in branches, routes, and general maze-like structure (as well as tons of hidden secrets and power-ups), they too have linear progression towards the exit (or boss) as a goal. The action is also notably faster paced and more challenging.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There are five locations visited in the game - these are, in order, Aosame Castle, Akasame Castle, Ryokusame Castle, Momosame Castle, and finally Murasame Castle. Each of the first four areas is divided into a town segment and a castle segment, while Murasame only consists of a castle segment. The town segments simply require Takamaru to reach the end screen, while the castle segments end on a bossfight against the castle lord (or alien inside Murasame castle).

[p 
	"The story takes place in Edo period Japan. The titular Murasame Castle is taken over by a mysterious alien creature, who extends its power to four other neighboring castles. The daimyō lords of each castle are each given an evil sphere of power, and they use this power to summon armies of ninja and monsters to terrorize the nearby villages. Shōgun Tokugawa Ietsuna sends out samurai apprentice Takamaru to investigate the castles, defeat each castle lord along the way, and stop the aliens.
