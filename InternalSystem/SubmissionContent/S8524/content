	"Unlike what theenglishman thought 13 years ago, you can manipulate the first 2 tiles that you get at the beginning of every level. You just have to do it in the gameplay portion of the previous level, as waiting before the level transition while "Win!" is displayed does nothing to the RNG. Same goes for waiting on the pause screen or in the main menu.

	"The rules that determine when power-ups spawn (the wild card and the exploding rock) are still unknown. These special balls are also incredibly rare. Therefore, the only time I really got some in this TAS where in level 42 (a level where it's required to get one, and was only completed after banging my head against a wall for multiple hours), and whenever I happened to get one for free. A deeper understanding of the RNG function to force these tiles to show up on demand would certainly save lot of time (probably around 10-30 seconds), most notably in the levels 36 and 47, where clearing skulls would remove the need to do unnecessary shots to lower the ceiling.

	"Speedrun.com failed to show me all of the game modes. Because of that, I originally thought that the branch name was "loosely" used. So I checked the submission, by 
	[a class=intlink href=/Users/Profile/theenglishman

	", where I loaded up this old VBA emulator to find out how "Time Attack" came into the picture. Basically...that submission is one of 4 game types, found in the options menu:

[div class=p
