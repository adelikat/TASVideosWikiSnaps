	"Well, I decided to try TASing GB games with BizHawk, and since the ones I wanted to TAS aren't fully supported, I chose a relatively obscure Sailor Moon game to TAS!

	"Jumping gives you like a 4 pixel boost everytime you do so. And sometimes, especially at the first 2 stages, adding a frame of delay before the 3rd jump or so boost you by 1 pixel. Why? I don't know.

	"A simple glitch that allows you to hover indefinitely simply by crouching near the edge of a moving platform. Completely useless and the only reason I used it was to ease off the boredom during the waiting times.

	"There's two modes in this game; a story mode where you walk around and do shit before you get to jump right to win, and a "platform-only" mode which focuses only on the platformer stages without any of the drawn out walking. Now why the heck didn't I chose the story mode? Well, it's not because it's way longer, no. It's because I can't read japanese and got stuck in the 2nd stage for 2 freaking hours walking back and forth talking to everyone I can yet still don't know what to do. So...on with the TAS!
