	"There's two modes in this game; a story mode where you walk around and do shit before you get to jump right to win, and a "platform-only" mode which focuses only on the platformer stages without any of the drawn out walking. Now why the heck didn't I chose the story mode? Well, it's not because it's way longer, no. It's because I can't read japanese and got stuck in the 2nd stage for 2 freaking hours walking back and forth talking to everyone I can yet still don't know what to do. So...on with the TAS!
