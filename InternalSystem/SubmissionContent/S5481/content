	"Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time is the second of five games in the Mario & Luigi RPG series. Mario & Luigi work together with their past selves to exterminate the Shroob aliens. The M&L series is known for the ability to do more damage in battle by hitting action commands as well as the ability to dodge or counterattack every attack in the game, which makes it possible, though difficult in real time, to beat the final boss at an arbitrarily low level. Partners in Time is unique among the other games in the series in that there is no mana; instead, all special attacks are consumable items.

	"Boss battles are definitely the highlights of this run. This section will explain non-obvious aspects of the battle system. Action commands and attack dodging are perfect, except for when I manipulate a lucky hit. Every normal and special attack has a chance to be a lucky hit, which does double damage. The probability depends on the attacker's STACHE and the enemy's level, but is usually 3% in this run. Lucky hits should not be confused with critical hits. Some enemies are weak to fire or ice, and if they are attacked with the element they are weak to, it will be a critical hit. Bro flowers and mix flowers do fire damage, and ice flowers do ice damage. Critical hits also do double damage, but if an attack is both lucky and critical, it will do triple damage. For this reason as well as others explained later, bro flowers and ice flowers are heavily abused in this run, and they will be collectively referred to as flowers, not to be confused with mix flowers or copy flowers. Also, the projectiles thrown during a flower will be always referred to as fireballs.

The bro with the big fireball throws big fireballs and the bro with the small fireballs. Big fireballs hit an enemy and do damage. Small fireballs don't hit an enemy and instead decrease the length of the attack by 20 frames when thrown. By default, the attack ends after about 600 frames or when the boss (or all of the enemies) dies. The bro with the big fireball begins by automatically throwing a fireball. Then, each bro must wait 7 frames before throwing a fireball. It takes 9 frames to pass on the fireball, or 10 if adult Luigi is passing it on. The adults can throw up to 74 fireballs and the babies can throw 75. If the target is in the air, each bro must wait 8 frames between fireballs, so only 65 fireballs can be thrown.

This means I throw fewer fireballs, doing less damage.

[div class=p 
	"The game decides whether a flower will be a lucky hit when the attack starts. It is easy to manipulate RNG during a flower since RNG advances every frame. For example, simply waiting one extra frame before throwing the final fireball will allow the RNG to advance one more time during the attack. It is much more difficult to make the first flower in a battle a lucky hit since the only ways to manipulate the RNG are waiting to get a different seed, getting hit by an attack, and watching a demo. This is why, in a few battles, the first flower is not a lucky hit but the others are. It takes 60 frames to wait for the next seed, so this is avoided as much as possible. Getting hit is usually pretty fast, but only advances RNG once and usually I can't take a hit since it would be deadly. Demo RNG advancement, however, is faster and can be done as many times as needed. In the bro item menu, I put the cursor on a flower, then on the same frame that RNG advances, I cancel the demo (either by exiting the bro item menu or moving the cursor) and then restart the demo.

However, this means gets an extra attack, since he has more speed than both adults. When he has under 450 HP, his attacks are very time-consuming. So, I again start the battle with an ice flower to decrease his speed from 34 to 23.8. Mario has 24 speed, so the turn order is now Mario, Brat, Luigi. Since the battle ends with Mario, this skips one long attack. I can skip the first long attack by having both adults die at once. When all the bros leave the screen the attack ends.

	"In the room to the left of the first area in Shroob Castle, the rightmost pipe leads to the third floor, almost at the final boss. However, it is inaccessible until you enter the corresponding pipe on the third floor. If it were possible to enter the pipe right after getting past the gate, almost all of Shroob Castle could be skipped. Additionally, if this and gate skip were possible without baby spin or baby cakes, Gritzy Desert and Gritzy Caves could be entirely skipped, bringing the TAS time down to about 2 hours.

However, there is a gate that blocks progress and can only be opened from the other side. If there was a way past the gate, all of Thwomp Volcano and most of Toad Town could be skipped, saving about 30 minutes. This would only be useful without gate skip.

	"It may be possible to skip the one or more encounters in Gritzy Caves and Thwomp Volcano that are used to put the adults in dire status. This would require taking damage from Petey Piranha, Mrs. Thwomp, or Bowser that would put the bros. at low health but not kill them. This is difficult since at a low level, the bros. defense is low and they die from most attacks.

	"It also may be faster to skip the adults' level ups after Commander Shroob and/or Elder Shrooboid by having them die and having the babies finish the battle.
