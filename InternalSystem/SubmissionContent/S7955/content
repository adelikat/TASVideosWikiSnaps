	"Barry Biceps is competing to be the arm wrestling world champion in the 2022 NES homebrew The Arm Wrestling Classic. To reach the top spot he must beat many contestants throughout the tournament by mashing the button displayed on the board in the background at superhuman speeds. Barry breezes through the competition and easily becomes the world champion in a mere 8 minutes.

	"The game features 17 (if I'm counting correctly) fights that increase in difficulty the further into the game you are. As a TAS, they are pretty much just 17 identical fights that involve pressing a single button a variable amount of times. To make TASing not so simple, there is almost always one lag frame after each button press after the button's been pressed seven times. I say 'almost always' because sometimes there can be two or none or some other amount and while it's not difficult to get around, it's just an annoying inconvenience. After every few fights, Barry is pulled into the training room to strengthen his right arm and these workouts are much simpler to TAS. The first Up press happens 17 frames after the Down press but that is shortened to 16 afterwards for the rest of the session. It's obviously faster to complete these than wait for the timer to run out. The following fight is relatively quick with Barry's even stronger arm.

	"Each fight ends in  400 frames of victory laps where the player can collect as many money bags as they possibly can. These money bags only increase the score and don't actually have any benefits. I could have collected a certain amount of bags so the score ended up being 42000 because 420 harhar but that'd probably mean a lot more standing around not making annoyingly loud and repetitive bleeps and I'd rather make it visually 'entertaining'.

	"You'll also notice, particularly in the Moe Hawk fight, that we lose two portions of the bar at the start. There doesn't seem to be any RNG involved so we can't really speed up any fights other than mash as quickly as possible.
