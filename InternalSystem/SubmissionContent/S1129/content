	"Every enemy entering the screen is random. The spot where it enters, and the frame you are able to hit it are determined by the frame you complete the scrolling of the screen, and the frame the last enemy died (there can three foots at most on screen). I constantly had to try lots of situations in killing enemies at different times, and intentionally waiting frames when scrolling the screen. This process was very frustrating! Since I knew more about luck manipulation, I was able to get better bossfights as well this time. The snow level boss might still look a bit random, but even this fight follows a certain pattern if you watch closely.

	"I use these (and maybe a few other less important ones) to move around the screen with high speeds, which greatly helped making the movie. It might even look easy, but this isn't true. You are still limited in what direction you can zip, and you can also zip twice if you want to to a A+B attack with it. Every screen was like a puzzle that needed to be solved, to get the best randomness, and the killing the enemies as fast as possible. The glitches were also used to create some cool effects. It enables you stuff like moving from the left side of the screen to the right side and other things. Too much to explain everything, just try around with it a little yourself!

I tried to make those moments as well as the moments where I actually fight to look as interesting as possible, without doing the same things over and over.
