	"For a long time, nobody had taken it upon themselves to timeattack a Sonic game. Then came Sprint, doing Sonic 3 & Knuckles. Then came Xebra, who started doing Sonic 1 but got sick of it and gave up. Sonic 2 got a similar treatment from Hero Chaos Chao. After several exceptionally poor quality Sonic 2 speed run submissions (ranging between 30 and 40 minutes long), I decided that my first timeattack would be of this game.
