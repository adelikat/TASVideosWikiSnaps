	""Boss battles" are defined as all battles that doesn't use the standard trainer or Galactic grunt theme. To be exact, boss battles include 6 rival fights, 8 gym leader fights, 6 Galactic commander fights, 2 Cyrus fights, 2 Palmer fights, Elite 4 fights, and the Cynthia fight.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Note: There is a harder version of the sixth rival fight that is unlocked after entering Hall of Fame 20 times. Given the fact that the fight is exactly the same other than the rival's team being at slightly higher levels and it takes about 100 minutes to enter Hall of Fame 20 times even from the void, I decided to only to the normal version of the rival battle in Fight Area.

	$LF

	"A History of This Run
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Everything started in early 2016 when I decided to make an "all bosses, maximum legendary" run after seeing a few videos showing how to catch Giratina, Darkrai, and Shaymin from
	$LF
	"the void in English Diamond/Pearl. However, 
	[a class=extlink href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPFHL8xPZ8k rel=nofollow 
		"after catching Giratina
	]a
	", I realized that it takes hours to reach Darkrai and Shaymin. I thought
	$LF
	"about redoing the run on early Japanese release, but I worried that it would make the watchability of the run much lower for most audience, and the fact that lua scripts only
	$LF
	"support English roms also made it harder for me to make a run on a Japan rom. Eventually, I set the project aside.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The time moves on to early 2017. A way to catch Arceus was found, and more importantly, 
	[a class=extlink href=https://forums.glitchcity.info/index.php?topic=7845.0 rel=nofollow 
		"a much faster way to catch Shaymin and Darkrai in non Japanese D/P was found.
	]a
	" These great 
	$LF
	"discoveries reminded me of my D/P completionist run. Many months later, while working on "no save/reset" and "glitchless" runs, I decided to give this project another shot.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Unfortunately, soon I learned that it's impossible to encounter Heatran whatsoever without getting Nationaldex. This means that I would have to acquire Nationaldex in order to 
	$LF
	"meet the "maximum legendary". That would make the run much longer than I hoped it to be. After thinking it through, I decided to abolish the goal of catching all 
	$LF
	"available legendaries. While catching Darkrai, Shaymin, and Arceus in a speedrun can be interesting for sure, repeatedly watching a bunch of legendaries getting caught after biking in the void 
	$LF
	"would get old really quick anyway. It was obvious that there has been a much better understanding of how the void works compared to a few years ago, but I didn't know much about the details. That's when I decided 
	$LF
	"to ask for help from Hall of Origin. Lucky for me, aera enthusiastically agreed to help on routing. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"And the run you see here right now is the end result.
	$LF

[h3 
	" The Team
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Chimchar/Monferno, Fearow, and Azelf are used as the main battle Pokemon at different points in the run. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Fearow is used for the middle section of the run because it's over leveled and can learn Fly; its type machup is also decent against most opponents it faces. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Azelf is used for the later portion of the run because it has very high Spe. Atk. and Speed base stats and good move pool. These traits are especially important for the fights in Battle Tower.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Oh, and Palkia is caught to be the Surf slave, a suitable role for the master of space and dimensions. :)

	" Void Trip 1 - Flagging locations and warping to Galactic HQ
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"I enter the void for the first time in Oreburgh City. I warp to the black Sinnoh to flag the locations that only require a visit to the corresponding map for Fly usage. The map of Pokemon League 
	$LF
	"entrance is visited after leaving black Sinnoh to flag Pokemon League. There are random grasspatches on certain black Sinnoh locations that can trigger wild encounters normally available 
	$LF
	"to the corresponding location. I caught a Lv. 51 Fearow with a Sharp Beak on black Route 225 for Fly and the upcoming fights. It has a good enough Speed IV and +Speed nature 
	$LF
	"so that it can outspeed all enemies it needs to fight. After all of these, I warp into the walkway to the Lake Trio room in Galactic HQ.

	" Galactic HQ and Veilstone City

	" Void Trip 2 - Onto Spear Pillar
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"TBH, entering the void from Veilstone City might be slightly slower than doing it from Jubilife City or Oreburgh City, but I decide to use a different entrance for each void trip 
	$LF
	"to show something different each time. The time difference is trivial. The goal of this trip to the void is Spear Pillar.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Spear Pillar
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"For some reasons, the summon ceremony won't happen until the two grunts are defeated, so the entire sequence has to be done (almost) normally. The Galactic Commander double battle 
	$LF
	"and Cyrus 2 fight take place. After catching Palkia, I use the Escape Rope I bought earlier and fly to Pastoria City.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Pastoria City and Lake Valor
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"After reaching Pastoria City, I immediately leave from the east to get to Lake Valor. Because the events in Spear Pillar already happened, the lake is back to normal and Azelf is 
	$LF
	"in the cavern... while Saturn is still there. Azelf, the main fighter for the rest of the run, is manipulated to have a 30 Spe. Atk. IV, a + Spe. Atk. nature, and a decent Speed IV. After finishing Saturn 1, I get the TM 
	$LF
	"for Thunder, teach Thunder and Grass Knot to Azelf, give it Wise Glasses, and fly back to Pastoria City.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Inside the void, I enter the Palpark map to activate the Palpark menu and enter Volkner's room to fight him via RETIRE. After the fight, I go to the Palpark map again to switch 
	$LF
	"back to the normal menu. Doing so warps me to the actual Palpark entrance on Route 221. Then I fly to Fight Area.

[h4 
	" Fight Area
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Normally, the rival can be battled here during weekends after finishing the quest at Stark Mountain. However, because I entered the map toward the east end while in black Sinnoh, the conversation 
	$LF
	"between the rival and Buck is finished on black Route 230. For some reasons, this makes the rival stuck at the dock, which means I can challenge him once per day anytime I want! 
	$LF
	"The in game time is set on Sunday anyway, but this saves the effort of doing the Heatran quest. That being said, I take the ship to Snowpoint City after doing the Rival 6 fight.

	"I couldn't find a way to effectively manipulate the trainers and Pokemon that appear in the tower, but luckily, most of them can be OHKO (after Azelf uses Nasty Plot, at least), unless their abilities make it impossible to launch critical hits or their carried Focus Sash (or Sturdy) make it impossible to OHKO them whatsoever. 
	$LF
	"Another noteworthy thing is that many trainers in the tower have much better AI than anyone outside of the tower. Many of them would actually only use the most effective move against my Pokemon. There are a few critical moments when a faster opponent can almost KO Azelf. 
	$LF
	"49 trainers are fought in total because that's the minimum requirement to do both Palmer battles.
