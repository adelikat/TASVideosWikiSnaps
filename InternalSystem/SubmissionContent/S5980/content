	"And rejecting for consistent sloppiness throughout all these improvements. I've found way too many improvements and things unaccounted for by the author within minutes of doing research for this to be acceptable. We do not like to have a large number of marginal improvements shortly after being submitted and have none of them be acceptable. He has not studied the PCE version TAS, which although it has different stages, has near identical mechanics. Please interact more with other people in regards to games you are working on and upload your work to userfiles prior to submitting. I hope you continue to TAS, but spend a little more time on your work, thank you.
