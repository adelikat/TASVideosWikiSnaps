	"There aren't that many game mechanics that you can abuse.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The main one that I abuse is air rolling, which allows you to move at the same velocity as walking on the ground, but you can dodge enemies this way.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"You also want to land after jumps as little as possible, as when you land, for a few frames your velocity is reduced.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"If you combine the flower bug with air rolling, you can have a consistent velocity of 7, even when you bounce off enemies.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Comparing that to when you get the invincibility "meat", you have a velocity of 6 and your normal movement is 4 and 3 underwater.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The last "bug" that I abuse is on the tank boss, where you can keep attacking him with a 1 frame gap, which makes that battle very short.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There are a few places where I hit the head on the floor, causing a few frame loss. Many of them are just because that is the fastest route, but some could probably be avoided.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I have abused damage boosting only on 1-1, 2-3, 4-1, 5-1, Waterfall, 4th boss (to get on his head) and final boss. The rest of the places where I take damage are on purpose because they are the fastest way through.

	"And rejecting for consistent sloppiness throughout all these improvements. I've found way too many improvements and things unaccounted for by the author within minutes of doing research for this to be acceptable. We do not like to have a large number of marginal improvements shortly after being submitted and have none of them be acceptable. He has not studied the PCE version TAS, which although it has different stages, has near identical mechanics. Please interact more with other people in regards to games you are working on and upload your work to userfiles prior to submitting. I hope you continue to TAS, but spend a little more time on your work, thank you.
