	"Bloons was the first game in the Bloons series that was created and released by Kaiparasoft (Now known as NinjaKiwi) in 2006. This would later turn into the now very successful game series Bloons Tower Defense (which is a series I've been following for over 10 years!). The original Bloons Flash game has a few versions from what I understand. The version featured in BlueMaxima's Flashpoint Flash game archive contains the newest version, which uses ActionScript 3 which is not fully supported by Ruffle and will currently fail to load in the emulator. The version used in this TAS comes from crazygames.com which features an older version of the game that does not contain ActionScript 3! One of the first things you might notice in this TAS is me throwing my extra darts away off the screen, which does save time. Throwing darts at the metal or ceramic blocks is slower as you cannot throw another dart under the previous dart that hit the block fades away completely. Occasionally, you don't have to toss darts if you destroy 
	[b 
		"all
	]b
	" Bloons in the level but usually once you meet the target amount of bloons. It's generally faster to dispose extras off the screen... especially if the bloons are in a tricky place. Another thing to mention with throwing darts is the invisible trigger zones where the darts will collide with off-screen to reset them, allowing you to throw the next dart. They are not all the same, as the trigger zone on the right is fair bit closer to the screen than the left side or bottom screen zones. To test this, simply play the game and throw the darts off the screen to the left, right, and down and you will see this. I thought I'd mention this because it saves some frames at a few points where you have to dispose extra darts or hit darts near the right of the screen. Another thing you may notice is that some levels, after you complete them, take a bit for the level complete screen to appear. I'm not sure why this happens and as far as I know, it's still a mystery. It could be similar to frame rules in Super Mario Bros. but that is just a guess. Below are my comments for each level. I have a lot to talk about for some levels.

	"Optimizing this game looks really difficult. There are some impressive trick shots that RTA runners wouldn't dream of trying. There are possibly some improvements due to the complexity of the game, especially in the bouncing dart levels, but the current solutions look good enough.

	"The choice to not use unlimited darts is somewhat understandable when you consider it's the default choice. However, it just adds more time with no added entertainment, and the difference in difficulty is only applicable to RTA. To be clear, I don't think it should be rejected over this, because there's a lot of redeeming things about this run and I think the audience would like to see it. I hope any future attempts at this will use UDM, and I would personally obsolete this run if using UDM was the only improvement. I'm going to make this a branchless fastest completion run, because I don't think a "no UDM" branch offers different enough content from an any% run, and we'll just chalk up UDM as a known improvement.
