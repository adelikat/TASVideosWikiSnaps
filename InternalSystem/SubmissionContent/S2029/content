	"We started the run with about 1.8 seconds of improvement in mind (A route change at the end of BitFS and a trick at the first elevator in BitS) and we managed to save well over 3 more seconds in the process.

	"First, BLJ'ing on a higher step allowed Mario to start BLJ'ing earlier, because of less air time. This saved 2 frames. Two frames were also saved from optimisation at the BLJ, and 6 more by using a normal jump to glitch through the trapdoor. So overall, 10 frames were saved over the previous run in this section.

	"In the gallery, one frame was saved by using a jump roll instead of a long jump to the stairs, and 2 more were saved at the long jumps up to the 70 star door. The air time after one of the BLJ's at the 50 star stairs wastes no time, in case you're wondering.

	"In the endless stairs room, one frame was saved; the strained angle used for the BLJ set up entering the entrance to BitS faster.
