	"Today marks 10 years since I joined this site! Thought that would be reason enough to warrant the making of a new TAS. As Sonic games are the ones I've had the most fun with due to their complex physics, and the fact that I didn't already have the record for this one, made it a wanted target to improve. Only problem was that in order to do so I had to beat Tee-N-Tee... big challenges are great motivators though and in the end I improved his run by 473 ingame frames (~7.9 seconds) and about the same amount of real time. The input file still became a few seconds shorter than that due to ending the input earlier by pure greediness.
