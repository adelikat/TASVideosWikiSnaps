	"Little Nemo has had several previous submissions. The current one follows Randil's run exactly up to level 8, where it uses a new found strat involving the morning star to boost through the level. This saves about 13 seconds over the published run.

	"Here you'll start seeing the morning star trick used. When the morning star fires it recoils you in the opposite direction. If you then jump on just the right frame without pressing any direction, you will fly a fairly long distance at high speed.

	"In the first area, it actually only has 2 uses since you need the reptile to get up the big tree, and the narrow tunnel and nemo's jumping mechanics make getting the first one quicker. It turns out the first boss in this area uses a slightly different pattern, which is a couple of frames faster then the older pattern.

	"In the second part of the stage, the boost makes getting to the lizard significantly quicker. Thereafter the area is completed essentially identical to Randil. The boss here has the same pattern and is beaten with Randil's original inputs.

	"The final part is where most of the time is saved. Nemo has a mechanic where after he lands from a jump he is stuck in a crouched animation for a few frames. This means jumping as little as possible, which is what the morning star boost allows for, adds up to saving significant time. For the final boss, he ended up having a pattern that was about a second slower then in Randil's run, the only way I could modify this I could find is by dying, which is far too slow. Overall however still time is saved in the final section from where I leave the bee to the last input.

	"This is another run of simply catching up to strats already known from the RTA world. This trick, according to Jokaah, comes from a Japanese runner called visan. I get the sense that TAS is quite far behind the RTA world in a lot of ways, but this could simply be because there are fewer TASers.

	"A possible improvement to this run would be to find a way to implement another new trick involving zipping. I couldn't find a use for it, since it only moves Nemo to the left.
