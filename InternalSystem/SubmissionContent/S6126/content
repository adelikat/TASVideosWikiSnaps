	"Bonk's Adventure is a simplified port of the PC Engine/Turbografx16 game of the same name to the NES. It features Bonk adventuring to save Princess Za from the evil King Drool. This version of the game has some different stage layouts and some changed mechanics from its PCE counterpart.

[p 
	"Tapping B repeatedly in the air will trigger Bonk's "bonk" attack and then cancel it allowing Bonk to slowly descend. This is acknowledged in the manual as "midair spinning". Doing a midair spin into an enemy will deal double damage compared to ground attacks and headbutts from below. It will also cause you to bounce off the enemy.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Bonk builds up speed slowly walking so at the start of a stage it is most optimal to jump immediately and do midair spins on the first possible frame. Bonk will have 4 frames of slower movement upon landing, however this can be reduced to 2 if he jumps on the first possible frame.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Flower Boosting: Doing a bonk into the side of a flower will give Bonk a horizontal speed of 7, the highest in the game. Combining this with a jump and midair spinning and bouncing off enemies, one can fly at high speeds across levels. Bonk will initially face backwards during a Flower Boost, unless the forward facing direction is pressed on the dpad at which point you can no longer face backwards without slowing down. Facing backwards is usually optimal for two reasons:
	$LF
]p
[ol 
	[li 
		" It can allow for setting up later flower boosts more quickly.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Any drops that appear from enemies will move in the direction that Bonk is facing. Facing backwards sends them offscreen faster, reducing lag.
		$LF
	]li
]ol
[p 
	"The direction an enemy moves when you bounce off it is dependent on where you hit the enemy. Left will send it right, center straight up, and right will send it left. It is usually optimal to send the enemy in the opposite direction from which Bonk is traveling in order to reduce the amount of time it is on screen and therefore causes lag.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Triggering swimming will stop Bonk in place for a frame then set his max horizontal speed to 3. If horizontal speed is important, we generally want to avoid triggering swimming by repeatedly jumping underwater and diving with the b button after a jump. Landing in water will also freeze Bonk for a frame. Lastly you can get several invincibility frames by canceling a dive.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"It's optimal to cancel jumps while climbing walls with midair spins to maximize the amount of time spent at vertical speed 9.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Landing on ice with Bonk's head will set his horizontal speed to 5, however exiting this state requires a long period of standing still. I only trigger this if the slide will take Bonk off a ledge which does not trigger the halted movement.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Small Meat will increment Bonk's power up state by 1 and Big Meat will increment it by 2. When Bonk initially hits the second powered up state, he will temporarily become invinicible and able to move quicker. This is still slower than flower boosts however. The only reason I pick one up is to do increased damage to the Round 2 boss which has long periods where it is not vulnerable to attack.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Smileys cause lag when on screen however there is typically a countdown at the end of each Round where the amount of smileys you collected are tallied. Therefore I mostly avoid collecting them until Round 5 where there is no countdown.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Waterfall mechanics are drastically changed from the PCE version. You can no longer make hops while on a waterfall and can only slowly climb or let go of the waterfall and fall. I usually try to use enemy bouncing to avoid slow waterfall climbs.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Bosses typically are manipulated to be as close to the center as possible when finishing the fight. This reduces the amount of time they need to move after being defeated.

	"The game transitions to the next screen a set amount of time after hitting the exit trigger. Therefore one usually wants to land as far left into the exit trigger as possible.
