	"Spellbound Dizzy is the fifth core game in the Dizzy series. Dizzy goes to visit his local friendy Wizard, Theo, and decides to read his book of Really Powerful Spells, particularly the page headed A Really, Really, Powerful Spell (That Shouldn't Be Read Out Loud), which traps himself, his friends and family, his pet, and Wizard Theo in the underworld. Dizzy has to find five stars and a special object for each person to rescue them.

	"The run is performed on the Sinclair ZX Spectrum +2A. Spellbound Dizzy synchronises its game engine to the screen's refresh rate, and therefore generally runs marginally (~0.1%) faster on 48K than on 128K versions. However, 128K versions of the Spectrum run their Z80 processor at a slightly higher clock rate, and the +2A and +3 also have some improvements in memory access speeds; this means that menuing and room transitions are faster on these models. The +3 is a disk-based system, and Spellbound Dizzy has never been officially released on disk, so the +2A would be better. On the other hand, Spellbound Dizzy has additional enhancements for 128K versions, the most relevant being additional dialog to skip.

	"Working out exactly which model is fastest for this game is non-trivial, and the difference is negligible, so I based my choice of model on an entirely different metric. Spellbound Dizzy has AY music when playing in 128K mode, but not in 48K mode. As a result, the run uses the +2A and loads the game from tape.

	"The game runs at a relatively constant 12.5fps (one in-game frame every four screen refreshes). Menuing and screen transitions take longer than this and are simply processed as quickly as possible ignoring framerate. For the rest of this section, "frame" refers to in-game frame.

	"Dizzy moves horizontally at four pixels per frame, whether on the ground or in the air. While standing or walking on ground, he can stop and turn around instantly, but he cannot be controlled in the air. A jump can only be performed while standing or walking on ground; this pushes Dizzy upwards at a fixed velocity and sends him into a roll. He cannot be controlled while rolling and will continue rolling until he is both on the ground and on his feet.

	"Dizzy can pick up and drop items, and the game revolves around his using this ability to solve puzzles. By pressing the menu button, the inventory will open. If an item is within Dizzy's reach, he will also pick it up. Dizzy can initially hold two items at a time, and attempting to pick up a third item will simply tell the player it can't be done. Selecting an item in the inventory will make Dizzy use or drop it. The menu can only be opened while standing still, and items do not act under physics; once dropped, they are stationary and do not move until picked up again.

[div class=p 
	"If an item is dropped within its designated use area, the item will (usually) disappear and some interaction will occur (e.g. opening a bridge). There are also items that are used simply by holding them; for example, holding the umbrella will both protect your items from rain as well as increase your buoyancy in the windy shaft. In addition, some items have no purpose and exist as red herrings. The bag permanently increases the number of items Dizzy can hold to four. The trampette can be placed so you can bounce on it repeatedly to gain height.

	"All rooms start in a fixed state, but maintain their state between visits. Enemies move in fixed patterns and cannot be manipulated. Dizzy starts with three lives and a full health bar; contact with enemies results in a draining of health, with a life lost when health is fully drained. Dizzy can also lose health by falling too far, or staying underwater too long without breathing apparatus. Health can be restored by eating food.

	$LF
]h4
[div class=p 
	"The main feature of Spellbound Dizzy is the windy shaft. Some objects have a weight or buoyancy associated with them, and the items you hold determine how low or high in the shaft you float. Rocks add one to your weight, whereas the umbrella subtracts one (or adds one to your buoyancy), and the kite subtracts two.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"In order to collect rocks, we must cross the deep pit. The only way to avoid fall damage (and fall stun) is to land on the trampette and wait until the bounces are low enough where jumping off is harmless. The sloped edges of the pit allow you to dismount a little earlier, at the cost of it usually being away from your destination. As a result, depending on items and method of entering the deep pit, sometimes it's faster to avoid fall damage and sometimes it isn't.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The deep pit must be crossed at least twice for each trip into the windy shaft; rocks are stored on the left side of the pit, and respawn when dropped. In addition, the inventory cannot be full of rocks when crossing the pit, as the trampette must be moved each time. To enter the windy shaft with an inventory full of rocks, a rock must be kept in cloud storage, but this requires two more pit crossings to restock the inventory again.

Of course, you can't do that immediately from the start of the game:

The umbrella makes us lighter, so we leave it at the two-rock level and drop a rock on the scales to speak to Grand Dizzy and collect his ear trumpet. A lot of item shuffling later, we leave the umbrella at the one-rock level, the megaphone and the ear trumpet outside Theo's Grotto, and the iron hammer at the two-rock level, while holding the weird talisman and a rock to reach the beast's lair and pick up the aqualung. We drop the weird talisman as it's no longer needed, and pick up the umbrella to take it back to the surface, putting our rock in cloud storage while we still have it.

We leave the aqualung there for later and cross the pit again, picking up the ear trumpet and the megaphone. We use the megaphone to collect Dylan's vibes before swapping it for the thin sticks and drying the soggy log on the fire. We give Dylan's vibes and the ear trumpet to Theo, along with 10 stars, to rescue Dylan and Grand Dizzy, dumping them after use. We then pick up a glass jar on our way back up to the surface, where we swap the thin sticks for the umbrella and the smoking log. With the umbrella to stop the smoking log becoming a soggy log again, and the smoking log stopping the bees from attacking, we can fill the glass jar with honey, leaving the smoking log behind as we no longer need it, and the umbrella near the windy shaft for later. We give the jar of honey to the bear so he lets us pass to pick up the pile of bones and the pot of pepper. By the time we get back he's finished eating the honey, so we retrieve the empty jar and leave it at the surface with the pile of bones.

The iron hammer opens the pipe to flood the pumping station, allowing us to swim up to Dozy to collect his comfy pillow, and the reserve tank to pick up the fishing net.

We combine the pretty cloth, the sticky tape, the thin sticks, and the knotted string to produce one fab kite, allowing us to float much higher in the windy shaft to pick up the drill bit, fitting it to the drill to finally escape the underworld.

	"Dizzy is one of my favourite 80s/90s videogame series. On paper, Spellbound Dizzy is the best of the classic Spectrum Dizzy games; it has the biggest map, tons of unique gimmicks and animations, a wide-open structure allowing for progress to be made towards multiple subgoals at the same time, and structurally is the most robust and well-programmed. The windy shaft is a fantastic idea and would probably not be nearly as hated were it not for the fact that every time you wish to descend into the shaft you first have to do a blind jump into the deep pit and hope you land on the trampette, pick up the trampette, drop it on the other side, build up height to get out, pick up however many rocks you need, do a blind jump into the deep pit and hope you land on the trampette, pick up the trampette, drop it on the other side, and build up height to get out again, only to realise that you've got one rock too many and you've missed your entrance. A great game ruined by forced busywork.

Further special thanks go to Big Red Software for making the game, Sir Clive Sinclair for making the Spectrum, and everyone in the Speedtrum Specrunning community for keeping da speccy alive.

It is very clear, that you struggle in some spots during your speedrun...but your TAS cleans them up very nicely with about 6 minutes advantage (Hope I calculated that right). Once again...excellent work!
