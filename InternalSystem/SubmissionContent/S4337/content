	"This is a tool-assisted speedrun (TAS) on Double Dragon for SEGA Genesis. Everyone on tasvideos knows the trilogy of Double Dragon for Nintendo NES, but still no-one TASed Double Dragon for GEN. Did anyone paid any attention?

	"I can't believe I've passed full game in frame advance and improved every fight at least 2 times! I think it's because the game is short =) I think it's a great run for a newbie like me!

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The first fight is simple. Fastest time, improves and etc. Baseball bat causes as much damage as roundhouse kick, so I decided to take it and pass the mission with it. In the last fight (with boss), I needed to kill one guy to spawn the boss faster and manipulate the enemy with knifes to throw them at simple enemies: if boss die, enemies go away which can delay the mission, so I needed to kill the boss just after enemies die.

	"It was the easiest mission of all! Just throw enemies into the pit. Belt conveyor also saved my time.

	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The first fight was a little slow (lag frames), because of 6 moving objectives on the screen, but I fixed it killing 5 of them =)
	$LF
	"I took the bat at the first moment and knocked down 2 men to manpulate the 3rd to change his direction and all enemies were left from me and then made an empty hit to knock down 4 enemies at once after it. Then it was a matter of technique. I needed to lose my bat (you can't throw it away!) and in the fight with the first pit I found a great way to do that and managed not to lose time. In next fights I was throwing enemies in pits. In the fight with boss, I needed to kill boss only, because there was a "rescue point" near us.

	" Mission 4:
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"I was just checking the level, but I didn't guess that all enemies die without my help! In that fight I just manipulated evils to thrust enemies quicker. I took knife because it causes lots of damage which helped me in fight with Mr.X stolen from SOR. Everything I needed is to find the fastest recipe to kill him. This is the end!

	"The first part of Double Dragon was published in 1992 after Double Dragon 2 (in 1991). Thats why the graphics in DD 1 is better! I played all three DDs on Genesis, but I think DD 2 is so boring to get published! I made a

	"The first part is interesting for TASing and I think 2 players can pass it in 4:10 (~).

	". It accomplishes this mostly by using the whip instead of the bat (three times more damage) and making enemies which comes out of doors disappear, including the final boss. It also uses the second player for a split second to trick some enemies into a pit, but even though that potentially puts it in another category, it is clear that a movie hoping to be published needs to include the other tricks. Sorry, I am rejecting this. Please try again, I think it will make an entertaining movie.
