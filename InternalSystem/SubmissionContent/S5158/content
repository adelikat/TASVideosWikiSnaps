	"Stage 5 is 315 frames faster. The improvement comes from a combination of a new damage boost and a much better boss fight. We can't perfectly optimize the moving platform anymore, but we can manipulate it to some extent by either killing a skeleton or picking up a money bag. Koh1fds gets credit for all of the new ideas.

[p 
	"Stage 6 is 315 frames faster, as well, because of another new damage boost idea from Koh1fds. The zigzag is gone. I had to confirm that it's still faster to damage boost at the unicorn. It is, barely. The boost is 147 frames faster than taking the ladder. Getting the armor takes 126 frames. And so it's 21 frames faster overall.

	": I just love what these Ghosts 'n Goblins submissions stand for. It goes to show that even after 12 years and just as many submissions, huge new things can be found in order to whittle a time down further and further. Runs like this are part of why I love this scene. Accepting as an improvement to the
