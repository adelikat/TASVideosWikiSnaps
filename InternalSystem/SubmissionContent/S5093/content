		"The First 500

	" list. Then I saw a wip of the 3rd level, with a sketchy bike skip and I decided to finally put my effort into it now that I have all the knowledge. It was hard as fuck, but I saved some second(s?).

I thought it's because the snowman hasn't destroyed the wall, so I did the left+right thing to show the wall on the screen. He crashed it and I was going to try passing the invisible wall once again, and it didn't disappear, and I occasionally started falling down while my sprite remained shifted way to the right.

When I manipulated my position to make checkpoint spawn, I finally found out it indeed fails to end the level, it just increases the checkpoint value to tell the game where to respawn you if you die. So yeah, you must activate them all.

	"Level 3 was nice, global timer that spawns falling rats tried to kill my 30 (?) frame improvement, but I saved a few more and it gave up. Resynced bike skip and Level 4. Saved some time with the new trick on Surfs. It's worth mentioning that Surf City can be skipped altogether with 2 players by going below the wooden floor while being on the surf board, but with 1 player, the screen starts immediately scrolling. You can only go lower if you also are going to the left map-wise, but the screen will push you, so maximum I could get was 10 pixels OOB. Added some manipulation to the mines.

But if you keep walking, it won't know that the water ended and your speed will remain the same. But you you jump out of that water (up and forward at the right time), you won't fall back into it, but will fall on the normal ground. You can charge dash attacks, I used the dash jump obviously.

Making me wait 256 frames.

	$LF

[div class=p 
	"While feos found most of the new tricks and did most of the optimization, I did find some things that helped. Level 2 features some new lag reductions on the venus fly trap enemies. In the ice level some frames were saved with a new strategy of clipping starting the L+R way earlier in the level. In level 5 running off of the surf board is a bit faster then jumping. But probably the most significant new things I found is actually in the snake level. I noticed that you can shorten the snakes by scrolling the screen at particular times. This strange behavior might need some more research, it does same some frames though. After that it's pretty much all feos. I think my biggest contribution was just giving the development of this run a head start. Sometimes just starting can seem the most daunting, but I'm surprised how quickly it came together in the end.

We have a WIP for 2player, maybe that'll be next... and perhaps my personal life has slowed down enough to allow me to actually work on that run a little more if someone else is up for it.
