	"I thought DS version would be the most suitable because the stylus allowed playing much faster than any other version. Since there is no USA version of Shanghai Solitaire released for DS, I used Japanese one.

	"The game has three difficulties and I played on all of them to find which one is the most entertaining for TASing. I made and watched a run of normal difficulty that has 8 stages, and thought some people would say that it is boring. Then I played on the easy difficulty that has only 4 stages. The run was too short for me, but it would be a good demonstration of how Shanghai Solitaire TAS would looks because it wouldn’t be boring and has a standard layout. That’s why I chose the easy difficulty.
