	"Tower of Doom was originally set to be the third AD&D title on the Intellivision with the working title "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Tower of Mystery". The game was only half complete when Mattel Electronics folded in 1984. INTV Corp resumed work on the game in 1986. Not wanting to pay for a renewed D&D license, the game was released under the new name, "Tower of Doom". Even if Tower of Doom is outside the Dungeons & Dragons license, it has more D&D elements than its two predecessors.

	"You cannot simply throw weapons all the time though, as there is a random chance the weapon will downgrade to a lower color. If the weapon downgrades enough times, you will lose itâ€”and we don't want to lose the axe. You will notice in Level 2 I downgrade the axe excessively in order to squeeze as many frames as I can out of the level to save. I end up with the axe two downgrades away from being lost for two reasons: 1) I need an extra downgrade available to manipulate optimal teleporter RNG on Level 4; and 2) with any higher number of downgrades left, I could not for the life of me manipulate an equal or better stairs positioning on Level 3. Therefore, I'd say I tested the ramifications of my RNG choices comprehensively enough.
