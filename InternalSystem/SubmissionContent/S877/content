		"About the Game:
	]b
	" Chrono Trigger is a phantastic role-playing game made by Square. It is known as one of the best RPG games of all time. The story is about time-traveling in which a group of young adventurers is trying to save the future by defeating a mighty creature called "Lavos" which has infected and destroyed the world.

		"Moviemaking:
	]b
	" Since making a TAS for the entire game would take very much time I decided to do a New Game+ run! This movie shows how to beat the game using the New Game+ feature which allows you to start a new game but keep the status and items from a save-file you can select for it. I used my own save-file I have optimized for this movie to reach the fastest possible time in this mode and defeating Lavos at the earliest point.

	"Optimizing the the movements especially where Marle joins, the Lavos battles to find the quickest battle-strategy against him and the Dream Team Ending was hard. In the End of Time I had to calculate the fastest possible route while talking to all the needed characters which required some planings and testings.

	"The effort was worth it, I managed to break the 10 min barrier by geting a time of 9 min and 57 sec which seems to be the limit for this mode.
