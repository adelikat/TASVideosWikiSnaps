	"The long and short of it is that Sam is amazing. The Blaster ball, even with diminishing returns, causes a ton of damage overall. However, as you get deeper into the game, the difficulty increases and the AI dodges/catches much more often, so the bulk of the time save is optimizing the AI manipulations. This is generally done by doing things at different angles, on different frames, and so forth. There are a lot of little delays throughout the run to get everything lined up properly, but this is very much worth it to be able to get more hits in on more enemies more frequently as evidenced by the time savings.

Like, you'd think the other teams would be studying game tapes and putting together a counterattack or something, but nahhhhhh. It's like they all think "Okay, the last guys lined up for the Blaster and all got knocked into next Tuesday. Let's all line up for the Blaster and aim for Monday."
