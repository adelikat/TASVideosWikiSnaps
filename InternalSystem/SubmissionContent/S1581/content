		" Minimizing diagonal movement.  The character moves at 1.2 pixels per frame when walking up but only .84 when walking diagonal up.  So care needs to be taken to get get the most efficient route planned in advance.

		" Better boss fights - the use of RAM address watching helped tremendously in these cases.  It showed that often the use of Merc bombs was slower.  Especially once your weapon is upgraded.  The ideal situation is to use 1 merc bomb at the end of the fight to finish the boss off.  This is because the regular weapon does 4 damage every 2 frames but the merc bomb does an instant 20 plus 3 damage every other frame.  So it is slower except at the end when the bosses health is at 20.
		$LF
	]li

[ul 
	[li 
		" Reduced lag.  Again ram addresses for camera position were helpful here.  Also a lot of luck manipulation was done to get the right enemy patterns.  Such as manipulating them to not appear near mini-boss sections.

	"Route planning was essential here.  Also, I reduced lag a lot in the tank section.  I destroy the jeep because it is slower to move around the tank and I have to lose it anyway at the next tank.  I wedged the jeep between the wall and the tank so the character would not be blown backwards (gather did this as well).

[div class=p 
	"Mercs are slower on the boss so I waste all but 1 before the fight starts.  You will see the boss do the "got hit" animation but no hp was lost.  Bosses are not vulnerable until there life bar appears.  I waste merc bombs as to not get the merc bonus at the end of the level.

	"At the end tank before the final boss, I simply walk past it rather than destroy it.  Oddly, this causes major graphical glitching.  If it is that destructive to the game you would think it would be harder to do :P  The graphical glitching has no effect on the run, and goes away at the end of the level.
