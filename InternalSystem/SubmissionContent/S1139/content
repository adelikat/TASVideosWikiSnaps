	"Golgo 13 is insanely powerful.  He can fly a helicopter almost as fast as a plane.  He has a vertical jump that is 3 times his height.  His sniper accuracy is nothing short of legendary.  If you shoot at him, he will kick the bullet away.  If he kicks you, you will explode.  He does all of this while wearing a suit and tie.

In some areas, I take damage if it's unavoidable.  A couple walking scenes forced me to duck for a couple of frames to avoid damage -- taking damage in these areas would have killed me at a later point.
