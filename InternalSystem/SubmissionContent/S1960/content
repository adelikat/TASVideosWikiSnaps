	"Here is a new movie that I choose this game named Chiki Chiki Machine Mou Race which is called Wacky Race in the USA.I choose this rom because of the background's design of the rom from Japan is more beautiful than that from the USA which is also very laggy.
	$LF
	"The charactor is lovely,especially the nauty dog.The game is interesting because there are many different stages.Ice,ocean,cloud and all the other things make the game entertaining.
	$LF
	"This game has a bug that pushing B and select together can shoot farther than only using the item BOW.It is the bomb that has a special movement like the BOW.This is my discourage and is the reason why I try to make this movie.
