	"Faster walking in stairs - Holding  <^> or <v> when walking in stairs speeds you up a bit. It also makes you walk through some of stairs.

	"After having some problems with my other ALttP run, I decided to see if I could improved the glitched version. At that time I didn't know where, or if, I could save any frames. But apparently I did.
	$LF
	"I also decided to keep the input animation in the beginning of the run

[p 
	"2 frames saved before the damage boost.
	$LF

[p 
	"2 frames lost because two frames were saved. The guard could get in the perfect position fast enought, which gave me a not as good damage boost.

	": Somewhat of an 'invisible' improvement, but 17 frames is quite a lot for a run that has gone through so many iterations. Accepting as an improvement to the published 'glitched' run.
