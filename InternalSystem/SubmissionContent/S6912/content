[ul 
	[li 
		"In the past (before my time on staff so I don't know exact details), the site had allowed runs of a game on one system to obsolete or prevent runs from another system from being accepted.  Currently, we lean more toward accepting multiple systems for the same game, especially if there are differences in how the game plays across the systems.  So cross-system obsoletion/comparison shouldn't be a concern for SOTN.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"The Saturn version of SOTN gives the player a starting choice from three charaters with which to play the game: Richter, Alucard, and Maria.  These characters have different abilities/limitations and thus require playing through the game differently.  As such, there is potential value in a publication for each character in order to both archive and showcase (from a TASing standpoint) the differences in how the characters beat the game as quickly as possible.  Based on the current rules, it's likely only one of these characters would get a Standard class publication with the others going to Alternate class; but there is also some discussion on whether this policy should be changed in a way that would allow a run from each of the characters in Standard class.  Regardless of class distinction, a run from each character is likely acceptable.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Exclusively for the Saturn version of the game, there is a save-game glitch where the memory of items collected isn't reset when restarting the game with a different character.  This effectively allows the game to be started with one character and get to a save point to create the "dirty" SRAM, then restart the game with a new character who will have all the items/stats collected by the previous character due the the game not resetting the RAM values upon stariting the new character.  This opens the door for different approaches to gameplay among the various characters and creates some SRAM backed categories of play.
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				"Richter normally starts with all the relics, but his relic stuff doesn't use much mana, so he starts with much less initial mana points than Maria.  So using him as the initial character is going to be a less optimal use of the save glitch for Alucard to then start his scenario as he would be limited by a lower mana level.
				$LF
			]li
			[li

Thus, I cannot accept this run for publication at this time.  I think it fits better in playground as a demonstration.
