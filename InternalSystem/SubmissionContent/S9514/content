	"This strategy is based on clipping yourself off the game screen even though you shouldn't do it, it allows you to go through boxes without jumping but it won't make you avoid enemies, besides the boxes can't be picked up if you are completely off the game screen, to do this clip we have to go to the end of the wall, press down for 6 frames and in the next frame drop down and press left + B which allows you to go beyond the screen, unfortunately we can't go much further or we will die, we have to reach the trigger where the screen will turn right, this glitch also allows you to jump on platforms on the left even though you shouldn't.
