	"First of all, if the Ultraman gets hurt, he can't in some frames. But it is necessary in some specific situations because it can make Ultraman run faster.

	"Secondly, if the Ultraman is standing and attacking super monsters, he will become immovable. So we have to jump and attack while running.

	"By the way, when we press the UP+B buttons, Ultraman will emit the various unique skills and we can press the start,←/→ and B button to switch them, it will spend 4-6 frames.

	"The Ultraman is standing and emiting the unique skills, he will become immovable too. But luckily we can press the A button in the following frame to cancel the delay and remove the immovables (immovable state). We can use this skill to to faster passage through obstacles from some super monsters.

	"Stage 1: I passed through some places by making the Ultraman stop moving and jump attack. I use the skill of jumping to remove the immovable state to pass through some places. I injured the Ultraman to pass through some places faster. About the BOSS quick kill plan, I keep enough energy to emit the fourth unique kill once. After the BOSS dialog box ends, you can jump and attack it in the following frame. We can use jump attacks and emit the fourth unique kill to defeat the BOSS quickly.

[div class=p 
	"Stage 2: The same skills as the Stage 1. But it is worth noting that some tracks need to jump up and land on the edge at the first time. It will make you accelerate earlier. Some places of Stage 2 some electric fans will make you retreat, I need to press the A button to jump and pass through faster. About the BOSS conflate earlier, I choose to fall in the middle of the BOSS stage ground and stand still to get injured. Keeping enough energy to emit the fourth unique kill twice is the BOSS quick kill plan. 
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Stage 3: The same skills. In the beginning of Stage 3-2, we make the Ultraman jump up and empty frames to pass through faster instead of be injured. At frame 23014 I made the Ultraman face left and got injured in order to allow position of the Ultraman to pass through the terrain. Then the Ultraman can pass through the next path faster. The same BOSS quick kill plan. 
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"Stage 4: The same skills. Faster fall can make some trap arrows launch faster in some places in order to the Ultraman can pass through faster. At frame 32247 I made the Ultraman hurt twice later to pass through. If I don't do this, the Ultraman will be injured three times, it will be slower. About the BOSS battle of this stage, it will be immune damaged after 7 attacks in the first two times. It makes the BOSS battle very slow. You can only defeat it with the quick kill on the third time.

[div class=p 
	"Stage 5: The same skills. At frame 38809 I made the Ultraman face left and got injured in order to take the invincible time to jump and fall faster. It saved me a lot of time, this's great! The same BOSS quick kill plan. But this BOSS is harder to defeat than the each one else before it. But fortunately there is fully supplied before the BOSS battle. Even if you have unhealthy HP and empty energy.

[div class=p 
	"Stage 6: BOSS Rush, there's nothing to talk about. There are the same plans of every previous BOSS. I have enough energy to emit the fourth unique kill twice to defeat the first BOSS.But I have energy to emit the fourth unique kill once to defeat the second BOSS. Because defeat the second BOSS used up all our energy, I need to defeat two super monsters before the 3rd BOSS to gain energy. We directly enter the 4th BOSS battle instead of defeat super monsters to gain energy because it's faster. Next is the 5th BOSS, there are supplies that I can bring back enough energy to emit the fourth unique kill once. 6th BOSS will start appearing in the form of a fake Ultraman, it has invincible time like the 4th BOSS. Afterwards, defeat it with the quick kill plan.

	"Stage 7: After defeating the boss, the Ultraman will return to Earth. First, we need to exhaust our HPs. The partners for the Ultraman will pass on their power to him. Next, just defeat him up, damn it! The TAS is completed after the last dialog box ends.
