	"I originally saw this strategy in a book. The book was discussing a peculiar rule where an illegal move (and/or possibly touching a piece with no legal move, it's not clear) forces the player to move their own King. In essence, a forced Bongcloud. The only reason the rule is notable is because of a game popularly cited (
	[a href=https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1242985 rel=noopener external nofollow 
		"Lindemann vs. Echtermeyer, 1893
	]a
	") where a player was forced to do a Bongcloud that immediately loses (or would have if Black not missed it, depending on the source; apparently, historians can't even agree on what happened after that!). The book gives the color-switched variant using the Wayward Queen Attack. So that's where I got this idea.

	"Another point that I wish to bring up, is the fact that a fast win doesn't always mean that great moves were made. If a chess AI was used against this game, it would certainly have taken longer...due to making serious moves, instead of blunders. In fact, we have seen chess submissions that break the CPU's logic and produce bad moves that allow a player to move in easily and quickly for the final attack.
