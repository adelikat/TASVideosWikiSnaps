	"All improvements come from the journey that triggered the BUG. Here, the important thing is not to die as soon as possible, but the role coordinates during resurrection. The reason is very simple. After the front player dies, the backward player surpasses him, and then continues to drag the scroll. The coordinates of the dead player's resurrection are relative to the current screen, not to the scroll. However, in my actual production process, I found some tips. The resurrection X coordinate of red player after being killed by the enemy for the first time is 48. The X coordinate of the blue player's first resurrection is 88.
