	"Montezuma's Revenge was one of the first platform games: an action game combining treasure hunting, multiple rooms, and puzzle solving. The player controls a character called Panama Joe controlling him from room to room in the labyrinth of 16th century Aztec temples filled with enemies, obstacles, traps, and dangers.

	"This game contains 11 stages all of which are very similar. This movie skips almost every room by using up+down on ladders.
	$LF

[p 
	"The glitch used in this run is performed by grabbing the ladder at the beginning of the stage and pressing up+down which makes Panama Joe start climbing in air. If you climb to the top of the screen it warps you to the final room of the stage (very convenient). From here climbing straight up will make you go into an infinite loop of falling and soft lock the game so I avoid this by climbing through the bottom of the screen. This warps me to the top of the screen where I climb downwards until my Y-position is 7. For one frame the game thinks I am standing on ground so I can jump off the invisible ladder.

[p 
	"For most of the stages I intentionally jump into the spikes because it is faster than exiting from the left or right. I cannot do this in every level because it would result in a game over. The lives are shown as hats in the first room of each stage.

	"I grab the ladder as quickly as possible and hold up+down to climb an invisible ladder to the top of the screen to warp to a room. I climb up more until I have the ability to jump and exit to the left side of the screen which is the entrance to the final room. I jump into the room so I die immediately after entering causing the next level to begin. I do not know why this is the only level that doesn't warp me directly to the final room.

I then go to the top of the screen by climbing off the bottom of the screen where I keep climbing down until my Y-Position is 7 where it detects for one frame I am on solid ground so I jump off either to death or the exit to the left or right, depending on whichever is faster and doesn't result in game over.

	"I climb up to the warp and end input at the last possible frame. I then warp to the last room where the game glitches after a while and finishes the level. This is a cool looking glitch. Stage 11 just keeps looping so there is technically no end to this game.
