	"The updated strat on Jaquio (2) is actually the RTA strat, which is functionally identical to the strat used in the published run except the first fire wheel is performed facing left. This still hits Jaquio and allows the subsequent fire wheels to be performed 2 frames earlier. Because we face left on the first cast, the fourth cast has the fire wheel from the second shadow performed to the left as well, meaning it leaves the screen earlier, allowing the final cast to be done 5 frames sooner. One frame needed to be added to resync the third phase, bringing the total improvement to 6 frames.

	"The existence of the Jaquio strat was brought up in the YouTube comments of the published run about a month ago, but it took me (Samsara) until earlier today to see it and investigate it. Thankfully it was the second to last boss of the game so it was really easy to implement and resync, though I still don't feel quite right implementing a "cheap" improvement like this without touching the rest of the movie. Either way, given the history of this game and the insane level of optimization on it, knocking out another 6 frames still feels pretty good. And then xipo comes along with another new improvement, so we're up to a solid 10 total frames, which feels even better.
