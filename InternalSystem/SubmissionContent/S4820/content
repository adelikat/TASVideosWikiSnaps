Like the SNES Umihara Kawase run, I initially had this run finished, but decided to check one last time for alternate TASes and ended up finding a Nico TAS of the DS version. Even more coincidentally, the run I found was from TKDL, the same TASer whose run I found last time. Apart from the first, every Field in this run either matches or beats TKDL's times.

	"This Field is around a second slower than TKDL's TAS, and there's a very good reason why that is. If we hearken back to the run comments, I mentioned that the DS port has extra features and some changes to the levels. The extra features aren't really anything to write home about, because they're in Japanese and no one at my home would understand it, but Field 00 in the DS port actually has extra platforms and less enemies, which allows for a different and faster route through. This is the only Field in the run where that's relevant. The rest of the Fields in the run are unchanged in the DS port and thus completely comparable.

	"Probably the stage I spent the second most time on overall. One of the problems with Umihara TASing is that there are so many places where you can potentially lose time, so if you're comparing to another TAS and you end up behind, then you pretty much have to go back through the entire stage several times over to see where you might've gone wrong. The end bit with the fast swing up onto the door platform was the trickiest part. It requires a pretty precise angle and really good line control.

Every swing, hook placement, and lengthening/shortening of the line is frame-precise, otherwise the entire strategy falls apart. I did find that it is possible to jump off of the slanted spikes if you land on them the right way, but it doesn't save any time.

Closer watching the two runs side-by-side (and compensating for the difference in loading times), it was evident that the gameplay optimizations made were very significant over Mukki's TAS.  Good to see that every stage was improved upon (and that you also took the initiative to match, or exceed, TKDL's work, too).  Overall, remarkable work and dedication on this one!
