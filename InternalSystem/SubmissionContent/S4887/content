	"Well, let's get the positive out of the way first. This is much better than your previous submissions from a technical standpoint. At the very least, it looks optimized, on par with the currently published SMS movie. It definitely

	" for Vault because of that... But there's the issue of the SMS run already being published to contend with. Comparing the two games and the two runs tells me that they are nearly identical: The graphics are almost unchanged, the level layouts are extremely similar, and ultimately there's no discernible difference between the two runs apart from different music and slightly different corridors to walk through. That's a bit of a problem.

	"I posed the question of publishing this alongside the SMS run in the thread, and there wasn't a single overly positive response. Some said it's not worth publishing, some said they don't mind if it is published, but no one spoke up and said for certain that it SHOULD be published alongside the other run. As for me, personally, I belong to the former category, deeming the runs to be too similar to warrant separate publications. So then the next question is whether or not this should obsolete the SMS run as the "preferred version" of this game, and that was also pretty quickly put to rest by the thread's comments. The run being a second and a half slower seemed to be the kicker, but there were also comments made about the GG version being slightly inferior for a game that isn't exactly superior to begin with.

	"As such, I'm going to reject this run, as it's too similar to the SMS run to warrant a separate publication, and it's inferior to the SMS run in both design and timing to warrant an obsoletion. I suppose I'll boil it down to "game choice".

	"gamerretro2, I hope you don't take this personally. The technical quality of the run shows that you have improved greatly over time. Had the SMS version not already been on the site, this would have absolutely been accepted to the Vault. The only problem here was the game. I wish you luck on your next project, whatever that may be.
