	" is a collection of three platformer games in one.  Each game is (very loosely) based on a story from the Bible.  Gameplay itself has very little biblical connection.

	[li 
		[b 
			"David & Goliath

	"While watching recorded videos from SGDQ 2014, I saw Brossentia do a run of the David & Goliath portion of this game.  I remembered playing through this as a child and finding it quite difficult at the time.  Playing through it again in preparation for this TAS I realized that the game's difficulty lied in its control system.

However the idea of tool-assistance intrigued me and I thought this game would be an ideal candidate.  Seeing that there were no published videos of this I was ready to attack.

		"A minor glitch resulting from throwing objects during a couple frame window of jumps is used at times to gain slightly extra height allowing the playable character to land on platforms that would normally be to high to reach with a normal jump.

When it is lost, this the screen background goes black making only sprites visible except during random lightning flashes.  The jar itself is used as an object to knock out certain animals making them easier to obtain. The last portion of this stage is performed in the blackness without the jar for added difficulty and entertainment value.

[p 
	"There are three issues with this submission, and I'll start with the most obvious one: There's a bit of issue with optimization, with Baby Moses being something like 2-3 seconds slower than an optimized version. Personally... It's three seconds over a movie of 1095 seconds, so I wouldn't consider the entire movie suboptimal by any stretch, especially since some of that time lost is a minor speed/entertainment tradeoff. "But Samsara," you ask, and immediately I regret ever asking to become a Judge, "This is a Vault movie, so shouldn't it be rejected for using speed/entertainment tradeoffs?" It's maybe a second or two, it's essentially meaningless in regards to rejection over it being done.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Overall, I think the level of optimization in the movie is just fine. There was a lot of thought put into the weird movement physics, routing, glitch/exploit usage, and for a first publication, that counts more for me than being a few frames late in reaching the end of the level. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"That leaves two other weird issues, the first of which being: Is it worth having this run as a "100%" run alongside, potentially, 3 separate runs of the individual stories? If it's either this or the 3 individual runs, which option would fit in better? My gut's leaning toward all stories in one file, personally. It's not a long movie by any stretch, even with the bulk of it being taken up by Big Noah's Animal Sho-ah, and having the single movie also makes more sense for Vault purposes, giving 1 movie more overall meaning than 3 individual movies.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"That just leaves the last issue: What do we do with the 
	[a class=intlink href=/1826M 
		"Genesis run of Baby Moses
	]a
	"? Well... I'm not entirely sure, myself. It feels a little strange to obsolete it, considering it's a purely Vault-oriented optimized run whereas this is a more entertainment-based (and slightly slower) run, but this run does have more overall content with the other stories included. Huh. Leave it to me to pick up a Bible game submission and have it turn into 
	[b 
		"two
	]b
	" weird publication precedents.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I think overall it's safe to leave the Genesis run published for now. If an improvement to this run comes along, whether it be on the Nintendo Exodus System or the Sega Deuteronomy, then we can discuss the obsoletion of the standalone Baby Moses run further.
