	"Out to Lunch is a little-known, very fast-paced platforming game where you play as a chef whose food has escaped, your goal being to recapture the food items from around the world. So in each level, you have to hunt down your magical food-capturing net, then bag a certain minimum number of living food, then deposit them in the level's food cage, and finally go through the exit door that appears before the evil chef lets the food back out. The hard part is that there are 3 enemies besides the food (wasps, amoeba things, and floaty yellow things) which, in addition to trying to kill you, will infect any food they touch. Food that's infected goes from its normal cowardly behaviour to suddenly aggressively hunting you down to destroy you with its newfound mutant food attacks, and in addition, infected food cannot be captured anymore. The other hard part about this game is that each level has a low time limit, and you only have 3 lives, no continues. Also, there are lots of cleverly hidden secrets, some of which are actually required.

	"A few of the levels have warp doors that will instantly exit the level and skip the next level if they can be reached quickly enough, which I always take advantage of because it's so much faster (not to mention easier). Also, the collision detection is a little rough around the edges, so I take advantage of that a few times to do things I'm not quite supposed to be able to do (especially in the level with the long vertical glass pipes).

	"This time attack was a lot harder to make than I thought it'd be. First of all, just getting around the levels is difficult because it takes so much precision and the physics don't really make sense (springboards have really weird logic determining how high they propel you, sometimes you fall through enemies instead of bouncing on them and the bounce height can vary, etc.). Besides that, the goal in each level is not as simple as just running across the screen, and the large randomness to enemy's actions can make it frustrating to plan out routes through the levels because my movements and other random factors affect the enemy's movements and any food the enemies touch becomes infected (and can no longer count toward the total number I have to collect).

	"This game has a 2-player mode, but it's not simultaneous so there's no point. I think that playing in advanced mode just skips the first couple locations, which I decided to do since I think also playing the intro levels would only decrease the entertainment/time ratio of the movie (by making it longer just for a few easy levels).
