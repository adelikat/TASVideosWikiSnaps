	"Mario Party 6 is a party game released for the Nintendo GameCube in 2004 (2005 for Europe and Australia). Four players race across a board trying to get stars. During each turn, every player will take their turn to roll a dice from 1 to 10. This will determine how many spaces each player will move, if a player lands on a blue space, they will gain some coins, but if a player lands on a red space, they will lose coins. There are other spaces on the board which will cause different events to happen if a player lands on them, some events may be good and helpful for the player, others not so much. At the end of each turn, all four players will compete in a minigame to win coins, coins are used to buy stars. The player with the most amount of stars at the end wins!

	"In this TAS, we played on the Solo Mode! Solo Mode is, as the name implies, a Single-player game mode that has the player go through 3 boards and it has the character playing minigames against the Koopa Kids. The turn limit on these boards is set to 50 turns and players can roll a Dice Block that shows numbers only from 1-6 rather than the usual 1-10.

	"The spaces on Solo Mode are different than those in normal modes of play. There are spaces for 4-player, 2-vs-2 (these are played teamed up with a CPU partner of the player's choice; but it can't be the same character as the player's), 1-vs-3 (the human is always the 1 player against 3), Battle, and Duel Mini-games. There are also Bowser spaces, which feature (normally 1-vs-3) games played against the Koopa Kids where all the players' coins are lost if they lose; ? spaces, which cause an event to happen; and the Goal is where Rare Mini-Games are awarded.

	"Landing on one of these Rare Mini-Game spaces concludes the game and grants players one of the Rare Mini-games: Dunk Bros., Lab Brats, or Block Star. Seer Terror must be bought from the Star Bank. If the player goes past the Rare space, then the collected mini-games and bonuses are lost, and the game ends. Each board have a space limit and the as explained above, going past the Rare Mini-Game space is considered a loss. So we aim to get to the Goal in fewest turns possible. Along the way, we have to play Mini-games and we aim for faster Mini-games. These are achieved through RNG manipulation.
