	"Certain staircases in Final Fantasy push a state on to the stack to keep track of where you have gone. Take enough of those and you can overflow the stack. Hitting start to bring up the menu triggers a glitch that jumps into a range of memory used when entering your party's names. There actually aren't many staircases that use this but one of them is in Castle Coneria right where you start.
