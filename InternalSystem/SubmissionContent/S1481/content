	"This is the run for Link's Awakening, using the screenwarp glitch (explained below). Making this movie was a rough, but not very long path. Using the screenwarp glitch takes me to the very end of the eight and last dungeon in approxmiatly one and a half minute. Thousands of re-records later, I'm here with the finished result, which I'm very pleased of. It is also my first TAS-speedrun, and I didn't know anything about using  the emulator for this purpose until I started with this.

	"By pressing up, down and the button I have for my shield, the game thinks that Link is at a different position and that makes me take the sword earlier. Same thing as Chef_Stef did in his LA TAS. This can also be done with other combinations, which provides some funny sequences that I use in the movie (Link changing colour, Link turning into a shovel, Link becoming invisible...)

This is mostly because that the previous emulator version, 1.7.2, had less lag than this. This was nothing I could do anything about.

	": Right after I take the sword, I have to push the spiky thing one screen up to manipulate the spiky thing one screen down. If I would have taken damage from this one, I'd have died in the nightmare battle. Also, for some reason, I lost a frame when the Wind Fish disappeared, emulator issue I presume.
