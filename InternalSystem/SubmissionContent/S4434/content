	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"Since Shadow Dragon is a remake of FE1/3, the gameplay mechanics unfortunately got dumbed down in a variety of ways. To name a few:
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		"No rescuing

		"Dodging enemy attacks is very unreliable (based on how hit & avoid are calculated)
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"The lack of rescuing is especially painful because it means the most efficient way to beat a map before the existence of the warp staff is ALWAYS to move Marth as far towards the throne as possible, with every other character basically being inconsequential. As long as Marth has strong enough stats to clear the enemies he faces, he can solo maps with ease.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The warp staff is also quite different from the other games in the series in that it shows up remarkably early (chapter 3 of a 27 chapter-long game) and has infinite range. In contrast, the warp staves in FE6-8 have range bound by the warper’s mag stat divided by 2, and the warp staff doesn’t even exist in FE9-10. In fact, the only game that has a warp staff remotely as broken as Shadow Dragon is Thracia 776 (FE5).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Putting these factors together, the strategy for the TAS boils down as follows:
	$LF
]p
[ul 
	[li 
		"Prologue to Chapter 3: Marth solo with some minor assistance from Jagen
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Chapter 4 base: Forge Marth an overpowered rapier forge that will one-hit KO just about every boss in the game (since most bosses are armors/generals, in which case the rapier does 3x as much damage as its weapon might)
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Chapter 4 onwards: Lena or Boah warps Marth next to the boss, wait a turn, Marth kills the boss on enemy phase, seizes next player phase
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"If in a chapter where a thief drops a warp staff, have a cavalier injure the thief and Jagen (with a full inventory) finish off the thief, sending the acquired warp staff directly to the convoy. Lena or Boah will then retrieve the warp staff from the convoy (by moving adjacent to Marth).
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"Granted, that sounds quite simplistic and you might wonder why I would even bother to TAS a game I’m being so critical of. The thing is, what Shadow Dragon lacks in terms of strategic depth it makes up for in raw gameplay speed. With the ability to skip enemy phases, what remains gameplay-wise is unbelievably fast and relentless cursor movement, with the only breaks in action being level-up screens and cutscene skips between chapters. The menus themselves are faster and more fluid than in previous games. Enemies can be targeted by placing the cursor directly on them, and weapons can be switched dynamically when targeting an enemy. And of course every little animation is now skippable, whether it be the actual enemy attack, the exp bar afterwards, the animation for using a stat booster, the message that pops up for acquiring an item, all of it can be skipped to some degree, leading to an utterly frantic gameplay pace throughout.

[p 
	[b 
		"Attack Strategy
	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Since enemy phase is skipped, it’s often faster to place Marth beside a boss and wait a turn than to engage the boss on player phase. This avoids boss dialogue, potential level-up screens and item drops (unless Marth’s inventory is full).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	[b 
		"Item Drops
	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"A lot of the hard-to-follow menuing that occurs the turn before Marth seizes is him dropping unnecessary items in his inventory. This is to avoid being interrupted on enemy phase with a prompt to drop an item due to Marth’s full inventory.
	$LF
]p
[h2 
	"RNG
	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"The RNG is found at addresses 02196E08 to 02196E0B (credit to Nitrodon). Unlike previous games, cursor movement does NOT affect the RNG, although dialogue between characters does. Also, setting the DS’ internal game clock affects the beginning RNG seed. Unfortunately that’s about all I know about the game’s RNG, and it is the main source of known improvements for this run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"To manipulate the RNG, I choose a DS clock time of “January 1, 2009, 12:00:10 AM” since I found this would give Marth 3 points of defence on 4 level-ups in my RTA runs. I’m sure there’s a better starting RNG seed that could be chosen, but without knowing the formula for generating RNs, I would have to brute force through countless initial clock times for what would amount to probably weeks, if not months of tedious testing to save a few seconds. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Beyond that, I am forced to occasionally visit villages and let some percentage of dialogue play out to manipulate certain outcomes, usually landing a crit or forcing Marth to gain defence on his next level-up. The most egregious example of this is having to play out roughly 7 seconds of dialogue in Endgame in order to get Marth a 7% critical on Medeus (the final boss).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Keep in mind that even if you could interpret the game’s RNG with the same precision and power as the lua scripts used for FE6-8, you’re still limited to clumsily waiting through dialogue in villages to burn an RN every few frames, meaning very little RNG manipulation is possible no matter how well you understood it. In particular, I don’t see any way that a DS clock time could be deterministically chosen to ensure an unmanipulated crit on Medeus.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I do have to admit that I goofed up a bit and left the Message Speed on Norm instead of Fast. The fastest setting (Max) essentially presents chunks of dialogue at once, which burns less RNs than letting one character appear on the screen at a time. However, Fast still writes the text on screen character-by-character while doing so faster than Norm. I only realized this at Endgame and tried to edit the movie file to implement this change, but immediately ran into problems when the RNG in Prologue-III changed unexpectedly. This mistake probably cost about 5 seconds over the course of the run, which I didn't deem significant enough to restart the run from scratch.

	"Sacrificing Characters
	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"Apparently Marth is some kind of huge asshole that likes to callously sacrifice half his army in the glorious pursuit of saving frames.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In all seriousness, Shadow Dragon has this oddity whereby even the death quote of a fallen ally is skipped if you skip enemy phase, meaning you lose absolutely no time by letting non-essential characters die. So unlike other games, it’s generally better to leave vulnerable characters in danger than to move them into safety. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This does present its own complication, however. Namely, you want to optimize who does and doesn’t die because it affects the unit slot order in your army, and therefore the starting position of your characters on each map. If you see me doing odd things such as having Abel attack a mage in chapter 15, that’s the reason why.
	$LF

[h2 
	"Clone Glitch
	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"In Chapter 20 you’ll see what appears to be Lena warping an empty slot 1 space up, only to have Marth appear on that very space. Basically when you warp a character and skip the warp animation quickly enough, an invisible clone of the character you just warped remains on that square. Now if you attempt to warp that invisible clone, the original character will be sent to the location that the clone is being warped to.
