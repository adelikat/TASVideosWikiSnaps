	"After making our way up we come across the first slope in the game. Now is a good time to talk about movement speed. Normally, your speed increases by increments of 2 until it hits 20, the max running speed. for some reason 20 movement speed moves you in this interval of pixels: 1 1 1 2, 1 1 1 2, and it repeats for as long as your movement speed is 20. This means it takes 10 frames for you to reach max speed, but each increment of 2 is not enough to gain you another pixel, that only happens at certain periods where your accumulative speed values are enough for the game to register that you have enough to "go faster"
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Now, entering a slope will put your speed at 33. This seems a bit odd, but also appears enough to move you at a constant 2 pixels per frame. Because this game loves inconsistent coding, swinging your club or weapons while on a slope does not slow you down. In fact you can turn around and face the other direction and your speed will remain 33. The only way it will change is if you jump or reach the end of the slope, where it will drop to 20 immediately. There is no way to preserve 33 speed off of the slope (that is known anyway).

Also the jumps over the dragons seem awkward but there is only 1 jump height in the entire game, including both characters jump the same height. I'll go ahead and post this here, the only way to jump shorter is to switch to barney 1 frame before jumping.

	"Next up is the first forced rope climbing segment of the game, so let's talk about these tightropes. Barney is the only character that can grab these and climb up them. Jumping into them as barney will cause an invisible collision with the rope, stopping you in place, unless you are shooting a projectile or special weapon. In that case you ignore the collision until that particular animation is over. Alternatively you could swap back to fred since he doesnt have collision with ropes but that costs a frame to switch characters. Also if barney grabs the very left edge where the rope starts he can actually be pulled forward by 7 pixels. This can't always be used however because letting go after grabbing a rope will reset your movement speed back to 0. Also, if you hold A you can shimmy along the rope, at a reduced speed of 1 pixel/frame, so you want to do this as little as possible. When hanging onto these ropes barney can pull himself up by pressing U on the d-pad. While this animation is shorter it can also be cancelled midway by switching to fred. This is used for the final dismount because pulling yourself up for 1 frame puts you 18 pixels higher, meaning you can land on the next ledge much sooner.

	"Just after this, we now come to the raft section of this level. Your character behaves very bizarrely on this raft when you're in the air. This is because the game is trying to auto correct your character to be above the raft, so it adds your speed to the raft's speed as long as you are in the same Y axis plane as the raft. Timing the raft to give you a +4 pixel boost on the last frame of it's existence puts you slightly farther ahead than just falling off the raft as early as possible. There are also several minor glitches in this segment listed in the resources page. Funny, but useless.

When damaging the triceratops he'll enter a long invincibility faze where he'll run to the other side of the room before crashing into the wall. The direction he runs is entirely based on which direction fred is facing when damaging the boss. There is a trick where you can actually swing your club behind you by turning around the frame before swinging your club. This causes the triceratops to run to the center of the stage instead, shortening his invincibility time considerably. Afterwards, grab the item that appears as high as possible to end the stage as early as possible.

If you're going WITH a conveyor, your speed changes from 1,1,1,2.... to 2,2,2,3. So, all the conveyor is doing is offsetting your pixel count while you're in contact with it. Fred can actually grab the edges of the conveyor as though they were cliffs, but for some reason he can't climb down them if they are attached to solid ground.

	"Just after the conveyor section we come across an impossible gap to cross, filled with a tightrope below. This means we must swap to barney to grab the rope in order to proceed. Firing a slingshot projectile into a block at the peak of your jump gets rid of one of them early. Then, throwing an axe will prevent barney from hitting the invisible barrier on the rope. After pulling myself back up on the rope, fire 2 slingshot projectiles as early as possible to get rid of 2 more blocks so that fred has enough space to walk in there. (If I never said before, fred has a larger vertical hitbox than barney). While walking on the block near the floor you can press B+A on the same frame for a frame perfect club swing while jumping. This is just enough to destroy the block above without the need to ever stop moving.

[div class=p 
	"After this we eventually come to the elevator section of the cave, where I actually found a completely new strategy. By loading the first set of elevators but stalling as early as possible so as to avoid spawning the second set of elevators for a bit, you can make sure that one of those platforms is in a position where you can just run and jump off it, and not have to wait for it. Also the tops of these pulleys do act as conveyors so they are increasing your speed by walking on it. Near the slopes just after this I found that you actually can jump shorter on slopes by firing a weapon just before jumping.. but you have to be moving DOWN the slope for this to work. The reason this was important is because with this variation I wanted to land early to get speed from the opposite downwards section of the slope as early as possible. It was actually very close to jumping normally, it came down to which one would produce less lag.

	"Finally you jump on the cart and enter the cart autoscroller. I won't go into much detail but the cart acts similarly to the raft from the forest stage before, where you will gain speed as long as you are in the cart's Y-axis. not much to say, but moving while on the cart actually does increase your x-speed value to a max of 40, which for some reason in this instance it does NOT go back down after you jump off the cart. This can be abused at the end to jump into the end of the stage.

He found that sometimes he was killing a spider boss in 1 less hit than before, and this was baffling me as well as I couldn't figure out why. We were thinking it was a double hit for a while but actually what I found was happening was swinging the club on the same frame as a previous club swing ended will combine the damage of both of them on the same frame. With a slow club, you can deal 4 damage with a basic club by overlapping them in this manner. So with that in mind, now let's move on to the boss.

Normally it would be advised to hit the boulders that fall from the ceiling with fred as this deals 11 damage (it hits the caveman twice, for 6 and 5 on consecutive frames). However, I discovered that turning around and throwing an axe with the hitbox inside the caveman can have the same double hit effect, dealing 12 damage (2 consecutive hits of 6 damage). This can only be used as a last hit as you can not avoid taking damage by doing this. This just barely beats out the old strat of using 2 boulders to kill him, as he is dead before the boulders would even be low enough to hit him.

However with this boss you can't get close enough to the monkey to hit it with anything else other than barney's slingshot which only deals 1 damage each. But since it does 2 damage now we can use 3 10 damage hits. A bowling ball is used for the first hit because there is not enough time between the slingshot and fully charging your club for a 10 damage club hit. his invincibility is so long after the bowling ball hit that you do have time to charge your club fully now.

	"When you reach the end of that boulder section there is a segment where you would normally have to wait for the boulder to fall in the lava to make a platform for you to jump on. However, you can grab the ledge as fred since that will reset your vertical momentum. This is just enough to make it to the other rock that is already down there. I tried to reach the rock without grabbing the ledge but it is ~1 pixel away from being possible. Infuriating.

It is always faster to jump onto this platform because your vertical momentum will force it to recognize you earlier, even if you are still on the ledge technically. There is a small glitch where the platform can carry you through the ground and you can zip yourself out the bottom of the screen, but it kills you.

	"This screen starts you on the platform you were on in the previous screen. Originally I had waited the whole length of the ride down, but I noticed if you were facing right the platform would pull you considerably far into the spike platforms before you took damage. I combined this with intentionally taking damage in a cramped space so that I could bypass taking damage from the spiked platform below. However I was unsuccessful at actually making it all the way through and I tried switching to barney for a smaller hitbox, but that seemed to have no effect. I abandoned the idea actually for quite a while until I remembered that ducking exists. If you duck as barney your hitbox is actually low enough that the game will eject you downwards before you even take damage. This initially saved 44 frames but a lot was lost due to the unfavorable platform cycles below.

	"Now we come to the only place where a wall clip trick was actually useful. By switching to fred under these spikes we can get a really short invincibility window because he bounces rapidly between the floor and the ceiling. And since we have invincibility frames I can jump up through the spike block. If you are far enough into the block without facing the block (that will push you out of it immediately) you can actually turn around and get a 1 frame window to jump from. This cuts having to walk all the way to the right and climb up as fred, saving around 92 frames.

	"Next we see a return of the caveman from earlier though he is a bit different. He has only 20 hp and a lot longer invincibility window than before. I tried to double hit him but it seems like he is immune to it. When he's dead an alligator seesaw will spawn. This seesaw can be used to launch you and the distance is based on which character you are currently. Barney will launch further than Fred. So, if you swap to barney it will throw you higher and you can switch to fred midair to actually slow you down. This was just enough to make it into the gap without having to land and jump first, which is slightly slower than the old strat of using the bonus room above.

I thought that the level was moving downwards independently of your character so I wanted to do rapid character swaps midair to make the ledges without having to climb.

You have to club the blocks that you land on, and because of the awkward hitbox of the club it is impossible to destroy the block directly below you, so you have to run a bit to reach the gap.

Bowling ball 10 damage since it will reach the boss faster than your club will. Next a fully charged club does 10 leaving him with 4. You know what that means, overlapping 6 damage club will finish him off. Unfortunately the boss's corpse always flies left so there is no saving time by having him fly off screen.

Should be noted that if there were around 50 more frames to save before this point it would put the bowling ball on a good cycle to get 2 bowling ball hits in earlier.

I would love to see a completely new strategy discovered, as this game is actually enjoyable to work on.
