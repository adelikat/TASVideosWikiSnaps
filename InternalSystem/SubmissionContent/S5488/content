				" I made an embarassing noob error in my published movie, the score tally screens at the end of levels can be skipped...by simply holding start.  About 40 seconds were saved by fixing this.

			[li 
				" It turns out that bombable objects can also be skipped by moving left and right.  This one is harder to pull off because it requires jumping and a very precise input pattern to pull off.  This is the biggest source of improvements.  The most notable use of this is the prehistoric level where most of the level is skipped by going through the stone wall at the beginning

		" Dinosuar boss skip
		$LF
		[ul 
			[li 
				" You can skip the boss fight entirely by bringing the bone up to the top and restarting the game just before he attempts to eat you. The dinosuar will eat you during the exit level animation and puts the game into a broken state. It puts you back at the level select but gives you the key anyway.  Unfortunately it does not unlock the later levels, but never fear!  We can still access them by glitching through the cover of the furnace in the basement (the cover is supposed to keep you from getting in until all levels have been completed)
