	"Longer explanation:At the start we go down to the black key and put it below the screen so that it wraps around the map to go into the room we need to go. We then reset the console(doing this only teleports us back to the start it doesn't accualy reset progress). Then we go up to where there is this purple thing that lets you go through walls, we use this to get the black key and unlock the door we need to go through to get the trophy, then with the trophy we use the purple thingy to quickly go back to the start room we need to go to to beat the level

	"Possible improvement: there are a few times where we need to slow down to pick up items due to item cycles, the game can only render 3 sprites at a time, so if there is more then 3 sprites in a room they cycle through disipering maybe if you could manipulate the order of what items dislper(I tried but couldint find away) you wouldint need to wait

	": Wow, this really came out of nowhere and surprised me! Cutting nearly 4 seconds off of a 31 second run of a 41 year old game is one of the things I love most about the evolving nature of speedrunning and TASing as artforms. Excellent usage of the bridge to save time wherever possible, somehow for an item that essentially lets you walk through walls I never imagined it could be used the way it is in this run.

	" having a TAS of a single case obsoleted by one with all 5 cases. I'm mentioning this since I know you were working on that, asking for help on the 3rd level. If you're still interested in that, feel free to upload that file to
