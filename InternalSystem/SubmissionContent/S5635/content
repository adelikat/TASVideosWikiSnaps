	": This is a decent effort for a first TAS, but the discussion topic shows that it still needs a bit more work - the fact that 
	[a href=/forum/p/457704#457704 
		"119 frames
	]a
	" can be saved in the first level alone, plus other minor errors given in the topic that could be improved, shows me that a second pass is needed to make a TAS that truly pushes this game to the limit. I'm rejecting this movie, but I do look forward to seeing an improved version.
