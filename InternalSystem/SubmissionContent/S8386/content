	"Pressing L+R in this game serves a few purposes. When moving, this will let Kawauso continue to travel through walls or floors while also increasing the hex value at 007A. This is the RAM value used to count how long the player has been holding the attack button. If you release L+R while this value is at a value that is normally only reached mid-attack (such as 0A), you will have a constant active hurtbox. This resets every screen change. If you are mid-jump, L+R will scroll the screen, causing Kawauso to shoot to the left. This is useful to move quickly or at the beginning of some stages to despawn some enemies enemies.
