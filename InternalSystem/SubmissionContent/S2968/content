[p 
	"Mega Man ZX, released for the Nintendo DS in 2006, is the successor game/series of the Mega Man Zero series, and is the third spinoff series of the Mega Man franchise. Unlike the previous series, you don't directly select your stage and teleport there, but you accept "missions" and find the area yourself in a Metroidvania setting, where almost all areas are connected.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Instead of being a badass robot, you play as a human, either male or female (chosen at the start of the game), who can do badass-robot-like things using Biometals, which transform (Megamerge) into suits armors and come from ancient heroes from earlier series. Mega Man ZX contains Models X, Z, H, F, L, P and W, which are based on Mega Man X, Zero, Harpuia, Fefnir, Leviathan, Phantom and dr. Weil, from the X and Zero series, respectively. The player uses Model X, which can Double Megamerge with Z, H, F, L and P to form ZX, HX, FX, LX and PX respectively.

[p 
	"When the player uses an attack while in wall climbing motion, he'll regain directional control sooner. This allows the player to kick wall faster, making you climb faster.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In addition, Model HX also has the ability to air-dash in between the wallkicks, eliminating the 1-frame short downwards movement in between wallkicks. This allows you to wall-climb even faster.

		"Spike walljumping
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[p 
	"When your X is just right when moving towards a spike wall, there's an one frame gap to jump off it. Because your X becomes inconvenient for spike walljumping after doing this, you can only do it once on the same wall. Except for HX, which can hover to change speed and thus X value into something you can use to walljump with.
	$LF

	"This can also be done off a corner boost (see below).

[p 
	"Airdashing as Model HX lowers your character's height. If you're under a ceiling near a wall when your airdash ends, you will be ejected about 20 pixels max towards the wall, away from the ceiling. This is especially used in Area M-2, where it's used under a spike ceiling.

	"We chose this stage first, because Model HX's superior movement abilities such as faster wallclimbing, airdashing (both sideways and upwards), as well as even being superior to ZX in beating neutral-element bosses, not to mention killing fire-elemental bosses in just a few hits using the Overdrive Invoke System.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Even with just model ZX, Hivolt got beaten pretty quickly. We tried to avoid hitting his weak spots as much as possible where avoiding it didn't cost time, and ended up with bossfight level 2: just enough to manage throughout stages (although with lots of weapon energy refilling).

Even though it's filled with spikes. On Pandora, elemental weaknesses work differently than on any other boss, and she doesn't take extra damage from fire and ice. So we use HX to defeat her instead.

For the bosses, Prometheus & Pandora sharing a bigger life bar, we use HX to abuse Prometheus' weakness. But unlike last time, he can't the same move he used last time because there are no walls here now. He's defeated quickly anyway, by use of tornado.

[p 
	"A boring autoscroller elevator stage for the final stage. We tried our best to make something entertaining of it during the elevator sections, while basically murdering the 8 Pseudoroids like last time. We need to use HX for both final boss fights, so we had to have a full weapon energy bar when we reach Serpent, which needed some pretty intense manipulation in the final corridor before the boss. The final battle is primarily plagued by the limited weapon energy bar on Model HX, but we manage to finish off both phases of the final battle quickly anyway.

	"Mothrayas' comments: Well, that went quick. Where the Mega Man ZX Advent run took me nearly 6 months to get done, this run took less than one month. I guess that's what you get when you have a partner like Rolanmen1 to work alongside with. It's really convenient when you come back from school/work and you see another stage done in your PM box, or when you find yourself in a tricky situation in the TAS and you find that situation done in your PM box the next day.
