	": Hello Daniel_1RD, this run is obviously a large improvement from your previous submission. It seems that you learned a lot by redoing the run. However, there are still some serious problems. Minimal effort was put into basic optimization in certain sections - if it's noticeable even to the naked eye, then that isn't acceptable. Specific examples were posted in the thread for you to consider. It's always a good idea to review our

	" for some basic optimization advice. You should always be trying to push every part of the run to its limits.
