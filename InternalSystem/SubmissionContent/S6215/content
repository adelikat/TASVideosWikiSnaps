	"Star Voyager (or Cosmo Genesis in Japan) is a interstellar exploration/space shooter where the placment of planets and possible upgrades are entirely random each time you start a new game. this requires some exploration if you want to make the battles at the end easier. game is notoriously difficult with floaty ship controls, and very difficult battle mechanics

	"due to the floaty nature of the way the ship handles, and the jumpy movment of enemy fleets, motherships are very diffcult to consistently pick off. other than that, the rest of the game is fairly easy

Given the nature of the game and lack of interesting features that make this submission stand out, this does not qualify for eligibility into the Moons tier. Overall audience response mostly has been lukewarm at best to cold at worst. That being said...
