	"For this any%, I chose the Selkie race, a physical fighter, in contrast of the Yuke used for my All Dungeon TAS. It's also really loved for RTA runs. For this run, I want to get the easiest strength artifacts, the fastest dungeons, and the most optimised money route. Indeed, since I'm a fighter, I need better weapons, and it costs a bit.

	"The japanese version is used because, since the food boosts stay on after loading zones, it's faster.

	"The big difference with the All Dungeons and this TAS is the fact I use physical attacks. It creates some amazing bosses, wich need to be manipulated for a pleasing result.

	"Timesave exists in the form of better RNG mostly. Even if I manipulate a lot, it's clear improvements could be made. But not easily.
