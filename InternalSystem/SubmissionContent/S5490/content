	" is an Atari platforming game released for Atari 7800 and 
	(__wikiLink|displaytext=Atari Lynx|href=/3267M)
	". This movie runs through the 7800 version. The plot of both versions is essentially the same: Louie has his dog Scraps kidnapped by mob boss Mr. Big, and Louie has to track him down (with Mr. Big's occasional clue by letter or phone)

	"There are some significant differences between the 7800 and Lynx versions of the game:
	$LF
]div
[ul 
	[li 
		" 7800 has a grittier, "mature", and less diverse art style compared to the more colorful and cartoony Lynx.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Related to the above, Louie looks childish in the Lynx version. In the 7800 version, he looks like a homeless alcoholic hobo.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" The 7800 version has no boss fights, only a "boss puzzle" at the end of the final stage. The Lynx version has a bossfight for every world.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" The Lynx version has 7 worlds with diverse environments to visit. The 7800 version has 6 worlds, but each repeats the same themes (junkyard, street, sewer) until the final stage, which is a warehouse.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" The 7800 version has no warps.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" The 7800 has only a limited amount of cans for Louie to throw, although he can get more from defeating enemies, visiting shops, etc.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" All things said, the 7800 version seems much worse, but - Louie does run 
		[em 
			"much
		]em
		" faster in the 7800 version. Maybe that'll help offset things a tad.
