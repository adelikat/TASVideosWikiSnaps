	"This video is the first track done in 40.67 seconds, about

	"1.8 seconds faster than Player1's time.  The route and the 
	$LF
	"tricks are very nearly the same, but I got very lucky and
	$LF
	"made a pixel-perfect jump that gave me a lot of extra
	$LF
	"velocity, which gave me a much faster second lap.  I tried 
	$LF

	"For future Excitebike timeattackers, here's a description

	"of some of the exploitable tricks:
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-Use the B button to maintain your velocity while on the
	$LF
	"ground, but release it in the air to let your engine cool
	$LF
	"off
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-Holding right while in the air increases your velocity
	$LF
	"slighty.  However, you cannot land while tilted all the way 
	$LF
	"forwards, so just before you land, press left.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-After landing like this, you will bounce on your front
	$LF
	"wheel.  Hold right to increase your velocity.  This time,
	$LF
	"you don't have to press left to avoid crashing, even though 
	$LF
	"you're tilted all the way forwards.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-In a total violation of real-life physics, jumping off
	$LF
	"some ramps increases your forward velocity significantly.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"This is where your main speed boosts come from.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"-While going off a ramp, you can change lanes to affect the 
	$LF
	"distance you jump slightly.  Up decreases the distance
	$LF
	"slightly, while going down increases the distance slighty.
	[br 
	]br
	$LF
	"This is because your bike does not move while in the air,
	$LF
	"but its landing position (i.e. the lane) changes.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"I hope that more players will make timeattacks for this
	$LF
	"game in the future!  They are very entertaining to watch
	$LF
	"and require very precise timing to make!
