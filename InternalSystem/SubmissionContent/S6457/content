For downward transition, we are are at the edge of the door, we can enter the door in crouched state, which saves about 15 frames. After getting the drone, it is faster to enter any door with the drone rather than Trace.

When pushing into a wall with a ceiling, and with very precise movement, the enemy and Trace can zip quickly upward. The zipping can be interrupted by destroying the drone. When it happens, the zipping may become horizontal, to the left or the right depending on the frame when the drone is destroyed. It is used in this run to skip the boss that guards the grapple, to reach the grapple room.

	"If the drone happens to be outside of the limits of an area, it is instantly warped to the coordinates of its latest valid location. However, only the coordinates are stored, not in which area are these coordinates from. As a consequence, one can launch and destroy the drone at certain coordinates in one area, more to another one, get outside the limits of the area and launch the drone. It will warp to the stored coordinates in the new area.

	", there is no floor below the purple water, so Trace can launch the drone there. It is used in the present run to warp to the top of Kur by placing the drone latest valid coordinates in the previous area (Indi). The second way is using the Backdoor glitch described in the grapple tricks section below (not used in this run).

If Trace appears partially inside a wall, he is moved toward the closest free position (also depending what direction is held next). If he appears completely inside a wall, he is moved back to its previous position. If on the next frame, we hold the backward direction, then Trace will move up to the vertical position he had before the grapple did connect (here is

After getting the Address Disruptor 2, we make a detour to get the Grapple, which will save a lot of time. It was also possible to take it latter in the run with a much shorter detour, but because it speeds up movement a lot, it is better to take it as soon as possible. Because we don't have our save point at the beginning of the game anymore, we have to go back through Indi. The rest of the run is unchanged, with some skips using grapple tricks: skipping the climb to Vision, skipping the climb to Enhanced Drone Launch (saves a couple of seconds at most in TAS), skipping most of the Temple, skipping Sentinel.

Save-warping comes first and looks reasonable but not surprising. Then Bionic Commando insanity starts. At first you don't clearly see what the time difference is, then this run catches up and leaves the previous one behind easily, although it clearly looks more elaborate this time!
