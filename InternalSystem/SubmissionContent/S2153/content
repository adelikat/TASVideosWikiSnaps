	"Doko Kashira Door. I don't really know what it means, but it allows you to finish the game in under five minutes. I'm not too much into Pokemon, but I do remember playing it when I was a kid, which is partly the reason I came to doing this TAS. I saw a video, hosted on YouTube, the Doko Kashira Door glitch. I quickly looked up a Pocket Monster Green run (non TAS), and there was one up. It was pretty slow. I never thought of looking for a TAS, but unfortunately, there was/is faster by Mike Tryczak (Primo).
