Most of the lag happens during the game's draw loop, meaning Lara's position technically still updates during the lag, so this was not very impactful. Although it made it harder to optimally move through a few areas, but nothing more than a 1 or 2 frames loss.

]h3
[ul 
	[li 
		" Corner bug: By clipping inside corners, the game thinks we are inside the wall we clipped in. which technically to the game means we are very deep in the floor (think of walls are raised up floors, if that makes sense), so the game corrects Lara's position, shooting us upwards.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Flare Wall Bug: Same as the corner bug, but using the flares allows us to clip in the middle of walls, not only on corners!
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Dive Bug: If Lara performs a dive to a wall and hits the exact point where it meets the floor, Lara lands on the floor without taking any damage, even if the height would have normally killed her.
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" QWOP: A glitch when the game thinks Lara is falling, when in reality she is on the floor. As a result, the game keeps trying to push Lara below the floor at an incrementing rate. after a while the rate becomes as big as a step, forcing Lara to do the "step up" animation, and since this happens every frame, Lara is stuck in that animation, resembling the infamous QWOP game. This is useful when the rate becomes as big as half a block, where Lara can do a small vault- she travels below the floor ignoring all objects and collision, effectively skipping (some) doors etc. (does not work on all doors due to the rooms-portal system the game is built over)
		$LF
	]li
]ul
[ul 
	[li 
		" Flare Cancel: Throwing a flare while Lara performs the landing animation makes her skip the landing and go straight to the next needed animation. sounds insignificant but each landing animation can be as long as 2 seconds! (Fun fact, devs knew about this, in fact they introduced it on purpose to avoid a soft lock!)
