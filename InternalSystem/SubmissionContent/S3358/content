	"Castlevania - Order of Ecclesia is the Castlevania series of the third work of Nintendo DS.

	"In the front, unlike two works, the map is stage form. 
	$LF
	"If each stage is not cleared, the next stage will appear. 
	$LF
	"Although the character which can be chosen first is only "Shanoa", "Albus" can be chosen once it clears.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"This TAS aims at the fastest clearance by Albus which can be chosen once it clears by Shanoa. 
	$LF
	"The features of Albus are that it can leap to the place which pushed the touch pen, and the invincibility in Backdash. 
	$LF
	"This "a touch pen warp" and "Backdash" are used for movement. 
	$LF
	"If a touch pen warp is used, it will consume MP 30 times. 
	$LF
	"MP takes the time of 60 frames to resume recovery, once it consumes in a form of some kind, although it recovers one time to one frame. 
	$LF
	"It is necessary to use this touch pen warp and backdash properly well.
