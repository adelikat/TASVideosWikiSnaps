	"This is a TAS of Super Mario Bros where the left button is never pressed. This is the first TAS I am publishing, so it probably has some mistakes. You can point out any mistakes or improvements you find in the comments and I will include those changes in the next TAS.

[div class=p 
	"Route: The routing was the most difficult part of this TAS. At first glance, the warp zones seem impossible, because you must press left to go in one of the pipes. The speedrun strategy in 1-2 is also impossible because clipping into the pipe requires you to press left. There is still a way to clip into the wall that I will get to later. Once you clip, you need to load the warp zone so that the pipes take you to the right place. If you don't, you will be taken to the minus world if you go down the first or third pipe, and world 5 if you go down the second pipe. The 4-2 warp zone is impossible without the left button, so it makes sense to go to world 5 by going down the middle pipe without loading the warp zone. After that, the levels in worlds 5, 6, 7, and 8 are played normally.

[div class=p 
	"1-1: The first level is played normally with some exceptions. The underground section can't be played perfectly because it requires you to hold left to not bump into the pipe. FPG is impossible for all of the levels because it requires you to hold left. (8-1 may be an exception, but I didn't go for it.)

[div class=p 
	"1-2: At the start if 1-2, I grab a mushroom. The quickest way I found was to wait until Mario grabbed the mushroom, then get back to running speed as fast as possible. The mushroom grab could probably be improved the most. After the second elevator gap, I jump up to the ledge and bump into it to slow Mario down. By duck-jumping and landing on a block that makes up the wall of the pipe below the ceiling, you can stand on that block for one frame before being pushed out. If you uncrouch on that frame, the top half of Mario will be fully inside a block. From there you can start running inside the wall and use the warp zone to go to world 5 by going in the middle pipe with the warp zone unloaded. This part could also be improved with a faster clip, but this clip was surprisingly hard to do quickly.

	"5-2: I want to grab a fire flower before the Bowser fights because killing Bowser, the bridge animation is skipped, saving about 6-7 framerules each time. Fire flowers are harder to grab because they don't move to the right. I was able to grab a fire flower in 5-2 by slowing down by not holding right, then jumping to reveal the fire flower. Mario landed from his jump half-way off the floor. By jumping again. Mario clipped partially inside the block and grabbed the mushroom inside the block. This is similar to how speedrunners grab powerups in warpless.

	"6-1: In this level, the remaining time ends in a 1. If the remaining time of any non-castle level is a 1, 3, or 6, you will get the corresponding number of fireworks. Ending with 1 firework doesn't lose any time, but ending with 3 or 6 does.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"6-2: If you don't slow down at all in this level, you will finish with a time of 343, which will cause 3 fireworks to go off, losing time. To combat this, I intentionally slow down to avoid ending with a 3.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"6-3: Again, in this level, if you don't slow down, you will end with 256. By not holding B at the beginning of the level, Mario is slowed down enough to barely miss a 256.

[div class=p 
	"7-1: This is the 4th level in a row that I need to slow down to avoid fireworks. I do this by letting go of B on the top of the stairs.

[div class=p 
	"8-2: At the end of 8-2, I perform the BBG. This is done by bouncing off a Bullet Bill into the flagpole. Mario grabs the flag inside the block and is pushed out. When Mario hits a block after touching the flagpole, the level end sequence is played. Mario is pushed out of the block and immediately touches the flagpole base. This ends the level early and saves time.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"8-3: This is another level that you must slow down to avoid fireworks. I slow Mario down by bumping into the last block in the stairs.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"8-4: This is the last level in the game. 8-4 is a maze level. You must go down the correct pipes to progress to the next section. In the first room, the plant disappeared before Mario went down the pipe. This happens because the screen changes and all enemies on the screen disappear. Mario is able to jump off the wall in the next room because the pipe is made up of individual blocks. Mario can stand on one of those blocks for one frame before he is pushed out. By jumping on that frame, you can jump off walls.

[div class=p 
	"Conclusion: I know that this isn't the perfect TAS and could probably be improved by someone who knows more about the game than I do. I also didn't play my run out on the framerule level. BBG in 8-2 was accidental and I never intended for it to happen. I got lucky with firebars in 5-4 and 6-4, but other than that, this TAS could be improved a lot.
