	"Every level except for the pod collecting levels was improved by at least 10-30 frames.

	"The major improvements are as follows:

[ul 
	[li 
		"Level 1: 4 seconds improved from faster handling

	]li
	[li 
		"Level 2: collect more pods upgrade more ammo

	]li
	[li 
		"Level 5: Killed monster faster with upgraded weapons and moved to the edge of the screen to exit faster
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Level 6: Intentionally missed a target to avoid 1-up (72 frames)
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Level 7: Saved only 1 person (120 frames saved)
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Level 9: Most of the savings were a result from this level. When the road forked I went right instead of left, cost 22 frames but allowed a different route later on
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Level 20:  The better route allowed the icebergs to be replaced with logs, this allowed for an 8 second improvment. also the timer was :50 instead of 1:20 allowing another 90 frames saved after it counted down the timer at the end of the level.  In addition I did not need to use the "force" saving it for the red dragon boss
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Level 21:Used the whirlpools to proplel me around faster, saving 3 seconds
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Level 23:Used the "force" to defeat the red dragon instead of waiting for the timer to expire saving over 10 seconds!
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"Also, on all boss fights holding A before the fight will allow you to get in a cheap shot, knocking one bar off of their life.  This allowed me to beat all the bosses slightly faster.
		$LF
	]li

	"Also, their are places where a shoot that seemingly hits nothing.  Those are to manipulate luck.  Turrets usually don't fire if you fire just before they appear on the screen.

	"Well that's it

	":  Cancelled my submission due to finding a way to manipulate pods in level 1; allowing the ability to get speed upgrades and complete the stage several seconds faster.  This will also result in upgrading sooner, saving more time later.
