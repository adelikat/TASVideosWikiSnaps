	"Phantasy Star 3 is a little different from the rest of the series, but still a good RPG by itself, featuring 3 generations and 4 possible endings (all similar, but different characters and plot). It's one of my old favorites on the Genesis, so I decided to try it.

	"To determine random battles, a step countdown is used: it's reset randomly (16-79) in specific situations (map change, battle start, fullscreen text) and can only be manipulated by waiting before each reset. Because of this, battles can't be avoided completely, but can still be distanced a bit.

Sure enough, the king is still there waiting for a rematch, while Maia decided brown was better than blue. Once the king is defeated, the 1st generation ends again ... leading to the 3rd generation!
