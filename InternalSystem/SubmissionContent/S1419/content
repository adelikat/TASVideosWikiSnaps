	"This is my second run of Mario 64 and by far the biggest difficulty I encountered was doing the run in a way that would seem new to most people, I personally think there is just enough justification to watch it over the previous submissions .Most of the time saved came from the over world route and execution, although generally there is small frame shaving improvments throughout the game which will most likely go unnoticed, since improvements were so difficult to find I actually save a lot of time through avoiding lag. I admit my run isn't perfect but there can't be that much improvement.

	"This movie improves on Rikku's previous submission by over 7 seconds, Most of the time saved came from not saving at any point since there is a brief period where the the select bar can move but you can't select and options. I also used a slightly different overworld route which saved time as well, but generally everything else is just frame shaving improvements.
