	", are any items which can be used indefinitely once collected and include the boat, axe, and key. Once acquired, a flag is set for each which tells the game that the player can pass through rivers, forests, or gates respectively. These tools are only found in blue, red, and purple mountains respectively. Collecting any of these tools multiple times will have no effect. Quivers of arrows, while it can be argued that they are items, are NOT considered tools.

	"The TAS will require going through three mountains to collect the three tools, and finally Cloudy Mountain to get both crown halves and beat the game. The most optimal path through each mountain requires the tool be in a chamber adjacent to the starting one with the exit ladder adjacent to the one containing the tool (all RNG-determined). To know immediately whether we get a layout satisfying this condition, RAM addresses 0x11132A and 0x11132B tell you the chamber X and Y positions of the tool, while 0x111326 and 0x111327 tell the X and Y positions of the ladder. In Cloudy Mountain, these addresses instead indicate the locations of the two crown halves.

Well, there is another bug in this port of the game where the bottom row of graphics do not show up properly. The bottom light green bar is supposed to start one graphic unit lower, but instead it obscures part of the game... I don't know how that mistake was made. Anyway, there are actually passable mountains to enter down there. I first enter a blue mountain, then 
		[em 
			"effectively

Can't we just go through those three mountains slightly suboptimally then do the corner skip to get to Cloudy Mountain so much faster that we make up more time than we lost? Not quite. The corner skip will not work after you've entered three mountains,
