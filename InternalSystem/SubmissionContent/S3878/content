	"This run beats the current published run by 1040 frames (~17.3 seconds). This is mainly due to a major time saving trick in area 12, but there are many other improvements throughout the whole game. It's sort of an interesting game to make a TAS of as there's not really that many situations where optimization is a big issue. Searching for the best strategies is mostly what adds to the rerecord count. Once you've found the best strategy the optimization almost comes with it, even though there did exist some situations where it was necessary to carefully manipulate the subpixels in order to get a certain trick to work.
