	"In short, I noticed that if I do a jump with the sword or the grapnel cane, then the player will be able to double jump even when changing weapons.
	$LF

[p 
	"So, the only important thing is to jump with the sword or the grapnel cane because the game will automatically give a double jump. Then, I just need to change weapon and do a rolling attack to obtain this result.

	"774 frames were saved on MOSQUITO ALIEN that must normally be beaten by going on the back of one of his mosquitos. I found a more complicated method that consist of attacking him on land, manipulating his behavior by doing rolls so he backs up then coming back so he comes back and I take advantage of the short time it takes him to back up again to attack him. I also had to kill the other mosquito enemies that keep coming to prevent the game from lagging to the point of being unstable!

	"LAVA LEVEL 2.1:
	$LF

[p 
	"33 frames were saved with a well-timed spinning jump at the end of the level to reach a platform that was further on the lava, removing the need to do 2 jumps and one extra rolling length.

[p 
	"155 frames were saved with optimization on the BOSS with better attacks, a spinning jump with MAX DAMAGE and conclude with the usual stuff.
