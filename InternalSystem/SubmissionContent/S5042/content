I found a more complicated method that consist of attacking him on land, manipulating his behavior by doing rolls so he backs up then coming back so he comes back and I take advantage of the short time it takes him to back up again to attack him. I also had to kill the other mosquito enemies that keep coming to prevent the game from lagging to the point of being unstable!
