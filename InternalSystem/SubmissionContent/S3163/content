	"Puggsy was a puzzle-platformer released in 1993 for the Amiga, and later released in 1994 for the Sega Genesis. The feature that made it stand out from other Genesis games was that this game had a real-time physics based system which calculated each object's weight & trijectory. It also allowed for several objects to have distinct properties that other objects wouldnt posses. This system was very innovative & new for the time and wouldnt be used for over a decade untill the release of games like Half-Life & Max Pane where it became the Havok physics engine.

	": In order for this movie to sync, 
	[b 
		"you have to disable SRAM
	]b
	". This game uses SRAM as an anti-piracy tactic to prevent you from playing the rest of the game. This will also cause the first stage to desync as it slightly changes the physics of Puggsy.

	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Its no doubt that the physics are very simply coded and thus very abusable. Even the way objects bounce off walls can even be abused the wrong way. In one stage, a ball even manages to bounce the completely wrong way in order for me to catch it for use with the rest of the level.
	$LF

[p 
	[b 
		"The Pixel Trick
	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This trick is only mainly due to how the physics system handles grabbed objects. Whenever you grab an object, It will pull you towards a specific position relative to the object you are currently holding. This means that your velocity will also change. So, If you constantly let go & regrab an object, you will continuosly get pulled into position creating a boost. Although there are some objects which prohibit this trick from being useful due to their properties, it is very useful & saves many frames.

		"The Flying Glitch
	]b
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"As explained above, An object will try to center you into a fixed position in you grab it. Not only does this work horizontaly, but vertically too! This makes me gain the ability to jump very high which allows me to skip large portions of levels. However, This  glitch is limited to only on specific frames.

[p 
	"This game isnt very hex friendly. Sometimes the physics can change per stage, & there is a slight frame rule when exiting stages. As a result, it is not fully possible that I would have been able to optimize everything on this first try. However, I will say that its pretty damn close.

[p 
	"This game was hard for me to TAS. It might seem simple since its just a platformer. But due to the physics, It was hard to come up with solutions only to find out that they didnt work. I worked really hard, and I think it shows. I hope you guys enjoy this TAS as much as I did!
