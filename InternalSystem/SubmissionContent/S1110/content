	"This game is based on one of a series of Crash 'n' Boys games. I have included the game with also opening and ending that's hilarious. The addict level of this game is incredible. The animation is hilarious and the idea is super. I mean, we are talking about sports that involves iron hammerball golfing and jumping on rooftops. My difficulty in the game is to make sure the enemy moves the way I want to-- with hilarious stuff.
