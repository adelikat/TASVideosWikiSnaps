	"Cardcaptor Sakura: Clow Card Magic is a mix between a vertical shooter and a puzzle game where the main objective is to collect all 51 Clow Cards. The game features 10 different levels with each holding 5 Clow Cards, except for the 10th level where it is possible to collect 6 Clow Cards.
	$LF
	"Clow Cards are obtained by shooting different colored cards in the stages. By shooting colored cards you can fill up the Clow Cards frame or "gauge" and once full, you will obtain the Clow Card.

	"You enter a level with 4 empty Clow Cards and the task is to charge them up until the level ends. There is no real penalty in failing to do that, you just have to revisit the stage and get the remaining Clow Card(s). After collecting the 4 Clow Cards in a level you will be 
	$LF
	"awarded with a 5th Clow Card which represents the level you have played.

	"The player can move side to side on 6 different paths. If a wild colored card is on the same path as you then the path will take that colored cards hue. Shooting colored cards will charge up the Clow Cards frame, this can be done faster by

	"shooting colored cards that are in a "group" which can cause a chain reaction. The bigger the chain reaction the more points you get, thus filling the Clow Cards frame faster.

	"Surprise, there are actually 11 levels instead of 10. The final level is unlocked by having all 5 Clow Cards in 10 levels. You know you have 5 Clow Cards by looking at the level in the menu before entering it as the level will be marked with a red card.
	$LF
	"The final level does not have any visible Clow Cards to collect, but rather you charge up the Clow Cards frames which takes much longer than usual. Completing this task will drop an item from the sky, which can be picked up by Sakura to launch an attack on the boss, well atleast in the animation.

	"Mirror: Can be found starting at level 3, shooting a mirror will spawn a card in front of the mirror which can be shot. This is quite useless to me because it only spawns 1 card. It's only useful if the mirror is placed in a group of cards so i can connect them for a bigger chain reaction.

	"The mirror can be broken by shooting it several times.

[div class=p 
	"Black Card: Can be found starting at level 3. shooting a black card will absorb your shot. Black cards serve as walls in this game, though it is possible with tool assistance to go inbetween walls, but you only have a few frames for this. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"When Sakura collides with a Card, Mirror or Black Card she will fall down and lose some HP. Getting hit too many times will make you restart the level. Failing to collect cards will make you restart the level aswell.

[div class=p 
	"I think the only useful trick to me was being able to spawn cards in front of other cards. This can be achieved by shooting from a large distance onto a card. That only works if the card you are shooting at is barely rendered in.
	$LF
	"This trick helped me in the final level, because the faster you charge up the Clow Cards frames then the faster the item will drop from the sky for sakura to collect and launch the attack.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"However, sometimes spawning a card in front of a group of cards may ruin the chain reaction, so i had to test it everytime. It was quite exhausting to do and im glad the whole game is not like that.

	"This saves roughly 10-12s per level. I did not do it in this TAS for the following reasons:

]div
[div class=p 
	"1. It adds another layer of difficulty and im not even sure if this could be done on every level.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"2. I would have to avoid cards and sometimes even take damage just for this strategy to work. Avoiding cards and leaving them behind you makes an annoying sound which i didn't want in this TAS.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"3. Probability of this strategy not working because of damage taken or not collecting any cards and having to revisit the level. Also the probability of lots of my time being wasted.
