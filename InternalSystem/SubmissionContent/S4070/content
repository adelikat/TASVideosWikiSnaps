	"Two kinds were considered. It is route which manipulates memory and builts warp flag to the abyss, and route which goes without flag to Mine of Judgement. As a result, it turned out that the route which goes to Mine of Judgement is earlier. The result of having tested memory manipulation route is

To be sure, same flag is in 020F718B, and manipulating is possible.However, an event applicable after dead does not exist in SOMA. Therefore, it seems that it is impossible to skip SOMA. The details of TAS which submited are as follows.
