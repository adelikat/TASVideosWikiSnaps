	"Mega Man 4 Voyage is a heavily modified romhack of Mega Man 4, with completely new tiles, level design, weapons, minibosses  bosses AI, and a very unique soundtrack done exclusively for this romhack! This TAS tries to go as fast as possible using almost all weapons, there is a item in this game called Speed Boost, this item increase Mega Man's speed while he walk and climb ladders, this is a very useful item so you will see this all through this run.

	"Like any other romhack, you can change weapon with Select or even A and B of the second controller, this is very useful to change weapon almost instantly on the run. You can skip the get weapon animation from all the 8 Robot Masters fights like in the original Mega Man 4. There is another item in this game that replaces Wire, it's the Spike Guard, this item gives you invulnerability for a limited time, but this item will not save any time because you have to pass an entire new section on Ring Man Stage to pick this item and is not needed in any part (Fake Wily 3 almost, but you can do the spikes section without the Spike Guard).

	"You want to obtain the Speed Boost as soon as possible to use during all the run, that's why Bright Man is the first one on the route. Ring Man 2nd, his weakness is his own weapon but i don't have his weapon yet, i don't need any other weapon than Speed Boost for the stage itself so i can do it without problems and i can easily kill Ring Man with Mega Buster without losing any pattern or losing big time. The following order is by weakness, no other specific reason.

	"The Speed Boost is very useful in moments like when Mega Man is not sliding like jumping, falling and climbing ladders, this weapon wastes only when Mega Man is doing these three things. If you change weapon and back again to the Speed Boost just before you waste a bar, you can use that bar a bit more.

	"This game has a Speed Glitch that actually is a bit faster than the Speed Boost, in every Boss Fight before the Boss appears you have 1 frame to do any input, if you slide in this frame then you will gain speed with the weapon you have entered the room, the bad thing is if you do a slide again or if you change weapon the Speed Glitch dissapears and you will be with normal speed, this is useful on some Robot Masters, Fake Wily 2 (lasers section) and Fake Wily 3 (water section), not useful in Wily 2 because you have to change weapons on the fights.

	" one may argue that this hack is better, even though there's no perfectly clear indication. The main quality of this hack is that it looks like a completely different MM game: its levels are completely rewritten instead of being versions of the original game. It also relies on a variety of new gimmicks throughout the game instead of just 2. Accepting over
