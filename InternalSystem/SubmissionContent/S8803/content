	"a Pause Glitch is when i pause the game while Taven does a certain Movement like Rolling or Punching, or Kicking.  the Best example of this is when Taven starts rolling you. you can pause the game and what it does Taven instantly stop doing the roll animation. its useful for Movement so i hit sharp angles. if didn't use pause cancel then i wouldn't be able to control Taven until the rolling Animation is ended, Same thing with Kicking, Punching, and Throwing.

	"so what is a chest skip? well a chest skip is when taven hold the block button to keep the chest from not spawning, if you let go of block the chest will spawn. now after the fight when i uppercut enemy's at the fan. you can see i hold the block button to keep from spawning once i get to the part where it says i unlock the fireball ability i press buttons to cancel the chest animation im not sure why that works for like that. But here is the new Chest Skip after defeating the enemy's with a sword I did the same thing hold the block button, then the weapon disappeared i still hold the block to keep the chest from spawning so I can't do a regular roll so many times so i use a roll uppercut attack to hold the chest from spawning and the hardest part about that chest skip is i have to kill 2 enemy's to access to another area so i manage to make it work and i thought it wasn't possible.
