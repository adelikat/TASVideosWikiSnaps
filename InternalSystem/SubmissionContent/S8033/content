This can also be a problem if an enemy is right where you need to jump or if you need to jump but an enemy's shot is in the way then you might need to wait before jumping.

Also after im completely inside the barrier coming from the left trying to walk left will have the game try to stop me from going through the barrier from the right putting me completely on the otherside in a frame (it also works when coming from the right).
