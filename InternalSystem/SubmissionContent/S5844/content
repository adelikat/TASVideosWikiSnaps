	"Dragster, the game that Todd Rogers claimed to get 5.51, which is impossible even with TAS. Currently, 5.57 is the fastest time (Human and TAS).
	$LF
	"I think that we could eventually get 5.54 (as it is Atari's simulated fastest time) if we can do Todd Rogers' glitch.

	"In the future, I plan to do a run were both players get 5.57.  This would require both controllers to have the same inputs.
