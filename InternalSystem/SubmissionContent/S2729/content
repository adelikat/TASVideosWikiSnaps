	"It may look controversial,  but "as fast as possible" is not one of the goals on this TAS, the main objective here is the difficulty already present in the game multiplied by the use of a far inferior car.

[p 
	"Top Gear 2 is a pretty difficult game (on the hardest difficulty setting). As you play the game and beat a country or two, your car SCREAMS for you to buy it upgrades to keep beating races. Starting at the very last country, with a totally non-upgraded car? I wouldn't have thought it could be possible, even in a TAS! The manipulation is brilliant... Only someone who has played the game a lot can tell the extent of it.
