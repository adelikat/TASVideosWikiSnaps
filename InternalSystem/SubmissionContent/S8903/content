[div class=p 
	"On the fighing sections, the fastest strategy, by far, is to start with an aerial attack, to close the gap, and then headbutt until the enemy is dead, this is because headbutts deal more damage than the other attacks, so even tho the animation can be slightly slower than other attacks, it is faster, specially since every hit adds some hit lag. One problem with the headbutt is that it is hard to make it connect, since the enemy tends to either block it, or attack right when you do, which means it will hit you. Making them all connect required some effort.

	"There are some sections where it looks like I can do something somewhat earlier, most of the time its just because there's an invisible wall until something happens, but a few are done for other reasons; giving the potion to the guard at Ingolstadt, this is delayed because if you give the potion too fast for some reason it warps you to the entrance of the scene, and when exiting the shop at Geneva, there is an invisible wall, but you have to wait a few extra frames to avoid crashing the game.

	"Also, when buying the Iodine and picking up the rat at the shop in Geneva at night, even tho the movement looks kind of weird because the rat is on the way, picking up the rat then the iodine is 40 frames faster, tho 10 frames are lost from menuing when using the rat to lure away the guard dog, over picking up first the iodine.

	"Everything looks good to me. The routing is solid, avoiding the extra items as well as using saving and loading to outright skip fights. The fights themselves go at a nice clip with getting the headbutts to connect without the computer dodging. While there might be some possibility to have the computer not jump or get knocked down as much, that might affect their usual tendency to block the headbutts.
