	"Pokémon Crystal is similar in Gold and Silver overall, with many small differences throughout the games.
	$LF
	"In general, Gold/Silver has (~10) more mandatory fights, while Crystal has more required story elements (e.g. Burned Tower) and overworld movement (e.g. Squirtbottle).
	$LF
	"Crystal also got some visual upgrades compared to Gold and Silver. Good examples are Ice Path and Lance's Elite Four room.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I also believe Crystal to be the fastest version of the three.
	$LF
	"Note however that the time of this run is not directly comparable to the published run due to emulator differences, and it's very hard to make a fair comparison at this point.

	"This run uses Cyndaquil as a starter, and later switches to Raikou for the rest of the game.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Cyndaquil and Totodile are the realistic starter options, Chikorita is bad against literally everything in the first part of the game (Falkner, Bugsy, Rockets) and therefore not an option.
	$LF
	"Cyndaquil has a slower start due to Tackle being worse than Scratch and Rage, but makes up for it with Ember and its high base Special Attack, and comes out ~25s ahead up to Ecruteak.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Using one of the legendary beasts costs time to catch it, but is well worth it.
	$LF
	"Not only do they make fights faster due to their high base stats and level, but they also save time due to fewer level-ups.
	$LF
	"Each level-up costs ~2.7 seconds for the jingle and stat display alone, without factoring in any learned moves or experience bar movement animation.
	$LF
	"Skipping the level-ups between 21 and 40 alone saves more time than it costs to catch them.
	$LF
	"Entei is slightly better in fights than Raikou, but it struggles for PP more and has a longer cry sound, making it slower overall.

[p 
	"The main and obvious rule is to take the least number of steps.

	"Tall grass and spinning trainers can generally be ignored in any pathing decisions for this run, as I can just luck-manipulate my way around them.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"One interesting aspect of Gen II movement are turn frames.
	$LF
	"They happen whenever the player changes direction while not moving, and allow the player to turn in place.
	$LF
	"They cost 8 frames, and are avoided whenever possible.
	$LF
	"That means that starting any movement by goings straight is always faster.
	$LF
	"Also, it doesn't matter which direction you turn in turn frames, afterwards you can walk in any direction.
	$LF
	"This is used in this run to show where turn frames are: whenever you see the character turn in a weird direction, it's a turn frame.
	$LF
]p
[h4 id=Generalbattlestrategy: 
	" General battle strategy:
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The most basic and obvious strategy is to minimize the number of turns needed in each battle.
	$LF
	"Critical hits cost extra time due to the additional text box, so are avoided if possible.
	$LF
	"Very or not effective moves cost about double the time that critical hits do, so they are even more to be avoided, but still way better than using an extra turn in the fight.
	$LF
	"For enemy moves, failing to hit is generally faster than using a stat-changing move, which itself is faster than failing a stat-changing move.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Each attack has a damage range from 217/255 to 255/255. Due to integer rounding, only 255 results in max damage, with a 1/39 chance.
	$LF
	"Max damage is only needed a few times throughout the run at the beginning where damage and HP are low and every point of damage matters.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Especially in the early fights, the amount of damage you do also matters for the HP drain animation.
	$LF
	"Depending on how your damage aligns with the enemy's max HP, it can take more or less time overall to fully drain over multiple turns.
	$LF
]p
[h4 id=Badges 
	" Badges
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Badges give two types of boosts, stat boosts and type boosts.
	$LF
	"The type boosts are a 1.125x damage multiplier for the corresponding Gym's type, and these are quite helpful throughout the run, without any quirky behavior.
	$LF
	"The stat boosts are a 1.125x stat multiplier, and are given by specific Johto Gyms.
	$LF
	"The two important one for this run are the Attack boost by Falkner and the Special Attack boost by Pryce.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"One interesting discovery I made while making this run is that the Special Defense boost which is meant to be given by Clair does not actually work as intended, it is instead given whenver you have Pryce's badge and the boosted Special Attack stat of your Pokémon is in a certain range.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Another quirk with these boosts is that they don't always apply to crits.
	$LF
	"The way crits work in this game is that in addition to being a 2x damage multiplier, they ignore any stat boosts unless your attack stat level is higher than the opponent's defense stat level.
	$LF
	"That means that the Gym badge stat boosts are not applied to crits, unless you used a stat-changing move or an X item, effectively making the first use of those options stronger than normal.

[p 
	"Choosing Girl costs 9 frames over choosing Boy: 4 for selecting it, and 5 more on the SS Aqua because of longer text.
	$LF
	"The difference is not significant over the course of the run however, and Girl turned out to align better for early luck manipulation for me.

[p 
	"The time is set to 3:52.
	$LF
	"It's important to start at night in order to be able to catch Poliwag.
	$LF
	"The 52 minutes part is not necessary, but changes the game to the friendlier looking daytime palette quicker for better watchability.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The name is chosen to be "I".
	$LF
	"Setting a custom name costs some time, but shorter name are faster to display, so it saves time whenever they appear often enough.

	$LF
]p

	$LF
	"Cyndaquil itself also uses Leer to lower Totodile's defense. This saves two crits and therefore time.
	$LF
	"Leer is generally a surprisingly useful move to save time in this run, unlike in Gen I where crits ignored stat changes making these moves completely useless.

	$LF
	"Using Leer saves one crit, but it makes very little difference compared to 4-turn KO without it.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Ron's Pidgeys go down in two hits, whereas Falkner's Pidgey of the same level does not.
	$LF
	"This is because in Gen II, trainers have fixed DVs across all their Pokémon, and Falkner's are just better than a generic Bird Keeper.
	$LF
	"Falkner also has a different AI and his Pokémon have different move sets, causing his Pidgey to always use Mud-Slap instead of the much preferred Tackle.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"While the 1/256 misses for moves that "always" hit which existed in Gen I were patched so Mud-Slap always hits, any secondary effects still have the same bug in Gen II, allowing Pidgey's Mud-Slap to not reduce the Accuracy in 1/256 of cases.
	$LF
	"Not reducing the Accuracy is desirable to save the time for the extra line of text that would show up.

	$LF
	"I also buy 2 X Attacks, which will speed up fights later in the run.
	$LF
	"They will be used in situations were it saves at least one turn, of which there are only two, so it works out nicely.

	"While this page states this run's time is 2:48:50, the actual time it would take when played back on console is 2:48:39.703.
	$LF
	"The reason for this is that the concept of a "frame" is variable on a GB, and BizHawk's input frames don't align with them, yet it calculates time as if they were evenly spaced.
	$LF

	"Unfortunately, this same discrepancy makes a console verification of this run rather unlikely, because of the real-time clock.
	$LF
	"Since BizHawk's frames are longer, and its emulated RTC is bound to the number of frames, its RTC ticks slightly faster than on an actual console, inevitably causing desyncs over time.

	"The correct solution to the RTC issue is probably to base BizHawk's RTC on the number of emitted audio samples instead, but I'm not sure it would solve all the problems with Gen II console verification.
