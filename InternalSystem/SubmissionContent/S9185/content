	"Because the goal is to stomp the enemies shadow as quickly as possible, i needed a character that could run fast, or have an ability that could make them run fast. My choice fell on Lipty. Her special ability makes her run in a panic.

	"DamDam has a similar ability, where he uses his jetpack to move around fast. Still, it was Lipty that i wanted to be in the TAS, because shes funnier.

	"I start off by pressing Start to skip the opening sequence for the battle and press Triangle on the same frame to activate Lipty's running ability. All of the opponents are situated on the bottom right of the map, so i run there and press square to bodyslam into them.

	"This counts as having their shadows being stepped on. You can stomp 1 frame after bodyslamming too to change rng and in one instance save an additional frame.

	"Enemies are launched into the air after their shadows have been stomped on and remain airborne for atleast 154 frames, or 2.5 seconds. During this time you can obviously not stomp on their shadow, the only thing you can do is position yourself for the next stomp.
	$LF
	"The airborne time varies from character to character, sometimes it can be 154 frames and another character could have 156-160 frames. This most likely depends on their model, or even the sun.
