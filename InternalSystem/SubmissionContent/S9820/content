	"This is a game that I began to TAS like two times now, got frustrated, stopped working on it, and then lost the file. What's frustrating about TASing this game is the lag. The mechanisms which create or don't create lag in this game are so cryptic and beyond my understanding. This time, however, I finally decided to get the TAS done once and for all by not being as much of a perfectionist with my work. To reduce lag, I mainly attempted to simply reduce the number of sprites on-screen, without bothering to test every conceivable combination of inputs that might reduce lag. Reducing the number of sprites on-screen is generally achieved by reducing the number of papers thrown, moving papers offscreen as they hit their target, and progressing through the level as far to the left as possible. That last one is important as a lot of lag-heavy cars spawn in the street; staying as far to the left as possible relegates the street to just a tiny part of the lower-right corner, reducing lag from these cars.

	"If you hold Select while the level is loading, you'll be able to pull up the Select menu on the first frame the level loads in. Pressing B to exit this menu will cause the level to start immediately, skipping the day of the week text, and saving 129 frames each time. However, it will put the game in a glitched state where none of the sprites are loaded in properly. Bales of papers will be yellow squares and point sprites will be blue rectangles on Monday. For all days though, many cars will be invisible! But those sprites being invisible does not change their tangibility nor the amount of lag they create. So in all, the select glitch does not affect how we actually play through the levels.
