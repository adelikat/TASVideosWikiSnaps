	"You control the "Big Nose" character, who is running through many islands to find his dinner, because he is very hungry. Along the way, Big Nose collects bones, that he can use to buy items from the various shops that include spells, upgrades to his abilities and items.

	"This game is also very difficult because you cannot restart from where you left off once all your lives are gone. It is also very long with four islands (Paradise Island, Monster Island, Terror Island, and Chaos Island) each containing several levels. Big Nose the Caveman dies in a single hit unless he has stones. The stones can shoot out of his club, killing enemies. As many as three stones can come out of the club. There are also many pitfalls, traps and deadly lava/water since Big Nose can't swim.

	": Master of Pigs, this TAS was well done. However, this game is just slow paced, without much potential to show off. You tried your best by maximizing score, but I just don't see anyway Big Nose could be publishable. I'm sticking with the decision from
