	"Eek! The Cat is a puzzle/adventure game based on the old cartoon series of the same name. Your goal is to kick and shove an NPC to the exit of each level while avoiding enemies and obstacles. This run is 58.42 seconds faster than my previous run thanks to new routes, new glitches, better application of old tricks, and just better optimization.

	"Eek! The Cat is a unanimous flop by critics. With terrible controls and a bad physics engine, 9 lives is simply not enough for the normal person. But with the help of TAS, guiding grandma back to safety has never been so smooth. This whole run was created using the TAStudio tool in BizHawk.

	"The only difference between Easy Mode and Hard Mode is that enemy shots and hazards do twice as much damage in hard mode. There is no gameplay difference. As per the Movie Guidelines page, this is an acceptable reason for not choosing the Hardest Difficulty. Not selecting hard mode saves 53 frames in the beginning and 17 frames in one of the later levels due being allowed some extra damage.

	"LEFT and RIGHT move the cat - Everything is based off of momentum in this game, so you start off slow and then build up into great speeds. If you press the opposite direction while running on the ground (while not pushing anything) you will start sliding. Your X-speed rapidly decreases and you will eventually turn around. If you go over an edge while sliding you will be stuck in a very cartoonish animation (similar to Wile E. Coyote). The direction of the character that you're pushing does not affect how fast you accelerate.

	"The glitch used in this level was actually discovered during the course of my first TAS of this game. If you fall into the corner of a building or ledge at just the right angle, then you will fall through it. If the area after the edge is also solid, then you will just land inside the corner and be pushing against a wall. But if there's no solid area after the edge of the wall (like many of the buildings in the city scape, except for the dark grey ones), then you will fall right through. This is used when bringing the policeman back. It lets me skip exactly one cycle of the barrel at the end of the level.

This changed the timing of the steam vents when I got to them; I was able to run the full length with no interruptions. Let the box get hit by the 10-ton weight as soon as possible. Waiting for the recovery on this was faster than tripping the weight and going back for the box. The combined time saved in this level let me get both characters down the elevator shaft before the platform rose to the top. Vastly improved manipulation of box in this final section. Built up a lot of momentum on the first clothesline. Skipped going to the top-right ledge on the final part and was able to get box to jump all the way to the orphanage thanks to the strange properties of the final clothesline.

The game would reset to the opening screen right after power-on, but it would freeze on that blue intro screen while still having the current level's music playing. Finding out why this happened could lead to a way to skip right to the Ending sequence instead.
