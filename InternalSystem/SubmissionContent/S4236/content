	"In this movie, I used a new trick to make "wall throughing" and "little X-position boost" much more easier.

[p 
	"While bomberman exists out of camera for some reason, putted bombs become impassable immediately even bomberman exists on the position of the bomb.
	$LF
	"So, Through Wall and X boost become easyer because they are caused by a situation that bomberman exists in impassable tiles.
	$LF
	"However, while using this glitch in horizontally long stage, Bomberman can never reach to the goal.
