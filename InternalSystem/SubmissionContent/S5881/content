	"So some people 
	[del 
		"hate passwords
	]del
	" are curious on how a run would look like "legit", so I spent like 2 weeks on/off resyncing the run from the start. As terrible as that sounds, it turns out the game is mostly running back and forth between locations, so the most problematic areas were relatively "small". Eg, takes an afternoon to sync like 20k frames of desert running, yet multiple days for battles.

	"The final run is 4:51.38 (or 17,483 frames) slower than using special Denjuu. In other words, given that the run is an over 80 minutes, this accounts to "only" ~5% longer by doing the game the "normal" way.

	"The fight with Skrippa looks rather "bad", and the reason is due to the lack of methods I can actually manipulate the RNG early on. It turns out that the fastest way to get through this fight is to get an ally to appear right before your turn, to basically deal 12 damage per turn. Additionally, due to being super underleveled in compared to the level 28 Denjuu, I cannot get hit whatsoever. Each attack must also be a critical hit, else the number of turns needed doubles. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I also leveled up to 8 by the end. All these factors together makes the first fight look rather bad, but if it's any comfort, the rest of the fights don't have several hundred frame waits. In terms of number of turns, it's the 2nd longest fight in the run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In case anyone wonders why the enormous wait for the first DP healing drink here rather than later, it's because I need 11 drinks for the entire run, and for the fights before I'm able to hop around to manipulate RNG, there's very few oppurtunities to do so. For the fights after I unlock jumping, every fight had multiple different things to manipulate simultaneously. In other words, unless someone figures out how to get drinks from the grass reliably, then you'll need to wait for them to appear in battles (which may take a while). If it's any comfort, it's "only" 170 frames of waiting this time, and I used this chance to nickname Skrippa. Also all other drinks take somewhat less frames compared to this.

	"For the 1st rival, it's mostly the same, but with slight difference:

	"For this fight, it appears Skrippa's typing allows me to inflict massive damage to Easydog. This allows the fight to take me 2 of my own turns. The strategy is as follows:

	"Unfortunately, by this battle, Skrippa has only 10 DP left. This almost messed with the TAS, but luckily, I had managed to pickup a DP juice bag from the grass a while back. This is also the last point where Skrippa is used in the run.

	"Each critical deals at most 71 damage to Diablos. Diablos has 221 HP, which means there's no way to 3 turn KO Diablos since 71 x 3 = 213. Both Akretto and Kaya inflict 1 damage on Diablos, so they won't help. In this case, it makes more sense to ignore criticals on Diablos, and prioritize not dying. I'm allowed to take damage once from Diablos; everything else must be forced to either miss, or use a non-damaging move such as Cursed Song. The latter causes a status aliment that wastes 50+ frames on dialogue, so it's prefferred to miss if possible.

	"Hoesntly, I made this run just so that if the other run gets rejected for using Secret Denjuu, there would still be a chance a Telefang 2 run gets published somehow. In case anyone wonders why is that a problem, it's because instead of a short 5 minute run like the previous game, using Secret Denjuu affects almost every single fight due to lack of gamebreaking glitches. I mean, sure recruiting a level 28 Denjuu early on basically does the same thing, but at the very least judges would have some run to compare, rather than me claiming "it's similar".

	"Also, making this run also helped the other, since I noticed mistakes that were then fixed, such as saving 204 frames in Bandit's Hideout compared to the "original" WIPs due to hopping to avoid NPCs. I still managed to actually include them back into this version of the run, in case anyone wonders, hence all the delays.

[p 
	"While I like the original game more, I admit, the sequel is much better for TASing a "full" run, since it's much more edit-friendly. Here's a spreadsheet on every single area the TAS goes through in which wandering NPCs are a potential problem: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DMwXqUgWF6V_Arabm3AOhf5IUhvMYM11N2GB1izF9po/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=102281563063352479341

	"After jumping is unlocked, they become much more easier to avoid in comparison to earlier segments. The first game had forced encounters with varying transition animations, which made it extremely annoying to splice in improvements.
