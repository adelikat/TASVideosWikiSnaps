	"This level is a bit tricky, especially for the underworld on the pipe, where I had to brake a bit, unlike I thought. I achieved to jump correctly in the underworld to get the pipe. At the end of the level, I was thinking “At the end of the stairs, I jump”, but finally, I let Mario fall down because it was faster.

	"I have been a bit surprised that, at the moment where Mario jumps frame-perfect to kill the Koopa, I could go. It’s important to notice that there is only one frame in no sprint. Then, there are 2 little difficult jumps. Where the platforms goes up and down, I had a big problem : knowing that if I kept walking and jump on the first platform, I fall, so I have to wait, and if I jump directly to the second, I jump on the HUD, and fall again, and I had to wait again.

Another waiting due to the piranha plant. In the water part, a really hard part to end because of fireballs. A third jump that would have required sprint and a Bowser that isn’t saying ‘You shall not pass’ and I just go under him.
