	"This level is a bit tricky, especially for the underworld on the pipe, where I had to brake a bit, unlike I thought. I achieved to jump correctly in the underworld to get the pipe. At the end of the level, I was thinking “At the end of the stairs, I jump”, but finally, I let Mario fall down because it was faster.

	"I have been a bit surprised that, at the moment where Mario jumps frame-perfect to kill the Koopa, I could go. It’s important to notice that there is only one frame in no sprint. Then, there are 2 little difficult jumps. Where the platforms goes up and down, I had a big problem : knowing that if I kept walking and jump on the first platform, I fall, so I have to wait, and if I jump directly to the second, I jump on the HUD, and fall again, and I had to wait again.

	"At the beggining, I prefered directly taking the upper tunnel, or I would have lost time. It’s hard to hit the block to trigger the vine, and it’s difficult to do the jump to climb that vine. The last part is really easy because it’s straight forward and you have jump to jump and press right.

	"I didn’t know if I lost time walking on holes, even if can go through. In that level, I did a lot of 1-frame-only jumps. Then comes a jump that would have needed the sprint.

	"The stairs and the beggining are really dangerous to do. I even killed the lakitu and that wasn’t even planned. It gave me a benefit. A lot of Bullet Bill annoyed me. Then comes the  second jump that would have needed the sprint. At the end of that jump, I should have stopped for a while for the next jump.

	"There is a little pixel-perfect jump in the middle on this level. However, there are the fireworks. If I rush to the flag, there would be 6 fireworks to would be triggered. Then, there is a Bullet Bill that blocked me a bit.

	"There is another pixel-perfect jump. You are forced to wait for the platform to move. Then you have to wait with the piranha plant. Then I had to go right, then to come back to the left. Another waiting due to the piranha plant. In the water part, a really hard part to end because of fireballs. A third jump that would have required sprint and a Bowser that isn’t saying ‘You shall not pass’ and I just go under him.
