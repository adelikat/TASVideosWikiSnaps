	"Stages are as follows.
	$LF
	"1-1: I use the same technique as Sleepz because it is what seems to be the fastest.

[div class=p 
	"1-2: Again, thank you Sleepz for showing a faster way, I also do the same.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"1-3: I use Luigi because I could not figure out how to get the star perfectly to kill Mouser. So Luigi became the next best with jumps. And the UP+DOWN is first used big on this stage. Mouser however is beaten very fast I think.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"2-1: Pretty much just a run through the stage until I hit the sand digging. From there I have to get some cherries in order to get my star which for some reason(for me) would only appear after the enemies projectile hit the wall and went a certain distance off the screen, so it didnt matter how fast I dug, also I had to press start 3 times to make the game think the star went to the left and then it gets a more needed early start across the screen, from there I have fun with the Birdo.

[div class=p 
	"2:2: Again, running to the end and then digging my way down.

[div class=p 
	"2:3: And again, running and digging. But when it comes to the boss, I use his little buddy against him to kill him faster.

	"3:1: This stage is a little different, more of a go up stage rather than a scroller. Nothing special really here cept for the Birdo beatin.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"3:2: I chose Princess here because she can float for a good amount of time. You will see why. It just seemed the shorter route. Anyways, Birdo gets taken care of nicely.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"3:3: Luigi was used for a particular reason in the level. His jumps are just the right height. Mouser gets destroyed at the with every bomb. Fastest possible way I thought of destroying him.
	$LF

[div class=p 
	"4:1: Same as previous speedruns.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"4:2: Same as previous runs, until I take the rocket up to the next level, then I get enough cherries to make the star appear to destroy Birdo once again with the touch of my body.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"4:3: Luigi worked perfect for this stage. His long jumps and his better moving ability when he picks up objects(I think). Plus, the boss gets it.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"5:1: Good timing with Luigi is needed on this, plus I use the (Pick up item after returning) glitch to take care of Birdo faster than normal.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"5:2: I first thought Luigi would be good for this stage, but Toad was the better choice with the faster running and all. I fish slap the Birdo at the end :)
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"5:3: Pretty much a running through the level. I used a faster technique than what I normally planned for Birdo. And the crab-looking-boss at the end of the stage is easier than holding A.

[div class=p 
	"6:1-7:2: These stages are pretty much the same as the speedruns. I dont want to explain them because the previous authors have aleady.
