	"Why, it's Aladdin! This is by far one of the more interesting Disney games, due to it utilizing the twelve steps of animation in its character design. Too bad it doesn't really follow the movie...at all. I mean, the heck, why does Aladdin have a sword in this one. But still, it's fun!!!

	" Skidding
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Originally discovered by Aqfaq, this is one of the most important tricks in the run. Skidding is where you stop Aladdin's run after a certain period of time (40 frames from standstill, 41 frames after) to add the speed of his stopping animation to his run. Skidding is only possible from a completely uninterrupted >39 frame run cycle, so attacking, jumping, and taking damage is planned accordingly.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Long Jump
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"A variation of skidding, doing a jump after initiating it transfers the speed to Aladdin's jump as well. Handy in some places.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Hitbox Sword Extension (New)
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"A trick I discovered that saves quite a bit of time. If you swing Aladdin's sword when he is exactly horizontal to an interactive surface (IE, an object that moves or does something besides sit there), the game gets confused and thinks Aladdin interacted with it, even though he didn't! This leads to a variety of useful tricks, which I'll detail below.

[h4 
	" Agrabah Market
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"-I managed to skip the Genie token from the camel bounce by attacking before landing on the camel. For some reason, this makes Aladdin bounce slightly higher. Yeah, I don't know why.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-Minor saves reducing lag.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" The Desert
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"-A few minor differences here. First off, I took a lower route before the palm trees to get an extra skid in. I saved time doing the palm trees by jumping from a lower point instead of off the skeleton like Electrospecter did.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-Did a long jump right before the first scarab piece to reach a higher platform.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-Finally, minor lag reduction was done throughout the level. Most noticeably, that stray apple throw I did saved a whopping 1 frame of lag.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Agrabah Rooftops
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"-The big one! Thanks to Hitbox Sword Extension, I'm able to use a boost from a clothesline to skip a large chunk of the level.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-Additionally, I did some more HSEs on other clotheslines to get some major boosts in speed. Fun stuff.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-The little thief miniboss is improved by crouching and throwing apples at him.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-Another major difference, since I skipped so much of the level I never picked up the 'bonus' flute that Electrospecter got, skipping a very long bonus ride on the last rope.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Sultan's Dungeon
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"-Nothing majorly different timewise, just a bit of lag reduction here and there. The most notable difference is doing a HSE on the final platform to get to the exit a little faster.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Cave of Wonders
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"-More like Cave of LAG, ha. No, but seriously most of this level was just lag reduction. How 'fun'.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" The Escape
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"-Gee whiz, more lag reduction. How new. I also managed to fit in about 4-5 more skids then Electrospecter did, so that saved some time.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Rug Ride
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"-Nothing that different. I think I maybe reduced lag by 2-3 frames, but that's about all.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Inside the Lamp
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"-Lots of minor differences here, too many to list. The most notable improvements is doing HSEs on the balloons, and doing one on the finger at the end to skip some bouncing around.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Sultan's Palace
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"-For some reason, both this and Jafar's Palace are exponentially more laggy then the other levels. Sad face. Biggest improvements were lag reduction, grabbing the rope after the first carpet ride, and an extra skid on route to the boss.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"-Speaking of the boss, very minor time saved attacking it from the left instead of the right. Neat.
	$LF
]p
[h4 
	" Jafar's Palace
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"-I hate this level, I hate lag, and I love you. Some extra skids were fitted in, but besides that it's the same deal. It's worth noting that whenever you run out of apples in a boss battle, the game will always spawn more if you move a section of the level offscreen and come back. Nothing major, but it's a fun bit of trivia.
