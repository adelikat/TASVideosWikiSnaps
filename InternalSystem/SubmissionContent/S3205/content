	"As you can see, the main improvement is using a trick to go through walls. It requires four steps (grab wall, shoot web, jump, shoot web), so no wonder it went unnoticed. It does not work in every place, though.

[p 
	"I had to redo some of the bossfights and managed to improve them. There is still room for additional improvements, but I don't know how to optimize the web swinging, so I'll submit this now. It may take years before anyone else contributes to the obliteration of this game, so why not update the publication while waiting.
