	"This submission is my 4th. I never thought I would actually complete it! That's because, chronologically, I played BOF 2 BEFORE BOF 1, and since the former caught more of my attention, the latter seemed rather pale... But BOF 1 is indeed the prequel to BOF 2 (the Goddess will leave seeds of evil that will grow up to be Deathevn in BOF 2).

[ul 
	[li 
		" Random battles are totally avoidable, except in Mogu's conscience (for some reason)
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Having people die is a big plus, especially before Nina gets Renew. This way, she gets it more quickly.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Dead people can cast magic outside of battle. So when Nina gets renew, she can play dead.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" I try to minimize the use of the status window. Therefore, I plan ahead and to every change (equipment, spells, change of rows) at once.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Death warps are a time saver.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Towards the very end, Agni is a time saver. Goda and Jade have such high defense that Rudra and Puka can't do enough damage to compensate 999 damage each turn.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Similarly, with Agni on AB, I can program the bosses so they only attack. Jade hasn't cast any magic, and the Goddess can keep attacking for up to 8 rounds
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Karn, in his transformed status (Puka, Shin), becomes a killing machine. It's a little detour getting the spells, but it's worth it.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		"It's fairly easy to have bosses (not) dropping items. It depends on the course of action during the battle.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Very low HP characters seem much stronger. And if it's combined with attack-up, it's even better
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" No need for most chests. I either buy everything in a store or maniuplate battles so I won't need to heal

		" Morte/Mortea : Using that extra fire stone came handy. After Mortea, only one of the soldiers was still alive, this way, the 2ns wizard fight was quicker.

	[li 
		" Wizard : I only needed him to cast thunder, the weakest spell.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Dark D Fort soldiers : the little detour to get a boomerang was worth it. They all die at the same time
		$LF

		" General and lancers : the boomerang always comes in handy.
		$LF
	]li
	[li 
		" Gremlin : a long and tedious fight. In his second phase, he only casts his multiple target spell. In order for it to be weaker, I needed to kill him before destroyed 87,5% of his health. Otherwise, he would have been about 35% stronger.
