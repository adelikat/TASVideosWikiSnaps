	"After making my original submission, Leblancanator9000 (a.k.a. Crash41596) informed me, on the forum, that the run had a suboptimal route, and also that it was possible to skip one of the Ripto fights without using a certain glitch. Taking this advice into account, I decided to make a new test run in VBA. Once GBA support was added in BizHawk, I started the actual run.
	$LF
	"Originally, I estimated the total improvement to be about one minute. However, with all of the new time-savers I had found since the old run was completed (along with a few I discovered during the development of the run) I managed to bring the time down even further.

Firstly, I use a precise jump+glide to skip the Ripto fight (which is much quicker than using Wind Breath Hover) and in the next area I perform another tricky jump to get on to the high ground. This allows me to pick up a lot of extra gems here instead of getting some from Thieves' Guild, because that level is no longer part of the route.

	"In the first area, there are three targets which make platforms appear. The second platform is not needed, so I only hit the first and third targets. However, the third target is hit in such a way that it skips a certain dialogue, which causes the game to get a bit confused. Not only does the game give me an item in the middle of a jump, but it also causes a storage effect on the NPC, which causes her to pop up a text box if you stop moving, but this is only a small time cost compared to what is saved by skipping the initial dialogue.

	"By standing near the drill and getting hit, I use Spyro's invulnerability frames to jump on top of the drill - this technique is TAS-only because it requires frame-perfect jumping so that Spyro actually lands behind the drill when he gets hit again. This is the only part of the TAS where it is required to take damage.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Before the final hit on Ripto, I position Spyro in such a way that he catches both the Warp Device and the Heart when Ripto drops them. The direction in which the items travel when they are dropped is affected by both Spyro's position and whether you are pressing A when Sparx's text box pops up, so I had to position myself precisely. Doing this delays the Heart of Chateau Ripto text box, so that it is skipped when the screen fades out after the Professor dialogue ends.
