	"How odd these pirate games are. Actually, this is a homebrew port of Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero for Sega Mega Drive. It seems to be developed in the first part of 2000 by 台湾游戏公司 which is completely unknown nowdays. You've never heard of this game? So, now you do =)
	$LF
	"It was barely known outside China and no-one seems to talk about it or even mentioning it, so people meet it only by either purchasing a pirate cartridge or watching someone playing it. Personally, I had a cartridge with all MK's ever released on Mega Drive.

	"There isn't much to say. It's a hallway side-scroller fighting where you walk around, fight a single opponent at once, collect items and look for the "exit". Sounds common, but it's a stiff and difficult game. The control is awful, less comfortable than in a normal MK game, and the enemies' behaviour is more unpredictable. Though an emulator fixes it, a hardware player will probably sick of it. It is also designed for a 3-button controller, so there isn't much a variety of actions you can perform.

	"There 3 types of rooms: with enemies, with traps (stage hazards), with nothing. You fight 1 enemy at the same time. After you kill him, the next one spawns outside the screen. If there are no more enemies to fight, you're able to quit the hallway. 
	$LF
	"The spawn depends on the players position. Enemy spawns on the left of the player if he is in the right (opposite to "left") part of the level and/or the camera isn't able to move right (there is still an area to prevent it). In all other cases, an enemy spawns on the right side, so I complete the same hallway faster if I go to the right.
	$LF

[p 
	"The traps work ciclically. If the player touches them, he recieves damage and falls back. Also their hitboxes mismatch their sprites, so I sometimes don't catch a visual moment when Sub-Zero is supposed to stay untouched if I would go/jump on the Nth frame. I have to mention that I saved only 16 frames of taking damage.

If you die, you respawn on your last check point, not at the starting point, so you can't bypass any hallways that must be passed in order to get to the point B quickly. The only thing is, the game doesn't save if you collect a key while having zero health. It wuold be useful in Stage 3 when I take the square key, but quiting the hallway normally is faster than passing the opposite hallway where I would respawn.
