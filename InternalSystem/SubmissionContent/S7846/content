Launch ScummVM within libTAS without a movie running (make sure "Prevent Writing to Disk" is disabled), then on the pop up window do "Add Game", select the game folder then press "choose", then click on the option that says the full game name, then click "choose".  you should see "pajama-win" as the ID, make sure to note that down, then click "ok", and close out of the window.
