	"Amagon... what a game.  I played it a lot when I was a kid and it was always one of my favorites.  In this game you play Amagon, a well-decorated marine.  Here's the story of the came (from http://www.everyvideogame.com/manual-nes-Amagon_(U).htm):

	"Many people find this game pretty difficult but I found it easy.  It's your basic platformer: run, jump, shoot, repeat.  There are 6 zones with 2 levels each (total of 12 levels) and all are filled with enemies that want to stop you from reaching the other side of the island.

	"Notes: I tried to play through the game as Amagon for the most part because it's more challenging and entertaining.  I try to wait until the boss to transform into Megagon.

	"About Megagon: Amagon can transform into Megagon when he gets the Mega Key.  The Mega Key is dropped by enemies you kill.  Once you have the Mega Key you can transform at any time by pressing 'Select'.  Megagon has health and can take hits as long as he doesn't run out of health.  His health is determined by how many points you have when you transform.  5,000 points gives you one notch on the health bar, so if you have 25,000 points when you transform you will have 5 notches on the health bar.  Megagon has two attacks: a close range punch and a ranged energy blast.  The energy blasts costs health to use (1 notch) but is very powerful.  I take out most bosses with it.
