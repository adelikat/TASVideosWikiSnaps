	"I waited for years for a Star Fox TAS to grace my existence. And then I kept waiting... For whatever reason it never even occurred to me to simply 'Search' for a Star Fox TAS (I can't tell you why the brain works they way it does). In the meantime I kept doing project after project; getting intimately familiar with BizHawk and a now second-nature workflow using TAStudio. I even entered the fully 3D world of Blast Corps (another favorite of mine whose TAS didn't exist). It was during this project that I realized the only person to make my dream come true was me, and I finally had the skill set to do it. So, with naught but a vision, I loaded up the game and fired my first shot.

I would hear that sound so many more times as I spent days getting past these ships and understanding just the basics. Once inside the city there are so many hidden places where enemies come out. With so many structures around it's relatively easy to get bonus points on all the enemies with the charge shot. I'm sure many are wondering why I crash and lose my wings at the first mech, and this was intentional because getting hit was the only way to slow down enough to get a 3rd charge shot off. There were some laser shots thrown my way during the top of the arc, but I was unable to get hit by one of them, so I had to run into the pillar instead. I only needed to get hit once, but I broke off the second wing for the sake of symmetry.

The problem is that those points don't count until the ship's hull is fully destroyed by either shooting it or having it crash into the ground. I had to throw a bomb the frame before lock-on so that it could destroy the hulls of the remaining 2 ships for the full 5 points before touching the checkpoint.

Here on this side we have more moles for a bunch of free points. Finally we come to the boss where I try to show a little flare. There's a visual glitch when that first hatch opens. This is an error in video recording and not any kind of lag.

In the next part where all the ships are coming down from above it is again not possible to charge shot every group of enemies. The first bomb takes out 4 enemies including a missile that I couldn't hit otherwise, and the second bomb takes out another 4 enemies I couldn't get to in time. In the corridor afterwards I am able to kill all but one enemy before I have to dive down below to take out the other ships.

	"Hoo boy! This level sure ramped up the difficulty of this run. I spent two months on this level (and it's still not optimal! but more on that later). There are some very notable changes in mechanics on this stage. First and foremost, charge shots do not exist. Instead, you get a torpedo by pressing the B button (normally reserved for bombs). This torpedo will lock on to a target the instant it's fired. There's a targeting cursor that shows exactly which enemy the torpedo will lock on to once it's fired. There's usually no way to avoid this lock on, but you can shoot at the ground or wait until there are other objects in the way. Once in a while there will be a couple frame window after killing an enemy before it finds a new target.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"MASHING! The best part about the torpedo is that you can fire another one the frame after the first one explodes. You see it right away on the clams. They start opening after the first hit, but the enemy inside has an indestructible hitbox until the clam fully opens. Note that the clams with an item inside can only be hit once. And Then We Have The Columns. The crumbling part in the center can be hit by the explosion radius for 1 point each. If it gets even a little close, though, it will destroy the center. And boy howdy do I take advantage of that.

There was no amount of boosting or braking to be able to get some of these birds with a distance shot, so I had to hit the whole group directly with a charge shot. The rest of the level is reasonably straight forward flying with long stretches of open space, so I use a bunch of boost to try and get through. The biggest thing about this level are the search lights. Missing one causes extra enemies to spawn for the rest of the level at the cost of reducing the light's point value from 3 to 1. After some testing it was confirmed that the light right before the tankers was the best one to get spotted by because there are only 4 lights left in the rest of the level and 27 extra enemies. If you pay close attention to the score counter at that light, you'll see that my bomb kills it for the full 3 points on the same frame that I'm spotted (which is also the same frame it despawns after going off-screen behind you). There's a point where Kat comes in and tries to take out some crates way ahead of you. I charge shot the first one and use a bomb to take out the second two before she can. I just had to make sure the explosion was far enough to the right to not kill anything else on that platform.

I manage to hit all 5 on the first frame they have hitboxes while they're still in the cart. One of the harder parts of this level was deciding who to hate on more, Slippy or Kat. Fortunately, there's plenty of time to do both, and YES that is the most proper way to greet a lady. For the bouncing rocks section I do a bunch of small hovers and this is because the Landmaster cannot aim towards the ground... unless you're in the air. Another method of getting ground shots is by doing a barrel roll and firing while the turret is in the ground, but that maneuver isn't used because I'd have to wait for the enemies to get close to me.

I intentionally take damage on this section so that I can die asap after the checkpoint.

I get a few distance shots, and then I have to wait for them to get close enough and bunched in enough to start getting +1's. I fire a bomb at the last second to finish them off right before they explode. Up next is the corridor of infinite mashing where I had never been able to get all the satellites as a kid, but now that I play videogames on a higher level these were a breeze to hit. If you kill the butterfly enemies fast enough (i.e. when they're still off-screen) another one will spawn right behind it. This window of new spawns only lasts for a few seconds, and I use it to get an extra 4 butterflies. This little secret must have been known by the devs, though, because shooting a bomb to kill them the frame they appear will completely stop any more from spawning after the first (whereas this particular trick works in other levels not seen in this run).

I constantly had to manipulate things to keep him alive, but on top of the already exhausting task of avoiding the  barrage of lasers, it was getting to be too much.
