[p 
	"These reasons make using a savestate anchor the more fool-proof method, even though starting from SRAM would be better for a number of reasons. For the previous version of the run, a procedure was developed to generate the savestate that guarantees that the anchor would be consistent and equivalent to using SRAM. The explanation is in the 
	[a class=intlink href=/2802S#GeneratingTheSavestateAnchor 
		"previous submission text
	]a
	", and I will not repeat it here. Playing the movie from a savestate generated in such a manner is equivalent to playing 
	[a class=intlink href=/Userfiles/Info/19351628431942712 
		"this hex-edited movie

[p 
	"Since the SRAM does not have information that could affect synchronization (you know, other than the save file with all emeralds...), the movie is self-verifying: you can use the SRAM generated by playing back the movie to play it back again.

The condition for it to work is that Tails must be off-screen at one specific frame; this is not normally possible if you don't know the condition, which was figured out through the disassembly. So it is absolutely crucial to allow Tails to respawn at that time, as he would be too late otherwise. The pattern at score tally minimizes the number of lag frames.

	"By the way, I was a bit sad about finding this trick: it is possible to use the route from the Tails TAS in act 2 and hit the boss above the ceiling; Sonic and Tails can deliver all 8 hits this way, but it ends up being a lot slower.

	"As it turns out, Hyper Sonic can do the level wrap faster than getting Wheel glitch, and faster than regular Sonic can either. Entering the wall at the boss allows zipping out at at the right time, allowing for a nearly frame-perfect kill -- it is theoretically possible to beat the boss 1 frame faster, but his position relative to the spinning top at the time of the first hit actually makes it impossible. Balloon positions for next act were manipulated at the end of this act. The original version of the ground entrance was by DMTM and used a bubble shield; I proved it was possible to do it without the shield.

And while he will still be on terrain and be able to zip right away, it ends up being slower overall. Anyway: new hyper ground entrance, which I previously thought was impossible. At the end, I setup the loop solidity for the next act in such a way I don't need to grab a shield.
