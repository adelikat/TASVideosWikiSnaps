	"This game consists of two types of levels, in outside levels you operate some vehicle and in inside levels you play as the man himself. In both sections you have five elements to choose from: fire, water, earth, wind and 
	[b 
		"HEART
	]b
	". In outside levels these elements serve as your vehicle's weapons. Water and wind don't seem to do any damage to anything and heart is used to interact with animals. In these levels your energy.

[p 
	"In inside levels Cpt. Planet can transform into these elements where fire does damage, water makes you immune to hazards and removes slimeparticles from bombs (good for lag reduction). Earth and wind are cheap knockoffs of fire and water respectively and heart is only used on 1st part of 2nd boss.

	"In vehicle levels energy is used only for ammunition (everything oneshots you), and in Cpt. Planet levels energy is both your ammunition (expires fast when transformed) and your health. Oh and it also serves as a timer by draining over time. Who needs multiple bars when you can just mash them all together. :)

	"When playing as Cpt. Planet A button punches and B makes you transform. If you cancel your punch on the 7th frame by transforming, the game thinks you are punching every frame. This is pretty powerful in later stages especially when transforming into water, which makes you pretty much invulnerable.

	"Submarine level. You are supposed to help the whales throughout the level, but you can actually skip the first whale event by going under the net (very precise). This skip will cause the other two whale events to not appear at all.

	"Most interesting level in the game. You need to help caged elephants into 
	[em 
		"elephant reserve
	]em
	". They also destroy missile turrets that will shoot you down if you go past them. All this while enemy helicopters try to shoot you down. Elephants themselves move around 0.9 pixels per second, you can carry them for 1 pps, but the fastest way to move them is to "walk them" by constantly taking them in your helicopter and dropping them for a whopping ~1.5 pps.

	"Final level, lags and balls are plenty. For the last boss you need to arrange 
	[em 
		"reflectors
	]em
	" in certain order. Without stored punch you can't arrange them in time for the first thingy to hit.

	"This movie could be improved by about a second by using stored punch in the 1st boss. Too bad the game has loads of lag from RNG so the rest of movie desyncs horribly if you try to tweak earlier levels. This is an 4900 frame improvement from my older tas of this game, but I never bothered to upload the first version here because it was pretty sloppy.

	[a class=intlink href=/Forum/P/339050#339050 
		"was proven

	" to be quite sloppy. But the game looks like a decent choice to develop one's TASing skills, so I am sad the Author is not going to improve this run any time soon. Rejecting.
