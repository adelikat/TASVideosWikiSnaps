	"Order of Twilight is a My Little Pony game created for a 48-hour programming competition. You play as the dreaming pony Twilight and must complete 12 screens worth of content to clear her mind of chaos. The main feature of the game is the spell system, which allows you to perform magic abilities. These abilities include rotating gravity, teleporting, and creating cubes.

	"While this run initially seems like a simple puzzle platformer, it quickly becomes a rush to teleport to the end of the screen. The teleport spell allows you to teleport a large distance forward in whatever direction you are facing. It lets you go through walls and a tile or two above your current position if a tile is in your way. Another commonly used spell is the gravity rotation one which is used whenever we need to move somewhere quickly but don't have room to teleport. These spells are entered in through specific combinations of the arrow keys and can be quickly entered by pressing multiple keys on one frame.

	"Since we have not yet unlocked the gravity rotation spells, we instead create cubes which give us enough height to teleport onto the hill and to the end of the screen.

	"Here we unlock the sixth spell slot which is immediately used to flip Twilight's gravity upside down. We then flip sideways which interestingly conserves our falling momentum and lets us keep this falling speed through our next few teleports, although this winds up forcing us to wait for a few frames to teleport near the end so we don't fall into the void.

	"The "diamond dogs" prevent us from teleporting, even when we use the invisibility spell which prevents them from hurting us, so we turn sideways to get above the dogs and teleport away.

	"Finally, we use a complicated amount of gravity rotations and teleports to get to the end of the level without falling into any of the spikes. We then obtain the final two spell slots and end input after entering the "???" spell. Twilight awakens with her friends on a sunny day, as the cutscene we skipped at the beginning of the game predicted. She immediately proceeds to perform flips in the air, just like anyone else would do after clearing their mind of chaos. I presume this makes sense to people who have watched the show.

	": Despite what the first screen suggests, this movie was quite cool, the audience agrees. Accepting to Moons. I have the avi dump if anyone feels like publishing it within 2 weeks.
