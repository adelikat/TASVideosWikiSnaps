	"After completing the previous TAS for this game, I decided to try to improve my console speedrun PB. I found an alternative way to pass the statues at the beginning of stages 2 to 5. By start walking left and grenade the left statue, you'll end up further to the left than with the previous method (passing more mid-way between the two statues). Assuming the general direction in the stage is towards the left, this reduces the amount of diagonal walking. In the TAS, this applies to stages 4 (18 frames saved) and 5 (24 frames saved), as those are the stages where the route is on the left side. Aside from some minor adjustments to make stages 4 and 5 sync, the rest of the TAS hasn't changed.

	"I have no plans on returning to this game either on console or for TASing, unless someone finds something new. While this is a small improvement for a game that's not very impressive in TAS conditions, I can now at least sleep well again, knowing that all currently known tricks and time savers have been implemented.
