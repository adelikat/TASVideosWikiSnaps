It is possible killing the spiders on the left first could be slightly faster, but if you kill the small spiders while on the left, more will spawn, which will make the big spider go up prematurely.

To transition from one phase to the next you have to hit him 16 times, which is tracked with a counter, after reaching 0, it resets to 16 and the next phase starts, when it reaches 0 on phase 3, the fight, and game, ends.

Seems that there are some differences on what strategies should have been done, but the outcome shows that the run proves itself. Yeah...some parts seem to be slow, but those same issues are mirrored in the WR speedrun. My final thoughts...this is a pretty dominating run, over human efforts.
