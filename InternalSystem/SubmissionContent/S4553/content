	"The glitch is performed in the "Area 1-1" portion of the 1st stage, during the transition off of the first elevator. While on the elevator, Down+A is held as you transition back up again from the bottom screen (RAM address: 0x200 to 0x00EC), causing your character to fall out-of-bounds into a glitched area of the map. Entering and landing in this area causes the game to execute the ending.
