	"INK is a fast-paced platformer about using colorful paint to uncover your surroundings. You play as a cube who spreads ink through walking and double jumping where your goal is to get to the rainbow box at the end of every level. The box only opens up once every enemy is defeated.

	"Your cube is very fast. Turning around is nearly instant. General walking is equally fast. Wall jumps are easily used to ascend large walls and occasionally used to save a few frames when turning around.

	"Quickly ascending is a very important part of movement in this game. Enemy cubes provide a very small bounce when landed on, but there are ways around this. Landing very closely to a cube allows you to jump while killing the cube at the same time, granting a much larger bounce than what the cube would provide. In situations where this doesn't work due to bad angles or positions, you can instead double jump as you land on the cube. If you've used your double jump already, you can hold jump to cancel out the cube's bounce, allowing you to land on whatever platform is beneath.

	$LF

[p 
	"For the first boss against the evil cube, we skip large amounts of waiting (and RNG) by hitting the boss on the same frame that it lands on the ground. This sets the boss to become damageable, but doesn't fully reset its speed value, resulting in it teleporting back up as if it was starting its hover phase while slowly floating down and remaining damageable. We then jump off to the side of the platform where the boss doesn't follow so we can hit the boss.

[p 
	"For the second and third boss, the cutscene after the bosses are killed are skipped by dying at the same time that the boss dies.

[p 
	"The final boss is supposed to move around the stage and force you to follow it while you dodge its laser beam and occasional projectiles. However, we can quite easily get it stuck beneath a platform to immediately hurt it before it can start trying to run away.

	": Nicely played; not much to say about this movie otherwise. I find this game cute and hard, but also quite boring, thought the audience enjoyed it, and there was no negative feedback. Gameplay looks like a polished version of the real-time run, mostly because there's not much variety you can introduce in this game.
