		"In the level where you get the gun, you can pass through walls if you turn around and then quickly jump to the right. It's used to skip through a few walls that normally you have to wait for the friendly alien to open.

	[li 
		"Sometimes if you skip killing a guard, other guards that would appear won't. This allows me to skip by one part of the game where you drop a green ball on one guard's head.

		"Discovered by Archanflel. Skipping the underwater section! nitsuja heads underwater to disable a laser alarm, but not me! I skip it completely. This saved a lot of time.

	[li 
		"When you get pulled out of the pit by the friendly alien, he gets caught by some guards and you have to kill one off. nitsuja did this, but he forgot to get rid of the corpse. The friendy alien doesn't move until you get rid of the corpse, so I shoot it too.

		"Some lag is reduced by killing off guards. This game is very laggy so you can't get rid of it all.

		"After you fall down a pit near the end of the run, you can pull a lever to let a beast lose to kill the guards. nitsuja does but I don't. I make a quick shield and knock out the guards. It is faster to do this then pull the lever.
