	"Spyman is a game by Ikiki, a Japanese game developer that releases games that are action games or action platformers. You may have seen their game "Nijukin" before in BrotherMojo's TAS which is what brought this game to my attention after I TASed it a while ago.

	"You're outside in rain. This level is fairly simple but is a tough introduction to the game. We wait a bit before jumping over the crates so I don't bump into them and so I can scale the building at a higher length. Note, in order to scale, you have to use your grappling hook. You must be close to the building to avoid the frames where the spy is pulled toward the building, because he moves down a bit. The two guards can be tough for new players. If they see you, they shoot a nearly unavoidable barrage of ammo at you and you die in one hit. We jump accross the pillars and climb the next building. Notice the guy in the suit? He's a guard too. But he is much easier to deal with, because he shoots one bullet at a time. We dart past him so he can't even notice us and slip down the manhole.

The windows are actually empty here - the glass is an illusion. By repeadetly jumping and grappling I can ascend the building, and then grapple to dodge the two spikes placed to prevent players from climbing all the way up the building and skipping the pillars.

By using the jump delay dodge, I can speedily move past all the guards so they don't shoot us. By moving on to the bottom floor, I grapple onto the stairs to start out fast, and then I go to the final stage.

Then I use the glitch to position Spyman in the wall so I can skip a section. By grappling accross two blue pipes, I head to the final section. I scale the wall quickly, and then grapple accross the long hallway. I try to be entertaining here by entering the wall while waiting for the smoke to vanish, then jump accross two pipes. Movie end.

	"I'm not sure. Maybe someone could find a way to glitch into walls without hitting the ground, which could save time in Level 5. There is also the possibility that I did something really dopey and wasted alot of time, but after a lot of revising levels, I don't think I did. The rerecord count is not THAT accurate - I had my previous runs to copy from so I didn't have to test strategies that much. Have fun with the movie pals.
