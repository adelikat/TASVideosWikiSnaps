	"As I said, I feel as though the general reaction in the thread was a bit harsh, but they all bring up very good points: You need to watch the other playarounds on the site and see what makes them entertaining, and I don't just mean skim through them and immediately try to copy them. I mean you have to study them. Or at least copy them much more closely next time. TASing a fighting game playaround takes a lot of skill, effort, and patience. You need to understand the game, you need to put the work in to make sure it looks like a proper TAS, and you need the patience to sit there ironing out every single little mistake, whether it be a blocked punch or a whiffed kick. These TASes need to be absolutely flawless. Hell, 
	[em

	" TASes need to be absolutely flawless. We may be harsh now, but it is more deservedly so this time around. Had this not been your second submission displaying numerous flaws, I feel we would be a lot kinder, especially if it seemed like you were listening to our suggestions... But I don't think you were.

	"Just to reiterate: At the very least,

	" use frame advance for your input. As a Judge, I shouldn't know that I'm going to reject a movie within the first 5 seconds, but I looked at the initial menuing and immediately thought "Yeah, that's absolutely suboptimal". Alongside that, use re-records much more liberally. We shouldn't be seeing missed or blocked attacks at all, let alone as frequently as they're happening in your submissions. The most useful, important thing you could do though is get involved with our community. Post more on the forums, upload some WIPs to Userfiles and share them with people, get audience feedback before making these submissions. Should you submit another low-quality, no-effort run like this, then we may revoke your submission privileges until you can prove to us that you're capable of making something worth publishing.

	"We don't mean to discourage you from making TASes in general, only terrible ones. We're an entire community made up of experts and newcomers alike, people who have been TASing for literally a decade and people who just picked up an emulator within the last month and started trying their hand at this hobby. There is absolutely someone out there who can help if you just ask, possibly multiple people depending on the game. And even if there isn't, someone will step up eventually. All we want is something entertaining, something worth watching, something where it's clear that great efforts were made into making the audience love what they see. You just need to take the time to make that.
