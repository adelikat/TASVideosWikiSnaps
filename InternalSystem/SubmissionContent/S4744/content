	"The story of PCE Ninja Gaiden happens in a parallel world of the Nes Ninja Gaiden. In this world, it seems Ryu Hayabusa doesn't master down + b slash cancelling and deadly spin slash, however, in game history the PCE Ryu still belongs to top ninja based on lots of his new skills, these are:

	"For throwing star, when using his ninpo, Ryu can release another ninpo in the second last frame of pulling his hand directly, then the third, the fourth ... after one frame gap. Therefore, as we have seen, the first three bosses are killed by Ryu's machine gun. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The maximum amount of throwing star able to exist in the screen is 5, if exceeding, some glitches may happen, yeah, the teleport in the third boss fight. The similar glitch is also the key to trigger the warp bug in the previous glitch run

	"When using spin-slash, if Ryu jumps again in the frame he just lands, he can keep spin-slash without cost of another 5 ninpos.

	"Ryu's one slash has 6 frames window doing damage, but the invincible time of the boss can only last for another frame, by controlling the distance between sword and boss, Ryu can hit the boss twice during one slash.

	$LF

[p 
	"Similar to twice-hit slash, by controlling the distance between spin-slash and boss, Ryu can keep damage the boss. Thus the deadly spin-slash looks like re-appearing in the sense of TAS.

	"The position of the platform edge is decided by the way of previous movement, we can achieve some super jumps such as stage 3 - 1 by edge controlling and fast movement

	"Some enemies' appearance requires proper backward of scroll, meanwhile, the wall-jump climbing sometimes can avoid backward movement. Thus some guys are absent of fighting with Ryu to survive.

	"Of course, the most heavy and boring task is optimization. The main trouble is due to the different kinds of moving speed, the obstacles and pits often mean that it's time to balance between usual walk and fast movement. Another trouble is the amount optimization of ninpo's picking up and using, normally only 5, 10 times throwing star (15, 30 ninpos respectively) can be used in a stage to guarantee running out of ninpo exactly after boss fight. Other considerations such as edge control, health and so on also affect the route more or less.
