	"Of course, the most heavy and boring task is optimization. The main trouble is due to the different kinds of moving speed, the obstacles and pits often mean that it's time to balance between usual walk and fast movement. Another trouble is the amount optimization of ninpo's picking up and using, normally only 5, 10 times throwing star (15, 30 ninpos respectively) can be used in a stage to guarantee running out of ninpo exactly after boss fight. Other considerations such as edge control, health and so on also affect the route more or less.
