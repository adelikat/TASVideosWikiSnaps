	": I'm surprised this game has never had a proper TAS, given its meme speedgame status a few years ago. Some sources call this game "Beethoven's 2nd"; this is the movie the game was based on, but the box art, cart, and manual all say "Beethoven The Ultimate Canine Caper!", so the current name is correct. All the optimization from the movement to the health management looks great, and it beats all known records. Accepting!
