	"I think the proper name for this is either a pure speedrun or suicidal run, there are some minor mistakes that can be fixed -- but I didn't notice them until afterwards. Also, you have to do some "second consuming" things on a few parts to be lucky to get a good item or whatever. I think it's a cool run though, if you've played the game you know that it can be insanely irritating and unfair at some points. Especially on suicidal runs like this. Doing a no damage run would take much longer because the enemies are quite strong.

	"Damage taken and lives lost to save time, when you start your new life you do this super attack that'll attack everything on the screen -- hence why I chose to die on a boss. I'm not sure if there are any shortcuts or warps, so none are used. The game got some nice music, and the final levels and music does actually give you that feeling like "I'm on my way to the end".
