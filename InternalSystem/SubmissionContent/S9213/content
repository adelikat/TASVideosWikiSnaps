	"The goal of the game is to create a face out of 4 pieces. Higher difficulties give more points, therefore "Hard" mode is used. More points are given if all the face pieces match. An extra "life" is obtained if the board is cleared, or extra points in case max lives is reached. Therefore, the fastest way to obtain points is to repeatably clear the board with a single face with all pieces matching.
