	"The Legend of Dark Witch was a 2014 game first released on the 3DS and later released on the PS Vita, PC, another PC Renovation version, and the Nintendo Switch. The main gameplay concept can be summarized as a Mega Man-like game with a Gradius style power system for additional gameplay options in stages. Syega Crystals have been stolen, and Zizou Olympia has come to investigate what has happened to the crystals.

	"With the release of BizHawk 2.10 giving the ability of making 3DS TASes with a piano roll, I felt it was a good time to go through my 3DS backlog that I built from the eShop closing sale. I originally got the trilogy of games for sale since they looked like my style of game and that the 3rd game is (as of 2 February 2025) still 3DS exclusive. The first game has some rough parts but overall I really enjoyed my time with the game and got interested in seeing how fast the game can be completed. After seeing

Each technical skill can be upgraded three times, at increasing prices per level, with about a +25% damage boost per upgrade. Tres drops from enemies can also be upgraded. This TAS elects to get the tres drop boost after Klinsy's stage to get enough tres for 2 Dia Missile upgrades from the shop. As Normal doesn't give as much tres compared to the Easy difficulty, it's not quite possible to max out Dia Missile's power before the final stage. While any technical skill could work for a boost, Dia Missile is the first on the menu and is the fastest to select.

A couple of tornadoes in a Z shaped corridor have their cycle set up by the camera position setting to get past them without really slowing down. It's possible to block the water spouts as each block of water is considered a projectile for some reason. A brief pause is done in the final section to avoid the tornadoes at the end. As Power isn't fully upgraded going into the Klinsy fight, a lot of blocking is done to get extra tres for the second Power upgrade for the rest of the fight. After the stage, the tres boost upgrade is bought from the shop.

Blocking is done to avoid one quill shot and a brief slowdown near the end of the stage is used to avoid the last quill shot to the boss. A Liner shot with the base damage of Dia Missile at the start of the fight against Blad is used for the first shot as the first possible chance to use Dia Missile for damage is longer than the i-frames of the first hit.

After the sole damage boost off the first spear section the first up zip is used to skip jumping up some platforms. A slow Circlecron shot is used to hit the next on-off switch used for an up zip as the shot's slow movement surprisingly speeds up performing the glitch. Blocking is used to get past an arrow with minimal slowdown. A boomerang gets blocked while mid-up zipping on the higher part towards the end of the stage.

Taking out the enemies that blow wind as soon as possible is important to avoid getting slowed down by them, although their movements make it possible to dodge some of the wind outright. For any path splits the top most path is universally slower due to needing to drop down a hole without much in the way of horizontal movement. A block was done on one of the snowflakes to avoid slowing down too much. As the Upper Tornado has limited range, running up to Al to use it is mandatory, although since she reaches red health she jumps away from the tornado's range. The final hit is done with Ground Upper since its vertical reach and speed takes out the remaining health quickly when boosted with the weapon swap glitch.

Blocking is used to avoid getting hit by a snowflake. Much like the tornadoes in Klinsy's stage, the camera position setting is used to get the set of 3 tornadoes past the on-off block section in a cycle that allows getting through without slowing down. The upper path in the section split is faster due to not needing to slow down. The first shot is done with Ground Upper as one weaker shot can substitute a Dia Missile hit on Verri to save time between hits. As the Dia Missile is only rank 2 it will only have 4 shots. Compared to the RTA run on Easy where a max rank Dia Missile gets 4 additional diagonal shots for more coverage, I can't get all of the first frame hits of Dia Missile on Verri.
