	"Back in the day I never actually finished SGNG I only got to the point where the princess tells you to get the oh so powerfull goddess' bracelet and summons you back to the start. So I dug up some walkthroughs wanting to know where can I find it. And as the walkthrough kept talking about "the 5th chest you open has the ring", THE RING?, and when I had opened my 3rd chest. I had some weird fairy-like thing coming out, later on I realized it was the goddess' bracelet or the ring or whatever you prefer :p. So I lost about 1Â½-2seconds while opening my 4th chest. I also "miss" couple of shots to the bosses but none of them affects my time nor looks bad imo ;), and I miss the red gargoyles on purpose to keep them away from me :p.

	"Oh almost forgot about the weapon of choice, it was so long ago when I last played this game that I had no idea about which weapon would be the fastest one to use. Although im pretty sure the dagger that I used first is the fastest one. In the quest finding the bracelet I used it from lvl2 till the end.
