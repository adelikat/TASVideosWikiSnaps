	", you do have the option to "Cancel" your own submissions. It is not necessary to clear out the submission notes. Also, since we do see that you are viewing this area...you need to be aware that conversations have been occurring in the "Discussion" threads of your entries. You need to come back often to participate, as they can be helpful in analyzing your work. Additionally, this would be where you could also ask for a cancellation...even though you have permission to do so yourself.
