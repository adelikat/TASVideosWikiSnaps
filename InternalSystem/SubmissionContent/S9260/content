	": Un-Claiming.  While it may ultimately be fine with the community.  I personally don't like the use of intentional "Game Over" even when it saves time overall.   I understand why others may be ok with the technique because it is ultimately faster; but I just feel that getting a "Game Over" is a degree of failure when it comes to gaming.  I'd rather see a run that doesn't get a "Game Over" even if it's longer, compared to one that gets a "Game Over" to save time.  Personal preference.
