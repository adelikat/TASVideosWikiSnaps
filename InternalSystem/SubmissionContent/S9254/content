	"Dead Zone is a November 1986 Famicom Disk System adventure game developed by Sunsoft. The introduction in the manual starts with the protagonist Kirk McRae, romanized as Cark in game, and his beloved Mary getting engaged. Their wedding had to be delayed as Mary's new job working on Lionex. Before departing, Mary gave Kirk a gift: a robot named Carry. Five months later Mary sent a message to Kirk that the Lionex project had been set up a month early and invited Kirk to celebrate. When Kirk arrived, the colony was empty and Kirk was knocked out. The game begins at the point Kirk wakes up in the scrap heap of the ship. From here, players must guide Kirk through the ship to figure out what happened on Lionex.

	"This is an early adventure game by Sunsoft, around the time when the company was known more for questionable games like Ikki and Atlantis no Nazo. It's an incredibly short game with its main draw having some voice synthesis provided by the tech from Electronic Speech Systems. Outside of that novelty and a few interesting ideas, the game design is a mess with a lot of commands that aren't useful, items that don't do anything to progress the game, and questionable event flags needed to progress. This game was developed around what a few folks consider the turning point of Sunsoft going from a developer of questionably fascinating games to an incredible developer of fantastic games.

	"I've been playing the Famicom Detective Club remakes on the Switch and been enjoying them. This made me curious about other adventure games on the NES and Famicom, starting with this one since that's one I've heard of for some reason. I've heard that the game was pretty rough to play and kind of had to see for myself. I came across agreeing that its design isn't good, especially if I had to look up the exact order of events to do something as simple as plugging in a computer. However, I still found it interesting on what does work, or at least interesting enough to make 2 whole TASes for it. It also gave me an excuse to make a "dual language" TAS though obviously the English text makes that one run longer.

I went with something related to that though you have to squint to read GSOZ as 6502.

Back outside the pipe has to be checked twice for the laser knife. This is missable, though at least death restarts the player at the start of an area. After the knife is obtained the hallway is flooded by removing the bolts on the pipe with the wrench. A bit further down the hallway the security robot is electrocuted by messing with the power wire by juggling the fuse and cutting the power wire.

Kirk has to check the computer after getting the power back on to realize it has no power because it's unplugged, possibly set up like that to pad game time. Once the computer has power the monitor will say that the conveyor belt's malfunctioning. Once the scrap stuck to the rollers is removed and Carry tosses it into the abyss, the power once again has to be activated to use the computer again. Kirk then enters a command that allows for the conveyor belt to run, allowing him to enter the engine room.

This is an unserious game. Taking the elevator, Kirk throws the loose handle at the lights to trigger the security alarm. This opens the door to the next area.

	"While it would be nice to have a separate encode of the English fan translation there are a couple of issues. The first issue is that I don't want to actually give the publishers extra work if it's not actually needed. I don't want to come off as demanding at all, especially for what is ultimately inessential. The other issue is that it's a fan work and I don't know the logistics of needing the translating group's permission for that to be on the TASVideos channel. I'm open to discussion about it if it's something worth addressing.
