	"Hi ! Its Mr.TASer, and I've created a TAS of the rom hack Super Mario Bros. in which the minus world has been extended by placing a flagpole at the end which auto generates random levels.
	$LF
	"I created this in BizHawk 2.6.2 with TAS Studio.
	$LF
	"The BIOS I used was the "FDS_disksys-nintendo.rom". I found it in an archive for BizHawk firmware archive.
	$LF
	"In this run, I've clipped through the wall of 1-2 and got into the pipe before the text "2","3", or "4" appears above them to reach a messy world called minus world. It is called so because there is no world number in it's name " -1".
	$LF
	"And please don't say that I've wasted time by backwards jumping because it isn't.
	$LF
	"I had just beaten all the levels as soon as possible, and there is no warp in this category, also the aim is to touch the flagpole of " -3", after -3, nothing loads for some reason.
	$LF
	"I used TAS Studio, RAM Watch for making it and FFMPEG extension for encoding in 2K (4:3).
	$LF
	"You can view it on the embedded video.
	$LF
	"I posted this because, once I saw a TAS of "Extra Mario Bros." on the channel and thought to submit it because it is also pretty speedrunned hack.
	$LF
	"Please support by favouring :)

	"This is only 3 rooms more than what you can already access in the original game by entering the 1-2 warp pipe too early, and several worlds less than what you can normally play in the original. We can't say this hack adds unique content to the base game, it only allows accessing some glitched "content" that is already there, but there's nothing useful you can do with it even then.
