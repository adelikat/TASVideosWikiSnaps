	"Wizardry, a good old RPG-style game, is so popular that it won't need many explanation. The goal of the game is to recover an amulet from an evil wizard, Werdna. You create various characters, choosing a race, an alignment, a job, etc. And you organize a party. The party will explore Werdna's maze many times, and they will gain more skills, and more powerful items. Finally, they will beat Werdna and be rewarded for recovering the amulet. But be careful, as there are evil monsters and traps in the maze.

	"Of course, luck manipulation is mandatory to achieve a fast run in this game. The 16-bit random number 
	[tt 
		"$40
	]tt
	" controls over the luck. The random number increases every frame, and it is affected a little by the player's input. So, I made a number of bots with Lua scripting to find optimal solutions. And I analyzed some assembly codes to understand the game.

	"Lags often occur in this game because the random number affects the flow of codes. For example, when you go up/down to another floor, some lags can occur (probably, they are caused by the code initializing floor data). I tried avoiding lag as possible as I can, using bots.

	"The random number is changed by the routines which interact with the random number. Furthermore, the random number continues to be incremented while the game are waiting for NMI at every frame. So, the clock cycles needed by the codes executed at every frame affect the random number. (note: The NMI routine doesn't use RTI to return. It returns with RTS, restoring stack pointer from memory)
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"That's why player's inputs affect the random number. Inputs of direction keys are processed in the NMI routine, and the needed clock cycles depend on whether a player made inputs or not. So the random number changes by player's inputs. But, the random number changes only a little by a input at one frame, so we often need to make inputs for a certain period to manipulate luck.

	"Especially, I wasted about 60 frames when I get items from the chest on B9F. I had to wait for some time to get a Dagger of Thieves. And I wanted the Thief to have a Ring of Movement, but I could not help giving up it to get a Dagger of Thieves without a large loss. So an equipment takes time a bit more. In this scene, luck maniputation is so difficult that more precise planning would be required.

[div class=p 
	"I considered a new strategy that I pick up a Sword of Slicing on B4F and a Scroll of Darkness on B9F. With Scroll of Darkness, there is roughly a 0.05% chance that a Ninja decapitate Werdna even if he has only 15 or fewer Strength. So, with this strategy, we no longer need to create any character. But for now, I can't tell whether this strategy really saves time. Thief can't equip Sword of Slicing, so we have to equip twice and it takes time unexpectedly. And it takes time a bit more to beat Werdna's party.
