We do all of these things in the verification movie. While customizing the character is optional, we just opted for the "Andy" preset, creating tricks and assigning tricks is really important and, alone, will save two minutes or so.
	$LF
]p
[p

	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"CATBAG is the biggest trick in the game's history. Originally discovered by PokemonAce101 in THUG2, the process was copied over into THUG1 by SubZeroReptile where it's true potential could be realized. It isn't a complex trick, but it is multifaceted.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"For starters: Starting in THUG1, players had the ability to create their own custom tricks. The trick comes into play since the game doesn't have any sort of check to ensure you did the proper trick. All the game looks for is the NAME of the trick in the trick string. So, if you had a Created Trick called McTwist, the game would think you actually did the real McTwist. If the game told us to do a McTwist, we could use the Created Trick version and it will count!
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Of course, we will abuse the hell out of this. Instantly, we can now move McTwist out of our Special Trick slots, put in another trick to optimize points further (especially on Sick difficulty), and have Created Trick called McTwist as a replacement. However, we take this a step further.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In several sections in this game, there are callout sections where you are tasked to do every trick the game gives you before proceeding. An intended mechanic is that if the same trick is called out several times, you only have to do it once. Now, if you have the same trick on multiple combinations, regardless if it is a grab or a flip trick, the game will count it all as the same thing. This means we can get rid of ALL of the RNG in the game by having every trick in our basic trick arsenal (save for one) be one trick, in this case, Nut Buster.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"To do this part, we have to get past a check in the trickset menu. Normally, if the same trick from one spot is assigned to another, the game would just reverse the two tricks. However, it was discovered that if you take a random Created Trick, assign it to wherever you wanted and replaced the random Created Trick with the one you wanted, the game WOULDN'T check. As you can tell, this is a well-made game.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Created Tricks are also allowed to have whatever pre-made trick animation you want, with spins or even sound effects, and you can also modify how long an animation must last. Currently, the lowest we can go is 0.4, but I am sure this will eventually be circumvented as well. With this, we have crazy tricks that last 0.4 seconds, and we can pull off a lot of them really fast.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The problem? Because the animations don't take long, the tricks hardly give any points. It would take four CATBAG tricks with a manual or two to even get SPECIAL, which isn't optimal. So, as a sacrifice, we opt for one of the combinations (usually up grab or up-right grab) to be either Madonna/Judo or FS Shifty/BS Shifty so we can get SPECIAL as quickly as possible (as a Boneless + 180 Judo or Boneless + 180 BS Shifty will give us over the 3,000 required for SPECIAL).

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Now, the first issue of the run occurs here, albeit I couldn't find a way around it. Depending on your RNG seed (which is determined by buttons pressed, frame count, etc.) will be where the skateboard parts spawn and how fast they move. After going through a few different seeds, I couldn't find one that would work in my favor, so I had to do a small jump here, unfortunately. This wasn't an issue last TAS since we did all of the setup at the beginning instead of in a verification file.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Once we get to the barriers, I do go for style instead of speed. When we jump over the two barriers in one clear jump, we do lose around two frames to it. But, due to how cool it is and it's complexity (nearly pixel perfect), I elect to go with it. This is the only instance that "cool" is slower than fast.

		"Walk Charles
	]b
	" is an auto-scroller and a lengthy one at that. The alternative to this goal is about 45 seconds slower, so we have to do this for the time being. QN is, again, used here. Once I grab Charles' leash, I do let go and grab it again at different intervals. Fog discovered that you could let go at a certain time (when the second counter on the top ticks down), re-grab, and not lose time. So, out of boredom, we mess with this a little.

		"Demo New Playground Setup
	]b
	", we need to attain 100,000 points. To easily accomplish this, we will be using one of the most well-known glitches in our franchise, butt-slapping. The glitch, which was introduced in THUG1 and it is apparent all the way into Proving Ground, is done by approaching an edge, ollie-ing, doing a trick (grab, flip, or otherwise), and mashing the ollie button during the beginning of the animation. The more times you are successful, the higher your jump will be and, with the new CATBAG trick, the timing for this is extended.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"After impressing the locals, we have to do the chapter finale called 
	[b 
		"Get the Stolen goods From the Dealers
	]b
	". Originally, this is supposed to be a "sneak" mission and you must do it without your board. Years ago, Coombs discovered that you could get into the Street Warriors car, retry the goal, and the game wouldn't take your board away. This may look like it loses time, but it saves several seconds!

This trick was originally found by Pyatters three years ago, it is performed by letting go of the car on one of three very specific frames.

		"High Score

[p 
	[b 
		"Help the Student

	" has a few routing changes in it, but a lot more style in it as well. The first notable change is that I elect for a weird wallride, called a boostplant, to get a little bit of height to get the purse and acid drop for speed. Luckily this is slightly faster than the real method, as it looks cooler!
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Right now would be a good time to talk about boostplants, as I will do them a few more times through the run (especially Tampa). If you hit wallride on the same frame as doing a grab, you will do both at the same time. And, with a fair amount of up+ollie (which is normally wall jump), the game will store them until the animation of the grab trick finished. Once it is done, it will perform them all at once. We can manipulate this a lot, as you'll continue to see through the run.

If you got the glitch, the game would skip out on a few cutscenes, including a dialogue with a guard, and place you in the dome instead of in the courtyard.
