	"Earthbound Zero is the first game in the Mother/Earthbound series.  It was localized, but never released in the US.  Technically, the game was localized as Earthbound, but the sequel was localized and released as Earthbound, so this game generally goes by the name Earthbound Zero.

	"The starmen.net walkthrough incorrectly states that he can be killed by a reflected PK Beam gamma.  It turns out that he is immune to Beam gamma, so I don't need the Franklin Badge yet.  However, he can be tied up with the Rope, leaving him defenseless and allowing me to SMAAAASH him into oblivion.

	"Ninten needs to be at level 25 to wake the dragon, so I need to powerlevel.  The 4x LastStarman encounter gives the most exp, and is very easy to defeat with EVE and the Franklin Badge (from Duncan's factory).  EVE kills the ones that are too smart to commit suicide.  Often, winning the battle in 2 turns is faster than the manipulation required for a 1-turn victory.

	"His inexplicable attack deals 28-46 damage with PSI Shield, and 14-23 damage with PSI Shield while defending.  With some manipulation, Ninten's 181 HP allowed him to survive the first 9 turns (6 attacks while defending and 3 without defending).  Giegue becomes vulnerable after his action on turn 8, so I start singing then, and heal with LifeupCream when necessary.  I only need to survive 5 attacks from full HP after the first LifeupCream, so luck manipulation becomes practically unnecessary for the rest of the battle.
