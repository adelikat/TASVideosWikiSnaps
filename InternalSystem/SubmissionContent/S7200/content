	"In the second half of the level, right after the big swinging spiked balls, you can jump into the pit and clip through an invisible wall which normally prevents you from accessing later parts of the level. If done correctly, you can trigger the checkpoint before falling to your death, and then respawn there, skipping the second river part and some other bits of the level. This is precise but still RTA-viable. Dying after triggering the checkpoint is unavoidable because nothing is solid (walls and floors are not "active").

	"I needed to redo the whole fight because I now start the fight on a different RNG setting than the previous TAS. This turned out to be slightly less lucky but still manageable. With some trial and error I managed to beat the boss before he jumps off the stage, and improved the DPS a bit, which made up for the worse luck and ended up being the same number of frames as my previous TAS. I am satisfied with this.
