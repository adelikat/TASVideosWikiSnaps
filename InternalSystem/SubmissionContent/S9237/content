	"There exist two versions of this game: The original retail release by XS Games, and the DSiWare release by Cinemax from 2011/2012. Compared to the latter, this version is far more interesting in my opinion. Levels have more sections, the soundtrack has more variety, and although they aren't featured in this run, you can also collect colour-coded floppy disks to gain access to two secret levels.

It's also home to one of my favourite speed strats since it moves in an arc: Fire off three of them at a big shielded tank approaching from the left while jumping, and you save yourself a lot of resources that would otherwise be wasted destroying the shield as well (though sadly, this doesn't work as fast when they approach from the right).

Whatever it hits, wherever it be the ground or an enemy, the explosion will stay for a few seconds, continuing to inflict damage up to 46 HP. This is the best grenade to save up for bosses as well as the odd slow moving enemy.

The fact that you can't hit it the first two times it swims past the screen doesn't really help either.
