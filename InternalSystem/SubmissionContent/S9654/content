	"It is the 25th century. You as the space pilot Buck Rogers are in the middle of a battle for Planet Zoom. A battle of life and death, because your biggest enemy is the hostile carrier spaceship. But before you meet it you will have to use your abilities against electrically loaded posts, alien spaceships and space-hoppers. And always take care of your fuel consumption, as a smash on Planet Zoom will always end in a loss of one of your spaceships. The faster you fly, the less fuel you need. When you have destroyed the carrier spaceship, your fuel will be refilled.

From what I can tell, all three of them appear to be the same ROM with the exception of the game name within the ROM header itself being different.  Any of the 3 can likely be used for encoding/publication.
