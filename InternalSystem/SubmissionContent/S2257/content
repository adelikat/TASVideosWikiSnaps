I now know this isn't true.  the speed of bonk when hes invincible seems to be about 3 times faster then normal bonk, and normal meat power is about twice as fast, which is why I need to get the meat.  Similiarly small meat power gives you twice as much damage, and big meat power gives you 3 times as much.  When the invincibility wears out I can keep his speed by staying in the air and not pressing right.  boss goes down in one hit.  normally you have to wait a long time while the ending music plays, and then bonk walks slowly to the right while the screen scrolls at the same pace until it reaches the end of the level.
