	"In this run, Bart Bonte's Full Moon flash point-and-click puzzle game is beaten in record time. RTA runs are timed the same way as TAS, from power on to last input. The current RTA world record is 77 seconds, so this TAS saves 27 seconds off the current world record. Because the game can be beaten very quickly if window bounds are ignored, this run is part of the Mouse Within Window Bounds branch, or branch-less depending on your perspective. See

	"The game is 600 pixels wide, so I have restricted all my mouse inputs to be within 0 and 599 inclusive. The game will not register that you clicked something if you do not let the mouse hover over the location for a frame, which is why all mouse locations are duplicated. Some do not even check that the mouse is where it was on the last frame, but for consistency I just duplicated every mouse location because it does not matter anyway, you need 2 frames per unique click regardless.

	"Dragging takes 2 frames. One frame to establish that you have clicked the object, then a second drag frame where you warp the cursor where you want the rock to go. In addition, dragging is not based on absolute cursor coordinates but instead are relative to where you picked up the rock. This normally would not matter but screen scrolling combined with limiting myself to no out of bounds mouse movement means I have to wait a few frames before dragging the rocks around.

	"It is sometimes possible to click bulbs that are underground but only when they are marginally underground and in the official flash player. The time save would be minimal, but it may be possible to save time here if underground bulb clicking were implemented. Also, the 3 strung bulbs are not controlled by the player, that is just an animation that results when you click the right bulbs.

After it is collected, it is possible to move the cursor away and it will make the fruit disappear during its falling animation, which I find humorous so I did just that.

Fun fact not in my encode: because I finish the level before the music fades out, the game does not properly play the dance music that is supposed to trigger when you complete this level and you are left watching owls and the bunny dance in absolute silence as the credits roll.
