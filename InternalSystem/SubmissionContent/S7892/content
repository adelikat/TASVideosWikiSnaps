	"The game has 3 (technically 4 but we skip sniping) main parts. Getting snipers into position, providing sniper fire to cover your team, rappelling down the building to breach it, and a first person breach and clear run and gun section which acts like a grid based first person shooter. All in all, pretty impressive for the NES.

	"A further 9 frames were saved in the building itself, I rerouted from scratch and clear out the first floor a little early as it gives more favorable enemy movements that way; we get many hallway kills by doing this which is generally more favorable than going through doors since the door transition takes longer than simply turning or moving.

	"You can finesse the enemy movements by shooting in certain windows and certain frames, so you'll occasionally see me shoot at nothing in an effort to bait in an enemy into the screen so we can kill them more quickly. Occasionally we also delay other actions for spawn purposes.
