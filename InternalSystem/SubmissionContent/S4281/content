	" while gathering all 64 livers in each particle accelerator.  You travel at 1 PPF (pixels per frame), or 2 if you hold down B.  You can move 1-2 lanes over at any gap (located above, below, left, and right).  Using a glitch, you can also move 3 lanes over (see "Triple Lane Switch" below).  Clones can switch lanes (only one lane at a time) in 4 frames in the top and bottom gaps, or 8 frames in the left or right gaps.

	"There's a varying degree of difficulty in each accelerator.  Every 5 accelerators, the AI loops and you lose 1 life out of 3 (e.g., accelerator 6 and 11 are the same as accelerator 1, but with 2 lives at accelerator 6 and 1 at accelerator 11).  At the end of accelerator 15, you have no life and the game presents you with a consolatory 
	[a class=extlink href=http://i.imgur.com/23g5BmN rel=nofollow

	", which is miles different from the 
	[a class=extlink href=http://imgur.com/nbP5Ofs rel=nofollow 
		"game over screen

	".  Because accelerator 6-15 uses the

	" Going Fast
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The fastest way to play is to hold down B at all times.  This is not possible when moving 2 lanes over.  However, if you release B for the first frame of the lane change, and hold B for the remainder of the lane changes, you will have maximum speed while succeeding in the double lane change.

[h4 
	" Triple Lane Switch
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"The game was intended to only allow the player to move 2 lanes at most over each gap, and without changing directions during the lane switch.  However, we found that under some frame-precise circumstances, the player can move 3 lanes over, can switch into a lane and back in a single gap, and can even change lanes once (e.g., left), change back, then change lanes on the other side (e.g., right).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When Address 02 divided by 4 has a remainder of 1, and if the car has the correct coordinates at this frame, you can perform this glitch.  We used it in accelerator 2 to trick the clone into thinking we were in a different lane than we actually were. Edit: The glitch is no longer used in accelerator 2.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"In practice, satisfying 
	[em 
		"(02h) % 4 = 1
	]em
	" may require slowing down for a few frames, so the triple lane switch becomes less practical if you need to slow down for many frames.
	$LF

[h4 
	" Fast Lane Switches
	$LF
]h4
[p 
	"Watching (26h), single lane switches on top and bottom can take at minimum 9 frames, while single lane switches on the left and right can take 13.  The first half of double lane switches are also this long.  Watching Address 26 is useful, because you can count the length of the lane switch by the number of frames.  Also, you can usually predict the length of the lane switch by looking at (02h).  When (02h) % 4 = 3, the lane switch will be optimal.

	" Improvement Summary
	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"Unless otherwise indicated, a lane change number is assumed to count the number of single lane changes.  A "d" after the number denotes a double lane change.  For example, "4 + d" is 4 single lane changes and a double lane change.  Also, "tls" stands for "triple lane switch", and "w" stands for "wait".
