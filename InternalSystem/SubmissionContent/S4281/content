You can move 1-2 lanes over at any gap (located above, below, left, and right).  Using a glitch, you can also move 3 lanes over (see "Triple Lane Switch" below).  Clones can switch lanes (only one lane at a time) in 4 frames in the top and bottom gaps, or 8 frames in the left or right gaps.

However, we found that under some frame-precise circumstances, the player can move 3 lanes over, can switch into a lane and back in a single gap, and can even change lanes once (e.g., left), change back, then change lanes on the other side (e.g., right).

	"Watching (26h), single lane switches on top and bottom can take at minimum 9 frames, while single lane switches on the left and right can take 13.  The first half of double lane switches are also this long.  Watching Address 26 is useful, because you can count the length of the lane switch by the number of frames.  Also, you can usually predict the length of the lane switch by looking at (02h).  When (02h) % 4 = 3, the lane switch will be optimal.
