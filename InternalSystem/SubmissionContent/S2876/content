But because of many restarts because of improvements because of new tricks and our general goal to make it as perfect as we goal, we never really got to finish it.

	"A couple of months ago, we (Arne and I) found a new warp glitch (Explaind further down) that would skip several levels, including one that made both the any% and the 101% stop its progress for a long time. This gave me instant motivation to work as hard as I could on this run to actually finish it. So I started the project in August this year and worked several hours almost every day. The plan was to have Arne to work along with me, but because of his lack of motivation as well as other things to do, I ended up working on this run myself. A huge thanks to Arne however for all his help with the run!

But if you don't hold right, Diddy/Donkey will roll a little bit further than the "first exit location" is. Once you are at the edge of the screen, press right and you have saved a few frames.

	"The effect of this glitch is that you'll roll in midair with the same speed as if you were rolling. You can change the direction you are rolling in and to cancel it you can just make a regular jump.

But however, I haven't actually found out why/when you are able to cancel the jumprolls this way...

]h3
[div class=p 
	"This is the glitch that saved the most time in the run, almost 7 minutes. I'll start with explaining the invisible barrel glitch. Arne found out a few years ago that if you threw a steel barrel, jump onto it, picked it up and then jumped into a Star Barrel, the barrel would break eachother but Diddy/Donkey would still be holding something. Later on, it was found that you could simply throw a barrel and pick it up while it's rolling, and then destroy the two barrels. It also works with floating DK-barrels.It's when you hold an invis barrel where the fun begins. Diddy/Donkey is in fact holding something. The object is the next sprite (Enemies, barrels etc.) that will spawn after you have activated the glitch. The sprite won't move and you can't always see that you are actually holding the enemy or whatever. If you try to throw the barrel, you'll release the effect. The effect can be that the sprite you are holding is flying away with super speed, it can be teleported to you, as well as a few other effects.
	$LF
	"When the sprite you are holding is unspawned, disappearing from the screen, you'll hold the next sprite that appears. In the run, you'll see that I turn around sometimes before and after activating the glitch. This was because of spawning one sprite and then unspawn it so that another one can be spawned.

	"Makes sense, right? In the end, I want to hold the opening to the first bonus, and this was the fastest way doing so.
	$LF
	"Once you are holding the bonus you can get to several different locations in the game. One of the three first levels, third level in the second world and the fifth level in th fourth world. The level you warp to depends on how you threw the barrel and which character you are using. Often when you warp like this, the game will crash. With the use of memory addresses, Arne and Deign found which levels you came to when the game crashed. The furthest was the second to last boss in the game, Master Necky SNR. But as the game crashes all the time, there was no way to actually be able to reach that location.

	"This run warped to Torchlight Trouble, the furthest you can reach without it crashing. In order to warp there, you have to use Donkey Kong and put the barrel down to open the bonus.

Also, when I only have one monkey on the map screen, I save about 10 frames between each level. As you have to wait until both Kongs are standing still on the level before you can enter, with only one monkey the waiting time is shorter.
