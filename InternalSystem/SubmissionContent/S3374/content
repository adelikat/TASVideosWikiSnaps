	"This is a run using Bass on Hard Difficulty. I installed the DLC that unlocks Bass as a playable character, and started from a save that has completed the game once already in order to allow access to Hard Mode. For this run, I use Bass. He has several abilities that contributed to the speed of this run.

	"The damage on Bass' main arm cannon has been halved in order to balance the upgrades. But there are times I need the full power of the buster. In order to achieve this, I switch to the Treble weapon. After calling Treble, every shot is the same as Mega Man's buster. As long as I don't touch Treble, I can use this alternate buster.
