	"For character exclusive mechanics, you can short hop and teleport repeatedly with duskmon to cause damage and reposition yourself the only problem it's actually RANDOM where he spawns, he usually tracks enemies or items, but the more enemies you have the less consistent you can repeated teleport. You also need to touch the floor again to reuse your moves and that includes the teleport.

	"A single differing fight should not make a whole different branch.  Furthermore these branches do not have exclusive bosses with the exception of the top and bottom paths.  An argument was made that these branches are similar to Megaman Powerfighters but in that game each route has different bonuses and different exclusive bosses giving different powerups except for Wily's castle's bosses. The stages themselves and the enemies in them appear in other branches in this game. There are no different endings upon defeating a different ending boss here.  Beating them only unlocks them.  Having six different branches for each boss both for each Hard and Easy difficulties alongside whether it is a savegame or not along with other potential branches like 100% is an excessive number of potential branches. For these reasons having boss specific branches for this not suitable for Standard.

	"With the current rule change accepting both Hard and Easy this means Hard is acceptable to Standard.  This Hard setting is chosen on the character select screen. While the word "Hard" appears on the branching paths it is to hint to the player the overall difficulty of the path.  This means that this game was selected to be Hard, but easier and faster "tree" route selections exist.  Accepting this as "Hard, savegame" for Standard is not possible since this chooses a longer path while faster paths are known to exist.

Killer Instinct needed to get to the credits, but here a point has to be decided for when a viewer would know that the game was truly complete. For cases like this without credits generally judges discuss it and decide what would be a clear ending.  In this case that getting to that ending point of the cutscene point was decided.
