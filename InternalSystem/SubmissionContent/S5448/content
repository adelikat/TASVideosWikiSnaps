I'm not exactly happy about the manipulation of the fat man, since depending on how close you are, he may wonder off path a bit. However I needed to make him stay in a spot such that he would also clip me OoB (to avoid a spray trap at the entrance), so it was tricky.

There's also no way to push the chair down to the floor so I could grab it with Verne without using Hammy to push it beforehand. Luckily, the dog's wander radius allows the mic to trigger it, allowing me to use it to clip out.

It's intended for you to use RJ and throw Verne over then instead, then find a switch and disable the lasers. However, at the peak of RJ's jump, there's a brief period you can make it over.

The best place to swap between them is during the pepper spray with RJ, and right at the laser fence with Verne. For RJ, if I didn't swap to Verne right there, I'd get hit by the pepper spray, which for some reason doesn't hurt me (for this stage) when offscreen. Verne seems unable to walk past the laser fence while clipping in, so might as well hop back to RJ instead. For some reason, the kitchen was very laggy despite nothing much there.
