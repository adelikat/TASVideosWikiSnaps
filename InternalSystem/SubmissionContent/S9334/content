It's possible to clip through the top of a corner, which will warp you to the top of it, which also does (and doesn't) preserve your horizontal speed. This can be used to jump slightly longer distances, which is surprisingly useful.

Not only does it save that time, but it also saves some time in the spring on the left because I can move to the right before jumping off the spring earlier, saving some time. Also, I skip using the pipes because of the fact that coyote time and a corner clip allow me to just barely jump over the gap.

The second reason, which is catalyzed by the first reason, is that the buzzy beetles have to be moving to the left when I press the button, because completing the level while the beetles crossing over you delays the fadeout by a lot of time. Using the goomba to grab the shine without pressing the button could've been a possibility, but the goomba falls on the pit too soon in order for me to try to do that. Besides that, it's just normal movement (also, it's faster to delay when coming from the left than coming from the right).
