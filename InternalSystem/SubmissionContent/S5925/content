[p 
	"Sonic the Hedgehog Megamix (commonly shortened to Sonic Megamix) is a work-in-progress multiperson disassembly modification of the original Sonic the Hedgehog videogame for the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis, developed by Team Megamix and ported to the Sega Mega-CD in the last version. The game features the ability to play as one of five different characters: Sonic the Hedgehog, Mighty the Armadillo, Shadow the Hedgehog, Miles "Tails" Prower, and Knuckles the Echidna. It is an extensive reworking of the original game, featuring new art, music, abilities, layouts, and other things.

[p 
	"Interestingly, this hack fixes the glitch called "horizontal underflow" or better known as "level warp" - the glitch that teleports the character instantly at the end of the level, keep in mind that it's not banned by us in the movie, the hack developers fixed it. But others like the "zip" are still present, since it's a routine incorporated into the game engine.

		"DDRKhat, fano, emu2000, Comicalflop, Crramalama
	]a
	", but for some reason they were not submitted here (I guess because at that time of 2007 the hack was not as developed as now, seeing that team megamix paused his development in 2008, returned again in 2012, but according to the main developer is "paused" actually).

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There was an attempt by feeuzz to continue it but he lost his wip and is currently inactive, and recently there was a sub-optimal submission of PLAYERONE that we asked with WST: why not? So we grabbed nitsuja's wip and finished it, we decided to keep his input in order to maintain his legacy since his wip is up to our current standards.

	"For me, it's a good hack, TASing it was fun and a good experience with my other teammates, the levels are really good and full of atmosphere, the only bad thing for me was the repeatable music of the speed shoes, but beyond that It was nice, it only remains for you to judge and decide if the hack deserve a place in TASVideos along with other hacks published in the past.

	": Before anything, I must address the version choice. There are 2 official releases and one that 1 that was an unofficial, incomplete leak. The first being of "Sonic 1 Megamix" v3.0, which is considered the most stable release and is on Genesis/Mega Drive. The most notable thing here is the number of hits the final boss takes before defeated. In the v3.0 release, Robotnik takes the same number of hits as the original Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit). The next release and considered the most current (and probably final release) is v4.0b, which is what this submission uses. This version made some additions and changes that were omitted from v3.0 such as changing from Genesis/Mega Drive to SegaCD, updating a few zones, adding 2 more characters, and more. The other thing about this version is that, unlike v3.0, the final boss hit count was changed to 1. Nevertheless, both would be eligible for acceptance into Moons. Just not the same category side by side.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"That being said, the hack in question is one of the most well known Sonic the Hedgehog ROM hacks to exist and is of really high quality. As for the submission... Does it do enough to justify acceptance onto the site? Yes! The optimization is solid and clear, the entertainment value holds well without dragging on too long, and the audience response has been mostly positive. With that out of the way...
