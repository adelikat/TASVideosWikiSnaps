	"The attacks BLIND, PANIC, and SLAVE each has a base time of 210 frames. You multiply your ATT and the target's DEF when you use one of the earlier mentioned attacks. Since I'm using Peach and Koopa, Peach versus Koopa will last 420 frames, while Koopa to Peach lasts a scary 1260 frames.
	$LF

	"MES simply states how many seconds it will take before the special is rerandomized. Since I'm using Peach and Koopa, these specials will change every 180 and 300 frames, respectively. Clearing a line at the time may delay this, and clearing a line of Yoshi's Cookies will activate and then change the special.
	$LF

[p 
	"LIM indicates the time limit before you lose. It is reset when you clear a line, and is frozen while you are not in control (line being cleared, or under effect of SLAVE or PANIC). This is also adjusted by the Time Speed setting, but Koopa at Low still runs out faster than anyone else at Hi. It "rarely" matters under TAS conditions, but this run has Hi Time Speed set for both players: Koopa has only 480 frames to react, while Peach can take her time with 880 frames.

	$LF
]p
[p 
	"You can clear multiple lines at once. The game will check for new lines formed after clearing a line before refreshing the 5x5 grid. It's quite possible to empty out the entire grid, should the clever player find a way, and get double the points for doing so. That isn't easy to do, but it looks so easy during Round 3 of this TAS.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"There is also a special type of cookie, one which looks like Yoshi's head. If you clear a line involving these, you trigger whatever special is shown below the player's character. When the game is restoring the 5x5 grid, it will add in 1 Yoshi cookie if you clear one line of any normal cookie (that is, not a Yoshi Cookie), or 5 Yoshi cookies if you clear two or more lines of normal cookies in the same combo.
	$LF

[p 
	"The available specials are BLIND, PANIC, SLAVE, +3, +7, -3, and -7. The numbers simply add or subtract from the target's current score. The other three are attacks that impair the victim in some way. BLIND covers the 3x3 area around the center. PANIC scrambles the cookies around for the duration, effectively paralyzing the victim. SLAVE grants control of the opponent to you, copying your actions. You can hit yourself with these, using both your ATT and DEF. The effects of ATT and DEF are already explained earlier.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"SLAVE is a special case when hitting yourself with it. You do not grant control of yourself to your enemy doing this. Instead, if you begin the combo, then the enemy hits you with SLAVE before it finishes, and you happen to be hitting yourself with SLAVE when your combo finishes, it cancels out the enemy's SLAVE completely.
	$LF

[p 
	"You can't choose the special -- The game randomly picks from one of several after some time passes or you clear a line of Yoshi cookies. The fact it's randomly decided means a TAS can manipulate it, though my tests have shown it is difficult to do, being largely frame-based. It will, however, always switch between targeting yourself or the rival.

Must have been overconfident from the previous SLAVE-lock or something. Once Peach breaks free, she counters with her own SLAVE, followed shortly by a double-length PANIC. Koopa, in between these attacks, manages to combo 3 lines with 2 of them being Yoshi, the special being +3 to himself... Only to end one point short. Peach wins.

Just in time, too -- Koopa was just one frame away from completing his second (and winning) grid-clearing match. Peach then throws another PANIC just before Koopa can recover his time limit, then manipulates the PANIC into preventing Koopa from making a match before his time limit runs out.

The entertainment isn't high, the game being TAS'd isn't that noticeable (maybe if it was constantly series of match chains), and other than beating yourself (where you get to make up your own difficulty), you don't complete any objectives. If you want to TAS a competitive puzzle game, may I suggest Tetris Battle Gaiden? Rejecting.
