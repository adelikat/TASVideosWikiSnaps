We could take one more hit and use the "sixth" health point to enter Zombie Mode, but it would make progress impossible since Alex and Marty constantly need to switch off for their special moves. For instance, if we became a zombie after being hit by the last big spider, Alex could climb up the cliff, but we would not be able to switch to Marty to enter the crawling tunnel at the top.

	"No, but seriously, this all started with me watching Madagascar over and over again. So when I found out there was a Madagascar GBA game, I immediately downloaded it..off of CoolRoms (sorry mum)...and played it on VBA, which was one of only a few workable emulators on my crappy 2006 Compaq. And then, 14 year old me said "You know what? This is perfect TASing material." Keep in mind that I, at the time, was probably one of the most annoying users on the forums since JWinslow. So me actually TASing a game was unheard of. I was surprised to see the positive feedback from everyone once I uploaded the WIPs for the run, but then I needed some help, because school was happening. So I called upon CoolKirby...was it spring 2012? I think it was. And from then on, the rest is history.
