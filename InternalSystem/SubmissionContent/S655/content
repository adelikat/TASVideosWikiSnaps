		"movie making was quite easy because this version DID NOT desync. thank you very much for this BTW nitsuja. it was also quite easy because i have played this game through a lot. the hardest part was plotting what i would need to use where and how much would be too much of something. i tried to end with as little excess weaponry and items as possible. the only real problem came when i would stop on a later level for a night and come back to it the next day. it just took a while to remember where i was.

	"While any one section of this game by itself is entertaining, as a whole this movie is very repetitive and eventually boring.  Game length is also a problem.  While there are RPG's whis long (and longer).  They are extremely short compared to what a theorical "speed run" would be (most of those game would take many days on a console).  This element contributed to the entertainment value of the movie.
