	"Kid Chameleon is a platformer released for the Sega Genesis in 1992. The story is that a new virtual reality arcade game comes to town, equipped with a sentient AI which captures all the kids who couldn't beat it. The protagonist, some badass with a leather jacket, is the only kid in town who is "too tough to beat", and sets out to free the kids by beating the game. Kid Chameleon is infamous for its difficulty, sheer length, and lack of a save feature. To quote an advertisement, "There's over 100 rounds to slam your head against, 1800 screens with eye-popping graphics, and so many secret passages you'll be whacking your brain to find 'em."

	"This TAS completes the game using what is known as the "Plethora Cheat", which as the name suggests, warps you straight to the final boss, Plethora. Many cheat guides will tell you it's done by standing on the last P block of the 2nd level, Blue Lake Woods II, and holding Down + Right + B + C. However, all you

		"Airwalking

	" is performed by repeatedly crouching and standing every other frame. This saves the horizontal speed and vertical position of both you and the platform from when you entered airwalking state, which will be reapplied when the "airwalking chain" is broken. While in the airwalking state, your 
	[em 
		"de facto
	]em
	" speed is calculated by taking your speed from when you entered the "airwalking chain", truncating any subspeed component, and then halving that. So a speed of 3:128 when entering an airwalk would translate to 1:128 speed during the airwalk.

		"Air drag reduction
	]b
	" (highly technical explanation so skip reading this if you don't care). If Kid's horizontal speed while in air is above 2:95 and you are holding the d-pad in the same direction as your speed, an air drag factor of -0:1 speed per frame will be applied. This increases to -0:4 if there is no d-pad input, and to -0:43 if the input is in the opposite direction from your speed. For Kid, if your speed goes below 2:95 due to air drag, it will wrap back to 2:160 the next frame. Manipulating these rules to our advantage is the reason you often see Kid turn around for single frames while jumping in the TAS. The ideal way to handle air drag 
	[em 
		"in theory
	]em
	" is once Kid's air speed reaches 2:150, we hold the d-pad neutral for 3 frames till speed reaches 2:138. We then turn around for one frame, which decreases our speed to 2:95, and wraps back to 2:160 the next. This air drag reduction technique allows for a higher average air speed, around 2:149 as opposed to 2:128. It is a 
	[em 
		"very

	" tedious process, that could be dampened with the help of an automated script, though I've thus far been unsuccessful in my attempts to make one.

	"The values above are slightly different for Red Stealth (the Samurai guy in the TAS). Namely, Red Stealth's air speed must reach 2:64 instead of 2:95 before wrapping back to 2:160. Also, holding the d-pad in the direction opposite your current speed will lose 0:64 speed instead of 0:43 speed. As such, the 
	[em 
		"theoretical
	]em
	" best air drag reduction for Red Stealth goes as follows: at 2:144 speed, hold the d-pad neutral for 4 frames till speed reaches 2:128, then turn around for one frame to decrease speed to 2:64, which will wrap back to 2:160 the next frame. Average air speed with drag reduction is 2:146 versus 2:112 without.

Furthermore in RTA runs, it's normally impossible to bounce from him to the top of the next incline. It would be nice if we could clear the incline because Red Stealth cannot walk up slopes, unlike Kid. So thanks to our knowledge of air drag reduction, bouncing from the tank to the top of the incline is barely possible.

The first instance of this is purely for entertainment to make it look like we phased right through some blocks! But the second is unexpectedly advantageous. This second platform I walk off rises up once you touch it till it despawns at a certain distance off-screen. By manipulating the height at which we walk off this platform, we also manipulate its despawn point, and thus the point we instantly teleport to. This point is perfectly calculated to inflict the exact number of hits we need on Heady Metal so the rest of the fight goes smoothly.

Simply teleporting up to him effectively minimizes this.

	"The fastest way to actually defeat Heady Metal is to do two passes on him: both passes wedging yourself between the lower then higher middle ceilings to inflict a fast amount of hits. However this won't work when using TAS time, as we must get over to the flag effectively, and the lower ceiling (as well as some other obstacles) are inhibiting us from getting over there quickly. For this reason, we only use a lower ceiling on our second pass, coupled with defeating Heady Metal even further from the flag than normal.

	"Notice how the position we defeat Plethora in launches us across the level to the flag, effectively avoiding all the obstacles along the way. Since the last input is made when 22 of 37 hits have been inflicted on the boss, another difficult challenge was attaining the correct launch speed to the flag. Every time you bounce off an enemy, your horizontal speed increases by a factor of 1.5, so our leftwards speed must be super tiny on that 22nd hit such that our speed is perfectly set 15 hits later.
