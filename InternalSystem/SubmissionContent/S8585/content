	"Tekkyu Fight! The Great Battle Gaiden was a GB game from 1993, created by Sun L and published by Banpresto. It is a side game in the Great Battle/Compati Hero series, a series which is a crossover between Gundam, Ultraman and Kamen Rider. In this TAS, you will be seeing Ultraman throwing a 30 ton weight at people and flying using a short-lived balloon until he wins!

	"The best character is Ultraman, because he can throw a 30 ton ball at enemies which one-hits normal enemies, deals good damage to bosses AND it bounces back relatively quickly, allowing for fast damage (well, fast damage for this game anyway). He also has a balloon, which ordinarily lifts you up into the air slowly, speeding up gradually as you hold the B button down. However, if you press B to start the balloon, leave a blank frame and press the A button, you can jump out of the balloon animation as if you were standing on ground. This means you can chain them together to fly upwards very fast. But it's not that easy. To use the balloon, you need to collect P from defeated enemies and occasionally from breakable blocks. Each balloon use needs 1 P, and you can carry a maximum of 10 P at a time. This made it very hard to route what P's to collect, what jumps I can skip using the balloon on, what enemies can be killed without going out of my way to collect the P etc.

	"Pressing B makes you attack (groundbreaking). If grounded, it makes you stay in place like in Ghosts n' Goblins. If you jump and attack, you can move while attacking but will come to a standstill if you land before the weight comes back to you.

I stood still at the start of the fight because his weak spot hasn't opened yet, and I also thought it's a little more dramatic. He spawns some enemies that get in the way, but he's not a big hassle.

[div class=p 
	"This boss is a... thing, that jumps around. To differentiate it from Stage 3's boss, this boss moves towards you when damaged and jump much faster, so it is harder to stunlock him. However, there are pits on either side of the arena, where you can lure the boss, so hitting him will just move him into a wall, and since you stand above it, the boss is trivial now.

Both are erratic and hard to get in the same space, and I had to slow down for three frames, but it was the best I could do. In the original version I went past these enemies by killing just one, but I was lacking a balloon at the end, so this was the best I could do.

Would you believe it, the weakpoint is the head, so you can just jump straight up and shoot it constantly. This is where the TAS ends!

	"Thanks for reading through all of this! I had fun making this TAS because I like some of the games in this series! I used Atroz's RTA speedrun of the game for routing and as a blueprint, so credit to them. Also, this game, Great Battle IV, Battle Pinball and Battle Dodge Ball are all part of the Compati Heroes series, so I reckon they should have a game group on the games groups page. The run may be improved with better manipulation and better routing of picking up P's. Once again, thanks for reading thsi, hope it wasn't too long, boring, or somehow non-descriptive, because knowing me I've messed this up somehow.
