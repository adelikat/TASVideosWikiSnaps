	"From a variety show broadcast in Japan, "ウッチャンナンチャンの炎のチャレンジャー これができたら100万円!!" (Ucchannanchan's passionate challenger, ready for 1 million yen!), its main project "電流イライラ棒" (Irritating Electric Rod) was faithfully recreated as a game. With the analog stick, move the rod to the goal in time without touching the course boundary or obstacles. This game was only sold in Japan.
