	"The start of the run (after doing Ordon Gate Clip and BiT) is mostly filled with a lot of rolling. Most of the time, rolling in Twilight Princess is not as simple as going in a straight line from point A to point B with frame perfect rolls. Link’s ground speed in Twilight Princess (and other Zelda games with a similar engine) is affected by the slope of the ground he’s moving on. The fastest speeds are obtained on flat ground, slightly lower speeds on downhill slopes, and slower speeds on upward slopes. To move around the fastest, we avoid going over upward slopes (usually referred to as invisible hills) if possible, which creates weird looking movement in a few places, but it is in the interest of speed. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"If we start at a standstill in an area, it’s fastest to start with a roll, walk for three frames, and then continue to do frame perfect rolls towards where we need to go. If we enter an area and we’re already walking, then it’s fastest to walk for three frames first, and then begin doing consecutive rolls all the way to where we need to go. There are also some instances where even when we start from a standstill, it’s fastest to begin walking until we hit the walking speed that translates into the fastest rolls and begin doing rolls then. In these situations, we get to the desired speed fastest by targeting for the first two frames of movement and then releasing the target.

]div
[div class=p 
	"There is also a useful technique that we use pretty much everywhere in the entire run called Angle Locking (some in the community have referred to this as “Stick Glitch”, but “Angle Locking” is more descriptive I feel). Due to some weird property with the game’s camera, if we target very briefly and then release target while holding a direction on the control stick, the control stick will be interpreted as if the camera is still in the last frame of target mode (regardless of where it is afterwards). This directional lock only applies on +/- a certain angle range of where the initial lock took place. Once the control stick returns to neutral or goes outside the “lock range” the Angle Lock ends and the control stick is interpreted with the current camera once again. This technique makes running in straight lines with the game’s varying camera very manageable. We simply lock an angle on my first frame of movement and see if it fits the desired path we want to take on the current map. If it doesn’t, we can reload the savestate right before the angle lock and try again with a slightly different angle until we find the perfect control stick position for traveling in a straight line. Angle Locking also gives me the ability to pan the camera around and make the viewing more cinematic in certain situations without worrying about where Link is going.

[div class=p 
	"Anyway, that about covers basic movement, so back to the route. After rolling around a lot and obtaining the lantern to burn some webs, we battle two bokoblins to free Talo and the monkey. With these enemies, we attack them once with the same sword slash, and then perform a spin attack while they’re equidistant from Link so that we defeat them both on the exact same frame. This allows only one hit stop effect to happen and saves us a few frames over hitting the bokoblins at different times, which would cause two hit stop effects. Hitting enemies on the same frame to avoid multiple hit stop effects is present many other times throughout the run.

	"Next, we have the goats. TASing goats wasn’t that bad (at least from what I remember since this part of the TAS happened almost two years ago).  The path used for herding is the same path that RTA runs have used for years, and this is the fastest time I could squeeze out with it, which is also the fastest TAS herding time ever achieved. This is also our last use of Epona until one of the final battles with Ganondorf.

	"We enter Bo’s house very early thanks to one flag set by the BiT file we saved with earlier (specifically the flag of having tamed Epona in Kakariko Village). When we talk to Bo, his text is will only go through one or a few lines at a time as we didn’t activate the cutscene which normally regulates his text. We must talk to him many times before he finally gets to the point about the having us wrestle him. The wrestling for the Iron Boots is all RNG manipulation. Bo has three moves he can perform, so we must manipulate the move which is vulnerable to a slap both times. We then slap Bo and push him out of the ring in one cycle to obtain the Iron Boots way earlier than intended. Upon exiting Bo’s house, we choose the right door since the animation going out the ride side of a set of double doors is shorter than the animation of the left side. This applies almost everywhere else in the run. Once outside in Ordon Village we save over file 2 so that we can use this save later for the Early Monkeys glitch.

	"Now we turn into wolf Link and go through the Hyrule Castle sewers and rooftops. Nothing much out of the ordinary is going on here, but there are a few techniques we use as wolf Link to help speedup movement. The first is called Dash Cancelling. When wolf Link initiates a dash, he usually cannot dash again for almost two seconds. However, if he begins a dash but is interrupted by another animation (such as jumping off a ledge or a b attack), the cooldown is skipped, and another dash can begin right away. The second technique we see is what’s known as a first frame Midna jump. During some sections, Midna will prompt use to use her as an assist for jumping to ledges that are too far away or too high. If Midna has something to say right before the jump begins, there is one frame after her text disappears in which we can jump immediately to the first spot in her series of jumps (normally you wait around two seconds to do the first jump). There are also some text skips that we do here to skip talking to Midna, such as at the bottom of the spiral staircase by avoiding contact with the water (where we first jump off to activate Midna jumps) and once outside on the rooftops by jump attacking on the first frame of control we have. We also save on the rooftops over file 3 as a convenient way to do BiT quickly again for the Early Monkeys glitch. After the rooftops, we perform Sword & Shield Skip and enter Faron Twilight.

Before we get there however, we save our current file over file 1, and load file 3 which is saved at the Hyrule Castle rooftops. We quickly perform BiT since this file spawns us in convenient proximity of a void. When we open this file, the reason we jump attack down to the path and then sidehop off instead of just jumping straight off is to avoid triggering extra text from Midna that we skipped earlier. After doing BiT, we perform BiTE to load ourselves into the King Bulblin 1 fight on file 2 and set the BossFlag for the Early Monkeys glitch. Then we load into file 1 again and continue on our way to the Forest Temple with the changed BossFlag value.

The lowest amount of times Ook can jump around is twice, and we manipulate the boomerang he throws to turn around and hit him fairly quickly after he releases it. This fight becomes only a single cycle with the Master Sword (whereas with the Ordon Sword it would have been two) and we now collect the game’s most broken item: The Gale Boomerang.

We defeat another set of shadow beasts and then perform a trick known as the Gorge Void (a frame perfect jump attack into the Kakariko Gorge) to respawn us at the field entrance and delay activating a cutscene that would force us to warp back to Faron Woods. Right after this, we dig up a yellow rupee and perform the Gorge Skip so that we can get into Kakariko Village. On the way to Kakariko we bonk on the gate that’s near the entrance and clip through during it’s swinging animation to save a few seconds over digging under it. There is a trigger behind this gate that we have to avoid which is why we go way off to the right and around the center of the path to eventually reach the Kakariko loading zone.

For the fight itself, we defeat all the little tadpoles as soon as possible, and then agitate the Deku Toad so he attempts to squash us. After he fails, we defeat him in one-cycle (once again, thanks to the Master Sword) with a series of sword slashes. In Twilight Princess, the direction of each slash is determined by the position held on the control stick, so we use whichever combination of control stick inputs results in the fastest slashes. The timing is tight for this one-cycle, so we don’t activate a full four-slash combo until the final hit, as the fourth slash always takes a long time to recover from (relative to the other slashes in the combo). Once the fight is over, we get our clawshot and savewarp back to the front of the dungeon before using Ooccoo to warp out to Lake Hylia.

In Zora’s Domain we use keese LJAs to jump over some invisible hills both before and after the Midna jump section. In the middle of the Midna jumping section, we jump a lot while running on the ice since wolf Link’s jumping speed is higher than his ground speed on an upward slope and jumping also allows us to cut corners on the path. The shadow beasts at the top of the domain are unfortunately separated by a wall, so we need to take them out in two separate charge attacks. After getting this warp portal on our map though, it’s time to head back to Kakariko Village.

After heading to the graveyard, we kill the first bug and then collect it as human Link while we clip into the basement (the clip here skips having to get to the basement the normal way). Since it takes a while for bugs to die, we push them in their death animation to be closest to where we need to go next. Once in the basement we quickly lure all three bugs together and kill them in quick succession. The targeting between the last two bugs may seem random, however these bugs will stop moving if you target them. So, by switching the target between them we prevent both from moving at all and keep them close together until we hit them. Now we warp back to the main village and go get the Malo Mart bug; we can attack the inside of the Malo Mart in a certain way which will agitate the bug and make it drop down in front of us which is very convenient. Throughout collecting the bugs in Kakariko Village, we also manipulate blue and yellow rupee drops as we’ll need 300 rupees later in the run to fix the City in the Sky Canon. The point at which we crash through the window to enter the bomb shop was when brake sliding was discovered, and thus we use it from this point onward for the rest of the run (mostly as wolf Link).

We still must crawl into the house collision though, since the collision won’t go away unless we reload the area. Some bugs hide in pots/boxes and, when they get revealed, have an invincibility period where they can’t be killed. Since we have to wait before killing these bugs, we spend the time doing things like collecting rupees or messing around.

After this cutscene skip, we transform back into wolf Link and obtain the vessel for our tears. The beginning of the Lanayru Twilight is fairly standard as we go around and track down bugs, defeat shadow beasts, collect rupees, and enjoy a lot of brakesliding. After getting the first bug in Zora’s Domain, we transform into human Link again to skip the Rutella cutscene a second time since the trigger still exists. We also get to perform a pretty sweet grab with the Clawshot while falling down the waterfall to go get the hallway bug (which took about five hours to figure out and saves roughly three seconds; the most rewarding type of TASing).

Once we finally get the lone bug in castle town, we warp back to Lake Hylia to get the remaining bugs there and in Zora’s River before facing the Boss Bug. The Boss Bug has the usual three cycle battle that we’re all used to at this point, however the second and third cycles are sped up by attacking the bug as it charges us and then timing another attack right away to grab onto it before it rises out of reach again. On the final Midna charge attack, we maneuver towards the edge of the bug in such a way that we bonk on the bug when releasing the charge.

The howling stone will spawn a golden wolf which will allow us to learn the Final Blow technique later (which is required for dealing the last hit the Ganondorf to complete the game). When we enter the minigame, we automatically get a bomb bag, and stealing it is very easy as all we must do is use Ooccoo Jr. and warp back to Lakebed Temple. However, this bomb bag won’t be able to stay in our inventory for the rest of the game. When we savewarp next, it will disappear. So, we must use the bombs in this bag to first obtain a bomb bag that we can keep permanently. The closest option for this is the Goron stuck in a rock at the bottom of Zora’s Domain, so we need to empty out our bomb bag entirely and refill it with water bombs to explode the underwater rock and free the Goron. This bomb bag we get from the Goron also is one of the reasons the German text is fastest, as on all other languages the text for the bag is not quick text. With this new permanent bomb bag acquired, we finally head off to the Peak Province.

It’s very convenient that this stone exists, as not having it to reload the area would mean that we wouldn’t be able to progress (since we need to activate a loading zone to get to the next cave, but Map Glitch disables it until the area reloads). In the next cave we take advantage of the vines on the walls using the clawshot to make our way through. Outside we’d usually have to fight a set of shadow beasts, but we skip this by performing an LJA into the void far enough away, so the game thinks we jumped into the void off a different part of the map.

The Ball & Chain has only one required use in this run, so it’s kind of annoying that we can’t skip it (and we’ll get to that use way later). To start off the dungeon we LJA over to a heart piece chest and then clawshot through the ceiling to reach the dungeon’s second floor. Normally you’re suppose to break the floor to get to this chest, so the fact that the developers didn’t bother adding collision to the ceiling below this floor makes sense. As we continue to drop bombs we LJA over to quickly grab a small key, and then LJA back before falling through a glitchy floor to the bottom level of the dungeon again. Thankfully we can use small keys on locked doors from the side opposite the lock, so now we can access the courtyard. In the courtyard there’s a giant freezard blocking the door to the Dark Hammer (miniboss who holds the Ball & Chain), but we clip through it using invincibility frames and a precise B Attack and open the door from behind to activate the miniboss room.

The first bomb we dropped was placed in such a way that the explosion would damage the Darknut when he became vulnerable and then Link could quickly come in with a jumpslash quickspin combo and finish him off. Right before the fight finishes, there’s a single frame where we pick up the Ball & Chain and not have to go and retrieve it after the death cutscene. Because of this, manipulating the direction the Dark Hammer throws the Ball & Chain in is necessary and is what made this fight particularly challenging to do. After defeating the Dark Hammer, we drop more bombs and pick up an orange rupee (100 Rupees) from an ice bubble in the room behind the miniboss. Then we savewarp, pick up another convenient orange rupee from an ice bubble, and use Ooccoo Jr. to warp back into the Lakebed Temple.

The second to last bomb that Link threw out went into a waterfall off screen, so it would despawn immediately.

Right before the cutscene that separates the two phases begins we pull out a water bomb while force unequipping the iron boots (which is unequipping them by equipping something else over them, forcing Link to take them off no matter what). After the cutscene ends we wait a little bit and then “place” down the water bomb to refill Link’s air meter (since the game believes that we resurfaced for a frame). We manipulate Morpheel to swim towards Link as quickly as possible and grab onto her eye with the clawshot to then deal damage with our sword. Normally Morpheel will throw us off after each attack, but by putting on and then force unequipping the Iron Boots after we deal the attack combo, we regain control of Link immediately and clawshot the eye again before Morpheel swims away. Three cycles later, Morpheel is dead and we finally completed our first temple of the run with a few frames of air to spare.

Just as before, we repeatedly dash cancel through castle town since the base running speed for this area is way lower than normal. Once we get inside Telma’s bar we do a precise jump to skip going across the left rope and save a few seconds. This jump actually requires waiting a few frames, otherwise the Goron will notice wolf Link and kick him out.  After crossing more ropes and extracting a poe soul, we come to the sewers again. In the first part of the sewers brakesliding saves more time than usual due to the unique way speed is normally hindered in this area. The game will initially allow Link to run with a speed value of 45 for the first few frames of his animation before it slows it back down to 33, but we preserve the 45 value with brakesliding. The second part of the sewers is an area we’ve seen before, except this time there are more ropes and we can’t use Midna to jump. The bulblin at the base of the broken spiral staircase needs to be defeated, else he’s going to try and shoot us while we cross the ropes in the upper part of the room. Once we get outside, crossing the rooftops is nearly the same as it was at the beginning of the run, except now we use a little bit of brakesliding to speed things up.

However, when we reach the room with the four poe lanterns, things begin to get interesting. The game will only check for the second, third, and fourth torches to be lit for the gate at the back of the room to open (as it assumes you can’t get to the other poes if you haven’t obtained the scent from the first one). So, we simply ignore the first poe and head off to the west room. There’s a pillar sticking out of the sand here that we abuse to jump up to a higher platform which gives us access to the fourth poe first. Any of the poes can be used to get the poe scent thankfully. So now that we obtained the scent, we go and defeat the second and third poes to open the gate. During the two instances that we need push the pillar in the center of the initial east room, we get damaged by the bubble to skip the full push animation. Similarly, when extracting the second poe soul, there are bubbles flying around which can interrupt the usual extraction animation with damage and give us control of wolf Link earlier than usual, so we can run back to the door we came from. The enemies will also push us closer to the exit door during the cutscene of the poe flame returning to the main room. The small key we obtained before the second poe was used on a door from the wrong side two rooms before the third poe. Right before fighting the third poe, we pick up a red rupee(20) by killing a stalfos. This finally gives us the 300 rupees we need to repair the City in the Sky canon once this dungeon is completed.

	"Thankfully, I discovered a way to skip Stallord during the making of this TAS. The loading zone to exit this room is always active, even if the gate blocking it is closed. So, by clipping out of bounds, we simply walk into the loading zone and skip the fight altogether. This skip was tricky to figure out since I had to bypass two walls to get fully out of bounds, but after around six hours of testing various ideas it came together nicely. The only reason we can perform CAD at this location is because the bridge (that normally forms after the fight) sticks in bounds slightly to create a ledge tall enough to fall off of. The direction the staltrooper pushes Link is also wildly random. Even changing the angle Link shoots the clawshot at by a single unit completely changes how the staltrooper pushes him. Originally, I had to use two bombs to make the trick work, but later figured out how to clip into the first wall without a bomb by abusing some very subtle L-sliding mechanics as well as better positioning. On the whole, I am very happy with how Arbiter’s Grounds turned out, and it’s probably my favorite dungeon in the entire TAS.

However, this does not apply if we zoom in all the way on the map for some reason, so any warps we do from here on out will have to zoom all the way in on the map to activate warping portals before warping away. We warp back to Kakariko Village and go to the basement of Renaldo’s house to perform Early City in the Sky by clipping through the bird statue that normally blocks the path to the Canon.

Upon entering the ManChicken Kingdom we’re greeted with a nice, long, unskippable cutscene with annoying bird noises. After this lovely cutscene, we begin our trek across the first two straight rooms with a few LJAs and some brakesliding. Before we enter the third room however, we change form to wolf Link. In front of this particular door is a trigger which activates a fan in the third room. The purpose of this fan is to block players from being able to reach the boss key earlier than intended. However, as wolf Link we can open the door from far back enough that we never end up touching this particular trigger, and so the fan blocking the boss key never turns on. Since we did this, we now go and get the boss key by using the clawshot to ascend up some vines.

	"After obtaining the boss key, we need to get back down to the lower level of this room…without taking any damage (as we’ll need to take damage for a trick coming right up). The quickest way I found to do this was by grabbing a ledge right before the ground and then dropping immediately. Unfortunately, the distance we fall is too high to get a regular roll out of. We proceed on to the east wing of the dungeon, and form a bridge using a spinner groove. This side of the dungeon normally requires a small key to progress on through, but that’s only through the top entrance. The bottom entrance has no lock, so we instead drop down to the bottom and enter the next room.

We have to get up to the top of the room we’re currently in, but there’s no way that’s normally supposed to be possible (as the bottom of this room is meant to be a backtrack room for after getting the second clawshot). However, this room contains two actors that we can clawshot too as well as a chest to provide a ledge we can fall off of. So, we do CAD on two separate objects in this room. Simply put, by using CAD and some bomb explosions, we rearrange these actors into a specific orientation and climb up to the higher level of this room using damage boosts and the clawshot. From the top of the second actor, we get just close enough to grab a set of vines that hang on the upper level, and then LJA over to the door we need to go through next. The damage boost up onto the second actor only works because, for some strange reason, Link will get boosted upwards after grabbing the actor partially through a wall, and then letting go one frame later. If this did not happen, I don’t know if I could’ve made the trick work.

None of the health we regained wasted any time, as the first heart was directly in our path, and the second heart was obtained while we were waiting for a fan cycle to activate. Eventually, we reach a tall room where we need to fall down as quickly as possible to the very bottom. We speed up our fall with the iron boots and skip sitting through a stunned animation by jumpslashing onto the ground. This jump takes two hearts from us and is what required regaining health after the small key skip. After this comes the skippable Aerolfos miniboss. While standing in a certain position, we angle the clawshot very precisely to grab the medallion above the gate that normally opens after the fight has concluded. This pushes us past the gate and allows us to very quickly obtain the second clawshot before savewarping out.

Upon entering the third room, we do end up activating the fan that blocks the boss key, but we already have the boss key, so this doesn’t matter. The final section of the dungeon involves a bunch of rotating clawshot panels in the last two rooms. However, these clawshot panels have a weird property that allows Link to climb on top of them if he clawshots the top of the grating from a certain distance above it (or higher). Using this property as well as some LJAs, we cross the outside area without rotating the panels and proceed on to the final room before the boss. The final room consists of a climb up the same kind of rotating panels. For the most part, we must follow what the game wants, but we skip needing to activate the final center panel by grabbing the top of the panel below it with the nearly pixel precise clawshot grabs. From this top we do another very precise clawshot grab onto the medallion above the boss door and proceed on to Argorok.

The start of the fight has us waiting for him to fly around back to the center of the platform before we attack him, but we skip the second flying iteration by grabbing onto the tail again fast enough. The start of the second phase commences with us voiding out to reset Argorok’s position and then using the double clawshots to have him try and shoot fire at us as soon as possible. We use the iron boots to cut Argorok’s fire attacks short by making him think he successfully hit us so that he becomes vulnerable to attacks sooner on all three cycles. Once Argorok is defeated, we finally have our necessary Mirror Shard to enter the Palace of Twilight. When exiting City in the Sky, we equip the iron boots and perform a jumpslash while falling into Lake Hylia so that Link lands on the wooden bridge instead of in the water, as this will allow us to warp away to the Mirror Chamber sooner than if we had to swim to land.

The first half of this dungeon consists of two Sols that we need to acquire in order to proceed to the final half, with each sol being contained in a wing on either the east or west side of the dungeon. The way the east and west wings work is pretty much identical, except the platforming is a little harder in the east wing. These wings each have three rooms. The puzzle for the first two rooms is defeating a series of Zant heads and then obtaining a small key in the chest that appears afterwards. The third room with the Sol is always a fight with a Phantom Zant enemy. Then we bring the Sol back through the rooms we just cleared, but fast enough to avoid a giant hand from picking the Sol back up and taking it. Then we place the Sol in the main outside area of the dungeon. When both Sols have ben retrieved, we’re rewarded with an “upgraded” Master Sword (commonly referred to as the Butter Sword) which can defeat twilight enemies in a single slash.

This grab skips having to do an extra clawshot grab on a lower medallion. In the room with the final small key, there’s a platform cycle which dictates how fast the room can be completed, so most of this room is dedicated to messing around since it’s possible to waste around five seconds and still hit the same cycle.

When fighting Zant with the Master Sword, the only hit which actually matters is the fourth hit of the sword slash combo. All the other hits we intentionally miss for the most part (to avoid unnecessary hit stop frames where possible). The first two phases of the fight are dealt with in a single cycle using a precise series of jumpslashes and/or regular sword swings. During the first phase (based on Diababa) I somehow got one of Link’s jump attacks to hit Zant twice. I have no idea how this was achieved and was not able to replicate it afterwards, but it skipped doing another jumpslash, so I’ll take it. The third phase of this fight is the longest, with Zant taking his sweet time to appear inside a giant replica of his head for two cycles. Due to how long he takes, we use a water bomb again to prevent ourselves from drowning. During the second cycle the head that Zant will appear in is the farthest one away from Link’s position at a certain point in time, so we use that to manipulate the head that we want and grab him before he gets a chance to try and attack us.

Just like the third phase though, this fight happens in two cycles, each initiated by an attack with the Ball & Chain. Once Zant begins shrinking, we only need to hit him with the fourth slash of an attack combo. This same logic applies on the final phase as well, but the final phase is three cycles instead of two. During the third cycle of the final phase, Zant will attempt to spin attack us, but if we counter his spin attack with our own and push him into a wall, he’ll respawn very quickly and in a vulnerable state where we can attack him instantly to defeat him.

In Hyrule Castle, it doesn’t matter which side of the double doors we enter (if they have a loading zone) since Link will always appear out of the right door when he comes out. We skip another barrier at the start of the interior by jumpslashing into the side of the collision while it forms and skipping its formation cutscene fast enough so that Link doesn’t have time to walk back into the barrier.

	"The next room is where we fight the only darknut of the run. A darknut’s armor has to come off first in two separate cycles, and then after he throws his claymore at us, we can very swiftly defeat him with the Ball & Chain. After this fight, we target a bunch of places around the room with the Gale Boomerang and then throw it right before the cutscene of a chest forming begins playing. The premise of the puzzle in this room is that there are torches which, when lit, will lower specific platforms at the back of the room. When the cutscene of the chest forming finishes, the Gale Boomerang will be above a torch we want to extinguish instantly, allowing us to ride up the platform as fast as possible to get to the next room, which is a lantern lighting puzzle. After this puzzle, we get to use our final bomb of the run to kill two lizalfos who get a little too close to us and after that enter the outside area of this castle one last time. Once outside, we fight off an aerolfos with the Ball & Chain to get the final small key of the run and roll to the other side of the castle to obtain the boss key (while getting saved by some people that we never met).

	"Now we ascend the final staircase. The first part of this giant room wants us to follow a specific path through the section of missing floor blocks, but we simply roll over the floor blocks that fall down before they fall too far and ignore the intended puzzle. We also fight some more enemies, and due to the downtime between beating them and waiting for barriers to dispel, we perform some epic sword twirls. The final darknut in this room is easily skipped by using the clawshot on the grates around the boss door and flying through the barrier collision during the cutscene of the walls forming.

	"The final boss gauntlet of this game consists of four separate fights. The first fight against Puppet Zelda is entirely RNG manipulation. The attacks she does, as well as the amount of time between attacks had to be manipulated so that we got the perfect attack pattern and the least amount of wait time in between attacks. The least amount of cycles possible in this fight is seven and the fastest non-energy ball move Zelda makes is the flying attack. The second fight with Beast Ganon goes through a required three cycles. However, by performing the maximum amount of damage on the first two cycles with a specific series of sword slashes, Ganon will reveal himself quicker on the third cycle using only a single portal and immediately run out of. (Normally he’ll spawn a bunch of portals and delay himself while he chooses which one to spawn out of.) For the horseback fight (hey, Epona’s back!), we simply need to be as close to Ganon as possible when Zelda shoots her light arrow so that we attack Ganon immediately after he’s stunned. In three hits he falls off and we come to the very short and underwhelming final fight. You know the drill by now, we finish this game with three attacks on Ganondorf at just over two and a half hours.

	"When I originally started this TAS, I wasn’t expecting it to take nearly two years to complete. However, my motivation and free time ended up running low after the first few months as I moved away from home to attend college and got somewhat addicted to Overwatch (as well as already focusing a lot of my free time on RTA speedrunning). Putting off this TAS during those times may have ended up benefitting it though, as my motivation to continue was always spurred by new discoveries such as brakesliding, or the new CAD skips which were found during the creation of this run. If I had continued the pace on the TAS that I had started with, brakesliding would’ve probably only been used for the last half of the run. For a while, trying to make any progress on the TAS was very mentally draining, as it took many long hours of tedious testing and manipulation to get the final result we have now (as I’m sure all other TASers are well aware of). During my recent winter break however, I wasn’t able to do RTA speedrunning because of an injury to my hand/arm. At the time, I was about one hour and forty minutes into the run when I figured out Stallord Skip and the City in the Sky small key skip. Starting the day after Christmas, I ended up spending about ten hours a day for eight straight days working solely on this TAS and managed to finish the last forty minutes in that time frame (and then spent many more subsequent hours trying to correctly dump the video and sync it up with the audio which is a whole other challenge on its own).

While technically the Zelda Edition is not an official Dolphin release, I think it can be considered as legitimate enough for TASing purposes, so I won't hold the use of it against this movie.
