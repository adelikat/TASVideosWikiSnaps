	"This movie includes the fight with Culex. Although the movie may have shorter without them, it is more interesting to be able to observe it and take advantage of the rewards later in the game. The Lucky Jewel is used in most of the boss fights to gain levels faster, most notably in the Culex fight. The Lucky Hammer was bought to use against the Shoguns to save the Lucky Jewel for use in more effective instances (i.e. the Culex fight). Timing for freebies was the most tedious aspect. I would have liked to have used less Rock Candies and Fire/Ice Bombs, but at least I was able to alternate sometimes between them instead of constantly using the same thing over and over. I often managed without them (thankfully) and I hated timing them constantly in the final battle.

	"The rerecord count is not accurately conceivable. It should be much larger since a lot of the controller data was hexed from the test version (which had a rerecord count of 26462). The hexed data is only from out of battle in places where there were no problems to begin with.
