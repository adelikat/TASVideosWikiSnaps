	"The fifth Tomb Raider game released and the last using the "classic" engine. the game takes place after the story of Tomb Raider 4, where Lara dies. Some of Lara's close friends are discussing four of her past adventures. the adventures take place in Rome,Russia,Ireland and the VCI headquarters in New York.

[p 
	"The game runs at 30 fps, so usually 1 in-game frame = 2 real time frame. On laggy places, the game may need more real time frame to advance to the next in-game frame (although this does not happen much in this game as the developers really optimized the engine and levels, I have observed it in a couple of large places such as The Base). although no specific glitches were used in favour of getting a better ingame time,Using ingame time instead of real time made the comparison with the RTA/IL runs easier.

	"As you can see, the Sprint Roll is the fastest way to move.However, That doesn't mean it's faster to do it instead of sprinting. Because sprinting has a consistent 82 speed, and when you start a sprint roll it adds 2 speed values each frame untill it reaches 100 for 2 frames , then starts decreasing 1-2 values each frame untill it reaches 47 (running animation), Making a consistent sprint way faster than doing a sprint roll. But note that a sprint roll can go down slopes, which is faster than sliding or jumping over/at the slope. it is also faster to do a sprint roll if Lara was going to fall off an edge, because Lara's speed during falls stays the same as the last frame she took off the ledge at, and with a sprint roll that's usually 98-100, better than sprinting off the edge with 82 speed.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Now it is important to note that these are the speeds in the RAM. In practice, the game rounds Lara's coordinates (X, Y, Z) because it only accepts integers. It means that depending if it rounds up or rounds down, Lara's true speed will be a little bit higher or smaller than the RAM speed.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When Lara is turning, her rotation speed increases by 45 each frame, until it caps to 1092 (on the ground) or 182 (in the air).However, when she is holding her guns (must be fully equipped) and turning on the spot, her rotation speed will reach 1092 in 3 frames (45-90-1092). While swimming, rotation speed adds 45 each frame untill to caps at 728.

		" Keyhole Glitch : an extremely useful glitch that allows Lara to place keys and puzzle items without actually having them! works when you use a flare to embed behind a keyhole then picking it up. basically the game says "Yes" for Lara to move to pickup the flare, but the puzzle/keyhole's hitbox interferes with the flare, so Lara does the "Yes" to the puzzle/keyhole instead (the game normally says "No" to Lara when she tries to interact with the puzzle/keyhole without having the correct item, the flare forces a "Yes"). Even works on card readers in Russia!

Flares weren't an issue in Rome because a flare pack is available at the beginning.

Lara does a bunch of glitches ranging from unlocking a door by sticking a gun in the keyhole (I think this might be a good screenshot if the above does not work), to the "flare jumps" which appear to just send Lara across the map. Unfortunately later on, less flares appear and the game gets bogged down by cutscenes, but I still really enjoyed it overall and so did the audience.
