	"In the year 2633, two years after the meteor crashed, two best commandos, Bill and Lance, were sent on a mission to eliminate the alien forces and thwart the alien leader Red Falcon! Only that according to the military corps, they told them that they are not allowed to get their hands on the huge weapons except for the items they are allowed to use!

	"Yeahhhhh!! The 'tormed' has struck for the first time ever with this run, and this game can be completed with the Peashooter with one coin clear. The reason I created this is that I wanted to show my fellow kids that we do really like video games not just the present but also the retros. I've been thinking of a challenge for the month and finally, I made up with this! 1cc using only Peashooter, because I imagine if the Military would not allow other weapons but this, and it's much of challenge after all.

Your movie does not appear to use savestates. In fact clearing a game on one continue is a cakewalk with savestates.
