	": This game has some bizarre but comedic elements throughout which makes it quite entertaining. The character here is Santos which is quite distinctive from the rest of the cast since his fastest strategy revolves around using his W-Fist which shoots him across flat surfaces and also has an uppercut type move.  There are some good strategies that are used for the various sections.

	"The character Santos may or may not be the fastest character for this game.  Kamakura, the ninja, seems like he should be the fastest with his ranged attacks, fast movement, and full screen multi-hitting special.  However, at this time there is no video or tas evidence showing that Kamakura would indeed be faster over Santos for the entire length of this variety filled game.

[div class=p 
	"For a future improvement, one thing I would like to point out is that there are tiny frame losses especially early on in the tas.  One trick to make things faster is to make use of the ability to jump and cancel attacks early before even getting the W-Fist for instance.
