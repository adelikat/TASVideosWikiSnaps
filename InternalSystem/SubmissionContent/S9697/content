So I redid the 2nd section and found out his actions were different. I originally thought points items influenced the RNG but it didn't. Viper is a wild boss, he has a variety of actions from firing a projectile to jumping and even performing a slide. The first action being a forward jump is logical as it allows me to get closer to him at half the full screen distance, then the next action is forcing him to fire some fireballs which makes him a sitting duck for the rest of the fight.  The jump away after unleashing a mega 10 damage was done to prevent him from performing a lethal slide which usually happens if GV is too close to him.

The RNG outcome I got was very good, I won't be too surprised if there is a better outcome through manipulation although between the 2nd boss and that first plant enemy, there are limited opportunities as you only have a few killable enemies and 1 breakable block to tweak the RNG without losing time.

	"The third boss Stratos is the only boss who can technically die in 4 hits. His first attack seems to be either jump to the middle and drop two eggs or warp to perform a chomp attack. The latter is used because I can trick his i-frames by firing a pellet from the distance and then getting at least 4 spheres inside its hitbox along with an extra pellet before the next hit confirm for a massive 13 points of damage. After the chomp attack, Stratos has already lost 14 out of 32 HP so he only has 18 HP left, fortunately when he appears, he has a wide hitbox that an initial 3 damage hit can be followed up with a massive 15 damage hit as it's possible to get 5 Lightning Spheres inside the hitbox. In a earlier version of this TAS before knowing the early mega 12 damage hit, whenever he is standing next to the edge of the screen, if you go too far away from him, he'll teleport and use his chomp attack, this is important to know for Ekoro/Beck runners.

[div class=p 
	"Just like the original game, this level is very vertical focused but due to the laws of 8-bit Mega Man-ism, the game is allergic to traditional vertical scrolling so there are a good amount of ladders here which means most of them will be exploited to either zipping or screen transition skipping. Not every ladder you see in this level gets a vertical zip due to either going out of bounds which isn't useful or triggering a softlock.

[div class=p 
	"My favourite part is the small time save which is done by grabbing a ladder that's above the spikes for a pixel boost to save some frames, the horizontal catapult that send players to the left wasn't useful as using it ASAP would send GV towards a wall and not through the tight gap where the two sweets are.

[div class=p 
	"The boss for this level became a massive roadblock in my submitted TAS, the old TAS made a week earlier had very little problems but since I found new time savers in the boss fights, trying to get the vital RNG was a nightmare as I am a noob at trying to use memory viewer finding the value. Eventually, after finding out that there were 2 breakable blocks in the level that didn't cost any time, I was finally able to get the ideal RNG. What made Jota notorious in TASing is that while he did have 2 attacks (when healthy), he was capable to change the order of his turret placement attack part-way through your attack aggression, you want Jota to go from bottom right to top right because he moves very slowly, if he wants to go from bottom right to top left, he'll move superfast and won't get caught in your last two hit combo.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p

	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"1) Use Lightning Sphere at the start to manipulate his best turret placement spawn.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"2) Release a short Lightning Sphere for the first hit, this is mainly to manipulate both Jota's 3rd turret location to make him go top right and the upcoming fight's first attack. If I started this Lightning Sphere a bit earlier or later but still get the first mega 9 damage hit, it would have affected the RNG.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"3) After releasing the spheres, move slightly to the right and along the way, perform two more perfect recharges to deal another set of 3 dmg + 9 dmg combo twice.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"The difference between this strat and the 1 cycle RTA optimal strat done TAS'd is 98 frames. In fact, the actual RTA runs wants Jota to perform the side drill attack which makes him a sitting duck but the problem is that he's so high up that getting a mega 6 damage hit isn't possible until he starts to descend. Then, he leaves just before the side drills start to function and he'll eventually re-appear after the attack has ended.

After the mega 10 damage, I went to the left side of the area and aimed the Lightning Sphere upwards to not only hit her early on the way down but to follow up with another 3 and finally mega 9 damage hit as soon as possible, I went to the very far left and held right on the latest possible frame that made GV face right upon landing.

What made the fight faster is that GV no longer needed to fire pellets which meant he can use his Lightning Sphere attack sooner after each mega hit.
