	"The Gens emulator does not have the soft reset feature meaning that I have to complete every zone including the cutscenes, even the long ones. Converting to Bizhawk fixed this issue and saved around 20 seconds of my final Gens run with Knuckles. The run lasted for 20:36.65 and it was cut down to 20:17.57 thanks to the 3 soft resets that were used at the end of Launch Base, Mushroom Hill and Flying Battery. These soft resets are used to skip the long cutscenes which were at least 7+ seconds long. They are implemented at the frames where the time bonus hits 0 so that the run counts the frames with the time bonus counting down.

	"If you compare this to the 2017 run, I basically saved 44 frames from the new boss method and another 23 frames for the new level wrap route found by Kaan55. How this works is that Knuckles has to be sent at least at a speed faster than 16 pixels (4096 subpixels) to the left for the level wrap to work and the horizontal position in the last frame before the wrap must be 16(pixel):1(subpixel) or further to the right. In this run, the last position before the wrap was 16(p):13(sp) while the speed was 4144 subpixels/frame which allowed the level wrap to happen. I tried the same thing with Sonic and Tails but no luck for them although to be fair each character now has their own way to level wrap to the end due to new strats that have been found.
