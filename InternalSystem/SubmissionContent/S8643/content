This skips several mandatory cutscenes only present on the first playthrough, as well as having to visit the Training Room for a tutorial on using the vacuum. Otherwise, the only thing the Hidden mansions changes on NTSC releases of LM is simply the strength of the vacuum (you can drain ghosts of 1 health every frame rather than every other frame). Everything else is identical to the Normal Mansion. Only the PAL release Hidden Mansion changes anything about the mansion itself, to the point of it being considered an entirely separate mode/challenge from Normal Mansion. For this reason, the Hidden Mansion is considered the standard mode for all NTSC speedruns of the game.”

The money requirement makes the most sense to me, as getting any amount over the minimum required 100,000,000 G for A rank changes nothing else about the game or ending. In fact, this A rank requirement opens up what is really the central question informing the entire route: What is the fastest way to collect 100 million G? As you can imagine, a great routing effort was required before breaking ground on the TAS itself, and the ‘money route’ did indeed take a lot of time and testing to get into a serviceable state that would allow me to start creation of the movie proper. This run also takes advantage of out of bounds clips and movement in order to skip watching some cutscenes and collecting some keys, while still finding ways to collect all of the requisite Boos and Portrait Ghosts.

Performed by soft-pressing L on one frame, and hard-pressing L on the frame immediately after. This ends the animation and allows Luigi to start moving and/or using the vacuum instantly instead of being locked in place waiting for it to finish. This is useful for using vacuum instantly in lit rooms, and for skipping the animation of Luigi pulling out his flashlight after opening a door going from a lit room to a dark room.

This is useful for keeping Boos in place while draining them, as they are ‘stunned’ for about 20 frames when hit with the initial pull of the vacuum, which you can continually hit them with by repeatedly R-Pumping. Each R-Pump wastes 1 frame of optimal Boo draining, so we try to use as few as possible. Boos can only be 're-stunned' a maximum of 14 times using optimal R-Pumps, after which we lose control of them completely until they leave the room. This means that we can count on draining ~150 health at most from R-Pumping alone.

	"This is a central component to the money route for this run. Touching some money to Luigi’s body and vacuum hitboxes on the same frame allows us to collect that money twice, thus duplicating it. There are two ways you can achieve this: ‘element duping’ and ‘air duping’. Element duping takes advantage of the fact that you can get an active vacuum hitbox between Luigi’s legs (and thus inside of his body hitbox) for a couple frames by doing a slightly delayed vacuum cancel, but only works in lit rooms. Air duping can be done anywhere, and takes advantage of the active vacuum hitbox you can get inside of Luigi’s head while doing an R-Pump. Both methods have their situational advantages; element dupes are generally easier and faster to execute, while air dupes are the only way to dupe in dark rooms and let you start/stop the vacuum several times during a single pump, which in a TAS setting means we can more precisely group scattered bunches of pearls together and dupe them all at the same time once they are high enough in the air, which allows for some impressive looking pearl manipulation dupes such as after Nana and Grimmly.

[div class=p 
	"These methods of duping money only work on the pearls (small (50,000G), medium (100,000G), and large (1,000,000G)) that drop from portrait ghosts, and gold bars (100,000G). It notably does not work on gems of any kind. This is significant to the route, mostly because of one specific type of gem; the Gold Diamond, of which there are only two in the game. One , which we skip, can be found by watering the plant in the backyard repeatedly as one progresses through the 4 areas of the game (the route we take through the mansion, doing bosses out of order, breaks this sequence and makes it impossible to get, though it would be slow to do this anyway). The other spawns upon defeating the 50th boo, whichever that happens to be depending on your playthrough. Each Gold Diamond is worth 20 million G, or 20% of the total 100 million that we need to collect by the end of the game. Being able to dupe gems would heavily trivialize the money route, but as it stands we are able to reach 100m with careful pearl dupe management and collecting all of the bills/coins in our path that waste no (or minimal) time to get.

RTA runners set up this glitch in the training room before actually starting runs, but including that setup in the movie itself would be very slow so we instead set it up just after receiving the Fire Medallion from Mirror Room, where we were going to savewarp (and thus soft-reset) anyway.

	"Here is a general explanation of how to get a skew: sometimes, getting hit at the right place while holding the right angle for the right amount of time makes Luigi tilt either really far forward or backward, again depending on some magic that I know nothing about. We do know that this only seems to work with a small number of damage sources, namely ceiling bats, mice, and the flying fish ghosts that can be found in the courtyard. While in this skewed state, Luigi’s hitbox is both visually and practically distorted (probably in separate ways, though its unclear since there are really no tools currently for visualizing what the real hitboxes in this game look like). What I do know is that Luigi’s Y position in this state is higher than normal, which equates to him being higher off the ground the more severe the skew angle you get is (imagine his height being determined from the heel of his shoes). 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"Once you have achieved this skewed state, you have to be careful to only change Luigi’s facing angle with the C-Stick, and only use the analogue stick for movement, as angle changing with the analogue stick will cause you to drop your skew. For RTA runners, the way to do this is to switch the control scheme in the pause menu to Sidestep, which achieves this desired kind of movement naturally. For TAS, we are able to remain in Standard control mode by only using the analogue stick to move while we are already using the C-Stick. In fact there are a couple of very precise C-Stick positions that we can hold that don’t actually change Luigi’s angle, but still register as C-Stick movement and allow us to move around in a ‘psuedo-sidestep’ fashion without switching control schemes.

Depending on the specific geometry of the room around where we are trying to clip, sometimes we can leverage our distorted position and increased height to simply walk around a wall or door (multiple times while walking along Floor 1.5 after Chauncey, clipping past the Area 3 door to the courtyard). Other times (when we clip into Rec Room from floor 1.5, clipping into Billiards Hall, Wardrobe, and Sitting Room from Floor 2, and into Conservatory from courtyards), we have to use the Gameboy Horror while releasing our skew in order to clip through a wall in the desired way. I don’t really know why exactly, my best guess is that using the GBH right after releasing a skew rapidly adjusts your angle in some way that can put you far enough into the wall to move through it, or at least be pushed to the other side.

	"The position for each Boo is determined when that room is loaded into memory. This happens as soon as you enter the room of the mansion where the door to that room is, which is sometimes obvious and other times not. For example, when we return to the Parlor for the first time after releasing the Boos into the mansion, the position for the Anteroom boo is set as soon as we enter Parlor. Likewise, the position for the Wardrobe boo is set as soon as we enter Anteroom. Larger ‘rooms’, such as the Area 2 and 3 hallways, are split into multiple sections that are not fully loaded all at once. So for example, the position for the Laundry Room and Fortune-Teller’s Room boos are loaded as soon as you enter the Area 2 hallway from the Foyer, but the Dining Room and Ballroom boo positions are not determined until you move up into the central connecting hallway, and the Conservatory and Billiards Hall boos are not set until you move further still up into the north-most horizontal stretch of hallway. Once a room is loaded into memory and the boo position is determined, it will never change, even if you leave the area. The only way to reset boo positions is to unload the whole mansion, which could mean hard or soft resetting the game, or being taken to egadd’s hut or laboratory for a cutscene before returning to the mansion, like after you defeat an Area Boss. This means that we often need to be sure very far in advance exactly where we want a boo to be located in a given room, and make sure that we manipulate it to load into that piece of furniture the very first time we load that room, even if we won’t be actually going inside of it until many minutes later in the run.

	"Significant time was saved throughout the run by optimizing ghost suck-ups. For the most part, draining ghosts of their HP optimally is a relatively simple process: hold away from the directions they are flying in for 10 frames with the C or analogue stick, input a neutral value on both sticks for one frame to reset the amount you are able to drain continuously, and repeat. The optimization comes after their health reaches 0, but before they begin the ‘suck-up’ animation into the vacuum: during this time, the game determines how long the suck-up animation will take to complete. It has been commonly understood that there are two types of animations you can get for every suck-up: a ‘wave’, or a ‘twirl’, with twirls being faster than waves in almost every instance. However, the mechanics behind getting faster than normal suck-up animations of either sort are very complex, and not even I understand completely what the game is actually checking for when making these calculations. In practice, there were several factors that seem to come into play:

			[li 
				"RTA runners of this game, aware of the potential time save from faster suck-up animations, have long been in the practice of flicking the control stick back and forth repeatedly at the end of draining a ghost to help improve their chances of getting a fast animation, which seems to actually help in improving consistency. While it isn’t as simple as ‘more/faster flicks = faster animation’, there is a reason why this works. Again, I don’t really have a technical explanation for this but in my experience; it helps to think of the vacuum suction shape (the shape of the visible air-force between the vacuum and the ghost) as a rope. Before the animation starts, if the shape of the rope makes a really wide arc in any direction, you will likely get a slow animation even if you're physically close to the ghost. However, wiggling the stick in certain ways, all relative to the first two factors of speed/direction and distance mentioned above, allows you ‘pull the rope taut’, and doing this can decrease the distance the ghost needs to travel in order to finish the animation, thus speeding it up significantly. It is important to note that once a ghost actually enters the suck-up animation, the length of it has been completely determined and you can no longer influence it, which means that you are free to move how you’d like before the ghost actually ‘pops’ into the vacuum without worrying about slowing it down.

This manipulation is obvious with some ghosts, but it was applied to every ghost in the run, and saves many seconds throughout the run overall. Some ghosts have very low health and do not spawn by furniture that they are able to get stuck on, so their HP is drained before they can be manipulated in the same way as some other ghosts.

We spawn the Cellar boo on our way to Pipe Room, and while progressing through the room we manipulate it to move into Cold Storage to set up for another double.

The boo here is the only ghost of any sort in the game that cannot be one-cycled; it’s speed and health is extremely high, and there is no way to make it switch between different room targets as the hallway is its only option. Usually one would either savewarp here or mirror warp from Safari, but we have to take care of some unfinished 100% business by clipping into Sitting Room for a couple boos and one last portrait ghost. Then its just heading to King Boo’s Altar and gg.

		"Ok here's where you all learn about my fucking white whale for this run. In short, there is a way to use the gravity panels inside of Tea Room to clip up onto the Balcony where Boolosus is, and actually enter the fight without the game checking for the minimum 20 Boos. Being able to do Boolosus even earlier than we already do in this run would save time from not having to backtrack for Tea Room/Nana/Astral Hall boos, as well as give us an opportunity to complete Sitting Room/Guest Room earlier in the run, with a faster skew setup. This would save probably 1 minute at least? Unfortunately, the only known ways of doing this clip require Tea Room to still be dark. This means that we have no way to do this clip after we get Ice Element, which is required to defeat Boolossus. I did extensive testing trying to get this glitch to work in the lit Tea Room, to no avail :( im sure now that this run is done, someone will find it lol.....

While this did help, and ended up saving frames I may not have otherwise found, its use was more limited and situational than I anticipated, mostly due to the script only working on single ghosts. Many of the actual Lua commands used to create script didn't seem to work at all... so it was a bit hacky and difficult to troubleshoot. Oh well
