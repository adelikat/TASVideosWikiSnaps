	""Astro Robo Sasa" is one of exciting retro games. It was originally developed for MSX, as "Sasa". And later it was ported to Famicom. In this game, a robot boy Sasa explores field, warehouses, sea, and universe, with his girlfriend Nana. And finally he will reach a blackhole.

	"This game manages position and velocity in a curious way. It does not adopt pixel-subpixel method. Instead, it calculates based on the value of internal frame counter. So, if you start from different internal frame counts, you get slightly different results from the same input. And lags make things more complex. Consequently, this game is not so friendly to hex-editing.
