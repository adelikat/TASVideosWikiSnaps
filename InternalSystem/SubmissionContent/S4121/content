	"The aim of this run is to show what it would be like to finish the game Ocarina of Time without every fighting the final boss. The reason this goal exists it to show a lot more of the game without the run being overly long. This run contains a decent amount of the glitches that are in this game and also shows off the recently discovered Wrong Warp glitch.

	"Introduction
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I started this run around the middle of August when I was looking for something to do in my free time, this run was originally supposed to be very quickly done and just for practice but it became something more than that. I ended up spending a lot of time redoing rooms and HEXing rooms, for example I did the entire run from just after the Eyeball Frog to the boss key skip in the Fire temple, and I had to completly redo the majority of it to use the timer glitch so I had time to finish the dungeon without being warped back to King Zora.

[p 
	"General Tricks and Glitches
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Sidehopping: This is by far the overall most useful form of "normal" movement that you can do in the game. As a child, it's the fastest form of movement period, and as an adult, it's the fastest movement over shorter distances (backwalking is faster over longer ones).
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Backwalking: This has its uses as a child (like when carrying a bomb), but it usually is slower than sidehopping. As an adult, it's the fastest form of movement, but its slow acceleration makes it slower to sidehopping in a lot of cases. Over long distances, backwalking will almost always be faster as an adult.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Rolling: Generally useless next to sidehopping, but still helpful in some places, for example, if a sidehop chain doesn't quite reach the door you're going to, it might save a few frames to do a roll instead of the last sidehop.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Superslide: This occurs when you roll and grab a grabbable object (like a plant or rock), and a damage source hits your shield at the time you grab onto it at. Bombs are good for this as they can serve as both the damage source and the grabbable object at the same time. It causes you to be propelled backwards at the maximum speed obtainable in the game, and it continues for as long as you hold R to keep your shield out. Releasing R causes your speed to return to normal. In previous OoT TASes (and in current OoT unassisted runs), this was the most useful method of travel, but it has been largely obsoleted by A-slides and Z-slides now.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Infinite Superslide (ISS): Also sometimes incorrectly referred to as "extended superslide", this is a reduced-speed kind of slide in which you can actually change angles. It's done by tilting the analogue stick very slightly to the left or right, then holding Z after Link begins to move. It can be done with any kind of speed, so speed that you get from damage sources can lead to what is called a "damage ISS". This is very slow and useless, though. A more useful application of it is to go from a superside into an ISS, however, this does not maintain the maximum speed that a superslide has, but rather almost halves it when you switch from the superslide to the ISS.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Hyper Infinite Superslide (HISS): This is just an ISS which actually has superslide speed, meaning it's a superslide in which you can change angles. Recently Bloobiebla found that by rolling into an explosive whilst holding the ISS position and then pressing Z + R you can actually get a HISS just like you would in Majora's Mask!
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Superflip: Also called a "megaflip", this is simply a backflip at superslide speed. If you roll into a damage source with your shield out, and backflip right as it hits you, you will be propelled backwards in the air at superslide speed. This allows you to cover large distances and gaps that you normally are unable to cover. A sidehop can also be done in place of a backflip (this is known as a "superhop", or, for some reason, a "megasidehop"), but it has much more limited use as a sidehop does not have as much height as a backflip.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Z-slide: This is the act of maintaining whatever speed Link has with constant Z presses. No matter what speed you have, pressing Z will maintain it for an additional 3 frames (1 visual frame), so holding Z for 3 frames, releasing for 3 frames, holding again for 3, etc. allows you to keep whatever speed you have for as long as you want. The obvious use of this is to effectively "superslide" from damage sources without the need of a grabbable object. This is started the same way a superflip is started, but instead of backflipping, you simply allow Link to be propelled backwards on the ground for 3 frames, and then begin the Z presses.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Max speed Z-slides aren't the only useful Z-slides, however. When backwalking up or down hills, your speed will often drop below its max backwalking speed, so if you begin Z-sliding while backwalking, you will maintain that speed even when going up or down hills. This saves time in various places and is seen several times in the run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"It is possible to change your angle while Z-sliding, up to 27 degrees either way, but doing this causes your speed value to drop by 2 points for every turn, so it is only ever done when necessary.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"A-slide: Originally called an "analogue slide" but later shortened to A-slide for convenience, this works very similarly to a Z-slide, but instead of pressing Z on and off every 3 frames, you are alternating between holding one extreme of the analogue stick and holding it at neutral, every 3 frames (while holding Z the entire time). An advantage of this is that there is no sound of constant Z presses, but at the same time, it does cause Link to appear to flicker in place because of the constant analogue movements (this is significantly more distracting as a child, and when you're an adult, it's not annoying at all). The biggest advantage an A-slide has over a Z-slide is that you can actually change angles from an A-slide into a Z-slide without losing any speed, and the angle which you can change has a much bigger range than the Z-slide does (45 degrees either way as opposed to 27 with Z-slides). This means that a fairly large angle change can be made in most slides without losing any speed. After the first angle change, you will be Z-sliding, so each subsequent angle change will cost a drop of 2 speed points. 
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Infinite Sword Glitch (ISG): This occurs when a crouchstab is interrupted by something (excluding a damage source). This can be reading Navi text, reading a sign, or grabbing an object. It causes your sword to be in a perpetual state of attacking, so anything you touch while it's active will be hurt by your sword. It is what allows hovering to be done.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Hovering: This is the act of gaining height or distance in the air using damage sources (usually bombs or bombchus). With ISG active, shielding any damage source will cause Link to become fixed in place, and if he's in the air while this occurs, he will stick in the air until you jump down. With each damage source, the entire height or distance of a backflip or sidehop can be achieved in the air. This allows us to reach various places sooner than we normally would be able to. The most notable example of this is obtaining the Mirror Shield in the desert without ever actually entering the Spirit Temple.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Power Crouch Stabbing: In Ocarina of Time, the crouchstab move (B while holding R to crouch) retains the same source of damage as the last attack you did. This means that if the last attack you did was a jumpslash, then all of your crouchstabs will have the same power as a jumpslash. This is incredibly useful when fighting almost any enemy in the game, particularly bosses.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Cutscene Diving: Whenever a cutscene is playing, Link will fall until he hits solid ground. This means that if Link were to be over a body of water as a cutscene started, he would fall right through the water and hit the ground below it, allowing some things to be skipped.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Owl Skipping: The owl's text can be skipped by alternating between two items (the button presses are frame perfect) while in the zone in which his text would activate. It prevents it from doing so. Note: This can also be used to skip various other texts in the game, like Navi's text about the twisty corridor in the Forest Temple.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Timer Glitch: By using something like a bottle or a trading item you can temporarily pause the timer whilst you are in the air, this causes every input to be locked meaning moving the analogue stick or pressing button does absolutely nothing, this trick is the reason this run is possible.

	"Obtaining Kokiri Sword
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Leaving Link's House and getting to the crawling hole has been TASed so many times now, that it is no surprise no frames could be saved here. Maybe 3 frames could be saved before doing the Gainer up to the hill, but I wasn't able to do this even after a few hours of attempting. I saved 3 frames on the final sidehops to the Kokiri Sword chest by managing to gain enough distance to make it to the chest with 3 less sideways walking frames.
	$LF

[p 
	"Travelling to Lost Woods
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"On the way to the crawling hole no frames were saved, neither do I think this can be done any quicker. In the list you see me losing 21 frames at collecting the rupees from the bushes. I collected 4 additional rupees, which are later on used to skip the blue rupees in the shop. This route change saved almost 2 seconds. 21 frames is also not much time lost considering I had to manipulate 3 bushes at the same time and one slash already costs more than 21 frames. This means, if I had to slash only one bush, I would have saved a few frames as well. By using more precise angles for the sidehops after climbing the vines, I was able to save 6 more frames.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Lost Woods
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I do the first angle change after one less sidehop and thus ended up saving 6 frames. This needed almost perfect angles to not get stuck at any walls for a short amount of time, which would have made me lose all the saved time again.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Zora's River
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"This section is the most important reason why I did this run. I started an attempt for a new any% run back when we were still getting Adult Link earlier in 2012 and had TASed this already, when Swordless submitted his run. After watching Swordless' TAS of this section, I knew that there could be a quite a bit time saved and it also made me assume, that this does probably apply to few more sections. Zora's River - especially everything until entering the water - was a nightmare to TAS. The goal is to make your last sidehop before an angle change always end directly in the end of a corner without any additional walking, because this always costs time. Thanks to all the slopes this became extremely hard to pull off. After around 12-15k rerecords I succeeded and saved half a second. As I did this section already long before doing this full game run, those 12-15k rerecords are not part of this run, because I simply copied the input.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"I use a nice timesaver I discovered here as well: If you enter a river (water needs to be flowing), instantly leave again and then keep sliding very close to it, the flowing speed of the water gets added to Link's Speed. Of course, this also works by doing a super swim into the right direction of the river. I managed to reach speeds, that were even higher than Superslide Speed, which we actually assumed to be the light speed of the N64 Zelda Universe.
	$LF
	"In the end I drop 6 frames before entering the loading zone to set a smart trick up.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Hyrule Field
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"When you enter most loading zones, Link takes his speed with him into the next area. During the time you don't have control over Link, he walks with this old speed (everything higher than max. walking speed is lowered automatically to max. walking speed by the game). By entering the loading zone with a very low speed, Link thus barely walks forward during the transition. By abusing this I'm able to end up way closer to the spot I can set the Water ESS up when I get control over Link again. I also saved a bit of time by abusing the same "River Trick" again.

	"Kakariko / Cucco Collection
	$LF
]p
[p 
	$UNPRINTABLE TEXT!!!
]p
[p 
	"Other notable improvements here are: Using a jump to reach Cucco 4 instead of a sidehop+jumpslash combination. The jump itself saves no time at all, but as I have no sword equipped while picking up the cucco this saves quite a bit of time. I also manipulated Cucco 2 to be more far away from the house and closer to the cage, so I can reach it within 1 sidehop instead of 2 after slashing cucco 3.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The 2nd part is where I actually saved way more time. Cucco 5 was equally well manipulated in both mine and Swordless' TAS. I used a new strategy for the following cuccos, though: Cucco 5+6 are both thrown into pretty much the same position. As I jump down to Cucco 6 after throwing Cucco 5, he simply runs a bit against the wall over into the direction of the cage. Cucco 6 caused a lot of trouble, though. As I climb up to Cucco 7 after throwing him, he usually runs into the wall of the Bottom of the Well and stays there. I wanted him to get past the Well, though, because this saves a lot of time. In order to do this I had to be as close to the fence as possible when throwing him. Throwing himself needed a precise angle, but this was still not enough to get it to work. I also had to wait for 6 frames after climbing the ladder before I was able to start moving again. Fortunately, this meant also having enough time to get a cool camera view. While I was doing all this, I also had to manipulate Cucco 7. I ended up having to try different things while backwalking with Cucco 5 to manipulate him correctly, because I was limited with my movement options later on due to the problems Cucco 6 caused. I needed like 2 weeks to get this part done, but the time I saved was big enough to be worth it.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"The main goal was once again to get them to be in the same place at the same time, so I can slash them to get control over them. After that I slowly walk behind them to make them end up in front of the cage. If I walked faster, I would have went past them too early and thus they would have run away from the cage again. I also had a better position when getting the bottle, so I saved another 10 frames on the way to the rock, that gives me bugs. After collecting the bugs I head towards the Bottom of the Well and use a navi dive to skip lowering the water and obtain bombchu's extremely early on in the run.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Bottom of the Well
	$LF
	"The reason we come to the Bottom of the Well this early is to collect Bombchu's, these allow us to collect the bombs very fast later on in the run, and also allow me to do a few HISS' on the way.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"Usually when you enter the Bottom of the Well you need to use Zelda's Lullaby to lower the water to reach the Lens of Truth room, however you can do a glitch called the 'Actor Glitch'. This allows you to unload all of the actors in the main room by entering a room before the camera has a chance to move about. This causes the next room to be loaded whilst keeping Link in the room he is currently in.
	$LF
]p
[p 
	"After I unload the main room I head towards the room containing the Dead Hand. I have to enter this room to re-load the main again or I am unable to use the Skulltula to clip as it is currently not loaded, I also collect the 100 rupee chest so I can buy the Hylian Sheild later on. As I get better manipulation in the room than Swordless I am able to reach the 100 rupee chest in less time which also allows me to start sidehopping faster towards the door. This means that I only need 1 side hop to reach the door after the cut scene finishes over the 4 that it took Swordless to do.
	$LF
	"After I exit the room by clipping through the wall, you can clip through vines as Child Link by getting hit by a damage source at the same time you grab onto the vines, in this case I use the Skulltula as the damage source and I then swim towards the Bombchu chest and then save and reset the game.

	"It was recently discovered that you can actually kill Volvagia using bombs, to do this you need to place the bombs onto a certain place in the room, and then only hit Volvagia once with the hammer to avoid him from flying. I also have to wait until Volvagia goes back undergound to throw the 3rd bomb or he will fly when he comes up for the second time, this means that I pause the timer using sidehops and backflips until then.

	"After killing Volvagia I then drop and catch bugs on the very end of the warp, this allows the timer to continue whilst the warp is picking link up, the Eyeball Frog timer then runs out at the perfect time which means that I get warped to both the Fire Medallion Cutscene and also I get warped back to King Zora resulting in me being Warped to the End Credits of the game!
