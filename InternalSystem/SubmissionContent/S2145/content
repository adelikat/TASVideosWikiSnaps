	"It took me quite a while making this TAS. This is my second submission of Sky Blazer. I cancelled the first one because I found glitches I had missed before. Certainly wasn't easy as this was my first real attempt at a TAS, and there doesn't exist a movie of the game anywhere. Anyway, I'm glad the way this movie turned out to look like.

[p 
	"Just an ordinary platformer with a Megaman-plot. First you fight a bunch of bosses to steal their weapons, then you fight them again and then, finally, the bad guy himself. You can somewhat choose the order of stages, but there's no need to change the one that is fastest to travel on map.

	$LF
]h3
[p 
	"The gameplay in general may look confusing for the viewer, since the fastest way to move is "zipjumping". By chrouching, punching and jumping, the jump starts a few pixels inside floor. Then pressing left for one frame, it zips me a few pixels to the right. This cannot be done always, hence I don't always do as low jump as possible. In later stages I start zipping longer distances too. But longer zipping in this game is possible only to left and up. Can't zip right or down. If it could be done to any direction, this run would get 
	[em 
		"a lot
	]em
	" faster, since it's possible to zip through floor, wall or even ceiling.

	"This is the black sheep of the run in my opinion. It may not look bad with all the iceblock-riding and moving wall -ownage, but I was very unfortunate with luck manipulation. What enemies drop depends on the frame it's killed, so sometimes it might take like two seconds to get what I want. Panthers and the water thingies didn't co-operate in they I wanted them to.

The boss normally disappears before it can be hit, but it's possible to jump in the air the very first frame of gaining control. Thus, ownage is to take place.

If I don't kill the enemies fast enough, I can't get whatever they drop since the screen scrolls up. Also I can't enter the wall to reach the door faster, because the floor isn't willing to co-operate with me. The boss is wtfpwned as usually.

However, any attempt at improving this run needs to use the (U[!] version, or risks outright rejection. With that said, accepting this for publication.
