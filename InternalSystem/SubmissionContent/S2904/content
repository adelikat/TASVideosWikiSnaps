	"Judging can be a dangerous thing. As a judge, Its important to not just claim a movie looks sloppy, or has a low re-record count, even if it may seem obvious. So, judges often have to test TASing the game. However, this leads to a problem - What if the game makes for a fun TAS to do? You have a new project on your plate.

	"Mendel Palace is an Action-Puzzle game. When playing in real-time, it becomes more action than puzzle, and when TASing, it becomes more puzzle than action. The plot of the game revolves around 'Bon-Bon' trying to save his girlfriend 'Candy' from a dreamworld where her own dolls have taken her captive. There are 8 sub-worlds, each consisting of a different type of doll, and then 20 end levels in Mendel Palace. The key is to flip tiles that push the enemies (dolls) into walls or blocks, or reveal special tiles. From

Sadly, while these levels were supposed to be far more difficult, they turned out simplistic, with the exception of round 8. Round 8 was killer to optimize, as only 3 tiles can be flipped! Also, I believe the bosses are supposed to be evil 'Bon-Bon' and evil 'Candy'

A good deal of the audience seems to agree. Accepting for publication.
