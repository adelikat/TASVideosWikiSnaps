	"Die Hard is an action packed Christmas movie that follows John McClane as he attemts to save the hostages (including Holly) from the terrorists. Though the controls make the game a bit difficult, it may be one of the more movie accurate games out there. For example your feet have an independent health meter and if you ruin them by walking on broken glass you will move slower (including up and down stairs).

	$LF
]h2
[p 
	"There are multiple different endings as described in the manual, including a worst ending where you shoot out a window and just jump out of the tower. This movie triggers one of the good endings by blowing up the helipad. Another ending can be achieved by killing all of the terrorists, also the ending is modified if you've chosen to call the cops.

	"The old RTA route took the stairs with low foot health to burn down the in game time and allow access to the final floor, then glitched into the boss room by walking through the wall at the elevator door.
	$LF

[p 
	"This run effectively takes the RTA route and just cleans up the execution. The run first goes up to grab a key needed to access the roof. Then it goes back down (burning some extra in game time on the stairs) to pick up C4 and a Detenator. Last off to the roof to blast it.

		"I tried playing around with enemy spawns a bit, but it may be that there is a faster way to get the C4 and the detenator without taking so many stairs.

	": Accepting for Vault. Intense stairs walking is probably healthy, but it kills all the entertainment of the run, which is short enough thanks to the glitch, but most of its time is occupied with those stairs.

	""All enemies/zipless" sounds like an acceptable 100% goal if it ever gets done, but it should be discussed separately, as this game has quite some stuff to offer regarding endings/routes.
