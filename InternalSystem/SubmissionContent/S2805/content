	"As for optimization, for a submission that's over a decade old at this point the optimization looks solid. A good number of delay scroll glitches found and a lot of routing considerations done with weapon usage makes this pretty smooth. I do have some minor concerns with some of the movement, mainly the brief points where there was air time that could've been used for walking on floor and some iffy points where damage could've been outright avoided with minimal slowdown. Those would most likely be frames at best and there aren't any immediate places where another delay scroll could be easily set up to save even more time.

	"There was one bit of tech that I knew about years ago with the Zero fight at the end where it's possible to get a single cloud bomb shot to hit multiple times by having it explode where Zero lands from a jump but that ended up being slower due to it not hitting as rapidly as I remembered. That was the only boss I had immediate concerns about but if there's a better strategy I can't seem to figure it out.

[div class=p 
	"After all these years, I'm accepting this to Standard. This is going under the "Normal" branch. The Hard mode patch adjusts some level geometry to be harder, removes Mega Man's i-frames, makes regular enemies and projectiles disappear on contact with Mega Man, and makes bosses practically instant death on contact since they don't disappear upon touching Mega Man. The Static patch is essentially Normal mode but with the vanilla Mega Man 2 weapons and the level design changed around that. These changes make the branch I added make some sense.
