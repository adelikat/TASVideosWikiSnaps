	"Knightmare II: The Maze of Galious is a screen-by-screen adventure platformer game by Konami, released in 1987 for the MSX1. You take control of two Knights, Popolon and Aphrodite out
	$LF
	"to rescue their baby Pamperse from the evil high priest Galious. They have their own subtle differences in gameplay, but for the most part, they just act as two separate health bars.
	$LF
	"The game world is split up in an overworld-like castle and ten different submaps, called Worlds. Each world has to be completed to obtain the key to the next one. In addition to that,
	$LF
	"there's a plethora of other items you can find in the game. This movie aims to complete the game as fast as possible, only obtaining items that are necessary or beneficial to speed.

	"For the most part, Popolon is used in gameplay due to his finer jumping, though Aphrodite sees use in a few boss battles. Since only the health of the hero is refilled who actually

	"Your base movement speed is 1 px/frame. Early on, jumping is faster, because, while you do lose some frames at the start of a jump, your falling x speed is 1.5 px/frame, 
	$LF
	"clearly faster. If you walk off a ledge, you're locked in place. You also start out with 0 y speed, which usually makes it faster to jump down ledges. Ladder climbing speed is an
	$LF
	"agonizingly slow 0.5 px/frame. Because of this, we choose to get the boots in this run, which boost our movement speed to 1.25 px/frame and our ladder climbing speed to 0.625. This
	$LF
	"makes jumping, especially under low ceilings, far less viable.
	$LF
	"You can use your sword every 10 frames and fire arrows every 6 frames. Due to the MSX1's hardware limitations (arrows actually are tiles), when you're close enough to an enemy, you
	$LF
	"can't even see the arrow before it hits its target. You can jump and change direction while using the sword, leading to amusing little sword dances.

	"When being hit, your life continuously drains until it hits a certain amount. You can stop the damage drain by pausing and hitting F1, losing only 2 - 3 health if done quickly. This
	$LF
	"is the most important glitch in this game which completely allows us to skip an out of the way subweapon (You'd need mines for the World 4 boss) and just fight it with our sword 
	$LF
	"instead. For all other bosses, it cuts down time otherwise spent on dodging. Note that bosses typically drain between half and all your life with a single attack, so F1 glitching can
	$LF

[p 
	"Typically, you can't dismount a ladder unless you're hit. However, on some ladders, you can walk off a few pixels over the ground, dropping down. At times, this only works when
	$LF
	"facing a certain direction and at some ladders, it just doesn't work at all. You can even walk down a ladder that takes you into the screen below saving a bit of time. The mechanics
	$LF
	"are very screwy, which is why you can see Popolon going into the screen below, climbing up again before dropping down. It just won't work otherwise. The same way, you can also do 
	$LF
	"small ladder-zips, boosting you 8 - 9 px into the direction you're going.
	$LF
	"The far more interesting property of those drop-downs however is the way you take damage afterwards. Since the game still thinks you're on a ladder, when you get hit after doing such
	$LF
	"a drop or zip, you just drop straight to the ground instead of being blown away. This can be useful if exploited right. After you take damage, the game behaves normally again.

[p 
	"While there is no crazy wall-zipping in the game, a tiny trick did sneak its way in. By jumping the right height (only doable with Popolon obviously), you can get yourself embedded
	$LF
	"in the ground for just a few frames. If you take damage while in the ground, you again don't get blown away but just stay in place. This allows you to activate the pause menu faster
	$LF
	"and take less damage than usual. This can be important if doing the F1 glitch for prolonged amounts of time and running low on health.
	$LF
	"Otherwise, your speed while being blown away is 2 px/frame.

	"Nearly everything in this game can be manipulated by giving it input. Enemies behave differently, which is important when you have to kill every enemy in the room as quickly as
	$LF
	"possible. As you imagine, bats are the worst offenders in that regard, but sure not the only ones. The same holds true for bosses, but not to that extent. Item drops can be 
	$LF
	"manipulated just the same and are only determined at the last possible frame. Ideally, an enemy is killed from afar with arrows, so no time is wasted killing the enemy or waiting
	$LF
	"for the item to spawn. That is not always applicable. Keys have the lowest drop rate, while useless coins have the highest. Trying to synchronize multiple enemies and drops while
