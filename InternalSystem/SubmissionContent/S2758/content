	"We started this run when I noticed you could get the shoes twice and then get the sword and quit and continue and end up at the main door, which only saved 20 or so frames but it was something. Then Sonikkustar noticed you can skip the piranha room and warp out of the room after it, which saved around 10 seconds. The rest of the savings is from optimization of the speed.
