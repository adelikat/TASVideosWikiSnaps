	"This movie quickly completes Pokemon Green - the original japanese version before being updated and transformed into Pokemon Blue, before being ported to the US and other regions. To accomplish this short time, serious errors which are fixed in later versions are used. This is ~31 seconds faster than AKA's previous submission.

	"Some time ago, a video was posted on 
	[a class=extlink href=http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=SKmcDPtjx1I rel=nofollow 
		"youtube
	]a
	" showing a glitch used to warp between arbitrary points of the game. Since then, the technique has been refined many times, resulting in a much shorter (and more confusing) route. This movie uses the most recently discovered route, which is slightly faster than FractalFusion's last attempt by a small number of frames.

	"The warping is at first enabled by attempting to switch Oak's Parcel with a Pokemon in your line-up; this is the part that is fixed in later versions. This step junks the display screen but enables you to finish the battle (a later discovery showed that running away is also possible). As a side-effect, it also changes the pokemon into a Level 1 Charizard. :)

[div class=p 
	"After this, the world map data is slightly messed up - Professor Oak appears in his starting location for the 'walking into grass' event, but the event does not trigger. Random tiles change type, lose or gain walkable-status, etc. A strange coincedence of this effect allows the 'destination' value for doors in the area to be overwritten by the step-counter, allowing

[div class=p 
	"This movie first warps to the 'secret house', enters a door that usually does not exist, walks through the guard station, and then proceeds to the department store in Celadon, finally warping to the very end room where Pokemon data is added to the Hall of Fame. Note that this room is very, very messed up (I call it Ninetown) - thankfully the cutscene still plays properly.

	"Barring any changes to the warping route, the main area to be improved is the first pokemon battle - ideally my Bulbasaur should miss both of its attacks, saving around 200 frames. However, I have not yet had this occur. :) If I can achieve this, I will resubmit.
