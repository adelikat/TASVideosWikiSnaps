	"Arkanoid - Doh It Again is the sequel to the arcade classic Arkanoid. The player controls the spaceship "Vaus", having to make silver balls bounce off itself and clear an area of bricks. The game consists of 99 levels, level 99 of which faces you up against the boss Doh, but Yep2yel just uses a password and challenges Doh right off the bat.
