	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Instant Double Jump
	]b
	"-- This is a very useful trick. Many ledges can be reached only by a double jump whereby Gex must jump once and hold A in mid-air. This causes him to bend his tail to bounce higher upon landing. 
	$LF
	"This initial jump can take up a feew seconds and over the course of the run this would all add up.
	$LF
	"What I discovered was that if Gex karate kicks into a wall the collision will break this motion (usually at a lower height than a jump) and Gex drops to the ground. This tricks the game into thinking that Gex has already jumped allowing me to activate a double jump instantly. A huge timesaver. 
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	"EXAMPLE -- To see this start paying attention around frame 2200 and also 2800.
	$LF
]div
[div class=p 
	[b 
		"Floating Enemies Glitch
	]b
	" -- If you hit the ninjas in the Chinese levels whilst they spawn they became active in mid-air. This resets the ground flag if Gex jumps on them whilst floating (although he still goes straight through) the resulting jump is much higher. 
	$LF
	"I demonstrate this in the run, however, in a level i chose to avoid i used this to my advantage.

	]b
	" -- After each level a Save Game, Continue, Password menu comes up. However there is a single frame of input during which start can be pressed to avoid this appearing, the sound can still be heard though. This does not work after a cut-scene (eg. Gate opening, television switching on).

	"At the start of the movie I skip the menus and intros very quickly to jump directly into the game. The first thing I do is go into the options menu and turn off Gex's voices. Normally Gex makes a wisecrack upon entering a TV, a level and then exiting the level, plus many during but those don't waste time. Each time wasting phrase could waste anything up to 4 seconds and so turning them of is well justified i'm sorry to say.
