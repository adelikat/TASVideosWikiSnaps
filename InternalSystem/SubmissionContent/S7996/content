	"The default setting is 5 points per match, so we leave it there. We use the hardest difficulty and don't need to change the scoring to rally point (which is where you can score a point without being on the serve whereas in normal modes you have to be serving to get points.) so this goes by pretty quickly.

	"Luckily, there is a serve that is a guaranteed Ace. By jumping at the right time and serving on the final possible frame before it hits the ground, the AI will never return it and we blow through the 3 matches in a little more than 2 minutes.
